1
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:58,672
这个故事描述的是 ...  我是怎么死的.
<i>This is the story of how I died.</i>

2
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:03,248
别紧张, 实际上这是一个 非常有趣的故事
严格说来, 我根本不是故事的主角.
<i>Don't worry, this is actually a very fun story.
And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

3
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,856
这是一个女孩的故事, 她名叫 "长发姑娘" ( Rapunzel )
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

4
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:10,367
故事要从 "太阳" 开始讲起
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

5
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:16,918
很久很久以前,
有一天, 从天空落下一缕阳光
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

6
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:22,699
从这一抹阳光里, 开出一朵 神奇金色的花朵
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

7
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:27,117
它有能力医治 生病及受伤的人们
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

8
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,944
哦, 看到个老妇人了嘛？
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

9
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,883
麻烦请记住这个人
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

10
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,704
故事中, 她还满重要的...
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

11
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:39,433
然后, 几百年过去了, 不远处, 诞生了一个王国
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.</i>

12
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,860
王国 由人民爱戴的国王和王后 统治着
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

13
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,052
有天, 王后怀孕了, 但
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

14
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,343
她却生了病
<i>and she got sick,</i>

15
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,488
病的很严重
<i>really, sick.</i>

16
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:52,637
她的时间不多了
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

17
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,093
而就在那个时候, 大家就开始去寻找 "奇?"
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:59,226
也就是去寻找那朵... 神奇的金色花.
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

19
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,580
唉唉, 我告诉过你们, 她很重要的,
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

20
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,044
她并没和别人 共享着太阳的礼物,
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

21
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:07,781
这个女人, 女巫 "葛朵", 独占着金花
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

22
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:11,066
并用金花的魔力保持年轻, 达数百年之久 ..
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

23
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:15,444
她只要, 唱一首特殊的歌曲
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,177
*花儿闪亮发光, 让你的力量闪耀*
<i>*Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*</i>

25
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:31,884
*使时光倒转, 带回曾经的我*
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*</i>

26
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,610
*曾经是我的*
<i>*What once was mine*</i>

27
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,298
懂了吧, 她一唱歌就变年轻了, 有点怪, 对不对？
<i>All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

28
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:51,569

We've found it!

29
00:02:56,554 --> 00:03:02,002

32
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,253
给你一个提示
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

33
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,463
她就是长发姑娘
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

34
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:25,952
为了庆祝她的诞生, 国王和王后放出了天灯
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

35
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:34,555
从那一刻起, 一切都非常的完美
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

36
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,458
但幸福时刻, 却要结束了
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

37
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:50,365
*花儿, 闪亮和发光, 让你的力量闪耀*

00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:08,479
全国人民到处寻找, 但他们无法找到公主.
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

41
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:12,995
但是, 在森林深处, 在一个隐藏的塔中
<i>For deep within the forest</i> <i>In a hidden tower.</i>

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,267
女巫 "葛朵" 独自抚养那孩子

as her own.</i>

<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

46
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,509
为什么我不能到外面去？
Why can't I go outside?

47
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,817
外面的世界是一个危险的地方
The outside world is a dangerous place.

48
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,171
充满了可怕的, 自私的人
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

49
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:44,566
你必须呆在这里, 这里是安全的, 你明白吗, 花儿？-- 是的, 妈妈
- You must stay here, where you're safe.Do you understand, flower?- Yes, Mommy.

50
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:51,309
但, 塔的墙壁, 是不能遮盖住一切的

所以, 母亲,
- Rapunzel!
- So, mother,

119
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:30,371
刚才我问, 明天是否是一个重要的日子, 你还没回答,
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

120
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,666
所以我要告诉你, 明天是我的生日！
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

121
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,275
答达！
TADA!

122
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,964
不, 不, 不, 不可能
No, no, no can't be.

123
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,645
我清楚地记得, 你的生日是去年
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

124
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:43,049
生日是有趣的事, 它是一年一度的
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

125
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,298
母亲, 我要十八岁了
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

126
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:51,968
而我想, 这个生日我真的想要的 .....
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

127
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:55,136
其实我每一个生日都（喃喃自语）..
Actually what I want for

128
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:56,973
长发姑娘, 请停止喃喃自语
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

129
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,625
你知道我讨厌喃喃自语
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

130
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,210
布啦, 布啦, 布啦, 布啦...这是非常恼人的
Blah, blah, blah,... blah.
It's very annoying.

131
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,577
我只是开玩笑, 你很可爱, 亲爱的
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

132
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,628
哦, 我想去看天灯
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

133
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,930
什么？噢,
- What? -Oh,...

134
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:19,740
嗯, 我希望你能带我去看那些天灯
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.

135
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,900
-欧.. 你是说那些星星吗 ?
-妈妈, 是这样的 !!
Oh, you mean the stars. That's the thing

136
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:29,127
我有星座图 星星总是不变的
I've charted stars and they're
always constant.

137
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:33,044
但这些, 他们每年都会出现在我的生日, 妈妈
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

138
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,109
只有在我的生日那天
Only on my birthday.

139
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,933
而我不禁觉得,
And I can't help but feel that they're,

140
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:40,040
他们是为我而来
They're meant for me.

141
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:44,825
我需要去看他们, 母亲, 而不只是从窗边看
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

142
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,371
亲自去
In person.

143
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,280
我必须知道它们是什么
I have to know what they are.

144
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,564
你要到外面去？
You want to go outside?

145
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,130
哦, 为什么, 长发姑娘

哦, 我敢打赌, 我的是更大的惊喜
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

223
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,449
我不这样认为
I seriously doubt it.

Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

228
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,261
尤其是我没有做错的时候
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

231
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:50,246
天灯, 这就是我要说的问题
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.

232
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:52,590
我以为我们放弃了那个话题了, 亲爱的
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

233
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,601
不, 母亲, 我只是说,
No Mother, I'm just saying,

你觉得, 我没有足够的力量在外照顾自己
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

亲爱的, 我知道你没有足够的力量在外面照顾自己
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

236
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:04,030
-但是你只要...,
-长发姑娘, 我们别再谈论这个问题
- But if you just...

你不会离开这座塔, 永远不会！
You are not leaving this tower,EVER!

241
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,181
哦, 太棒了 !!
现在 我变成了个坏蛋
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

242
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,071
我只想说, 妈妈, 那个...
All I was gonna say, mother ,is that...

243

And what is that?

245
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,447
新的油漆, 你曾经给我过的
白色贝壳制成的油漆
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.

246
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,339
啊 那要走很远耶, 长发姑娘
Well that is a very long trip,Rapunzel.

247
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,462
几乎要三天的时间
Almost three day's time.

248
00:23:55,707 --> 00:24:00,568
我只是觉得这是一个比星星, 更好的主意
I just thought it was a
better idea than, uh, stars.

249
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,557
你确定你会没事, 剩你一个人？
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?

250
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,952
我知道我很安全, 只要待在这里
I know I'm safe, as long as I'm here.

251
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,505
我会在3天后回来
I'll be back in three days time.

252
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:25,178
我爱你, 亲爱的
I love you very much, dear.

253
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,175
我爱你更多
I love you more.

254
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,487
我最爱你
I love you most.

255
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,172
好了
Okay.

256
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:41,041
什么？ 这是...头发？
Is this... hair?

257
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,727
挣扎 ...挣扎是没有意义的
Struggling... struggling is pointless.

258
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:49,946
我知道你为什么来这里
I know why you're here.

259
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,705
而且我不怕你
And I'm not afraid of you.

260
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,372
什么？
What?

261
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,308
你是谁, 你是怎么找到我的？
Who are you, and how
did you find me?


263
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:13,939
你是谁, 你是怎么找到我的？
I know not who you are.

264
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,708
我不知道你是谁, 我也不是来找你
Nor how I came to find you.

265
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:23,003
不过, 我只想说
But may I just say.

266
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,498
嗨
Hi!

267
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,580
你好吗？
How you doing?

268
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,114
我的名字是 "弗林莱德"
The name's Flynn Ryder.

269
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:35,044
过得怎样呀, 啊？
How's your day going, huh?

270
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:39,778
还有谁知道我住的地方, 弗林莱德？
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

271
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:41,587
-好吧, 金发女郎-我是长发姑娘
- All right, Blondie.- Rapunzel.

272
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,767
幸会!! , 事实是...
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

273
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,594
我因为某种情况, 闲逛穿过森林
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

274
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,717
恰巧发现你的塔, 和...
I came across your tower and...

275
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:52,085
哈, 哦, 不, 我的背包在哪里？
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

276
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:55,679
我藏在了某个地方, 你永远也找不到它
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

277
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:00,351
它在那锅里, 是不是
It's in that pot, isn't it.


279
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
啊, 别舔我耳朵啦 !
Ahh, will you stop that.

280
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,845
现在, 它藏好了, 你永远也找不到它
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

281
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:15,502
所以, 你到底想拿我的头发去干嘛？
So, what do you want,with my hair?

282
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:17,388
-要剪它？-什么？
- To cut it?- What?

283
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,370
-卖掉它？-不,
- Sell it?- No!

284
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,502
听着, 我唯一想对你的头发做的事,
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

285
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:24,325
就是要摆脱它, 完完全全的摆脱它
is to get out of it.Literally.

286
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:27,850
等等, 你不想要我的头发？
Wait, you don't want my hair?

287
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,869
我为什么 会想要你的头发？
Why on earth would I want your hair?

288
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,393
听着, 我被追赶, 我看到了一座塔,
我爬上来, 就是这样 .....
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

289
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,454
你是, 说真话？
You're, telling the truth?

290
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:36,936
是的!
Yes.

291
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:51,944
我知道, 但是他可以带我去 .....
I know, maybe he's the one
to take me.

292
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:54,776
我认为他说的是实话
I think he's telling the truth, too.

293
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:58,486
他应该没恶意的, 而且, 我还有什么选择？
Nothing I think,
but what choice do I have?

294
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,554
嗯, 好吧
弗林莱德, 我们来谈个交易
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

295
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,382
交易？ 看这边
- Deal?- Look this way.

296
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,550
你知道这是什么？
Do you know what these are?

297
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,416
你是指他们为公主做的灯笼？
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

298
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,336
灯笼 ...
Lanterns...

299
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:18,598
我就知道他们不是星星
I knew they weren't stars.

300
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:22,569
那么, 明天晚上他们将照亮夜空,
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

301
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:26,886
用这些灯笼, 您将作为我的导游,
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

302
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:30,661
带我去看这些灯笼, 再带我平安回家
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

303
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:34,269
那时, 也只有到那时, 我会把你的背包还你
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

304
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,515
这是我的条件
That is my deal.

305
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:39,256
是啊, 不可能
Yeah, no can do.

306
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:43,269
不幸的是, 在此刻, 王国和我相处的, 不太好,
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
aren't exactly, simpatico,

307
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:45,925
所以, 我不会带你到任何地方
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

308
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,656
什么风把你吹来的, 弗林莱德
Something brought you here,Flynn Ryder.

309
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:59,904
-可能是你的意志, 命运, 天意 ....
-是一匹马带我来的啦
- Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
- A horse.

310
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,372
所以, 我已经决定信任你
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

311
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,722
一个可怕的决定, 真的
A horrible decision, really.

312
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:07,234
但是请相信我, 当我告诉你这一点
But trust me, when I tell you this.

313
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:13,036
你可以拆开此塔, 一砖一瓦的
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

314
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:17,424
但没有我的帮助, 你永远都不会找到你的宝贵背包
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

315
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:20,384
让我们把话说清楚
Let me just get this straight.

316
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:21,837
我带你去看天灯
I take you to see the lanterns.

317
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:23,162
然后再带你回来
Bring you back home,

318
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,359
你就把背包还给我？
and you'll give me back my satchel?

319
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:26,852
我保证
I promise.

320
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:33,622
而且我答应过的事, 我向来都会做到
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

321
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:36,530
永远都会！
EVER!

322
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,623
好吧, 听着, 我本来不希望这么做,
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

323
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:44,707
但你让我 别无选择
but you leave me no choice.

324
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:48,723
看我  帅哥的 '电眼媚功'
Here comes the 'smolder'.

325
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,001
看来我这功夫 不管用了
This is kind of an off day for me.

326
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,732
这通常不会发生
This doesn't normally happen.

327
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,415
好吧, 我带你去看天灯
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

328
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,693
真的吗？
Really!

329
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:05,721
哎呀, 我的 '电眼媚功' 被你毁了 !!!
- Ooops.- You broke my 'smolder'.

330
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,480
快下来, 金发女郎？
You coming, Blondie?

331
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:27,114
*看世界如此接近, 离我只剩半步了*
<i>*Look at the world so close, and I'm
half way to it*</i>

332
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:32,289
*看看这辽阔一切, 我真的敢吗？*
<i>*Look at it all, so big
do I even dare?*</i>

333
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:37,712
*看看我, 终于, 我做到了*
<i>*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*</i>

334
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,437
我应做吗？不
Should I? No.

335
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:42,296
我来了
Here I go.

336
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:19,324
*我闻到草和泥土的芳香就像我梦中的*
*Triumphant music*

337
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,781
*感受那夏日的微风*
<i>*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*</i>

338
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:26,022
*她正呼唤着我*
<i>*Just feel that summer breeze.*</i>

339
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:33,075
*就像是第一次, 我是完完全全自由的*
<i>*The way it's calling me.*</i>

340
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,468
*我可以跑步, 赛跑, 跳舞...*
<i>*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*</i>

341
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:42,411
*和追逐, 蹦着, 跳着*
<i>*I could go running, and racing,
and dancing...</i>

342
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:46,065
*头发飞扬, 心砰砰的跳,*
<i>*and chasing, and leaping
and bounding.*</i>

343
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:49,171
*我终于明白,*
<i>*hair flying, heart pounding
and splashing and reeling.*</i>

344
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:59,622
*现在我的人生开展了*
<i>*And finally feeling,*</i>

345
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:05,512
我简直不敢相信我这样做
<i>*Now's when my life
begins.*</i>

346
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:10,603
（喃喃自语中）我真不敢相信 我这样做,
我不相信我会这么做！
I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I did this.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

347
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,936
妈妈会非常气愤
Mother would be so furious.

348
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:17,977
这没关系, 不知道的事, 不会杀了她, 对不对？
That's okay, what she doesn't
know won't kill her, right?

349
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:20,835
噢, 我的天哪, 这会杀了她
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

350
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:24,220
这太好玩了！
THIS IS SO FUN!

351
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:27,918
我是一个糟糕的女儿, 我要回去
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.

352
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:31,346
我将永远不回去去去去去去！
I am never going
baaaccckkk!

353
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,535
我是一个卑鄙的人
I am a despicable human being.

354
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,895
最好的一天, 永远！
Best day, ever!

355
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:51,022
你知道, 我不禁的注意到,
You know, I can't help but notice,

356
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:51,198
-你似乎有点 ... 在跟自己对抗
-
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

357
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:57,369
你说什么 ???
你整天都是这样 , 隐隐约约我感觉到
- What?
- Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces,

358
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,124
似乎是被母亲保护过度, 你偷偷溜出来一样 ...
of course, over protective mother,forbidden road trip.

359
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,977
我的意思是, 这是严肃的事情
I mean, this is serious stuff.

360
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:05,508
不过, 让我减轻 你的罪恶感, 这就是成长的一部分
But let me ease your conscious. This is part of growing up.


361
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,697
有点反叛, 有点冒险
这是很好的, 甚至是很健康的
A little rebellion, a little adventure. That's good, healthy even.


362
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,028
你这样觉得？
You think?

363
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,744
我知道, 你想太多了啦 !!
I know. You're way over thinking this, trust me.

364
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,109
难道你母亲是活该嘛？ 当然不
Did your mother deserve it?No.

365
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,724
这是否会让她心碎, 冲撞她的灵魂？
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

366
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:23,018
嗯, 当然会. 但是, 你本来就应该做的啊!
Of course.
But you just got to do it.

367
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:25,920
让她心碎？
Break her heart?

368
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,224
-对, 碎成两半 ..
-冲撞她的灵魂？
- In half.
- Crush her soul?

369
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,144
像颗葡萄
Like a grape.

370
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:33,500
她会心碎的, 你说得对
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

371
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,919
当然对啦 !! 唉.. 我替你难过 .....
I am, oh my, oh bother.

372
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,393
好吧, 我不能相信我这样说, 但是...
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

373
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,015
我愿意让你 中止这笔交易
I'm letting you out of the deal.

374
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:43,841
-什么？-没错

But don't thank me. Let's
just turn around,

377
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,050
我拿回我的背包,

378
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:52,278
你也能维持 良好的母女关系
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

379
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,500
基于相互信任 和什么的！

385

保持冷静, 它也许以为你怕它

386
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:21,907
噢, 对不起

387
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:24,611
我只是有一点点, 紧张 ....
Guess I'm a little bit, jumpy.

388
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:29,361
但小心为上, 如果我们要面对暴徒和恶棍的话
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

389

392
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,758
当你闻到它你就知道

393

哦, 一匹官马

394
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,510

403
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,162
舒服的小鸭

404
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:03,946
别担心, 很古朴的地方, 很适合你
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.

405
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,399

What are you getting?

00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,853
去, 实现你的梦想
Go, live your dream.

499
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:02,802
我会的
I will.

500
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:05,610
你的梦想烂透了, 我是说她的
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.

501
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:09,294
谢谢你们的帮助
Thanks for everything.

502
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:15,434
我相信这是你要找的人
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.

503
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:17,398
你抓到我了
You got me.

504
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:19,390
长官, 没有任何莱德的迹象
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

505
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:25,065
马克西姆斯
Maximus.

506
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,350
它在做什么？
What's he doing?

507
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,843
一个密道, 来吧弟兄们, 走吧
A passage, come on men,
let's go.

508
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,944
科曼, 别让这些人逃脱了
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

509
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:55,561
小心使用啊
Play it safe.

510
00:43:57,905 --> 00:43:59,338
我们去抢王冠
We'll go get the crown.

511
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:11,077
我有梦想, 我有一些梦想
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.

512
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:15,803
你好, 哦, 我是喝多了
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

513
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:20,100
因为我看到一个高大的美女
Because I just found me a
tall drink of water.

514
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:23,234
哦, 得了吧, 大耳朵
Oh stop it, you big lug.

515
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,786
那条密道通往哪里？
Where does that tunnel lead out?

516
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:27,893
刀子！
Knife!

517
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:31,642
嗯, 我得说
Well, that got us safe.

518
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:35,569
你刚刚的表现 ... 让人印象深刻 ...
Didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty, impressive.

519
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,506
我知道！
I KNOW!

520
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:39,279
我懂!
I know...

521
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:46,218
那么.. 弗林, 你是哪里人？
Sooo, Flynn. Where are you from?


522
00:44:46,241 --> 00:44:48,645
哇, 哇, 对不起 金发女郎, 我不喜欢说故事
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

523
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:52,045
不过, 我却对你的故事 很感兴趣
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

524
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:54,365
我知道.. 我不应该提你的 "头发"
Now I... I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

525
00:44:54,366 --> 00:44:56,192
-当然不,
-或者提到 "母亲"
- Nope.
- Or, the Mother.

526
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,452
-嗯, 嗯,
-坦白说, 我也怕问你那只 "青蛙" 的事
Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

527
00:44:58,553 --> 00:44:59,709
-是变色龙啦 ..
-差别不大
- Chameleon.
- Nuance.

528
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,989
我的问题是, 如果你这么想去看天灯,
Here's my question though, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

529
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,571
你为什么从前不去？
why haven't you gone before?

530
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,283
嗯, 弗林...
Uh, Flynn...

531
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:18,758
弗林！
Flynn!

532
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,561
快跑！
Run, RUN!

533
00:45:41,102 --> 00:45:42,198
他们是谁？
Who's that?

534
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,422
他们不喜欢我
They don't like me.

535
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:45,876
-那他们是谁？,
-他们也不喜欢我
- Who's that?
- They don't like me either.

536
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:49,226
-那又是谁？
-就让我们假定此时...
- Who's that?
- Lets just assume for the moment,

537
00:45:49,254 --> 00:45:50,779
这里的每个人 都不喜欢我
that everyone here doesn't like me.

538
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:52,301
拿着
Here.

539
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:03,263
我等这一刻 已经等了很久
I've waited a long time for this.

540
00:46:11,814 --> 00:46:16,371
哦, 妈妈, 我得买个一摸一样的
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

541
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:29,456
你应该知道, 这是我做过最奇怪的事
You should know that this is
the strangest thing I've ever done.

542
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:35,499
三战两胜怎么样？
How 'bout two out of three?

543
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,413
弗林, 当心点
Flynn, look out.

544
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:45,936
哇, 呜哇！
Hold on.

545
00:46:49,794 --> 00:46:52,413
你应该看看你的脸, 因为你看起来...
You should see your faces.
Because you look...

546
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:54,143
很可笑！
Ridiculous

547
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:02,847
来吧, 金发女郎
Come on, Blondie.

548
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:04,162
跳
Jump.

549
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:37,162
这样没有用的, 我什么也看不见
It's no use,
I can't see anything.

550
00:48:41,006 --> 00:48:43,180
嘿, 那样毫无意义
Hey, there's no point.

551
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,053
那里是一片漆黑
It's pitch black down there.

552
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,195
这都是我的错
This is all my fault.

553
00:48:55,903 --> 00:48:58,938
她是对的, 我不应该这样做
She was right, I never
should have done this.

554
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:04,537
我很...
I'm so...

555
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:08,079
我很抱歉, 弗林
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

556
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,232
尤金
Eugene.

557
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,598
什么？
What?

558
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:22,982
我真正的名字是, 尤金 菲茨赫伯特
( Eugene Fitzherbert )
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

559
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:26,619
所以, 不妨让你知道吧 ..
So you might as well know.

560
00:49:29,073 --> 00:49:32,636
我有神奇的头发, 唱歌时, 它就会闪亮
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

561
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:34,155
什么？
What?

562
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:40,838
我有神奇的头发, 唱歌时, 它就会闪亮
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

563
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:44,534
*花儿闪亮而发光让你的力量闪耀*
<i>*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*</i>

564
00:50:34,722 --> 00:50:36,436
我们成功了
We made it.

565
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:37,835
她的头发 会发光 !!
Her hair glows.

566
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:40,587
我还活着, 我还活着！
I'm alive.
I'm alive!

567
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:43,461
怎么会有这种事 ? 她的头发真的会发光
I didn't see that coming.
Her hair actually glows.

568
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:45,390
-尤金...,
-她的头发为什么会发光？
- Eugene...
- Why does her hair glow?

569
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,734
-尤金！-什么？
- Eugene!- What?

570
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:50,610
它不仅仅会发光而已 ...
It doesn't just glow.

571
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:54,043
它为什么 对着我笑？
Why is he smiling at me?

572
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:19,940
我会杀了他
I'll kill him.

573
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:22,002
我要杀了, 莱德
I'll kill that, Ryder.

574
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,545
我们要阻止他去王国
We'll head him off at the kingdom.

575
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:27,808
要取回王冠, 来吧
And get back the crown, come on.

576
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:30,113
孩子们
Boys.

577
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:36,584
也许你要停止像个野狗 追逐自己的尾巴,
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

578
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:38,751
好好的想一想
and think for a moment.

579
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:42,221
哦, 拜托没有必要那样
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

580
00:51:48,163 --> 00:51:52,012
那么, 如果这就是你想要的, 拿去吧
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

581
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:54,999
我还想向你提供一件.. 价值千顶王冠的事,
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

582
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,051
将会使你富有的难以置信
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

583
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,481
这甚至不是最好的部分
And that wasn't even the best part.

584
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,096
哦, 这就是人生
Oh well, C'est la vie.

585
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:02,486
好好享受你的王冠吧
Enjoy your crown.

586
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:05,675
那什么是 最好的一部分？
What's the best part?

587
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:11,075
它还能顺便报复 弗林莱德
It comes with revenge
on Flynn Ryder.

588
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:22,472
所以你在用你那奇怪神秘的魔法头发 包?我受伤的手?
So you're being strangely cryptic as you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

589
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,243
-啊..抱歉
Sorry.

590
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:30,673
只是不要... 不要吓到喔
Just don't....

591
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,768
*花儿闪亮和发光
<i>*Flower gleam and glow*</i>

592
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,250
*让你的力量闪耀*
<i>*Let your powers shine*</i>

593
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:48,316
*使时光倒转*
<i>*Make the clock reverse*</i>

594
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:52,027
*带回曾经的我*
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

595
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:57,133
*治愈了所有伤害*
<i>*Heal what has been hurt.*</i>

596
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:01,482
*改变命运的设计*
<i>*Change the fates design.*</i>

597
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:05,756
*拯救已经丢失的*
<i>*Save what has been lost.*</i>

598
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:08,907
*带回曾经的我*
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

599
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:14,817
*曾经的我*
<i>*What once was mine.*</i>

600
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:29,595
-啊.....
-不要吓到喔
- Ah...
- Please don't freak out.

601
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:34,948
唉唉, 我没有吓到, 你吓到了吗？
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

602
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:38,454
不, 我只是对你的头发 和它的神奇魔力 很感兴趣,
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
And the magical qualities that it possesses.

603
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:40,584
它... 这样已经有多久了？
How long has it been
doing that, exactly?

604
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,789
一直都是这样的, 我想..
Forever, I guess.

605
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:49,048
母亲说, 当我还是个婴儿时 有人试图把它剪下
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

606
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,488
他们希望把它占为己有
They wanted to take it for themselves.

607
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:53,832
但是, 一旦它被剪下
But, once it's cut.

608
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:56,559
它变成褐色, 并失去它的魔力
It turns brown, and looses its power.

609
00:53:57,495 --> 00:54:00,857
这样的一个礼物, 它必须得到保护
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

610
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:04,462
这就是为什么 妈妈从来不让我...
That's why Mother never let me...

611
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:12,153
这就是为什么我.. 我从来没有离开过 ...
That's why... I never left the...

612
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:16,139
你从来没有离开过那座塔
You never left that tower.

613
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,828
而你还是会回去吗？
And you're still gonna go back?

614
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,453
不 ..是的
No... yes.

615
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,494
这很复杂的
It's complicated.

616
00:54:38,714 --> 00:54:41,785
因此, 尤金 菲茨赫伯特, 是吧？
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

617
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:45,590
啊, 是啊, 咱们跳过悲惨的部分吧 ..
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of

618
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:48,732
尤金 是个可怜的孤儿, 这有一点点啊...
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit of a...

619
00:54:48,764 --> 00:54:50,903
这有一点点 令人沮丧
It's a little bit of a downer.

620
00:54:56,872 --> 00:54:58,475
曾有一本书
There was this book.

621
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:01,708
有一本我每天晚上用来 读给弟弟妹妹们听的书
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

622
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:05,774
芬尼根莱德的故事, 虚张声势的无赖, 最富有的人..
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder. Swashbuckling rogue,
 richest man alive.

623
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:09,826
跟女人关系不坏 , 没什么可炫耀的, 当然
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing
to ever brag about, of course.

624
00:55:10,795 --> 00:55:12,407
他也是个小偷吗？
Was he a thief too?

625
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:16,080
啊, 哦, 不是
Ahh, well no.

626
00:55:16,117 --> 00:55:19,682
其实, 他有足够的钱, 来做任何他想做的事
Actually, he had enough
money to do anything that he wanted to do.

627
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,320
他可以去任何他想去的地方
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

628
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,684
而且, 对一个 一无所有的孩子来说
And... and, for a kid,
with nothing.

629
00:55:24,716 --> 00:55:26,740
我不知道, 我..
I don't know, I...

630
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,000
这似乎是一个 很好的化名
It just seemed like a better option.

631
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,207
你不能告诉任何人这件事 , 好吗？
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

632
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,498
这可能毁了我的声誉
It could ruin my whole reputation.

633
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,187
啊, 我们不希望这样
Ahh, you wouldn't want that.

634
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:41,646
哦, 夸张的名声, 是男人的一切啊 !!
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

635
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:51,000
嗯, 嗯... 我应该 .....
Um, well I should uh...

636
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:54,502
我, 我应该去找一些柴火
I, I should get some
more firewood.

637
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,175
嘿
Hey.

638
00:55:57,002 --> 00:56:02,332
说真的, 我比较喜欢 "尤金菲茨赫伯特",
而不是 "弗林莱德"
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

639
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:07,219
那么, 你会是第一个
Well, then you'd be the first.

640
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,250
无论如何, 感谢你
But, thank you.

641
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:21,339
嗯, 我还以为他会一直待在这
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

642
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:23,407
妈妈？
Mother?

643
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,436
你好, 亲爱的
Hello, dear.

644
00:56:25,457 --> 00:56:28,011
但是, 我..我.., 正想...
But I... I..., don't we...

645
00:56:28,104 --> 00:56:29,610
你是怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

646
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,472
哦, 这真的很容易
Oh, it was easy really.

647
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:36,411
我只是听着 背叛的声音, 跟着来了..
I just listened for the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

648
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,265
-母亲 ..., -我们回家, 长发姑娘
- Mother...- We're going home, Rapunzel.

649
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:42,418
-马上-你...你不明白
- Now.- You... You don't understand.

650
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,599
我踏上了最不可思议的旅程
I've been on this incredible journey.

651
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:46,840
我也看到和学到了很多东西
And I've seen and learned so much.

652
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:49,369
我甚至遇到一个人
I even met someone.

653
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,740
是的, 被通缉的小偷, 还真自豪啊
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

654
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:54,205
-来吧, 长发姑娘 
-母亲, 等等...
- Come on, Rapunzel.
- Mother, wait.

655
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:55,071
我觉得...
I think

656
00:56:57,153 --> 00:56:58,600
我觉得他喜欢我
I think he likes me.

657
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,660
喜欢你？拜托, 你痴呆啦
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

658
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,644
-但是母亲, 我..,
-这就是为什么 你不应该离开
- But mother, I...
- This is why you never should have left.

659
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:08,805
亲爱的, 这整个浪漫, 都是你的想像,
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

660
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:13,842
只是证明你不懂世事
just proves you're to naive to be here.

661
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:17,395
他为什么会喜欢你吗？别闹了, 真的
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.

662
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:20,736
看看你, 你认为他会对你有好的印象吗 ?
Look at you, you think
that he's impressed?

663
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:24,548
做个乖孩子, 跟妈妈走
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.

664
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,558
*母亲 ..*

665
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:30,030

671
00:57:46,824 --> 00:57:48,751

672
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,006
*走向前去, 然后给他..这个！*
<i>*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*</i>

673
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:52,004

674
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:53,854
*这是他为什么在这里*

675

676
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:59,000
-*给他看, 你会了解的*

<i>*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*

677
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:02,332
*相信我 亲爱的, 他会很快离开你*
<i>*Trust me my dear, that's
how fast he'll leave you.*</i>

678
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:06,544
*我不会说我早告诉过你, ...不*
<i>*I won't say I told you so... no.*</i>

679
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,351
*长发姑娘最清楚*
<i>*Rapunzel knows best.*</i>

680
00:58:08,475 --> 00:58:09,771
*所以, 如果他是一艘梦之船*
<i>*So if he's such a dream boat.*</i>

681

<i>*Go and put him, to the test.*

*如果他真的说谎, 别来哭*
<i>*If he's lying, don't come
crying.*</i>

683
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:25,876
*母亲, 最清楚*
<i>*Mother, knows best.*</i>

684
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:35,130
所以, 嘿啊, 我能问你吗？
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?

685
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:39,017
是否有可能, 我的手会得到超强的能力？
Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?

686
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:42,537
我不骗你, 如果真是这样, 那就了不得了 !!
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

687
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:45,245
嘿, 你没事吧？
Hey, you all right?

688
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:47,964
哦, 对不起, 没事
Oh, sorry, yes.

689
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:51,233
只是嗯, 陷入了沉思, 我想
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.

690
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:55,625
我的意思是.. 因为, 你看
I mean because here's the thing.

691
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,694
超人的帅劲, 我天生就有了
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

692
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,523
但如果再加上 超人的力量？
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

693
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,475
想像一下那可能发生, 我只是...
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...

694
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:14,795
要有点耐心, 男孩们, 好东西都需要等待 !
Patience boys. All good things
to those who wait.

695
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:30,997

696
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,647
嗯, 我希望你是来道歉的

No, no put me down.Stop it. Let... me... go!

699
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,398
哇！
Whoa, 

700
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,545
哇, 哇, 哇, 哇

701
00:59:57,918 --> 01:00:00,692
别紧张, 男孩, 别紧张, 平静下来

703
01:00:07,722 --> 01:00:09,206
就是这样
That's it.

704
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:14,709
现在..  坐下
Now sit.

705
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:17,550
-坐... -啥 ??
- Sit.- What?

706
01:00:17,551 --> 01:00:19,048
好, 放下靴子
Now drop the boot.

707
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:20,685
放下它
Drop it.

708
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:25,817
哦, 你真是个好孩子
Oh, you are such a good boy.

709
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:28,403
是的, 你是
Yes you are.

710
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:33,106
你很累了吧, 到处追逐坏人？
You all tired, from chasing the bad
man all over the place?

711
01:00:33,316 --> 01:00:34,213
不好意思....
Excuse me?

712
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,289
没有人欣赏你, 是吗？
Nobody appreciates
you, do they?

713
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,482
是吗？
Do they?

714
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:40,694
拜托, 他是个坏马
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

715
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,666
哦, 它只不过是一只个头大的宝贝
Oh, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.

716
01:00:44,444 --> 01:00:45,847
是不是啊？
Isn't that right?

717
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,478
马克西姆斯
Maximus.

718
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:50,890
你在开我玩笑

And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.

721
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:02,615
只要二十四小时, 然后...
Just for twenty four hours and then,

722
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:05,204
你想怎么追, 就怎么追他 ....
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.

723
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:06,290
好吗?
Okay?

谢谢你们
Thank you.

727
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,613
这是要给失踪的公主
It's for the lost Princess.

728
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:10,463
鞠躬谢幕吧
To the boats

729
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:22,610
嘿 马克斯
Hey, Max.

730
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:28,441
怎么啦？我买的啦
What? I brought them.

731

大多数是买的
Most of them.

732
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,599
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

733
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:38,763
那么, 你人生中 最美好的一天,
Well, best day of your life.

734
01:04:38,764 --> 01:04:41,057
我想你应该有一个 像样点的座位
I figured you should have
a decent seat.

735
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:00,310
你没事吧？
You okay?

736
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:03,125
我吓坏了
I'm terrified.

737
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,302
为什么呢?
Why?

738
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:09,966
我一直望着窗外.... 十八年了
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

739
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:14,885
梦想着, 当我亲眼看到那些灯升空时, 会是什么感觉..
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

740
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:19,823
如果它不是我 梦想的那样呢？
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

741
01:05:22,272 --> 01:05:23,895
会是的 ..
It will be.

742
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:29,368
如果它不是呢？我要怎么做呢 ??
And what if it is? What will I do then?


743
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,134
那也是件好事, 我想
Well that's the good part,
I guess.

744
01:05:33,053 --> 01:05:34,648
你可以去追寻一个新的梦想
You get to go find a new dream.

745
01:07:09,111 --> 01:07:13,676
*所有从窗户看的那些日子*

Watching from the windows.*</i>

746
01:07:13,723 --> 01:07:18,628
*这些年都在望着外面的世界*

*我一直, 从来不知道*
<i>*All that time
Never even knowing*</i>

748
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:28,363
*我过去多盲目, 直到我来这里*
<i>*Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here*</i>

749
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:33,754
*星光闪烁中, 现在我在这里*
<i>*Blinking in the starlight

<i>*Suddenly I see

*它是, 哦, 如此清晰, 我终于来到此地*
<i>*It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be*</i>

752
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:56,390
*终于, 我看到灯光, 它就像浓雾已经消散*
<i>*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*</i>

753
01:07:56,483 --> 01:08:06,111
*终于, 我看到灯光, 像天空焕然一新*
<i>*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*</i>

754
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:16,157
*如此温暖, 光明和真实, 整个世界都改变了*
<i>*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*</i>

755
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:23,900
*所有的一切, 看起来都不同了*
<i>*All at once
Everything looks different*</i>

756
01:08:23,948 --> 01:08:28,865
*自从, 我遇见了你*
<i>*Now that I see you*</i>

757
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,926
我也有东西要给你
I have something for you, too.

758
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:41,274
我早应该把它给你了, 但我只是害怕
I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

759
01:08:41,443 --> 01:08:45,270
而事实是, 我不再害怕了
And the thing is,I'm not scared anymore.

760
01:08:45,631 --> 01:08:46,747
你知道我是什么意思？
You know what I mean?

761
01:08:48,348 --> 01:08:50,302
也让我说
I'm starting to.

762
01:08:54,628 --> 01:08:59,310
*所有那些追逐白日梦的日子*
<i>*All those days
Chasing down a daydream*</i>

763
01:08:59,311 --> 01:09:03,691
*这些年来活的浑浑噩噩*
<i>*All those years
Living in a blur*</i>

764
01:09:03,735 --> 01:09:08,927
*从来不曾 真正明白*
<i>*All that time
Never truly seeing*</i>

765
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:12,421
*人生的意义, 直到遇见了她*
<i>*Things, the way they were
Now she's here*</i>

766
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,833
星光闪耀中  终于, 遇见了她*
<i>*Shining in the starlight
Now she's here*</i>

767
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:22,469
*突然, 我知道 只要她在身边*
<i>*Suddenly I know
If she's here*</i>

768
01:09:22,515 --> 01:09:31,720
*我人生的方向, 突然变得清澈*
<i>*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*</i>

769
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:35,968
*终于, 我看到了光明*
<i>*And at last, I see the light*</i>

770
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:39,884
*它就像浓雾已经消散*
<i>*And it's like the fog has lifted*</i>

771
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:44,423
*终于, 我看到了光明*
<i>*And at last, I see the light*</i>

772
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,576
*它就像天空 焕然一新*
<i>*And it's like the sky is new*</i>

773
01:09:49,019 --> 01:10:00,058
*如此温暖, 光明和真实, 整个世界都改变了*
<i>*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*</i>

774
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:07,174
*所有的一切, 看起来都不同了*
<i>*All at once
Everything is different*</i>

775
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:11,838
*自从, 我遇见了你*
<i>*Now that I, see you.*</i>

776
01:10:16,518 --> 01:10:26,463
*自从, 我遇见了你*
<i>*Now that I... see you.*</i>

777
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,367
你没事吧？
Is everything okay?

778
01:10:45,368 --> 01:10:48,453
咦？哦, 没事
Huh? Oh yes.

779
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:50,700
嗯, 是的, 当然
Uh, yes of course.

780
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:52,751
我只是...
I just...

781
01:10:58,448 --> 01:11:00,148
对不起, 一切都很好
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

782
01:11:01,265 --> 01:11:02,798
只是还有件事, 我一定要去处理
There's just something I
have to take care of.

783
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:07,557
好..
Okay.

784
01:11:08,858 --> 01:11:10,895
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

785
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,528
没事的, 帕斯卡
It's all right, Pascal.

786
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,363
啊, 你们在这儿
Ahh, there you are.

787
01:11:27,395 --> 01:11:30,269
我一直在到处寻找你们, 自从我们走散了
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

788
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:33,127
嘿, 新鬓角修得不错, 是吧？
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

789
01:11:33,153 --> 01:11:34,728
你一定很引以为傲
You gotta be excited about that.

790
01:11:37,838 --> 01:11:42,430
总之, 只是想说, 我当初不应该溜走, 
王冠归你们了 ..
Anyhow, just wanted to say, I shouldn't have split.
 The crown is all yours.

791
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,300
我会想念你们, 但我认为这样...最好
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

792
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:51,931
又想瞒着我们吗？   嘿, 莱德？
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

793
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:55,350
什么？, 我们听说你发现了什么
What? We heard you found something.


794
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,542
比一顶王冠 更有价值的东西
Something much more valuable than a crown.

795
01:11:59,368 --> 01:12:02,704
我们要她来.. 代替王冠
We want her, instead.

796
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:16,704
我还以为你带着我的王冠跑了
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.

797
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:24,218
他是跑了
He did.

798
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,673
什么？不会的
What?
No.

799
01:12:26,696 --> 01:12:27,726
他不会的
He wouldn't.

800
01:12:28,514 --> 01:12:30,400
你自己看吧
See for yourself.

801
01:12:34,987 --> 01:12:36,433
尤金？
Eugene?

802
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:40,293
尤金！
Eugene!

803
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:44,811
公平交易
Fair trade.

804
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,898
用一顶王冠, 换来拥有魔法头发的女孩
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

805
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:53,318
你认为人们会为青春永驻, 付多少钱给我？
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

806
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,516
不, 拜托
No, please.

807
01:12:55,535 --> 01:12:56,864
不
NO!

808
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,254
不
NO!

809
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,751
长发姑娘！
Rapunzel!

810
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:10,296
妈妈？
Mother?

811
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:18,050
哦, 我的宝贝女孩
Oh, my precious girl.

812
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:20,182
母亲
Mother.

813
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:23,166
你没事吧？ 你受伤了吗？
Are you all right? Are you hurt?


814
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:25,999
-母亲, 你是怎么...
-我很担心你, 亲爱的
- Mother, how did you?
- I was so worried about
you dear.

815
01:13:26,204 --> 01:13:27,402
所以我跟着你
So I followed you.

816
01:13:27,606 --> 01:13:29,481
然后我看见他们攻击你
And I saw them attack you.

817
01:13:29,502 --> 01:13:32,549
走吧, 走吧, 他们快醒了.
All right, let's go, let's go
before they come to.

818
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,278
你是对的, 妈妈
You were right, mother.

819
01:14:04,932 --> 01:14:07,143
你一切都是对的
You were right about everything.

820
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,102
我知道, 亲爱的
I know darling.

821
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:11,735
我知道
I know.

822
01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:26,206
你看！
Look!

823
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:28,112
王冠
The crown.

824
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:30,264
长发姑娘
Rapunzel.

825
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:32,372
长发姑娘！
RAPUNZEL!

826
01:14:34,148 --> 01:14:36,658
不, 不 等, 等等, 等一下 伙计们, 伙计们
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.Guys, guys.

827
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:41,838
长发姑娘！
Rapunzel!

828
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,806
让我们做个了断, 莱德
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

829
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,732
我们去哪儿？
Where are we going?

830
01:15:14,905 --> 01:15:18,050
什么都没发生的, 好吗 ...
There, it never happened.

831
01:15:19,272 --> 01:15:21,400
现在, 洗手吃晚饭吧
Now, wash up for dinner.

832
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:24,139
我正在煮榛子果仁汤
I'm making hazel nut soup.

833
01:15:29,162 --> 01:15:31,681
我真的试过, 长发姑娘
I really did try, Rapunzel.

834
01:15:31,681 --> 01:15:34,281
我试图警告你, 外头究竟是怎样
I tried to warn you,what was out there.

835
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:37,955
世界是黑暗的, 自私,
The world is dark, and selfish,

836
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:39,186
和残忍的
and cruel.

837
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:43,050
哪怕我们拥有一丁点的光明
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine.

838
01:15:43,082 --> 01:15:46,031
都会被破坏
It destroys it.

839
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:28,684
你怎会知道她的事情的？
How did you know about her?

840
01:17:28,771 --> 01:17:29,972
告诉我, 马上！
Tell me, now!

841
01:17:30,073 --> 01:17:31,423
这不是我们做的
It wasn't us.

842
01:17:31,504 --> 01:17:33,067
是那个老太太
It was the old lady.

843
01:17:33,068 --> 01:17:34,474
老太太？
Old lady?

844
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:37,948
等等, 不, 等等！
Wait, no, wait!

845
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,238
你不明白, 她有麻烦了
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.

846
01:17:40,404 --> 01:17:41,473
等一等…
Wait!

847
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:42,559
长发姑娘？
Rapunzel?

848
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:46,428
长发姑娘, 怎么回事了？
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

849
01:17:50,103 --> 01:17:52,155
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

850
01:17:52,947 --> 01:17:55,142
我就是失踪的公主...
I'm the lost princess.

851
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:58,875
请大声说, 长发姑娘,
你知道我讨厌喃喃自语
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

852
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,805
我就是失踪的公主
I am the lost Princess.

853
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:02,279
不是吗？
Aren't I?

854
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:07,469
听清楚了吗, 妈妈？
Did I mumble, Mother?

855
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:10,870
或者我不该这么称呼你？
Or should I even call you that?

856
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,942
哦, 长发姑娘, 你知道自己在说什么吗？
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

857
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:17,749
为什么你会问 这样一个可笑的问题？
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

858
01:18:17,774 --> 01:18:21,206
是你！这都是你
It was you!
It was all, you.

859
01:18:23,183 --> 01:18:27,172
我做的一切, 是为了保护你
Everything I did, was to protect you.

860
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:31,593
-长发姑娘, 
-我的整个人生
- Rapunzel.
- I spent my entire life,

861
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:34,243
把自己藏起来, 不让别人用我的魔力
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

862
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,651
-长发姑娘！,
-其实, 我应该躲着的人 ... 
- Rapunzel!
- And I should have been hiding.

863
01:18:36,652 --> 01:18:38,287
就是你
From you.

864
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:39,651
你去哪里？
Where will you go?

865
01:18:39,662 --> 01:18:41,869
他不会等你的
He won't be there for you.

866
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,726
你对他做了什么？
What did you do to him?

867
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:47,752
以他的罪行, 会被吊死
That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

868
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:50,867
-不,
-现在, 现在都没事了, 
- No.
- Now, now. It's all right.

869
01:18:50,868 --> 01:18:52,365
听我说
Listen to me.

870
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:55,477
所有这一切 是理所应当的
All of this is as
it should be.

871
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,900
不
NO!

872
01:18:57,406 --> 01:18:59,647
你看错了这个世界
You were wrong about the world.

873
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,502
而你看错了我
And you were wrong about me.

874
01:19:02,706 --> 01:19:07,208
我永远不会再让你利用我的头发！
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

875
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,126
你要我变成坏人？
You want me to be the bad guy?

876
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,051
“好的”
Fine.

877
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:22,609
现在我是坏人了
Now I'm the bad, guy.

878
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:38,081
这是啥情形？
What's this?

879
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:39,796
把门打开
Open up.

880
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:42,335
通关密语？
What's the password?

881
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:44,125
-"什么"？
-答错了
- What?
- Nope.

882
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:45,786
打开此门
Open this door.

883
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:47,298
错得离谱呢
Not even close.

884
01:19:47,318 --> 01:19:48,524
你有三秒钟
You have three seconds

885
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,349
一...
One...

886
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:52,622
二...
Two...

887
01:19:54,477 --> 01:19:55,778
三...
Three...

888
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:03,564
平底锅, 可是秘密武器, 对不对？
Frying pans.Who knew, right?

889
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:33,894
-头向下 !
-好的, 头向下
- Head down?
- Head down.

890
01:20:33,906 --> 01:20:35,231
-手臂夹紧,
-好, 手臂夹紧
- Arms in?
- Arms in.

891
01:20:35,243 --> 01:20:36,323
-膝盖分开
-膝盖分开 ...
- Knees apart?
- Knees apart.

892
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:37,324
双膝分开？
Knees apart?

893
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,543
为什么 双膝要分 ...
Why do I need to keep my
knees apar...

894
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:49,822
马克斯！
Max.

895
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,445
是你带他们来这里的？
You brought them here?

896
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:55,073
谢谢你
Thank you.

897
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,898
真的, 谢谢你
No really, thank you.

898
01:20:58,924 --> 01:21:04,670
嗯, 我觉得, 我们一直都相互误解着
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.

899
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,915
而我们只是...
你是对的... 我们快走
And we're really just, yeah
your right. We should go.

900
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,571
马克斯！
Max.

901
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:18,463
马克斯！
Max!

902
01:21:29,736 --> 01:21:33,722
好吧, 马克斯, 让我看看你可以跑多快
Okay Max, lets see how
fast you can run.

903
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,971
长发姑娘
Rapunzel.

904
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:57,499
长发姑娘, 放下你的头发
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

905
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:15,796
长发姑娘, 我以为我再也见不到你了
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never
see you again.

906
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:26,405
看看你逼我做了什么事, 长发姑娘
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.

907
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,870
哦, 别担心, 亲爱的
Oh don't worry, dear.

908
01:22:28,887 --> 01:22:31,258
他死了, 我们的秘密才能守住
Our secret will die with him.

909
01:22:32,749 --> 01:22:34,943
至于我们呢？
And as for us?

910
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:40,944
我们去的地方, 再也没有人会找到你...
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

911
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,451
长发姑娘, 真的, 够了 ...
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.

912
01:22:50,487 --> 01:22:53,497
停止抗拒我...
Stop fighting me.

913
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:55,448
不！我不会停止
NO! I won't stop.

914
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:59,165
我的余生的每一分钟, 我都会拚力对抗
For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.

915
01:22:59,203 --> 01:23:03,040
我永远不会停止 尝试摆脱你
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.

916
01:23:04,908 --> 01:23:08,037
除非, 你现在让我去救他...
But, if you let me save him...

917
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:09,772
我就跟你一起去...
I will go with you.

918
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,009
不..不, 长发姑娘
No. No, Rapunzel.

919
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,524
我不会跑, 我永远也不会跑
I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.

920
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:21,109
只要让我医治他, 我会和你在一起
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

921
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:23,522
永远, 就像你想要的
Forever, just like you want.

922
01:23:23,523 --> 01:23:25,400
一切都会像以前一样
Everything will be the way it was.

923
01:23:26,888 --> 01:23:28,536

925
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:37,554
只要让我医治他
Just... let me... heal him.

926
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:46,842
这是要防着你 等会偷偷跟踪我们 ..
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

927

most famous concert pianist in the world,
if you can believe it.

966

<i>I started going by Eugene again.</i>

979
01:30:43,766 --> 01:30:46,175
停止偷窃, 基本上改头换面了
<i>Stopped thieving, and basically
turned it all around.</i>

980
01:30:46,176 --> 01:30:47,863
但我知道, 大家都想问的问题...
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

981
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:50,782
长发姑娘, 会和我结婚吗？

01:31:02,547 --> 01:31:04,887
好吧, 其实.. 是我求婚啦
