1
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:29,048
And on that point, members of the jury,

2
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,246
I rest my case.

3
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:27,141
Hello, Wanda.

4
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,907
Hi, Ken.

5
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,236
Hello, W-W-Wanda.

6
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,659
Ken,

7
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,619
this is Otto.

8
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,370
Hello, Ken. Wanda's told me a lot about you.

9
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,662
Hey! Great fish!

10
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,081
A squeeze of lemon, some tartare sauce... perfect!

11
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,786
George back yet?

12
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,909
No, he had to g-g-go

13
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,368
to the b-b-b...

14
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,208
What?

15
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,918
That's quite a stutter you've got there, Ken.

16
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,750
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.

17
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:15,584
So er... George needs a weapons man, eh?

18
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,586
A cup of tea, Ken?

19
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:19,588
Y-y-y...

20
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,340
Yeah, he'd like one.

21
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,134
I had a good friend in the CIA, had a stutter.

22
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,836
Cost him his life, dammit.

23
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:30,919
Hi, George.

24
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:34,092
Hello, George.

25
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,334
Get you a Scotch?

26
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,093
Yeah.

27
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,216
George,

28
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:40,923
this is Otto.

29
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,590
So,

30
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,464
you're Wanda's brother?

31
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,056
Good to be here, George.

32
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,972
England is a fine country.

33
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,924
Did she tell you what we need?

34
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,969
Something like that?

35
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,558
Something like that.

36
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:09,680
Hello, Wendy.

37
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:13,474
Had a good day?

38
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:17,639
I spend the morning trying to get a waste disposal man.

39
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:21,222
At lunch, Marjorie just complained about her husband

40
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,309
then I have to play three rubbers with Philippa.

41
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:27,357
I come back and Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

42
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,060
Oh, no!

43
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,024
Would you like some tea?

44
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,313
Yes.

45
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,112
I won the case.

46
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,686
This is the first moment I've had to myself all day.

47
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:46,151
Hello, Portia! How was the show?

48
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:48,568
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

49
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,781
- But you liked Phantom. - He's not fit for dog meat.

50
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,065
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,771
- Oughtn't we... - I thought you were making tea.

52
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,444
- I am, darling. Sorry. - I'd better get it.

53
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:01,900
- No, no, let me do it. - No! I'll do it!

54
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,571
I won the case.

55
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,824
Now this is cracked.

56
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:13,406
They're worth about 100,000 each.

57
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,737
There are 1 35 of them.

58
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,444
That makes 1 3 millions, my friends.

59
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,742
Dollars or pounds?

60
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,868
Pounds, pet.

61
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,823
This is the big one. So...

62
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,121
OK.

63
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,407
Yeah.

64
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,497
Otto?

65
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:32,906
Yes?

66
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:34,323
OK?

67
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,455
What?

68
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:36,748
The plan.

69
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,958
Yeah. Great. No problem.

70
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,544
What was the middle thing, about the police?

71
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,831
We don't meet up at Heathrow until Tuesday...

72
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:47,496
Yeah, yeah!

73
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,538
I haven't finished yet.

74
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:53,502
Because the police will watch all the airports for 72 hours.

75
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,545
I know.

76
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:55,668
I know.

77
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,496
Do you want me to g-g-get

78
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:02,003
a b-b-big

79
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:05,217
c-c-car?

80
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:06,718
Getaway?

81
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,254
A limo, OK?

82
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:10,424
And put diplomatic plates on it.

83
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,959
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

84
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:15,631
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

85
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:17,421
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

86
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,968
So, next week,

87
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,135
we won't have to look for work.

88
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:25,338
And it won't have to look for us.

89
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,470
Oscar Wilde.

90
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,589
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

91
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,468
What's the attraction?

92
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,260
Because you can t-t-t

93
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,843
trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

94
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,091
Shit on you?

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,635
Show off all the time.

96
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,177
You know what Nietzsche said about them?

97
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,801
He said they were God's second blunder.

98
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,136
Bye, sis!

99
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,180
Well, you tell him from me that l-l-l...

100
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,304
Bye, George.

101
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:02,644
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

102
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,813
- OK. - Don't let him touch you.

103
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:07,063
One more day, and we're together.

104
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,356
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

105
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:14,062
I know he's insensitive.

106
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,692
He's had a hard life.

107
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,230
Dad used to beat him up.

108
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,064
Good.

109
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:25,192
Aaagh!

110
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,007
Anybody moves and you're dead.

111
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,266
Look where you're going!

112
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,018
Chauvinist pig!

113
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:29,595
Really, people here just think they own the pavement.

114
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:58,934
That was fun.

115
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:00,777
I love robbing the English.

116
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,026
- They're so polite. - The d-d-d...

117
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,778
- What is it, Ken? - The dog!

118
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,186
We didn't hit the dog.

119
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:10,104
- $20 million and an insect worries him! - It's not an in-in...

120
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,524
Stutter's not getting any better. How about surgery?

121
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,654
Shut up!

122
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,071
Ken.

123
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:24,781
Bye!

124
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:57,664
Let's split.

125
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:01,374
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday. - Lie low. No celebrating.

126
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,998
No celebrating?

127
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,454
See you in a couple of hours.

128
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,132
To $20 million.

129
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,382
To a job well done.

130
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,514
To us.

131
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:01,477
To the best brother and sister team since...

132
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,717
Romeo and Juliet?

133
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:06,682
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes bought our story?

134
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:07,808
What morons!

135
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,262
- I want you to know something. - What?

136
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,846
Even if you were my brother, I'd still want to fuck you.

137
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,977
Oooh!

138
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,274
Make the call.

139
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,022
- Momento, carissima. - No!

140
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,726
- Eventuale! - No ltalian!

141
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:22,853
Hey!

142
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:26,315
Per cominciare, due insalate verdi con peperoni.

143
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,015
- E linguine primavera... - No. No.

144
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,316
- Una cotoletta di vitello. - Make the call, Otto.

145
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,939
Are you really ltalian?

146
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:35,612
Absolutamente. Si!

147
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,609
My name is Otto. It means eight.

148
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,395
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

149
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,477
Bye, George.

150
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,604
The police, please.

151
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,397
Otto!

152
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,444
Yes, hello.

153
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:50,656
Sorry to trouble you, but you may like to know

154
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:56,022
that today's Hatton Garden robbery was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.

155
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,821
He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions,

156
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:03,401
Murray Road, London W9.

157
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,399
Wanda!

158
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,996
Police! Open up!

159
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,625
Come on, open up!

160
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,617
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

161
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,706
George Francis Thomason?

162
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,296
Passport,

163
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,625
tickets,

164
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,756
money!

165
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,677
Asshole!

166
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:28,383
We're rich, Wanda.

167
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,630
Yep?

168
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,473
I bet these weeks with me

169
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,599
have been the most exciting weeks of your life.

170
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:35,923
You said it.

171
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:49,850
OK.

172
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,347
OK.

173
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,023
Disappointed!

174
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:56,933
Sonofabitch!

175
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,484
What do you have to do to make people trust you?!

176
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,936
Shut up.

177
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,735
People are always taking advantage of me!

178
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,146
Shut up and think. Where's he moved it?

179
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,142
What are you doing?

180
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,316
I'm thinking!

181
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,270
Thinking what I'll do to him.

182
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,524
I'll hang him up with piano wire...

183
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,737
- Where are you going? - I'm going to talk to him.

184
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:22,769
Talk to who?

185
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,401
Talk to who?!

186
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,484
So, while installing these windows,

187
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:31,397
you knelt on some broken glass from the pane you had dropped.

188
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,730
That's right, sir.

189
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,821
Your parents can confirm this?

190
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,279
Yes, and his aunt,

191
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,985
Georgina Thomason.

192
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,149
Good, Bartlett.

193
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:40,695
Yes?

194
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,319
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

195
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,609
Thomason. A young lady to see you.

196
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:49,111
- Anything else? - No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

197
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,621
No, absolutely not.

198
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:51,742
George!

199
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:54,540
Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.

200
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:55,861
- Thanks. - De nada.

201
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,739
What do you think, Mr Leach?

202
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:02,034
We may be OK on the glass, but what else will they come up with?

203
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:14,619
Oh, George!

204
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:17,585
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.

205
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,703
That's not allowed in here, miss.

206
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:21,034
Are you OK?

207
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:22,368
It's all right.

208
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,459
I don't think I can handle this.

209
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,042
I was too afraid to sleep last night...

210
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,044
Leave it out, leave it out, OK?

211
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,922
Listen, listen, listen.

212
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,591
Listen.

213
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,755
You stayed at my place.

214
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,833
We slept late.

215
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,005
You made me breakfast.

216
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:48,211
What?

217
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:50,300
What's he doing here?

218
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,384
He wanted to see you.

219
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,259
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

220
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,426
Do you want me to rub him out?

221
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,594
Anything, you name it.

222
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:02,093
I have friends making enquiries.

223
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:03,846
Good.

224
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,677
The jewels are very safe.

225
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,673
If I get sent down, it all gets handed back to cut my sentence.

226
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:13,180
Now, to cut my sentence even more,

227
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,764
I could tell them who done it with me

228
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,643
if I wasn't very happy about everything.

229
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,350
What was the middle thing?

230
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,517
Piss off.

231
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:30,726
- You want me to spring you... - Now!

232
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,392
George?

233
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,315
You don't think...

234
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:42,065
Do you?

235
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,187
No!

236
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,564
No.

237
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:49,813
No!

238
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,816
OK.

239
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,976
- George. - What?

240
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:57,648
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

241
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,570
Trust me.

242
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,522
Thank you very much.

243
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,233
Thanks a lot. Bye.

244
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,562
Have a good day.

245
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,694
So?

246
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,282
He's not sure it was you.

247
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:11,403
What about you?

248
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:12,944
No, no, he believes me.

249
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,530
That's why he can't figure out about you.

250
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,690
Figure out what?

251
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,398
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

252
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,407
Don't er

253
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,322
ever, ever, ever

254
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,112
call me stupid. OK?

255
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:30,658
What?

256
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,120
That's George's lawyer.

257
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,327
The other guy must be the barrister.

258
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,161
So?

259
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,453
Trust me.

260
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,573
Let me know if anything unexpected turns...

261
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,954
Excuse me.

262
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,791
Don't I recognise you?

263
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,041
No. No, I don't think so.

264
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,828
Oh.

265
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,451
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

266
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,415
Erm...

267
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,585
Well, hardly.

268
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,084
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

269
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,507
Yes, yes, certainly.

270
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,627
Thanks.

271
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,590
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

272
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,711
I'm American.

273
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:16,836
Oh, really?

274
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,717
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

275
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,881
What er... What brings you here?

276
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,049
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.

277
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:26,215
I... have a friend.

278
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:27,625
Oh!

279
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:28,757
I see.

280
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:29,966
There you are.

281
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,090
I knew it!

282
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:32,797
You're Archie Leash.

283
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:33,925
Leach.

284
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,134
Right.

285
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:36,721
I saw you in court!

286
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:38,885
Er... two weeks ago.

287
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:40,343
The casino break-in?

288
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,097
You were great!

289
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,262
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

290
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,216
I love the way you er

291
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,844
cross-examine.

292
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:51,381
Oh, I really admire your work.

293
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,513
Thank you.

294
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,926
- I'd better not... - I don't suppose...

295
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,099
No? Fine, right.

296
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,223
Well,...

297
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:01,929
Thank you for this.

298
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:03,390
I'll treasure it.

299
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,977
Au revoir.

300
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,806
You speak French, too!

301
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:33,729
What's going on?

302
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:37,395
Whatever George decides to do, he'll tell Leach first.

303
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:38,940
Why?

304
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,648
Because he's his lawyer.

305
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,895
Yeah, I know that.

306
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,236
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

307
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,489
So George will tell him where the diamonds are?

308
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,903
That's what I'm going to find out.

309
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,364
You done well, my son.

310
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,699
Now, where are we going to hide it?

311
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,746
Very good!

312
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,614
Don't tell Wanda anything.

313
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:15,988
Otto might get something out of her.

314
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,118
Now...

315
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,907
George.

316
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,866
You are going to g-get off?

317
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,037
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

318
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:24,162
We'll fix it.

319
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,834
Now, anything on Otto?

320
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,831
No. Not yet.

321
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,785
You watch him.

322
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,786
Ken!

323
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,867
OK.

324
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,206
Looks like the police have been all over it.

325
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,337
Let me change clothes, then I'll help you look.

326
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,039
Hello,

327
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:49,294
K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

328
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,003
Hey!

329
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:53,916
Wake up!

330
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,378
Wake up, limey fish!

331
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:01,167
So. How are you going to get friendly with this lawyer?

332
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,376
I don't know. I'll improvise.

333
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,379
Fucking insects!

334
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:09,340
I thought Englishmen didn't like women, the way they talk.

335
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:10,584
No!

336
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:15,426
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too, in a pompous sort of way.

337
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,380
Have you got the hots for him?

338
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:20,217
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

339
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:24,379
What is this? Hump-a-limey week?

340
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,140
Otto doesn't approve.

341
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:27,890
Otto might get jealous.

342
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:32,641
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

343
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,390
Molto pericoloso...

344
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:42,802
Carissima.

345
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:44,561
Oh, speak it, speak it!

346
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:48,271
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

347
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,180
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

348
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,810
Dov'?la farmacia?

349
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,684
Yes, yes, yes!

350
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:58,811
No, no, no.

351
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,436
- Si, si, si. - No, no, no.

352
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:01,765
No, not here.

353
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:02,980
Otto, not here.

354
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,520
Dov'?la Fontana di Trevi?

355
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,731
Not here, Otto!

356
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:07,188
Erm...

357
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,314
Mozzarella...

358
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:09,607
Er... Parmigiana...

359
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:12,689
- Gorgonzola! - Otto, no!

360
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:17,984
Wanda!

361
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,236
Look what I've got, Wanda.

362
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,776
Treasure!

363
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,367
Ssh!

364
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:15,415
Aaagh!

365
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,122
Ooh!

366
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,831
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

367
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,000
I thought it was the police again.

368
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:23,168
Isn't it horrible about George?

369
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,664
I've such a headache. Could you go and get me some aspirin?

370
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,078
Shit.

371
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,299
- What's that? - My brother's using the bathroom.

372
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:34,174
- Otto? - Mm. We just went and saw George.

373
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,790
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

374
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:44,716
Isn't it terrible about George?

375
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:47,928
When I find the bastard who squealed!

376
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,464
I love that man!

377
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,296
What are you d-d-doing here?

378
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,549
What am I doing here?

379
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:57,881
Wanda was upset, Ken. She needed to talk to family.

380
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:59,176
Sh...

381
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:02,259
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

382
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,807
I've got to speak to you.

383
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,345
Are you OK, now, sis?

384
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:12,723
- I'm fine, thanks for coming. - Call me if you need me.

385
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,184
What's up with you? Can't you think about her feelings?

386
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:20,432
Something f-f-funny is going on.

387
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:21,972
Oh dear, oh dear.

388
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,261
You don't know why you're excited.

389
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,973
- I saw the b... - Ken, Ken, Ken!

390
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:29,685
I didn't want to say anything while George was around.

391
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,723
Isn't it time you faced facts?

392
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,351
Come on!

393
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:36,313
You're a very attractive man.

394
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:37,812
You're smart.

395
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:39,980
You've got wonderful bones,

396
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,812
great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

397
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:43,643
Wh-wh-wh...

398
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,898
We could have a lot of fun together.

399
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,813
I think we'd be really good for each other.

400
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:49,940
What do you say?

401
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:53,568
You must be j-j-j...

402
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:54,858
May I kiss you, Ken?

403
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,398
No, you fucking can't!

404
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:58,106
Just a peck! No tongue!

405
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,234
No, no!

406
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:01,984
Ken! Ken!

407
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,609
Ken!

408
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:09,028
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

409
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,197
OK, no, look.

410
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:12,321
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:14,323
I've handled this badly.

412
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,573
Look, the physical side can wait.

413
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,201
You need time.

414
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,572
Will you think about it?

415
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:46,995
Oh, my God.

416
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:51,290
Oh, my God!

417
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:53,078
Ken!

418
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:54,918
Somebody just called!

419
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,871
They said that the police...

420
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,493
No, that the loot is in a garage in Fulham.

421
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,502
You and I have to go get it now.

422
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:03,954
We have to move it before the police find it.

423
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,085
No, no, no...

424
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:07,123
- What? - It's all right!

425
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,295
- What? - Ge-Ge-Ge

426
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:11,000
George

427
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:12,330
M-m-m

428
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,421
moved...

429
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,506
George moved the loot?!

430
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,129
Yes.

431
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,878
Where did he move it, Ken?

432
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,717
Where did he move it?!

433
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:24,466
C-c-c...

434
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:37,339
I don't know where it is. There's a key for something.

435
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:38,468
It's in...

436
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,844
Don't tell me.

437
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:44,131
It's better that you don't tell me.

438
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:49,179
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

439
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:55,353
Otto

440
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,803
tried to k-k-k

441
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:00,266
kiss me.

442
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:03,811
I thought he might.

443
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,184
No.

444
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,353
Nothing, no marks at all.

445
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,520
But it is a safety deposit box key?

446
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,103
Yes, but there are millions of them,

447
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,058
hotels, banks, offices.

448
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:18,389
Sorry.

449
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:19,854
Thank you.

450
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,268
Fuck!

451
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,815
That's him.

452
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:41,986
That's him, lnspector.

453
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:44,735
He's the one who tried to murder my dogs.

454
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,784
Davidson!

455
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:08,361
An American legal student wants to see me for a moment.

456
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,986
- What time is Sir John due? - 1 2.30, sir.

457
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:12,117
Right.

458
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,410
Come in!

459
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:26,456
- Hi. - How very nice to see you.

460
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:28,494
Am I interrupting?

461
00:29:28,628 --> 00:29:30,121
Absolutely not.

462
00:29:30,254 --> 00:29:31,248
Really?

463
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,250
Really. Delighted to see you.

464
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:34,373
Hello.

465
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,624
So.

466
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:40,706
This is the place.

467
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,952
- This is it. - Very nice.

468
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,498
I was at the courts this morning. It's fascinating!

469
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,338
Really, so much to know,

470
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,504
Everybody wears these. Do you?

471
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,630
Oh, ridiculous!

472
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:56,963
Well, erm

473
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:59,250
I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

474
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:00,381
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:03,179
But until then, I'm all yours, as they say.

476
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,424
I just have a couple of questions.

477
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,342
I'm having a little problem

478
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:11,754
understanding preliminary criminal procedures.

479
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,175
What exactly is the committal?

480
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:16,420
Ah. Interesting.

481
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,757
Basically, it's a preliminary investigation

482
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:22,640
where the prosecution presents evidence

483
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:25,091
that the accused has a case to answer.

484
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:27,181
That's what it says in the book.

485
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:30,393
Let's take, for example, my friend George Thomason.

486
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,716
Right.

487
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:34,893
- His committal is on Wednesday... - Thomason?

488
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:36,265
Yes.

489
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,509
George Thomason?

490
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,268
Yes. Do you know him?

491
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm defending him.

492
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,562
What are you talking about?

493
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,763
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

494
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:50,732
That's so great!

495
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,390
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

496
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:57,891
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

497
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,021
Thank you.

498
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,023
He's sure to get off now.

499
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,436
Wow!

500
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,734
I can watch you work now!

501
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:07,519
Please.

502
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:10,851
Amazing.

503
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,232
Well, anyway.

504
00:31:12,364 --> 00:31:15,232
At the committal, George would then plead...

505
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:17,106
Not guilty.

506
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,270
Really?

507
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:21,405
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

508
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,986
But wasn't there an identification?

509
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,024
True, but a very elderly lady.

510
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,315
I think they've got the wrong man.

511
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,984
You don't think he did it?

512
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,113
No.

513
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:35,732
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

514
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,694
that you did think he did it.

515
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,991
Sure, if more evidence against him came to light.

516
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:42,115
Right, right.

517
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:45,577
You would then advise him to plead guilty,

518
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:49,533
and turn over the jewels to get his sentence cut.

519
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:52,236
And he would turn them over to who, to you?

520
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,038
Theoretically, yes, yes.

521
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,161
Oh, of course.

522
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,405
Erm. Well er...

523
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,324
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

524
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:06,122
Wanda.

525
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:08,207
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

526
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:10,374
Well, Wanda, there are three...

527
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:16,999
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

528
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,084
Yes.

529
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:21,086
Oh, my God.

530
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:22,245
What?

531
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:23,578
You're his alibi.

532
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:25,789
I can't talk to you!

533
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:26,919
Why not?

534
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,503
My dear lady, you're a defence witness!

535
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:31,754
I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.

536
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,507
What did I say?

537
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:36,302
It's not ethical for me to talk to a witness.

538
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,418
Everybody does it in America.

539
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:40,258
Not in England, it's forbidden.

540
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,881
I insist, or I may have to give up the case.

541
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:45,050
I'm sorry. Please.

542
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,422
Oh, Archie.

543
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:57,640
I didn't come here to talk about boring criminal procedures.

544
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,591
Come on, you know!

545
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,429
You knew the minute I walked in here.

546
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:09,182
I want you.

547
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:13,132
What?

548
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,137
- Hello? - Sir John is here.

549
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:18,468
Show him in, please.

550
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,346
Make love with me.

551
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:22,138
- Pardon? - Nothing.

552
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,940
- Will you take me to bed? - No, sorry.

553
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,273
Bye, Uncle.

554
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,558
Hi!

555
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,693
He's pleading not guilty

556
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:57,027
so you're safe until the trial.

557
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,689
Leach doesn't think he did it.

558
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:04,533
Ken says there's a safe deposit box key,

559
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:07,111
but only George knows where it is.

560
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,111
Thank you, Wanda!

561
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,656
What have you found out?

562
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,030
Not a lot.

563
00:34:16,162 --> 00:34:18,401
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

564
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:19,734
I know that!

565
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:21,329
So nothing, huh?

566
00:34:21,455 --> 00:34:22,449
Nix.

567
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,740
Zip.

568
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,414
Diddly.

569
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,032
Bupkiss.

570
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:31,576
Niente.

571
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,446
Oh, it's too big!

572
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,989
- No, it isn't, Portia. - It's enormous!

573
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,366
- No, it isn't! - Oh, please, Mother!

574
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:44,124
No! Absolutely not!

575
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:46,824
I'm so miserable and you just don't care!

576
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,157
Do shut up, Portia!

577
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,705
All I get, all day, is people complaining to me.

578
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,793
Oh dear.

579
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,627
Ecco I'uomo.

580
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,755
Ooh, le due cupole grandi della cattedrale di Milano.

581
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,932
Benito Mussolini!

582
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:26,936
Dov'?il Vaticano?

583
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,899
Volare

584
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:45,739
Oh-oh

585
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:48,154
E cantare

586
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,279
Oh-oh...

587
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:04,152
Archie, I want you to speak to her about plastic surgery.

588
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,611
- Hmm? - I do wish you'd listen to me.

589
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,572
I want you to speak to Portia.

590
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:11,993
I'll speak to her in the morning.

591
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:13,533
Goodnight, Archie.

592
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,367
Goodnight, Archie!

593
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,706
Goodnight, Wanda.

594
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,619
Goodnight, who?

595
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:25,616
Sorry, darling. Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow

596
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:27,791
with some lousy old hag.

597
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,037
Are you George Francis Thomason

598
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,838
of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue,

599
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:35,207
London W9?

600
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:37,958
Yes, sir.

601
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,088
The charge is one of armed robbery.

602
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,420
Are we ready for a committal, Mr Percival?

603
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:47,080
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

604
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:48,544
That is correct, 6.2.

605
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:52,207
Here are the statements, all to be fully bound, please.

606
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,250
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

607
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,755
You are committed to stand trial

608
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:00,554
at the Central Criminal Court.

609
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,132
There is some urgency about this case.

610
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,087
The main witness, Mrs Coady,

611
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:09,595
is elderly and has had serious heart difficulties recently.

612
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:12,639
Is there any possibility that this case

613
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:15,135
might be put down for an early trial?

614
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:17,837
That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.

615
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:21,174
Take him down to the cell, please, officer.

616
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,347
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

617
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:44,555
You look great. I love your hair.

618
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,064
Got time for a coffee?

619
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,596
- No, I've g-g... - Have you thought about it?

620
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,227
Why did he give you this?

621
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,479
Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.

622
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:55,228
Does he want you to send her flowers?

623
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,390
Do her shopping?

624
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:57,770
Show her a good time?

625
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,810
Rub her out?

626
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:05,025
He wants you to rub her out?

627
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,396
He's going to kill her!

628
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,694
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

629
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,353
Limey fruits!

630
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:20,364
So the old lady will m-meet with an accident?

631
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,647
- Eh, K-K-Ken? - Sssh. Sssh!

632
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:26,526
What's so funny?

633
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,025
Nothing. Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

634
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,324
Well, it's better than b-buggering people.

635
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,152
I bet you ? you don't kill her.

636
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:38,698
All right.

637
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:40,157
All right.

638
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:43,485
I love watching your ass when you walk.

639
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:45,280
Is that beautiful or what?

640
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:48,165
Don't go near him!

641
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,866
He's mine!

642
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,947
? says you won't kill her!

643
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,875
When could you look at it?

644
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,580
Let's think. My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

645
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:04,626
I'll look at it then and call you on Saturday.

646
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:07,158
- I really appreciate it. Thanks. - Bye.

647
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:08,289
Hi.

648
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:10,791
I know we're not allowed to talk.

649
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:12,201
Give me a call.

650
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:13,535
I can't.

651
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:15,875
Please?

652
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:18,079
We're not allowed to speak.

653
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,837
We don't have to.

654
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:24,789
I don't want you for your conversation.

655
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,916
I'd love to...

656
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:43,923
- What happened? - Got a date, Friday.

657
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,142
Look here!

658
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:05,017
Do you mind not making that terrible noise?

659
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:07,181
My dogs will be having their nap.

660
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,265
Nice doggy.

661
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,557
Nice... doggy.

662
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,434
Otto, what are you doing?

663
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:33,102
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

664
00:41:33,234 --> 00:41:35,188
It focuses your aggression.

665
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:38,068
The monks did it before they went into battle.

666
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,231
What kind of Buddhism is this?

667
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:46,646
Asshole!

668
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,982
It's an early Tantric meditation...

669
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,489
What is this?

670
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:55,561
To get information, I might have to get friendly with him.

671
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:58,401
Well, we're ready now, at last.

672
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,570
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

673
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,533
- Your supper's in the fridge. - Marvellous.

674
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,654
Be good.

675
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:09,108
When you say friendly, what are we talking about here?

676
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:11,115
Cordial? Courteous?

677
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,524
Supportive? What?

678
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:15,281
I don't know. Let's just see what happens.

679
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,986
So, friendly might include actual er

680
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,496
what, penetration?

681
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,576
I don't need your jealousy now.

682
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:24,949
- Jealousy? - Yes.

683
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:28,199
Hey, I'm merely curious. Me? Jealous of that fop?

684
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,247
What about my tits?

685
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,870
Does he get to handle them?

686
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:43,835
Yes. That's my forecast. I'll stand by that.

687
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,123
Nuzzling?

688
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:47,539
I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.

689
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:48,867
80% chance there.

690
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:51,672
- Sucking? - I thought you weren't jealous.

691
00:42:51,797 --> 00:42:55,328
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy, it's for the weak.

692
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:56,661
One thing, though.

693
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:59,168
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

694
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:06,884
I told your father to get the car serviced.

695
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:08,466
Aren't we going, then?

696
00:43:08,593 --> 00:43:10,168
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

697
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,256
Hurry up.

698
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,889
Hi.

699
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:45,932
Do you despise me?

700
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:53,133
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

701
00:43:54,105 --> 00:43:56,142
Can I stay, then?

702
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:02,475
Of course. Look,...

703
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,184
- Wanda... - I know.

704
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:06,891
Your wife's coming back.

705
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:09,264
No, it's not her. She'll be hours.

706
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,271
It's about what I said to you.

707
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,308
It is all right for us to speak.

708
00:44:13,444 --> 00:44:14,474
It is?

709
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,229
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

710
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,266
Oh.

711
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:20,850
Oh, fine.

712
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:23,356
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

713
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:25,311
Oh, but they won't.

714
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:34,689
Sorry if I seem

715
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:36,103
pompous.

716
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,065
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

717
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:44,406
No.

718
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:45,648
Not yet.

719
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:47,112
I'm thirsty.

720
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,994
What shall I get you?

721
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,741
Whisky.

722
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:03,242
You are the sexiest, most beautiful girl

723
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,197
I have ever seen

724
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,571
in my entire life.

725
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,622
Get me my drink.

726
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:37,003
Oh, Archie.

727
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:40,454
Mm, Archie.

728
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:47,295
So.

729
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:51,206
If George decides to change his plea,

730
00:45:51,344 --> 00:45:54,709
he'd tell you where the loot is first, wouldn't he?

731
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:56,669
Mm?

732
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,719
Darling, we mustn't talk about the trial, OK?

733
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:02,133
I know. I just meant theoretically.

734
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:04,710
Kiss me there.

735
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,006
Oh. Theoretically.

736
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,549
Erm.

737
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:18,138
..to his legal representative...

738
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:28,304
What's the matter?

739
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:30,261
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

740
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:31,390
Ooh!

741
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:34,969
Aah!

742
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:36,598
What? What, darling?

743
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,721
- You're getting me hot! - Sorry.

744
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:40,514
I need something to drink.

745
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:41,810
Something cold?

746
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:43,268
Maybe in the fridge?

747
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,394
Champagne?

748
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:46,562
Oh, my favourite.

749
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:48,893
Don't go away.

750
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,435
Je reviens!

751
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,482
What are you doing here?

752
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,734
- Relax! - Get the fuck out of here!

753
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:11,063
- Your moaning worried me. - I was faking it, stupid!

754
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:12,855
Don't ever call me stupid.

755
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:15,147
- And I'm not jealous. - Then leave!

756
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,276
OK!

757
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,488
It's a nice place.

758
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:21,823
Don't touch his dick!

759
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,984
His wife, his wife!

760
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:31,281
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

761
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,654
God, there isn't any ice.

762
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,247
Champagne!

763
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,654
Aaagh!

764
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,201
What's the matter?

765
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,203
What are you doing?

766
00:47:57,502 --> 00:47:59,955
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

767
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,123
Erm... Iet me pour you a glass.

768
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,872
Whose is the car?

769
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:06,546
The car?

770
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,080
Blocking the drive?

771
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:10,037
There you are, dear. Cheers.

772
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:11,665
Nice to see you again.

773
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:13,076
How was the opera?

774
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:15,749
- Finished early, did it? - Whose car is it?

775
00:48:15,882 --> 00:48:17,209
Mine.

776
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:18,798
It's a beauty, isn't it?

777
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:21,129
Where did I leave my drink, Archie?

778
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:24,545
Who is this?

779
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:25,754
Don't you know?

780
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,377
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

781
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,171
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

782
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:33,376
- I'm... with the CIA. - The CIA?

783
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,052
That's correct, ma'am.

784
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,295
I was er... just telling your husband

785
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:41,924
before I had to go to your beautiful bathroom.

786
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:46,465
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector in a safe house near here.

787
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:48,588
We're debriefing him as of now

788
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:50,098
and we're just er

789
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:52,678
checking all the houses in the area.

790
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,798
- For what? - For KGB.

791
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:57,173
- Is there any danger? - No, no, no, no.

792
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,058
No er... No, not now.

793
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:01,512
We er...

794
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:04,215
We just want to keep everyone informed.

795
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:06,473
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

796
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:08,427
Sorry to have troubled you...

797
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:10,104
Keep everyone informed?

798
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,887
So there's no panic, ma'am.

799
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:13,349
But isn't it a secret?

800
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,186
You've no idea how secret.

801
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:17,471
Well, why are you telling everyone?

802
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:20,271
It's a smoke screen?

803
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:21,642
What?!

804
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:23,053
Double bluff.

805
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:26,805
You obviously know nothing about intelligence work.

806
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:29,513
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

807
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:33,312
My father was in the Secret Service, Mr Manfredjen St John.

808
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:37,272
I know perfectly well you don't keep the public informed

809
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:40,105
when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

810
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:41,565
Oh, you don't, huh?

811
00:49:41,696 --> 00:49:45,690
Not unless you're congenitally insane or stupid, no.

812
00:49:46,697 --> 00:49:48,154
Don't call me stupid.

813
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,447
Why on earth not?

814
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:56,313
Oh, you English are so superior, aren't you?

815
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,191
Do you know where you'd be

816
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:00,944
without us, the old US of A to protect you?

817
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:02,070
I'll tell you.

818
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:06,527
The smallest fucking province in the Russian Empire, that's what!

819
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:08,651
So don't call me stupid, lady.

820
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:09,780
Just thank me.

821
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:12,281
Thank you for popping in and protecting us!

822
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:15,162
If it wasn't for us, you'd be speaking German!

823
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:16,863
Singing Deutschland, Deutschland

824
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:19,284
ber alles

825
00:50:19,415 --> 00:50:22,994
He's covering for me. Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

826
00:50:23,124 --> 00:50:25,328
Necklace. I'll think of something.

827
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:28,077
- Who are you talking to? - Myself, darling.

828
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,787
- Who was that shouting? - Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

829
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:33,659
Archie, who on earth...

830
00:50:33,793 --> 00:50:34,989
I don't know. He...

831
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,330
- I need a drink. - Let's go to the pub.

832
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:38,740
What?!

833
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:40,121
Let's go to the pub.

834
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:41,875
Would you like to, Portia?

835
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:43,545
We haven't been for 1 5 years!

836
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,128
Portia could see it now.

837
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:46,450
Honestly, Archie!

838
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:47,582
Aaagh!

839
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:49,087
What on earth is the matter?

840
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,211
I thought the picture was falling off.

841
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,543
Will you pull yourself together?!

842
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:55,048
What's this?

843
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:57,128
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

844
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,584
What was that?

845
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:00,173
- A kind of necklace. - Aah!

846
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,330
What's going on?

847
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:03,172
Nothing. Let's go.

848
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,294
Can I see that?

849
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:05,753
- What? - In your hand.

850
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,165
Your other hand.

851
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:10,884
Portia, go to your room.

852
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:12,254
Aren't we going out?

853
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:13,962
I can explain. I left...

854
00:51:14,096 --> 00:51:15,090
Now!

855
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:17,341
- They sent a new girl... - Oh, Archie.

856
00:51:17,471 --> 00:51:19,260
No, she's Canadian...

857
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:21,674
It's lovely. Thank you.

858
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,504
It's even got a W for Wendy.

859
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:30,840
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

860
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:34,092
It's the most beautiful thing you've ever given me.

861
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:41,720
Oh, Archie. This isn't like you.

862
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,264
Are you fucking crazy?!

863
00:51:53,355 --> 00:51:54,729
Hey, I saved your ass.

864
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:57,854
I had him right where I wanted him, you asshole!

865
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,552
I give you one fucking thing to!

866
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:03,262
You had to drive me and shut up!

867
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,513
Oh, relax!

868
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:14,601
Hello.

869
00:52:15,278 --> 00:52:16,771
Hold on.

870
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:18,560
It's for you.

871
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:21,686
Hello.

872
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,435
Not at the moment, no.

873
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,771
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure when I can get hold of that.

874
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,404
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

875
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:38,441
Yes. As soon as possible.

876
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,363
Well, that would be very nice, obviously.

877
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,820
So. Erm...

878
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,493
See you soon, I hope.

879
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,076
Bye, Frank.

880
00:52:51,913 --> 00:52:53,950
Calm down. Calm down!

881
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,568
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

882
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,144
Smell, Maggie, smell.

883
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,980
Now. Now!

884
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:13,267
Kill, kill!

885
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:14,857
Kill!

886
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:17,196
Kill!

887
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,076
Kill!

888
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,752
We therefore commit its body to the ground.

889
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:48,535
Earth to earth.

890
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:50,665
Ashes to ashes.

891
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,756
Dust to dust.

892
00:53:55,056 --> 00:53:57,927
Miserere Dominus

893
00:53:58,394 --> 00:54:03,816
Miserere Dominus

894
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:08,228
Canis mortuus est

895
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:11,619
Hello, honey.

896
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:13,369
What happened?

897
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:15,407
N-n-nothing.

898
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:16,490
What's that?

899
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:17,740
Er...

900
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,993
Not Granny?

901
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,126
Not yet.

902
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,498
Oh. Who is it for, then?

903
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:23,879
A f-f-f...

904
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:26,087
A fish? Frenchman?

905
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:28,049
- A phone operator? - Friend.

906
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:30,305
Oh, a four-legged one?

907
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,634
Where's my sister?

908
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,052
She's in the b-b-b...

909
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:34,435
Thank you.

910
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:35,932
Lavatory.

911
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,149
Wanda!

912
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:40,407
Anything?

913
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:41,862
What? No?

914
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:43,654
Why are you here?

915
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:45,827
I'm here because I'm bored!

916
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:50,286
Bored, wandering around this awful city, shoving George's pic...

917
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:57,011
Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up, intellectually inferior British faggots.

918
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:01,216
They get rigor mortis in the prime of life in this country!

919
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:04,603
Standing there with their hair clenched

920
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:08,944
counting the seconds till the weekend,

921
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,109
so they can dress up like ballerinas

922
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:14,116
at the flat at four

923
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:15,360
2B, Saint...

924
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:20,332
To be honest, I er... hate them.

925
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:24,292
I mean, pretending they're so fucking lawyer...

926
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:28,636
So fucking superior with those phoney accents.

927
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:31,929
Not you, Ken. You've got a beautiful voice

928
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,686
when it works.

929
00:55:34,648 --> 00:55:35,762
Sonofabitch!

930
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,238
So er... Want to have some lunch?

931
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:45,863
Have you heard from him?

932
00:55:45,997 --> 00:55:47,656
- Who? - Archie.

933
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,162
No, I have to finish my hair!

934
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:51,540
Nothing?

935
00:55:51,671 --> 00:55:52,868
OK, I'm out of here!

936
00:55:53,006 --> 00:55:54,583
No plans to see him?

937
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:55,914
No.

938
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,296
OK, bye, bro!

939
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,216
Bye, Wanda!

940
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:03,929
Oh, sorry.

941
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:09,224
- What?! - It wasn't theirs to sell.

942
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:11,650
A old lady gave it to them to engrave.

943
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:14,272
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

944
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,736
- That's their problem. - No. Legally...

945
00:56:16,871 --> 00:56:17,866
You paid for it!

946
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:21,699
They accept their mistake and they're offering you this.

947
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,460
It's much more valuable.

948
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,375
I adore this and you want me to give it back...

949
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,798
- I don't want... - They can't have it.

950
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,925
- Wendy. - No. No!

951
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,680
- Wendy! - NO!

952
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,467
Tell them they can't have it!

953
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:35,559
You're the bloody barrister!

954
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:11,860
- Hello. - Hello.

955
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,903
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

956
00:57:16,994 --> 00:57:19,200
It's just beautiful.

957
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,581
Oh, my God, look!

958
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:27,460
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

959
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,049
Isn't it wonderful?

960
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:30,635
Whose is it?

961
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:33,170
It belongs to someone at the chambers.

962
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:34,504
And where are they?

963
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:36,632
Hong Kong.

964
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:37,765
Ah so.

965
00:57:38,481 --> 00:57:40,520
Gone for weeks.

966
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,808
Nice rug, Archie.

967
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:45,732
May l?

968
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,112
Archie, what are you doing?

969
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:51,443
The polka, I think.

970
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:58,126
You make me feel free!

971
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,834
Free?

972
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:03,800
Do you have any idea what it's like being English?

973
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:06,303
Being so correct all the time?

974
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:12,058
Being so... stifled by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

975
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:14,565
Asking someone, 'Are you married?'

976
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:16,735
and hearing, 'My wife left me.'

977
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,322
Or saying, 'Do you have children?'

978
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:22,823
and hearing, 'They burned to death yesterday.'

979
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,955
Wanda, we're all terrified of embarrassment.

980
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:30,467
That's why we're so... dead.

981
00:58:31,593 --> 00:58:33,585
Most of my friends are dead.

982
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:36,295
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

983
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:39,891
But you're alive, God bless you.

984
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:42,691
And I want to be. I'm so fed up with all this.

985
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:47,102
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

986
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:48,903
I'm a good lover.

987
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:52,783
At least, I used to be in the early 14th century.

988
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:56,371
Can we go to bed?

989
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:03,176
Yeah.

990
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:06,426
Hang on!

991
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:08,763
Mind your head.

992
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:11,387
Agh! Aagh!

993
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:13,348
Aaagh! Aaagh!

994
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:17,312
I think I love you, Wanda.

995
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:19,486
Oh, Archie.

996
00:59:19,617 --> 00:59:21,573
Can I ask you a question?

997
00:59:21,702 --> 00:59:22,697
Anything.

998
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:24,868
Where's my locket?

999
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,113
I couldn't get it.

1000
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,412
What?

1001
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:29,785
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1002
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:31,499
I got you this instead.

1003
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:33,459
Do you like it?

1004
00:59:33,594 --> 00:59:36,299
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1005
00:59:36,431 --> 00:59:39,183
What's the matter? Why?

1006
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:42,641
My mother gave it to me

1007
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,774
on her death... bed.

1008
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:49,777
Oh, I'm sorry.

1009
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:51,317
All right, darling.

1010
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:52,945
I'll get it for you.

1011
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:54,073
You promise?

1012
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:55,782
I'll think of something.

1013
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:58,203
Sex is very, very difficult for me

1014
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,538
with somebody that I don't trust completely.

1015
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:04,171
I promise I'll get it. OK?

1016
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:07,923
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

1017
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:13,476
I've loved you ever since the first second I saw you!

1018
01:00:15,691 --> 01:00:17,315
What was that?

1019
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:19,021
What?

1020
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:22,156
Your brother didn't bring you here this time?

1021
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:23,861
No.

1022
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:25,108
He's no idea?

1023
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,030
He doesn't have a clue.

1024
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,329
What?

1025
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,249
He is so dumb...

1026
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:32,374
Really?

1027
01:00:32,506 --> 01:00:36,551
He thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived.

1028
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:43,976
Those terrible lies he told about the CIA!

1029
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:45,100
So painful!

1030
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:48,398
When he heard your daughter's name was Portia,

1031
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:51,399
he said, 'Why did they name her after a car?'

1032
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:58,078
I love the way you laugh!

1033
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:00,705
I love you, you're funny.

1034
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:05,914
How come a girl as bright as you

1035
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,208
can have a brother who's so...

1036
01:01:08,345 --> 01:01:10,004
Don't call me stupid.

1037
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:13,424
Jesus Christ!

1038
01:01:20,445 --> 01:01:22,603
Ouch! Otto!

1039
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,854
Come on!

1040
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:27,027
I'll deal with you later!

1041
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,698
What have you done with her?

1042
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,503
- She's all right! - Otto!

1043
01:01:32,628 --> 01:01:34,454
Now, apologise.

1044
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,747
What?

1045
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:38,508
Apologise!

1046
01:01:38,636 --> 01:01:39,880
Shit!

1047
01:01:40,013 --> 01:01:42,339
Are you totally deranged?

1048
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:49,597
You pompous,

1049
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:52,273
stuck-up, snot-nosed,

1050
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:54,646
English, giant twerp,

1051
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:58,615
scumbag, fuck-face, dickhead asshole!

1052
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:00,952
How very interesting.

1053
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:03,454
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1054
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,745
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1055
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:06,876
Now, apologise!

1056
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:10,125
What? Me to you?

1057
01:02:14,893 --> 01:02:16,932
Apologise.

1058
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,141
All right, I apologise.

1059
01:02:19,273 --> 01:02:20,553
You're really sorry?

1060
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:22,269
I'm really, really sorry.

1061
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,146
I apologise unreservedly.

1062
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:26,104
You take it back?

1063
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,160
I do. I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1064
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:33,237
The imputation was totally without basis in fact,

1065
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:35,415
and was in no way fair comment.

1066
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:37,752
It was motivated purely by malice.

1067
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:39,838
I deeply regret any distress

1068
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:42,887
my comments may have caused you or your family.

1069
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:44,805
I hereby undertake not repeat

1070
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:48,468
any such slander at any time in the future.

1071
01:02:51,108 --> 01:02:52,352
OK.

1072
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:59,358
Miserere Dominus

1073
01:03:59,826 --> 01:04:04,952
Miserere Dominus

1074
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:09,670
Canis mortuus est

1075
01:04:09,922 --> 01:04:10,206
You said you loved him!

1076
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,920
Right, Otto! Here's a multiple choice question.

1077
01:04:15,054 --> 01:04:17,093
A. Wanda was lying.

1078
01:04:17,223 --> 01:04:19,262
B. Wanda was telling the truth.

1079
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,349
Which one are you going to pick?

1080
01:04:21,479 --> 01:04:23,186
What was the first one?

1081
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:25,271
You said you were not seeing him!

1082
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:27,357
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1083
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,896
I was dealing with something delicate.

1084
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,322
I'm setting up a guy who's important to us.

1085
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,370
He knows where the loot is and if you'll be arrested.

1086
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:38,036
You lope in like Rambo without a jockstrap

1087
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:39,912
and dangle him from a window!

1088
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:42,121
Now, was that smart?!

1089
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,048
Was it shrewd?

1090
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:46,714
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1091
01:04:48,516 --> 01:04:50,140
Don't call me stupid.

1092
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:51,638
Oh, right!

1093
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:54,723
To call you stupid is an insult to stupid people!

1094
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:57,266
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1095
01:04:57,403 --> 01:04:59,525
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1096
01:04:59,656 --> 01:05:02,776
You think you're an intellectual, don't you, ape?

1097
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:05,617
Apes don't read philosophy.

1098
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:09,579
Yes, they do. They just don't understand it.

1099
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,462
Let me correct you on a couple of things, OK?

1100
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:14,665
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1101
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:17,632
The central message of Buddhism

1102
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:20,634
- is not every man for himself. - You read...

1103
01:05:20,767 --> 01:05:24,136
The London Underground is not a political movement.

1104
01:05:24,272 --> 01:05:26,561
Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.

1105
01:05:26,692 --> 01:05:29,444
Now. You have just assaulted

1106
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:33,271
the one man who can keep you out of jail and make you rich.

1107
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:35,817
So what are you going to do about it, huh?

1108
01:05:35,954 --> 01:05:37,993
What would an intellectual do?

1109
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,158
What would Plato do?

1110
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:45,333
Apologise.

1111
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:47,340
Pardon me?

1112
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,465
Apolo...

1113
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:49,591
What?

1114
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:51,385
Apologise!

1115
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:52,512
Right!

1116
01:05:53,937 --> 01:05:55,347
I'm sorry.

1117
01:05:56,649 --> 01:05:58,059
No.

1118
01:05:58,193 --> 01:05:59,188
Not to me.

1119
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:00,729
To Archie.

1120
01:06:00,863 --> 01:06:03,271
And make it good, or we're dead.

1121
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:13,711
Oh, I'm so very, very, very, very s...

1122
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,665
Fuck you!

1123
01:06:16,884 --> 01:06:18,710
I'm s...

1124
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:21,217
I'm very, very s...

1125
01:06:21,348 --> 01:06:22,379
I'm so

1126
01:06:22,516 --> 01:06:23,974
very s...

1127
01:06:24,102 --> 01:06:27,187
Very, very s...

1128
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,123
Very, very...

1129
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:44,366
ssfff...

1130
01:07:56,393 --> 01:07:57,590
Ugh!

1131
01:07:57,727 --> 01:07:59,636
Hello, Mr Burglar!

1132
01:07:59,772 --> 01:08:01,349
Going somewhere?

1133
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:03,142
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1134
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:05,233
I'll teach you a lesson.

1135
01:08:05,363 --> 01:08:07,771
He's a very good friend of mine.

1136
01:08:07,908 --> 01:08:09,318
Otto! Otto!

1137
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:13,235
He'll be very pleased with me when he finds you all tied up

1138
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:15,116
and ready for the police!

1139
01:08:16,837 --> 01:08:18,793
And don't call me Otto.

1140
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:20,962
To you, I am Mr...

1141
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:30,262
Aagh!

1142
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,724
Oh, God.

1143
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,644
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1144
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,654
I'm sorry.

1145
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:40,779
Please.

1146
01:08:41,704 --> 01:08:42,901
I'm sorry.

1147
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:45,244
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1148
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,034
How could I know it was you?

1149
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:50,160
I mean, how could you expect me to guess?

1150
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:51,293
Stupid jerk!

1151
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:55,719
What the fuck are you doing robbing your own house?

1152
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,222
You asshole!

1153
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:59,840
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1154
01:08:59,978 --> 01:09:01,388
Agh!

1155
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:02,683
I'm sorry.

1156
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:04,393
I'm sorry.

1157
01:09:04,526 --> 01:09:06,565
Er... Er...

1158
01:09:07,321 --> 01:09:09,194
Yeah.

1159
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:52,418
God Almighty!

1160
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:55,255
Bloody hell!

1161
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:04,638
Darling!

1162
01:10:04,773 --> 01:10:06,315
Are you hurt?

1163
01:10:06,442 --> 01:10:08,683
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1164
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:11,775
Can't you speak?

1165
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:15,074
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1166
01:10:17,624 --> 01:10:19,616
Archie, we've been burgled.

1167
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:20,747
Oh, no!

1168
01:10:20,878 --> 01:10:22,075
Well, are you hurt?

1169
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:23,872
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1170
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:25,584
Bit of a headache. I er...

1171
01:10:25,717 --> 01:10:28,422
I came in here, somebody hit me, tied me up...

1172
01:10:28,554 --> 01:10:30,048
My God, is that the time?

1173
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:31,130
What?

1174
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:33,508
I didn't realise it was quite so late.

1175
01:10:33,645 --> 01:10:34,640
What?!

1176
01:10:34,771 --> 01:10:36,430
I'm late for a conference.

1177
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,308
You've just been attacked!

1178
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,399
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1179
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,937
- Archie! - I'll help you tidy up later!

1180
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:44,402
Hello, Portia.

1181
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:45,648
What's happened?

1182
01:10:46,328 --> 01:10:50,575
Your father has finally gone completely mental.

1183
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,524
Hi.

1184
01:11:26,257 --> 01:11:27,667
Archie!

1185
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,972
Thank you so much.

1186
01:11:32,098 --> 01:11:33,342
Champagne?

1187
01:11:33,475 --> 01:11:34,470
OK.

1188
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,166
- To us. - To us.

1189
01:12:02,097 --> 01:12:04,671
I went back to the house, and guess who...

1190
01:12:05,977 --> 01:12:07,008
Let's make love!

1191
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:10,644
Well, if you absolutely insist...

1192
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:11,854
No.

1193
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:12,980
What?

1194
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,186
Here. On the rug.

1195
01:12:16,116 --> 01:12:17,610
I'll be right back.

1196
01:12:17,742 --> 01:12:19,781
Get undressed.

1197
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:22,114
Why not?

1198
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:24,250
Why not indeed!?

1199
01:12:26,964 --> 01:12:28,588
Afterwards,...

1200
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:30,174
Yeah?

1201
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:32,340
..let's go to South America.

1202
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:33,633
What?

1203
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:35,673
Let's fly to South America.

1204
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:37,052
Why South America?

1205
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,059
OK,... Iceland?

1206
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:45,440
What do you really want out of life?

1207
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:47,489
I don't know.

1208
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,443
Why do I like you so much?

1209
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:50,572
Archie.

1210
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:51,699
Hm?

1211
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,489
Do you speak ltalian?

1212
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:54,619
I am ltalian!

1213
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:56,992
Sono italiano in spirito.

1214
01:12:57,129 --> 01:13:01,257
Ma ho sposato una donna che preferisce lavorare in giardino

1215
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:03,841
a fare I'amore appassionato.

1216
01:13:03,972 --> 01:13:05,300
Uno sbaglio grande!

1217
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:08,432
But it's such an ugly language.

1218
01:13:08,978 --> 01:13:10,970
How about... Russian?

1219
01:13:11,106 --> 01:13:15,899
Yest' sila blagodatnaya sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1220
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:22,279
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya lyubosyat'sya grust'.

1221
01:13:23,289 --> 01:13:28,581
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu tverzhdaya naizust'.

1222
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:34,088
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya somneniya daleko.

1223
01:13:34,345 --> 01:13:37,880
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko...

1224
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,215
Archie!

1225
01:13:39,352 --> 01:13:40,632
Yeah?

1226
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:42,229
Are you rich?

1227
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:43,981
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1228
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:45,483
What about the house?

1229
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:48,102
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1230
01:13:49,157 --> 01:13:50,781
Oh.

1231
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:58,454
Yest' sila blagodatnaya sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1232
01:13:58,587 --> 01:14:02,916
I tushit nyeponyatnaya, svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1233
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:08,964
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya somneniya daleko.

1234
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:13,718
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko!

1235
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:36,379
- What the hell are you doing? - I might ask you the same question!

1236
01:14:37,555 --> 01:14:38,550
Who are you?

1237
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:39,676
What?!

1238
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,136
Get your clothes on.

1239
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:44,306
- Will you leave immediately, please? - What?!

1240
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,017
You're in the wrong flat.

1241
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,476
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1242
01:14:48,612 --> 01:14:49,726
He's in Hong Kong.

1243
01:14:49,863 --> 01:14:51,736
He lent me the key. Now get out!

1244
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:54,951
We leased it from the agents last weekend.

1245
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:04,335
Yes, well obviously that changes things a bit. Erm...

1246
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:08,172
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1247
01:15:08,848 --> 01:15:10,045
What?

1248
01:15:10,182 --> 01:15:12,934
You bought our house in Lissendon Gardens.

1249
01:15:13,562 --> 01:15:16,729
Hazel and lan Johnson.

1250
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:20,644
What a coincidence!

1251
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:22,779
Ha...

1252
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:25,149
How nice to see you.

1253
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:55,438
Hello.

1254
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:57,235
Hello, Wanda. It's Archie

1255
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:01,708
I can't see you any more. I've got to end it.

1256
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:02,830
I'm sorry.

1257
01:16:02,961 --> 01:16:04,787
What?

1258
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:07,838
I'm sorry.

1259
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:10,750
Archie?

1260
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:41,423
Er...

1261
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,337
OK.

1262
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:46,100
Oh, no, no. Please.

1263
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,886
Look, I want to apologise.

1264
01:16:48,022 --> 01:16:49,219
I just finished it.

1265
01:16:49,357 --> 01:16:50,352
OK, OK, wait.

1266
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:53,153
Where are you going? I want speak with you.

1267
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:55,318
Will you leave me alone?

1268
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:56,990
I've ended it, all right?

1269
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,073
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1270
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:00,994
It's all over, OK? It's over.

1271
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:02,866
- All right! - Jesus Christ!

1272
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,909
- Calm down! - Someone help me!

1273
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:07,876
- Please believe me! - It's all right!

1274
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:10,925
Don't beat me up again. I've had a terrible day.

1275
01:17:11,052 --> 01:17:12,166
Will you shut up?!

1276
01:17:12,304 --> 01:17:14,213
Jesus Christ, don't kill me!

1277
01:17:14,349 --> 01:17:15,380
Shut up, then.

1278
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,096
OK.

1279
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:19,223
Look.

1280
01:17:19,355 --> 01:17:21,146
I just want to apologise

1281
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:22,306
sincerely

1282
01:17:23,528 --> 01:17:25,401
When I hung you from the window.

1283
01:17:25,531 --> 01:17:26,526
I'm really....

1284
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,193
It was not a nice thing to do.

1285
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:31,449
Then when I attacked you in there.

1286
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,122
I'm really, s...

1287
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:35,871
How did I know you were robbing your house?

1288
01:17:36,002 --> 01:17:37,282
I was trying to help!

1289
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:39,710
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1290
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:41,335
I wanted you to trust me.

1291
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:43,925
Please, it was my fault.

1292
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:46,050
- That's true. - Yeah.

1293
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:47,511
Now, about my sister.

1294
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:48,638
Otto,...

1295
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,477
She's a very sexy girl.

1296
01:17:50,606 --> 01:17:52,895
I understand you wanting to play around with her.

1297
01:17:53,026 --> 01:17:56,111
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1298
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,233
I was jealous.

1299
01:17:57,365 --> 01:18:00,070
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1300
01:18:00,702 --> 01:18:01,864
Fuck her blue.

1301
01:18:01,996 --> 01:18:03,620
I like you, Archie.

1302
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:05,908
I just want to help.

1303
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,548
Oh, God!

1304
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:53,644
Send for an ambulance!

1305
01:20:13,005 --> 01:20:14,380
Shocking!

1306
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:19,845
I did it!

1307
01:20:19,972 --> 01:20:21,430
I did it! I did it!

1308
01:20:21,808 --> 01:20:24,679
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1309
01:20:24,812 --> 01:20:25,807
Thomason!

1310
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:26,934
Yeah?

1311
01:20:31,154 --> 01:20:32,778
You done well, my son.

1312
01:20:34,284 --> 01:20:35,908
Now, here's the plan.

1313
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:39,784
You get four tickets for this evening for Rio, first class.

1314
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:42,157
- Then... - F-f-f...

1315
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:43,491
Yeah, four.

1316
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,124
We get rid of Otto later.

1317
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:48,091
Then, back to the flat, pack, collect me.

1318
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:51,837
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel to pick up the jewels.

1319
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:59,479
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1320
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:01,268
Oi! Oi!

1321
01:21:04,532 --> 01:21:07,237
It's so exciting, I can't believe it!

1322
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:08,448
He's s-s-safe.

1323
01:21:09,789 --> 01:21:11,745
I'm going to be late for court!

1324
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,248
H-Hello.

1325
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,375
Hello, Otto.

1326
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:21,589
No, she just er... I-l-left.

1327
01:21:22,265 --> 01:21:24,340
Oh, and Otto...

1328
01:21:24,476 --> 01:21:27,098
You owe me a p-p-p...

1329
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:29,601
What?

1330
01:21:31,444 --> 01:21:33,770
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1331
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,402
Not Granny?

1332
01:21:37,368 --> 01:21:41,496
M-met with an accident.

1333
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,409
Bullshit! You're lying.

1334
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:46,833
Dead?

1335
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:49,256
Heart attack.

1336
01:21:53,556 --> 01:21:54,966
I don't believe this.

1337
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,674
So, George will be out this afternoon.

1338
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,555
We all go out to Heathrow,

1339
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:01,313
collect the loot and...

1340
01:22:03,028 --> 01:22:09,114
All thanks to me.

1341
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:12,784
So the loot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1342
01:22:23,179 --> 01:22:24,673
What's h-h-happening?

1343
01:22:26,392 --> 01:22:27,387
Well, Ken.

1344
01:22:28,312 --> 01:22:30,684
I'm going to ask you some questions

1345
01:22:30,815 --> 01:22:32,225
while I eat my chips.

1346
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:33,734
First.

1347
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,519
Who was the philosopher

1348
01:22:35,655 --> 01:22:38,573
who developed the concept of the superman

1349
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,858
in Also Spracht Zarathustra?

1350
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:44,413
No?!

1351
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:47,329
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1352
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,790
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1353
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,417
Next.

1354
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:53,877
In which book did Nietzsche claim

1355
01:22:54,012 --> 01:22:57,464
that almost all higher culture is based on cruelty?

1356
01:22:59,269 --> 01:23:02,021
Are you thinking or are you in mid-stutter?

1357
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:04,640
You're m-mad.

1358
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:08,019
Beyond GoodAnd Evil.

1359
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,656
I'll have to ask you an easy one.

1360
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:13,659
OK. Erm...

1361
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,448
Let me think, let me think.

1362
01:23:16,251 --> 01:23:17,994
Where are the diamonds?

1363
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:20,622
I'll give you a clue.

1364
01:23:20,757 --> 01:23:23,248
Somewhere round the airport.

1365
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,506
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1366
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:32,177
I'll just sit here and eat my chips till you tell me.

1367
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,402
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1368
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:39,320
The chip.

1369
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:42,402
What do the English usually eat with chips

1370
01:23:42,535 --> 01:23:44,824
to make them more interesting?

1371
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,207
Wait a moment!

1372
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,336
It's fish, isn't it?!

1373
01:23:56,597 --> 01:23:58,470
Here, boy.

1374
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:01,633
Down the hatch.

1375
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:05,936
Delicious!

1376
01:24:06,068 --> 01:24:08,524
You b-b-b...

1377
01:24:08,654 --> 01:24:10,480
Better eat the green one? OK?

1378
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:13,613
What's this one's name?

1379
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,950
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

1380
01:24:16,081 --> 01:24:17,824
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1381
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,116
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

1382
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:26,627
Eugh!

1383
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:28,801
Avoid the green ones.

1384
01:24:28,932 --> 01:24:30,556
They're not ripe yet.

1385
01:24:32,519 --> 01:24:36,896
You were in court, lnspector, when the forensic evidence was read?

1386
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:38,056
Yes, sir.

1387
01:24:38,194 --> 01:24:41,646
And the fact that Mr Thomason was installing windows

1388
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:43,525
the previous weekend,

1389
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:49,496
would explain the presence of small particles of glass on his trousers.

1390
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,209
No hurry, lnspector.

1391
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:54,916
Please do take your time.

1392
01:25:02,267 --> 01:25:03,298
I'm almost full.

1393
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,599
Almost.

1394
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:08,724
Stop!

1395
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,852
Please, don't.

1396
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:11,982
Come on, Wanda!

1397
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:14,236
Gullet time!

1398
01:25:17,163 --> 01:25:20,413
What are the names of those hotels by the airport?

1399
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:21,870
The Airway Sheraton?

1400
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:22,997
The Post House?

1401
01:25:23,129 --> 01:25:24,457
The Cathcart Towers?

1402
01:25:24,589 --> 01:25:26,628
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1403
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:29,672
Mm? Mm?

1404
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:32,503
Yes.

1405
01:25:32,642 --> 01:25:34,184
In the safe deposit box?

1406
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,341
Yes.

1407
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:37,222
Where's the key?

1408
01:25:37,357 --> 01:25:38,352
What?

1409
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:39,514
Where's the key?

1410
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:41,726
It's in the t-t-tank.

1411
01:25:43,782 --> 01:25:45,276
Where? Where?

1412
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:47,817
In the t-t-t...

1413
01:25:47,953 --> 01:25:49,233
Treasure chest!

1414
01:25:53,878 --> 01:25:55,787
Where?!

1415
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,669
Where?

1416
01:25:57,801 --> 01:25:59,460
Oh!

1417
01:26:00,137 --> 01:26:03,257
You m-m-m

1418
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:07,471
murdering k-k-k...

1419
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,556
I'll kill you, I'll kill you!

1420
01:26:12,653 --> 01:26:16,236
Sorry, Ken, but your answer was incorrect.

1421
01:26:16,367 --> 01:26:19,902
Still, you really did think it was in there, didn't you?

1422
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:23,582
What?

1423
01:26:24,127 --> 01:26:26,000
Oh!

1424
01:26:33,473 --> 01:26:35,881
- Hello? - I know where the diamonds are.

1425
01:26:37,562 --> 01:26:38,557
Where?

1426
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:40,183
Where's the key?

1427
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,100
I've got it.

1428
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,730
When can you get to George's apartment?

1429
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:51,111
You are Wanda Gershwitz,

1430
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:55,031
of Kipling Mansions, Murray Road, London W9?

1431
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,125
Yes.

1432
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:58,962
Would you tell the court,

1433
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:01,130
how do you know the defendant?

1434
01:27:01,261 --> 01:27:04,179
We've had a relationship for two years.

1435
01:27:05,099 --> 01:27:06,758
Relationship?

1436
01:27:06,893 --> 01:27:09,384
We're lovers, your lord.

1437
01:27:11,774 --> 01:27:15,273
Miss Gershwitz, on 4th March of this year,

1438
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:16,780
in the morning,

1439
01:27:16,907 --> 01:27:17,986
where were you?

1440
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:20,155
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1441
01:27:20,286 --> 01:27:23,655
And were you by yourself, or was anyone else present?

1442
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,159
No. Somebody else was there.

1443
01:27:26,294 --> 01:27:27,788
Who was that?

1444
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:29,331
My brother.

1445
01:27:29,465 --> 01:27:30,460
Did your b... ?

1446
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:36,471
Your brother?

1447
01:27:37,768 --> 01:27:39,677
My brother.

1448
01:27:41,941 --> 01:27:43,269
Yes.

1449
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:46,319
Yes, and...

1450
01:27:47,614 --> 01:27:50,022
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1451
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,615
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1452
01:27:52,746 --> 01:27:55,747
She's had a relationship with him all her life.

1453
01:27:58,045 --> 01:27:59,455
Much obliged, my lord.

1454
01:28:00,632 --> 01:28:04,844
W-w-was there anyone else present that morning?

1455
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:07,093
Yes, George was there.

1456
01:28:07,224 --> 01:28:08,634
But he left about 6.55.

1457
01:28:08,767 --> 01:28:10,426
Wanda!

1458
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:12,430
I-l wonder...

1459
01:28:12,856 --> 01:28:14,729
I wonder...

1460
01:28:16,278 --> 01:28:17,902
I wonder...

1461
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:28,414
Yes, Mr Leach?

1462
01:28:29,462 --> 01:28:30,920
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1463
01:28:31,047 --> 01:28:32,671
I wonder... I w-w-w

1464
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,920
Wh-when you say 6.55,

1465
01:28:36,054 --> 01:28:38,426
Miss er... Gershwitz,

1466
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:41,262
how can you be so sure?

1467
01:28:41,395 --> 01:28:42,972
Oh, I looked at the clock.

1468
01:28:43,314 --> 01:28:44,724
Cos I said to myself,

1469
01:28:44,858 --> 01:28:48,607
'Where could he be going at 6.55 with that sawn-off shotgun?'

1470
01:28:48,738 --> 01:28:49,686
Darling!

1471
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:52,325
Mr Leach.

1472
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:53,531
Darling?

1473
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:54,858
Yes, dear?

1474
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:55,992
You bitch!

1475
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:57,581
You fucking bitch!

1476
01:29:01,881 --> 01:29:03,078
Restrain that man!

1477
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:10,636
Restrain this man.

1478
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:12,096
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1479
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:15,313
Clear the court! I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1480
01:29:15,441 --> 01:29:17,599
Clear the court!

1481
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:28,576
Clear the court!

1482
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,949
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1483
01:29:31,086 --> 01:29:33,078
Officers, arrest that man!

1484
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:42,016
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1485
01:29:53,241 --> 01:29:54,735
Bloody hell!

1486
01:29:55,452 --> 01:29:57,693
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1487
01:29:58,499 --> 01:29:59,827
Ah, you made it. Good.

1488
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:01,701
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1489
01:30:03,547 --> 01:30:06,584
I have never been so humiliated in my life.

1490
01:30:06,717 --> 01:30:09,920
You can stick this marriage right in your bottom!

1491
01:30:10,056 --> 01:30:11,466
I'll see you in court.

1492
01:30:21,321 --> 01:30:22,316
Yes.

1493
01:30:24,658 --> 01:30:26,068
Well.

1494
01:30:26,744 --> 01:30:28,321
That's it, then.

1495
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:33,121
George.

1496
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:34,912
- What? - We've got to talk.

1497
01:30:35,715 --> 01:30:37,624
Tell those pigs to fuck off.

1498
01:30:37,759 --> 01:30:39,039
Fuck off, pigs.

1499
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,932
Did you hear what I said?

1500
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,055
Fuck off.

1501
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:52,061
What's she up to, George?

1502
01:30:52,195 --> 01:30:53,309
What are you up to?

1503
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:56,107
You called her darling,

1504
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,356
and Wanda.

1505
01:30:57,493 --> 01:31:00,578
I've been helping her get her evidence straight.

1506
01:31:00,707 --> 01:31:01,821
It slipped out.

1507
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,701
Have you been coaching her?

1508
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:06,457
What do you think?! We've got ten minutes.

1509
01:31:06,589 --> 01:31:08,628
They'll find you guilty, right?

1510
01:31:08,759 --> 01:31:12,258
Plead guilty now, tell them where the loot is, you may get

1511
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:14,678
eight years, out in five and a half.

1512
01:31:14,809 --> 01:31:17,265
What if I tell them about Otto... and Wanda?

1513
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:19,478
- They both did it? - Yeah.

1514
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:20,721
Great, all right.

1515
01:31:20,859 --> 01:31:22,685
Maybe six years, out in four?

1516
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:25,655
So where are the diamonds?

1517
01:31:25,782 --> 01:31:27,489
Where's Bartlett?

1518
01:31:27,618 --> 01:31:29,574
Upstairs, calming things down.

1519
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:30,866
So, where are they?

1520
01:31:30,997 --> 01:31:33,702
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1521
01:31:35,128 --> 01:31:39,173
George, it'd be a lot quicker if you told me.

1522
01:31:41,428 --> 01:31:43,384
OK! I'll tell Bartlett.

1523
01:31:43,514 --> 01:31:45,257
Where's Ken?

1524
01:31:45,392 --> 01:31:46,636
He's at the flat.

1525
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,067
Thank you for all your help.

1526
01:31:54,195 --> 01:31:55,309
I'll be right out.

1527
01:32:10,509 --> 01:32:12,168
Taxi! Taxi!

1528
01:32:12,302 --> 01:32:13,333
Please... shit!

1529
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:14,751
Taxi!

1530
01:32:14,889 --> 01:32:16,051
Come on.

1531
01:32:16,183 --> 01:32:17,297
- What? - Let's go.

1532
01:32:17,435 --> 01:32:18,929
- Where? - Buenos Aires.

1533
01:32:19,061 --> 01:32:21,896
- What? - We're going to George's flat first.

1534
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:23,767
Get in.

1535
01:32:26,822 --> 01:32:28,019
Got your passport?

1536
01:32:28,157 --> 01:32:29,152
Yeah.

1537
01:32:29,284 --> 01:32:31,406
Check the briefcase for mine.

1538
01:32:31,537 --> 01:32:32,947
Get your head down.

1539
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:42,373
So, you robbed the jeweller's, turned one lover in,

1540
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:45,345
and kept one to help you find the diamonds.

1541
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:48,142
When he does, you commit perjury in court.

1542
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:50,093
Everyone does it in America.

1543
01:32:50,228 --> 01:32:51,472
Not in this country!

1544
01:32:51,606 --> 01:32:53,728
Right! Nobody lies in England.

1545
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:57,987
- Like Margaret Thatcher never lied. - You lied to me from the start.

1546
01:32:58,113 --> 01:33:01,778
- You just wanted to get me into bed. - I fell in love with you!

1547
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:09,329
How come you dumped me, then?

1548
01:33:09,462 --> 01:33:11,501
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1549
01:33:23,273 --> 01:33:24,932
Say something in Russian.

1550
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:26,061
No!

1551
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:32,942
What are you thinking, Archie?

1552
01:33:33,078 --> 01:33:35,450
I'm trying to find one good reason

1553
01:33:35,581 --> 01:33:37,870
why I should take you away with me.

1554
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:38,866
How about

1555
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,123
because I have the key to the safety deposit box.

1556
01:33:43,801 --> 01:33:46,090
(both) That's a good reason!

1557
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,344
What do we do about Otto?

1558
01:33:51,477 --> 01:33:52,591
I'll handle Otto.

1559
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:54,767
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1560
01:33:55,358 --> 01:33:56,686
So am l.

1561
01:33:56,817 --> 01:33:58,441
Keep it running.

1562
01:34:01,992 --> 01:34:04,198
- Why did you bring him? - Otto, wait!

1563
01:34:04,328 --> 01:34:07,115
- I'm beginning to think you like him! - Wait!

1564
01:34:07,248 --> 01:34:08,706
Let's get the diamonds!

1565
01:34:08,959 --> 01:34:09,824
Ken!

1566
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:11,873
Are you Ken?

1567
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,545
How do you do?

1568
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:17,254
I'm George's barrister.

1569
01:34:20,475 --> 01:34:21,470
Oh, my God!

1570
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:22,976
Asshole!

1571
01:34:23,103 --> 01:34:25,475
What the bloody hell...

1572
01:34:25,606 --> 01:34:27,230
Oh, all right, then.

1573
01:34:28,693 --> 01:34:30,484
Archie!

1574
01:34:31,865 --> 01:34:33,193
Where have they gone?

1575
01:34:33,325 --> 01:34:35,151
Quick! Where have they gone?

1576
01:34:35,286 --> 01:34:37,325
They've go... they've go...

1577
01:34:37,455 --> 01:34:38,699
What?

1578
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:41,198
Are you all right?

1579
01:34:42,086 --> 01:34:43,414
Where have they gone?

1580
01:34:43,547 --> 01:34:44,957
They've gone to the

1581
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,252
the Ca-ca-ca...

1582
01:34:46,384 --> 01:34:47,926
- Are you ill? - No, no, no.

1583
01:34:48,053 --> 01:34:49,084
What?

1584
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:50,216
Ca-ca-ca...

1585
01:34:50,348 --> 01:34:51,758
Have you got a stutter?

1586
01:34:51,891 --> 01:34:54,097
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1587
01:34:54,227 --> 01:34:55,721
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1588
01:34:55,855 --> 01:34:57,811
Do you know where they've gone?

1589
01:34:57,941 --> 01:34:58,936
Yeah.

1590
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:00,526
Fine, fine. Where?

1591
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:03,690
The Ca-ca

1592
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:04,819
Hotel.

1593
01:35:05,576 --> 01:35:06,571
Hotel?

1594
01:35:06,703 --> 01:35:07,698
Which hotel?

1595
01:35:09,415 --> 01:35:10,410
Ca

1596
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,414
The Ca... The Ca...

1597
01:35:13,545 --> 01:35:15,003
Go on, go on.

1598
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:16,126
Ca-ca-ca...

1599
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:17,252
It's OK.

1600
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:19,875
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1601
01:35:20,013 --> 01:35:22,052
Slowly. Very slowly.

1602
01:35:22,182 --> 01:35:23,177
Slowly.

1603
01:35:25,478 --> 01:35:26,853
The Ca

1604
01:35:28,524 --> 01:35:29,519
The Caa

1605
01:35:30,986 --> 01:35:31,981
The

1606
01:35:32,112 --> 01:35:33,736
Ca

1607
01:35:33,864 --> 01:35:35,061
The Caa...

1608
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,194
No hurry.

1609
01:35:36,326 --> 01:35:37,950
The C-C-Caaa...

1610
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:39,656
Sing it. Sing.

1611
01:35:39,789 --> 01:35:40,986
The Caa

1612
01:35:42,168 --> 01:35:43,448
The Caa

1613
01:35:43,752 --> 01:35:45,411
The Caa, the Caa

1614
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,002
Caa

1615
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:49,128
Plenty of time.

1616
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:50,255
Caa

1617
01:35:51,555 --> 01:35:52,550
Caa

1618
01:35:52,681 --> 01:35:53,676
The Caa

1619
01:35:53,808 --> 01:35:55,183
Oh, come on!

1620
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:56,803
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1621
01:35:56,937 --> 01:35:57,932
Erm...

1622
01:35:59,482 --> 01:36:01,308
The Caa

1623
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:05,439
Here. Write it.

1624
01:36:17,006 --> 01:36:18,500
Cathcart Towers Hotel?

1625
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:20,461
Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1626
01:36:20,593 --> 01:36:21,790
Where is it?

1627
01:36:22,888 --> 01:36:24,465
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1628
01:36:24,599 --> 01:36:25,879
Hea-Hea-Hea...

1629
01:36:26,018 --> 01:36:27,512
Here. Again.

1630
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:28,842
No, no, no.

1631
01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:38,063
Heathrow Airport.

1632
01:36:50,175 --> 01:36:51,503
Hey! What's the idea?

1633
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:53,125
You can't stay...

1634
01:36:53,263 --> 01:36:55,801
Terribly sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1635
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,223
Thank you so much.

1636
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:06,400
Er... British Airways to Rio.

1637
01:37:06,531 --> 01:37:08,190
Rio? Terminal Four.

1638
01:37:08,324 --> 01:37:09,948
Thank you.

1639
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:17,873
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1640
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:19,747
I'll be with you in a moment.

1641
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,078
I'll be right back.

1642
01:37:22,051 --> 01:37:24,507
Aisle or window? Smoking or non-smoking?

1643
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,132
What was the middle one?

1644
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:28,506
Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

1645
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:30,137
Gate 14 is boarding now.

1646
01:37:53,635 --> 01:37:54,630
Rio!

1647
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:58,680
Otto, don't look back, there's a cop behind us.

1648
01:37:58,809 --> 01:37:59,804
Quick!

1649
01:38:04,316 --> 01:38:06,355
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

1650
01:38:06,486 --> 01:38:07,481
Great.

1651
01:38:07,612 --> 01:38:09,106
Luggage?

1652
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:13,945
Don't really need any.

1653
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:15,786
- Gate 14. - Thank you.

1654
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:19,540
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1655
01:38:26,513 --> 01:38:28,172
Ow!

1656
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:30,473
Aargh!

1657
01:38:49,418 --> 01:38:51,374
Come on, Archie.

1658
01:38:51,505 --> 01:38:52,702
Pick up the phone.

1659
01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:02,090
Ticket, sir. Airport security.

1660
01:39:02,227 --> 01:39:04,053
May I see your boarding pass?

1661
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,847
Oh, yes. Certainly.

1662
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:09,434
Very good. Would you mind stepping over here, please?

1663
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:10,400
Of course.

1664
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:12,403
- Oh, look, the Queen. - Where?

1665
01:39:17,456 --> 01:39:19,495
OK, OK, OK, don't get excited.

1666
01:39:19,625 --> 01:39:21,284
OK, OK, OK.

1667
01:39:23,381 --> 01:39:26,501
Oh, it's you! I was actually worried for a minute.

1668
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:28,378
- Keep your hands up. - No!

1669
01:39:28,512 --> 01:39:30,884
- Put 'em up! - I'll make a deal with you.

1670
01:39:31,016 --> 01:39:32,213
I'll put one up.

1671
01:39:32,351 --> 01:39:33,893
Put the other one up!

1672
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:36,810
Which looks better?

1673
01:39:37,941 --> 01:39:40,349
I'm warning you, Otto.

1674
01:39:40,486 --> 01:39:41,980
What are you going to do?

1675
01:39:42,156 --> 01:39:45,359
Shoot me? Gun me down in cold blood, like a dog? Hey?

1676
01:39:45,493 --> 01:39:49,657
If you want to settle something, fight me. You're a man.

1677
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:51,829
Let's fight like men! Come on!

1678
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:54,664
All right.

1679
01:39:54,798 --> 01:39:55,829
All right, then.

1680
01:39:56,841 --> 01:39:58,797
OK. OK.

1681
01:39:58,928 --> 01:40:00,754
You look good, Arch.

1682
01:40:00,889 --> 01:40:03,261
That's right. I used to box for Oxford.

1683
01:40:03,392 --> 01:40:05,930
Oh, yeah? Well, I used to kill for the CIA.

1684
01:40:06,063 --> 01:40:07,473
Now, get your hands up.

1685
01:40:08,608 --> 01:40:09,603
No.

1686
01:40:12,529 --> 01:40:15,316
You spineless bimbo.

1687
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:17,490
Now, out.

1688
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,211
I'm going to have to shoot you now, Archie.

1689
01:40:24,338 --> 01:40:26,746
But I've got a little time before my plane leaves

1690
01:40:26,883 --> 01:40:29,089
and I'm longing to humiliate you.

1691
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:31,045
So get in that barrel.

1692
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:33,968
What?

1693
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,095
In the barrel.

1694
01:40:39,441 --> 01:40:41,065
Right.

1695
01:40:43,571 --> 01:40:44,566
You English!

1696
01:40:44,697 --> 01:40:47,271
You think you're so superior, don't you?

1697
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:49,948
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1698
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,321
A bunch of pompous,

1699
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,210
badly-dressed, poverty-stricken,

1700
01:40:55,337 --> 01:40:58,172
sexually repressed football hooligans.

1701
01:40:59,676 --> 01:41:01,170
Goodbye, Archie.

1702
01:41:01,304 --> 01:41:03,795
At least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1703
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:06,423
Your problem is you don't like winners.

1704
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,840
- Winners? - Yeah.

1705
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,141
Winners.

1706
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:10,469
Winners like

1707
01:41:10,608 --> 01:41:11,770
North Vietnam?

1708
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,228
Shut up!

1709
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:14,938
We did not lose Vietnam!

1710
01:41:15,072 --> 01:41:16,269
It was a tie!

1711
01:41:16,406 --> 01:41:19,526
I'm telling ya, baby, they kicked a little ass there.

1712
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:24,157
Boy, they whupped your hide real good!

1713
01:41:24,293 --> 01:41:25,288
No, they didn't.

1714
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:27,292
- Oh, yes, they did. - No, they didn't.

1715
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:29,164
Oh, yes, they did.

1716
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:30,923
Oh, no they...

1717
01:41:31,052 --> 01:41:32,047
Shut up!

1718
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:34,168
Goodbye, Archie.

1719
01:41:34,306 --> 01:41:35,716
Are you gonna shoot me?

1720
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:38,091
Er yes, I'm afraid so, old chap.

1721
01:41:38,228 --> 01:41:39,259
Sorry!

1722
01:41:39,397 --> 01:41:40,428
Look, Otto. Look.

1723
01:41:48,074 --> 01:41:50,744
Revenge.

1724
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:55,827
It's K-K-Ken!

1725
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,878
C-c-coming to k-k-kill me.

1726
01:41:59,006 --> 01:42:02,505
How are you going to c-c-catch me, K-K-Ken?

1727
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:05,883
Now, where was l?

1728
01:42:06,015 --> 01:42:07,425
Oh, yeah.

1729
01:42:09,395 --> 01:42:11,221
Shit! God!

1730
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:15,147
Fucking limey cement!

1731
01:42:23,705 --> 01:42:24,784
Ken! Ken!

1732
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:26,991
Wait, wait, Ken!

1733
01:42:27,126 --> 01:42:29,498
Kenny! May I call you Kenny?

1734
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:30,661
Remember Wanda?

1735
01:42:30,798 --> 01:42:32,457
I got the deal of a lifetime!

1736
01:42:32,592 --> 01:42:34,050
50-50. What do you say?

1737
01:42:34,178 --> 01:42:36,300
OK, OK, 60-40.

1738
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:37,841
That's my final offer.

1739
01:42:37,974 --> 01:42:39,005
Revenge!

1740
01:42:39,143 --> 01:42:40,340
Wait, I got an idea.

1741
01:42:40,478 --> 01:42:41,853
You take it all.

1742
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,269
Here's my boarding pass. Ken!

1743
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,401
I'm gonna... I'm gonna k-k-kill you.

1744
01:42:47,529 --> 01:42:49,071
OK, fine, Ken. Come at me.

1745
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:50,656
Give me your best shot.

1746
01:42:50,784 --> 01:42:52,823
Go on, you don't have the guts.

1747
01:42:52,953 --> 01:42:54,328
Admit it.

1748
01:42:56,457 --> 01:42:57,785
OK, you have the guts.

1749
01:42:57,918 --> 01:42:59,412
Good. Wait.

1750
01:42:59,545 --> 01:43:01,039
Death!

1751
01:43:01,172 --> 01:43:04,209
All right, I'm sorry I ate your fish, OK?!

1752
01:43:04,343 --> 01:43:05,505
I'm sorry!

1753
01:43:05,636 --> 01:43:06,798
Revenge!

1754
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,673
Jesus, I said I'm sorry.

1755
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,800
What the fu...? Aaagh!

1756
01:43:14,023 --> 01:43:14,936
Got him!

1757
01:43:25,371 --> 01:43:27,410
Gotcha again!

1758
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:29,200
You bastard!

1759
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:32,077
Hey! I've lost my stutter.

1760
01:43:33,257 --> 01:43:34,454
It's gone.

1761
01:43:34,592 --> 01:43:35,587
I can speak.

1762
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:38,293
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck,

1763
01:43:38,431 --> 01:43:40,637
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1764
01:43:42,227 --> 01:43:43,389
Good afternoon, sir.

1765
01:43:43,521 --> 01:43:44,516
Boarding pass?

1766
01:43:52,825 --> 01:43:54,734
Buongiorno, signorina.

1767
01:44:03,256 --> 01:44:04,833
Now, listen. Two things.

1768
01:44:04,966 --> 01:44:06,543
One.

1769
01:44:06,677 --> 01:44:10,342
Behave yourself from now on, or I'll break your neck, OK.

1770
01:44:11,683 --> 01:44:12,678
Two.

1771
01:44:14,146 --> 01:44:15,141
Gorbachov.

1772
01:44:15,772 --> 01:44:16,767
Glasnost.

1773
01:44:17,441 --> 01:44:18,603
Molotov.

1774
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:21,148
Blinis.

1775
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,565
Er... Lenin.

1776
01:44:24,701 --> 01:44:26,907
Pushkin.

1777
01:44:27,037 --> 01:44:28,234
Chicken Kiev.

1778
01:44:28,373 --> 01:44:30,745
Good. Dostoevsky.

1779
01:44:30,876 --> 01:44:32,453
Roubles.

1780
01:44:35,049 --> 01:44:36,708
Vladivostok.

1781
01:44:41,432 --> 01:44:46,937
Assho-o-ole!
