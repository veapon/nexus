? To everything except for me ?

60
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,820
? A constellation of tears on your lashes ?

61
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,680
? Burn everything you love then burn the ashes ?

62
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,860
? In the end everything collides?

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,180

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,760

101
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,480
我覺得我從小到大
I have been walking up and down

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,770
就一直在模仿超模走秀
fake runways my whole life, I think.

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,060
我第一次知道時尚秀時
The first time I was introduced to a fashion show,

104
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,750
我好像才四歲
I was, like, four years old.

105
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,310
我的夢想
My dream was to walk in

106
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,300
就是參加維密時尚內衣秀
the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

107
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,740
對於來自巴西小鎮的我來說
Coming from a small town in Brazil,

108
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,730
這太了不起了
it's huge.

109
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,890
我只想成為那些女孩中的一員
I just wanted to be one of those girls,

110
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,320
加入這個不可思議的大家庭
you know, and wanted to be part of this incredible family.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,200
我18歲時
When I turned 18,

112
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,210
我就定下目標
I had set a goal of being

113
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,600
要參加維密時尚內衣秀
in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,770
卻不知道這意味著什麼
and had no comprehension of what was ahead.

115
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,670
我當時年紀小  缺乏安全感  很害怕
I was young and insecure and very scared.

116
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,820
我來維密的第一件事
The first thing I did

117
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,940
就是參加時尚內衣秀的模特選拔
with Victoria's Secret was the fashion show casting.

118
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,650
很多人問我們
A lot of people ask us,

119
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,850
你們選拔都看重什麼
"What do you look for when you're casting?"

120
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,730
對我們來說  最重要的是找到
For us, it's very, very important to have someone

121
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,990
熱情向上  積極開朗的人
who's enthusiastic and always positive and always happy--

122
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,470
我們要找一位美麗健康的女性
this gorgeous, healthy woman.

123
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,260
我從沒這麼緊張過
I had never been more nervous in my entire life.

124
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,500
把果凍和水泥混起來
If you could mix Jell-O and a cement block together...

125
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,910
-就是當時我腿的感覺  -慢點  慢點
- that is how my legs felt. - Slow down, slow down.

126
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,120
這是個成為巨星的真正機會
This is a real opportunity to become a big star.

127
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,910
我當時很年輕  對我來說簡直不可思議
I was so young-- it was just mind-blowing for me

128
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,750
我能夠參加走秀  能夠站上天橋
that I'd booked the show and that I was there.

129
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,340
我見到了Heidi  Laetitia  Stephanie
I saw Heidi, I saw Laetitia, I saw Stephanie.

130
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,400
還有Tyra Banks  Gisele  Adriana
Tyra Banks, Gisele, Adriana...

131
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,580
天吶天吶  真不敢相信我居然在這
"Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't believe I'm here.

132
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,390
她們太美了
They're so beautiful."

133
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,780
我從未想過能走上維密秀天橋
I never imagined that I would be on that runway.

134
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,160
第一次參與維密內衣秀
My first time doing the VS Fashion Show,

135
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,780
改變了我的模特生涯
that changed my entire career.

136
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,980
維密能推動你的事業
It definitely puts you in the next level.

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,800
提高了我的全球知名度
That's what really got me out into the whole entire world.

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,010
大家都知道你是誰
Everybody knows who you are.

139
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,870
這是段無與倫比的旅程
It's such an incredible journey.

140
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,100
歲月如梭
The years go by so fast.

141
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,020
真希望時間能走得慢一點
I wish it could slow down.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,250
我到現在都還沒緩過神來  但我做到了
I still don't know how it happened, but here I am.

143
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,320
我成為了維密天使

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,630
? From A to Zed ?

292
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,520
? I got a lot of nasty things ?

293
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,530
? Blowing up in my head ?

294
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,340
? But none of them are worth my time ?

295
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,400
? You're not even worth this rhyme ?

296
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,260
? And I don't, I don't ?

297
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,010
? Give a flying ?

298
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,680
? I don't really have much to say ?

299
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,060
? I was over it the second that I ?

300
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,580
? Saw her name ?

301
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,050
? I got two ?

302
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,160
?Two, two letters for you ?

303
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,310
? One of them's F ?

304
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,880
? And the other one's U ?

305
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,580
? 'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue ?

306
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,080
? Only two, two, two ?

307
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,870
? Letters to choose ?

308
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,100
? One of them's F! And the other one's U ?

309
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,960
? SMH ?

310
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,180
? I'm pressing send on you ?

311
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,550
? Ooh, ooh, two letters for you ?

312
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,000
? Yeah(letters for you) ?

313
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,680
? What you trippin' on, huh?

314
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,450
? Girl, you know you're wrong, huh ?

315
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,420
? Don't let these girls drive you crazy ?

316
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,910
? I don't really have much to say ?

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,610
? I was over it the second that I saw her name ?

318
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,290
? I got two, two, two letters for you ?

319
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,910
? One of them's F! And the other one's U ?

320
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,740
? 'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue ?

321
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:50,930
? Only two, two, two, letters to choose ?

322
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,190
? One of them's F ?

323
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,090
?And the other one's U ?

324
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,030
? SMH, I'm pressing send on you ?

325
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,060
? I got two, two, two letters for you ?

326
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,460
停放乾冰  乾冰停下
Let's stop atmosphere now, please. Stop atmosphere now.

327
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,180
Clyde  倒數60秒  撤下巴黎街燈
Clyde, cue 60-- the Parisian lamp post out.

328
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,100
? 'Cause what you gotta do ?

329
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,930
? Is go get yourself a clue ?

330
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,960
? Only two, two, two, two ?

331
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,130
? I'm pressing send on you ?

332
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,640
今年的假日廣告是在巴黎拍的
This year, we shot the holiday commercial in Paris.

333
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,460
開拍
And action!

334
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,060
猶如夢境一般
It felt like a dream.

335
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,980
妙不可言
It was awesome.

336
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,820
我們決定在夜間拍攝
We decided to shoot at night.

337
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,450
午夜拍廣告  感覺有些淘氣
It feels a little naughty to shoot at midnight.

338
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,470
從全新的視角來拍攝
It's such a different way

339
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,280
內衣和天使們
to see the lingerie and see us.

340
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,610
我們睡了一白天  晚上八點才開始做造型
We slept all day, we'd go to hair and makeup at 8:00,

341
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,140
接著拍了一夜廣告
and then shoot all through the night.

342
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,720
我們的生物鐘的確與眾不同
Our sleeping patterns were very interesting.

343
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,820
凌晨六點  我們還在香榭麗捨大街拍外景
At 6 a.m., we're shooting right in front of the Champs-Elysees.

344
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,070
當時我只穿著內衣
I'm just walking around in my wings

345
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,650
戴著翅膀走來走去  沒啥大不了的
in my bra and underwear, no big deal.

346
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,200
開拍
And action!

347
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,580
巴黎的夜晚燈火絢爛
Paris is luminous.

348
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,850
它是光明之城
It's the City of Lights,

349
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,440
我們真的點亮了它的光芒
and we lit it up, literally.

350
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,980
維密公司花下重金
Victoria's Secret paid

351
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,450
讓埃菲爾鐵塔整晚閃爍
to keep the Eiffel Tower lit all night.

352
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,650
難以置信的美麗特別  浪漫至極
It was unbelievably beautiful and special and romantic.

353
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,440
我當時真是凍得要命
It was freezing cold.

354
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,080
天上還下著雪
It was practically snowing.

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,910
要是讓我受凍
Put me in a cold situation,

356
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,720
我就會不開心
and I'm not the happy girl.

357
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,230
這次的拍攝場面特別宏大
It's such a massive production.

358
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,670
拍了許多動人心魄的美麗場景
Beautiful, epic scenes.

359
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,840
是展現演技的好機會
It's an opportunity to perform.

360
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,250
為了展現性感  我通常會做這樣的表情
To turn on sexy, I usually will do one of these.

361
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,120
這是搞怪版Behati
This is goofy Behati, um,

362
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,000
有點二的Behati
being her stupid self.

363
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,100
這是性感版Candice
Ths is sexy Candice.

364
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,070
這才叫性感
And this is sexy.

365
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,920
有何貴幹
What?

366
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,590
大概有一千多位娛記
There was, like, a thousand paparazzi

367
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,980
想拍到我們的照片
trying to get pictures of us...

368
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,530
但廣告拍攝依舊順利
But we got the shot.

369
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,010
沒什麼能阻擋維密假日廣告
Nothing can stop a VS holiday commercial.

370
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,200
Lais非常出色
Lais is simply amazing.

371
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
她是我所認識最甜美
She's the sweetest,

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,470
最溫柔  最美麗的姑娘
most gentle, beautiful thing I've ever seen.

373
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,060
我從沒在天橋上摔倒過
I've never fallen on the runway.

374
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,540
但世事無常  一旦發生後果極其沉重
But it's, you know, it happens, and it's awful when it does.

375
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,550
參加維密秀是每個女孩的夢想
To be in this show is a dream for every girl.

376
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,010
我十分重視它
It's a big deal.

377
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,980
去年我參加了綵排
Last year, I got there to do the rehearsal.

378
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,610
但不知道怎麼回事
Then, I don't know how it happened.

379
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,530
我突然摔倒了
I just fell down.

380
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,950
我覺得我的腳踝斷了
I thought I broke my ankle.

381
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,140
恐懼感會一直縈繞在你腦海中
It's always in the back of your mind.

382
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,610
這件事真的特別可怕
It's a scary thing.

383
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,940
在綵排中扭傷腳踝
At the rehearsal,

384
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,730
然後無法參加走秀
hurt your foot, and you can't do the show?

385
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,730
這事太讓人傷心了
It was a very sad moment.

386
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,610
好了
Okay.

387
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,140
大家都嚇壞了
Everybody was freaking out

388
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,610
因為他們說
because they said it looked like

389
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,540
看上去很嚴重
her foot literally broke,

390
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,560
她的腳踝好像真的斷了
snapped from underneath her.

391
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,760
我當然特別沮喪
Of course, I was very upset.

392
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,480
我開始哭
You know, I start to cry.

393
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,260
當時的場面很沉重
It was pretty heavy.

394
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,890
第二天  我醒來
And the next day, I woke up,

395
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,990
試著站起來
and then, I tried to put my feet on the ground.

396
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,170
還是不行
No.

397
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,570
沒法走路
No way to walk.

398
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,240
我不得不穿起她的裝扮  替她走秀
I had to go out there and walk the show in her look.

399
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,420
那感覺太糟糕了
It felt really horrible.

400
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,400
穿著她的裝扮太難受了
I felt so bad putting that outfit on,

401
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,100
因為那本是她的  不該由我去展現
'cause it wasn't mine, I wasn't supposed to have it.

402
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,910
今年  我做了更充足的準備
This year, I'm more than prepared for this show.

403
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,990
Lais  出來讓我們看看吧
Okay, Lais, can we see your outfit?

404
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,000
辣妹喲
Wow! It is hot!

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,040
試衣的時候
In the fitting,

406
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,410
我告訴他們  如果我又摔倒
I told them, if I fall again,

407
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,290
我一定會撲扇著翅膀飛起來
of course I'm gonna use my wings to fly.

408
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,090
因為去年你出了意外  所以今年
Because of what happened to you last year, we wanted you to know

409
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,070
我們希望你來走這個單元的開場
that we're going to have you open the section of the show

410
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,070
叫作"天堂飛鳥"
which is called "Birds of Paradise."

411
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,700
感謝你
Thank you. Thank you.

412
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,670
抱歉
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,220
今晚我無比興奮快樂
Tonight, I'm more than excited, happy.

414
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,040
也很緊張
Nervous.

415
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,860
我希望Lais今年
I want for Lais, this year,

416
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,160
能走一場最美妙的秀
to have the most incredible show,

417
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,880
穿最熱辣的衣服
to have the most incredible outfit,

418
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,090
希望一切都如她所願
to have whatever she wants.

419
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,220
我們都會在她身後支持她
We're all gonna be behind her this year, and be, like,

420
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,380
為她歡呼
"Yeah!"

421
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,680
我一定會去後台祝賀她
I will definitely find Lais backstage.

422
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,850
希望她享受最美時刻
I want her to just have the best time.

423
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,830
上吧
Kill it.

424
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,450
Fall Out Boy登台吧
Preset Fall Out Boy, go!

425
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,440

426
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,250
? Put on your war paint ?

427
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,840
? You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down ?

428
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,320
? Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground ?

429
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,720
姑娘  上吧
Go, baby, go!

679
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,730
? When he's next to me ?

680
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,540
? And I realize ?

681
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,650

682
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,480

695
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,630
? You're drowning, you're drowning ?

696

? Now, I heard you moved on from whispers on the street ?

698
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,020
? A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be ?

699
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,720
? Now I see ?

700
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,470
? Now I see, now I see ee-ee-ee-ee?

701
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,580
? He was long gone ?

702
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,710
? When he met me ?

703
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,400

? That you never loved me ?

719
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,500
? Or her or anyone ?

720
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,140

721
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,240
