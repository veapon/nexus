1
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,463
<i>Everyone gambles.</i>

2
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,056
<i>They may call it something else,</i>

3
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,325
<i>like the stock market, or real estate.</i>

4
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,198
<i>But make no mistake.</i>

5
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,068
<i>If you're risking something,
you're gambling.</i>

6
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,507
<i>And if you're gambling...</i>

7
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:07,700
Hey.

8
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,971
<i>Then I'm the guy you want to see.</i>

9
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,512
Do you ever follow up a mistake

10
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:17,017
with another wretched mistake?

11
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,815
I hate the expression "I hear you."

12
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,585
Because what it usually means
is, "I'm ignoring you."

13
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,252
But, Professor Hornstein, I hear you.

14
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,728
It's just that I was planning

15
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:31,663
on taking my wife skiing in Vermont
on break, and now...

16
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,861
And now, the online sports book
has your money.

17
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:35,426
The poker site has some of it, too.

18
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,508
I was hoping, perhaps,
you could get it back for me.

19
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,568
I can't get you back what I don't have.

20
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:45,442
I gave you a coupon
for discounted play on the site.

21
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,210
You used it. Lost. That's it.

22
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,521
You got all the answers, don't you?

23
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,046
Of course you do.

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,684
Okay.

25
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:58,385
Professor, you ever heard
of Rush Street Capital?

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,086
- Yeah.
- I worked there.

27
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:03,563
One year away from becoming a Portfolio
Manager and a seven-figure bonus

28
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:06,532
when the meltdown happened
and the firm blew up.

29
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,763
But I learned two things from it.

30
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,134
Hard work alone
doesn't protect your downside

31
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,706
and nobody plays for free.

32
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,841
<i>What do college campuses have in common</i>

33
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,608
<i>with Las Vegas and Atlantic City?</i>

34
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,545
<i>Gambling is now so prevalent
among college students,</i>

35
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,448
<i>it's creating serious problems
with few easy answers.</i>

36
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,152
Worldwide, online gambling

37
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,780
<i>has reached epidemic proportions.</i>

38
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,791
<i>Four years ago, the big Nevada casinos</i>

39
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,827
<i>thought of online gaming
as the competition.</i>

40
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,323
<i>Now, they're realizing
that with their brand name recognition,</i>

41
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:35,694
<i>they can maybe
get a big piece of the online action.</i>

42
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,333
<i>FEMALE TV ANCHOR 1:
With access to high-stakes gambling</i>

43
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,629
<i>just a mouse click away,</i>

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,899
<i>teenagers are the latest group
to fall into the gambling web.</i>

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,564
<i>With reports of revenue in excess</i>

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,700
<i>of thirty billion dollars a year.</i>

47
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:47,343
Anyone
with access to the Internet

48
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,810
<i>can gamble away their life savings</i>

49
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,904
<i>without stepping foot out of their home.</i>

50
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:52,414
Department of Justice has indicted

51
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>the top 3 major offshore
online poker sites.</i>

52
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,619
Players are convinced that a cheater

53
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,120
<i>can somehow see his opponent's hand.</i>

54
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,288
<i>Department of Justice officials announce</i>

55
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,257
<i>that Ivan Block has become a major
target of federal investigation</i>

56
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,520
<i>and continues to operate outside</i>

57
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,790
<i>federal jurisdiction in Costa Rica.</i>

58
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:09,072
With no legal recourse whatsoever.

59
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,604
<i>At Princeton,
you're either bred for it</i>

60
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,001
<i>or you bleed for it.</i>

61
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:26,874
<i>And I can't seem to stop bleeding.</i>

62
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,510
My general concern, Mr. Farsi',

63
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:33,078
is that you are
promoting gambling on campus.

64
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,185
My more pressing concern,

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,489
the one expressed to me
by Mr. Arnaud's father

66
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:42,654
is that you are encouraging Paul to gamble.

67
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,459
You told your dad that, Paul?

68
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,325
It's his credit card.

69
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,471
The point is, Mr. Furst,

70
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:52,006
Mr. Arnaud did not send his boy
3,500 miles from home

71
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:55,202
in order to start him
on the road to perdition.

72
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,211
You are supposed to be
earning your Masters of Finance

73
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,351
and serving as
a graduate teaching assistant.

74
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:06,785
Instead, you are running
some kind of virtual casino.

75
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,958
Gambling is forbidden on campus.

76
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:12,027
Bookmaking is forbidden on campus.

77
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:14,190
And if you don't change your tune,

78
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:17,493
you're going to be
forbidden on campus as well.

79
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:23,129
Now, if you'll excuse us,
I'll finish with Mr. Furst alone.

80
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,411
Paul. Thanks, man.

81
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,741
Looked at your transcripts.
Spoke to your professors.

82
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,480
Even read some of your papers.

83
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,583
You have a real gift.

84
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:44,221
I want you to make this place proud.

85
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,930
But you've got your hands
in your fellow students' pockets.

86
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:51,260
I've never stolen anything from anyone.

87
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,534
Dean, I'm not eligible for financial aid

88
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,698
because my past income is too high.

89
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,500
But that money is basically gone.

90
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:01,543
I owe $21,000 tuition, due next week.

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,011
Sixty-grand, total, before I get my degree.
And that's if I don't eat.

92
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,706
Welcome to the real world.

93
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,110
It doesn't mean you can
live by your own rules.

94
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,447
I'm not a bookie, okay?

95
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,591
My official title is
"Affiliate for Online Gaming."

96
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,623
I steer traffic to the website,
they pay me a commission.

97
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,193
Hands off. Arm's length.

98
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,227
I get a small fee for
each player I sign up.

99
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:22,422
I'm not living some
elaborate lifestyle, here.

100
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,587
It's how I'm paying my way
through this university.

101
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:28,432
What we touch touches us, too, Mr. Furst.

102
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,130
Dean, I'm in marketing.

103
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,639
As am I.

104
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,734
And what I market is this university.

105
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:39,872
You will close up shop,
effective immediately,

106
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,685
or you won't have a school to pay for.

107
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,703
<i>The thing about
this game is you can't win</i>

108
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,166
<i>unless you're ready to risk it all.</i>

109
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,947
<i>So, there it is.</i>

110
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,317
<i>Everything I have.</i>

111
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,455
That is a lot of your bankroll in play.

112
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,789
All of it, Craigger.

113
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,556
What do you say,
we shut it down real quick?

114
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,829
It must be really nice
to have your education paid for,

115
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,164
but the rest of us
still have to grind for our Masters.

116
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,397
Is your plan just
to gamble for your tuition money?

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,507
Whoa, whoa, it's not
like I'm shooting craps

118
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,667
or playing blackjack or something.

119
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,925
You're playing poker, Richie.

120
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:43,879
I'm playing poker against fish, Craig.
It's a big difference.

121
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:47,711
And $17,000 means zero to me right now.

122
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,547
This is my shot, okay?
And statistically, it's the right play.

123
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,279
Look, I've been three-tabling.

124
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,482
I find a guy on the fourth,

125
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:56,719
who's acting like it's his life's mission
to give all his money away.

126
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,984
Hold up.
Why did you just raise?

127
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,687
Non-weighted game theory.

128
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:03,799
Because it'll outperform the EV
of flatting and he'll spaz in anyway.

129
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,196
Look. See his starting hands
and betting patterns?

130
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,530
This guy is a weak player.

131
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,172
This is the type of sucker
you find once a year, maybe.

132
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,633
Okay, what are we at?

133
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,037
- Fifty.
- Fifty. Fantastic.

134
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,974
Hey, Richie, it's me, Craig.
I'm a very good friend of yours.

135
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,410
You cracked 50? What do you say
you just pullback some of that cake?

136
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,016
Fifty doesn't get me to graduation, Craig.

137
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,585
What did I tell you?
This is the one you wait for.

138
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,312
No, no, no, you gotta be kidding me.

139
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,981
How did you know to fold?

140
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,215
We got the next one. Here we go, baby.

141
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,155
Richie, let's go. Stay in it.

142
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,862
Come on, don't bet at that. Fold!

143
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,392
Shit, how did you know to bet at that?
How did they know eight-high was good?

144
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,059
<i>If you Te a poker player,
a real poker player,</i>

145
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,568
<i>there is no such thing as luck.</i>

146
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:42,886
Richie, you got to stop, man.

147
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,649
I can't let short-term variance slow me
down. That's the sucker play.

148
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,869
This guy plays too bad for me to stop.

149
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,843
<i>If you lose over the long term,
there is a reason.</i>

150
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,539
<i>And this guy was too bad to be the reason.</i>

151
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,049
<i>He never showed his cards,
he'd just raise or fold.</i>

152
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,553
<i>Raising when I was weak,
folded when I was trapping.</i>

153
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:03,020
<i>That's not good, that's great.</i>

154
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,960
<i>And this guy wasn't great.</i>

155
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,962
<i>When you get beat straight-up,
it hurts like hell.</i>

156
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,795
<i>When you get hustled,</i>

157
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,560
<i>it's a fucking dagger in the eye.</i>

158
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,476
You were right.
See this right here?

159
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,775
This is way outside the norm.

160
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,383
I knew it. That's why I brought it to you.

161
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,500
I compared it against
thousands of players, right?

162
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,317
With at least 2,500 recorded hands.

163
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,291
Look how far outside the normal win
rates the guys who beat you are.

164
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,121
What's that, like, over a million to one?

165
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,492
Dude, it's like winning Powerball
four times in a row.

166
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,902
<i>Richie? What the hell?</i>

167
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,568
<i>Christ, I haven't seen you in what?
Four years?</i>

168
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,711
<i>I don't know, Dad.
I stopped counting.</i>

169
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,005
<i>You stopped counting, I count.</i>

170
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,780
You, uh, got a minute?

171
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,348
Oh, yeah. Come in, sit down.

172
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,850
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you okay?

173
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,352
I'm fine.

174
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,522
What do you need?

175
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,694
Have you got any connections
in Costa Rica?

176
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,626
Why? Are you going down to Costa Rica?

177
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,164
Are you gonna gamble?
Are you a chip off the old block now?

178
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,667
No, I'm not.

179
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,202
I always thought you were an action guy.

180
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:21,635
I'm not looking to gamble.

181
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:22,999
Oh.

182
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,969
Well, what then?

183
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:29,410
I was hoping you knew somebody
who could get me close to Ivan Block.

184
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,515
No. I don't know anybody like that.

185
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,984
That's out of my league. Way out.

186
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,882
He started that site,
and he had a dozen competitors.

187
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,647
I know. You're sure?

188
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,691
There's nobody
from all the years at the tables?

189
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,519
No, there's nobody.

190
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,230
All the chits are going
the other way now, son.

191
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,028
Now, wait a minute.
Where the hell are you going?

192
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:54,762
Come on. Stick around, play a little bit.

193
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,235
Here.

194
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,329
Richie. Richie,
you're not even listening to me.

195
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,608
Richie, what about finals, huh?

196
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,741
I got extensions.

197
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,385
Okay, but where are you going?

198
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,645
- Costa Rica.
- Costa Rica.

199
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,813
Did you get your shots?

200
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:12,911
Because there are monkeys there.

201
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,082
Monkeys that bite you with disease.

202
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,021
Odds are, the monkeys
will be the least of my worries.

203
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,661
Do you have any idea how crazy this is?

204
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,921
Look, Block is a businessman.

205
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,363
It's bad business to defraud your customer.

206
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:25,899
If anything, I'm doing the guy a solid.

207
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,977
"A solid."
This isn't about Block, though.

208
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,369
It's about you. You don't know how to lose.

209
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,608
- You ever heard of Meyer Lansky?
- Yes, I know Meyer Lansky.

210
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:39,681
Right. One thing he wouldn't allow
is a bent table at any of his casinos.

211
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:44,410
Every flip, every spin,
every roll of the dice had to be legit.

212
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,556
Because he understood
what gambling is about.

213
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,713
So, what's gambling all about?

214
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,359
Everybody gets a fair shot.

215
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,222
Whether you have one dollar on the line
or a million.

216
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:53,904
Let's think this through for a second.

217
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,022
You're about to jet off
to a country you've never been to,

218
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,064
with a language you do not speak,

219
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,601
bluff your way into Ivan Block's posse,

220
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,799
somehow call him out
in front of everybody he knows,

221
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,670
and you expect him
to just give you your money back and say,

222
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,275
"Oh, that's my bad, dude. My fault."

223
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,434
This school, this degree,

224
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,174
- what that means in the world...
- Mmm.

225
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:15,548
This isn't my second chance, Craig.
This is my last chance.

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,604
Welcome to Costa Rica.

227
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,545
<i>There are hundreds
of affiliates already</i>

228
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,379
<i>down here for the gaming convention.</i>

229
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,248
<i>And they run the gamut.
From the guys with all the money</i>

230
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,888
<i>to the guys trying to get some.</i>

231
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,564
Hey, hoss. If you're looking to gamble
in your hotel room later.

232
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:56,717
I'm all right, man.

233
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,051
You're Pet! I'm Richie Furst.

234
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,451
I steer players to your sites.

235
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,226
Richie. Dude.

236
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,059
- Andrew C.
- Hey, Richie F.

237
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:06,257
Nice to meet you.

238
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,564
Are you here for the expo?

239
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,964
Yeah, I'm hoping to get face to face
with Ivan Block.

240
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,096
Do you know him?

241
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,209
The man is like the Wizard of fucking Oz.

242
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,798
And no one gets behind the curtain.

243
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,971
No one.

244
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,114
All right, man. We gotta go. Take it easy.

245
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,238
Good luck.

246
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:22,114
Yeah, you too.

247
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,188
We understand you're homesick.

248
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,182
It's not that I'm homesick.

249
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,257
I'm not away at camp.

250
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,917
It's an issue of freedom.

251
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:37,725
You know what Napoleon said he missed
the most when he was in exile in Elba?

252
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:39,627
Pussy.

253
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,263
You know what he missed second?

254
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,532
Paris.

255
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:47,506
Now, myself, I don't
give a fuck about Paris.

256
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,373
And I got a whole grip of pussy down here.

257
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,674
But I can't walk down Michigan Avenue.

258
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,282
I can't walk down Broadway.

259
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,884
I can't walk down Art Rooney Avenue

260
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,011
and have a Primanti's Kolbassi and cheese.

261
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,020
You know what that's like
for a lifelong Steelers fan?

262
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,125
I can only imagine.

263
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,283
We can raise it in committee.

264
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,788
The table's ready. Who's first?

265
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,762
Okay.

266
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,935
Look, guys, we all know what's going on.

267
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:19,598
You're about to get the kind of blowjob
your wife hasn't given you in 30 years.

268
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:20,936
And that's great.

269
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,380
I want to help our vaunted leaders
let off a little steam.

270
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,614
That's why we're lucky,
because you got me down here.

271
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,453
Enjoy your massage.

272
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:23,322
Welcome, affiliates,
to the 201.7 Midnight Black Expo.

273
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:29,798
<i>Please join us poolside
for poker and blackjack.</i>

274
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:36,609
<i>Affiliates, please go to the lower deck
to redeem your vouchers.</i>

275
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:42,716
<i>Super affiliates, please meet
in the poker pavilion on the lower level.</i>

276
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,625
Five minutes. I'm just looking
for five minutes with Mr. Block.

277
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,786
And I'm looking to be
on the cover of Italian Vague

278
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,452
but it's not gonna happen for either of us.

279
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,756
It could.

280
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:55,889
Maybe for me.

281
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,226
Why don't you give me your card?

282
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,665
I'll put you on the call list.

283
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,266
<i>Oh.</i>

284
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,165
Triage this for me, best you can.

285
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,399
Great dress, by the way.

286
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:06,498
Thank you.

287
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,685
You're gonna have to like it

288
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,177
because I'm gonna be in it
for the rest of the night.

289
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,143
No time to breathe, much less to change.

290
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,213
I know. I'm buried with party requests
for tomorrow night.

291
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,176
It's going to be amazing.

292
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,286
I've just been over all
the details with Ivan.

293
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,114
Excuse me, Ms. Shafran?

294
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,622
Oh, God, I haven't been called that
since the last time I was deposed.

295
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,225
It brings back bad memories.

296
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:25,452
It's Rebecca.

297
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,027
Rebecca, I'm Richie Furst and...

298
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,562
You smell like an affiliate.

299
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,355
Not anymore.

300
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,125
But you want something.

301
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:35,401
Okay, so there's a couple of ways
I could respond to that.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,631
I could say "yes," and you walk away.

303
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,002
I could say "no,"
but then you'd know I was lying.

304
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,768
And I walk away.

305
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,907
But you haven't walked away yet.

306
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,809
Don't try to con me.

307
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,075
Just tell me straight up what you want.

308
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,916
Okay.

309
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,521
I need to come
to that party tomorrow night.

310
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,590
There. How easy was that?

311
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:47,125
Hey, you! Get down. Now.

312
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,797
All right, fellas.

313
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,532
Let's go.

314
00:18:58,202 --> 00:18:59,681
Is this the guy?

315
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,317
Okay, you got in. What do you want?

316
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,679
My name is Richie Furst.

317
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,561
I was cheated on your site, Midnight Black,

318
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,952
and I'm guessing by the look
on your face you don't even know it.

319
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,025
If I had a dollar for every bad
gambler who lost money on my site,

320
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,561
and turned around and claimed
they got cheated, I wouldn't need a site.

321
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,824
Mr. Block, I ran a multimodal
sample distribution

322
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,163
at the Plasma Physics Lab at Princeton.

323
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:19,895
These numbers are negative-S sigma.

324
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:23,131
That means they fall substantially below
the standard deviation.

325
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,372
I could have gone
to the Internet forums, chat rooms,

326
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,412
exposed the whole thing, but I didn't.

327
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,174
I brought it to you.

328
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:36,977
Well, I appreciate that.

329
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,882
Thank you very much.

330
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,316
Have a good night.

331
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,889
Sir?

332
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:06,078
Hey. Come on aboard.

333
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,677
It's not gonna make you sick, is it?

334
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,040
No, no, no. I'm fine.

335
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,107
Good.

336
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:14,350
I'm a big believer in being the person
who kills what they eat, you know?

337
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,920
The Indians had that figured out.

338
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:20,524
And not a whole hell of a lot else
until the casino racket in the mid '80s.

339
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,465
Let's try this part again. My name's Ivan.

340
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:23,623
Richie Furst.

341
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:24,893
It's a pleasure, Richie.

342
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,364
Welcome aboard.

343
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,026
<i>This is The House.</i>

344
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,079
I never in a million years
thought I'd have something like this.

345
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:33,402
Just got to the point where me
and my old partner, Alex Maynard,

346
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,884
looked in the ATM account and
realized we had so much money

347
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,937
that it was morally incumbent on us
to buy something.

348
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,275
So, we ordered a set of these boats.

349
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,215
We had a good time. A lot of fun.

350
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,313
Is he still involved?

351
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,656
No. Alex, um...

352
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,619
You know, this life has
a lot of temptation.

353
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,265
And it just gets a hold of some people.

354
00:20:57,421 --> 00:21:01,494
Alex died of a drug overdose
a little more than three years ago.

355
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:05,236
He was a good guy. He was my...

356
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,501
He was my best friend.

357
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,743
<i>Why The House?</i>

358
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,743
Because the house always wins.

359
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:15,110
Which is why we don't have to cheat people.

360
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,180
We have the greatest business model
in the world.

361
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:22,154
50,000 players, three cents a second,
average rake.

362
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,951
That's just poker, okay?

363
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:27,460
The rest of the site we're doing
$1.2 to $1.9 million a day.

364
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:31,691
That translates into $750,000
net profit per day.

365
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,601
But the math is right.
Am I missing something?

366
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:37,203
No, you didn't miss anything.

367
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:39,606
We missed something.

368
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,667
We had a couple of our programmers

369
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:45,177
who decided it would be a good idea
to write a backdoor into the code

370
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,373
so that they could see player's hole cards.

371
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,211
And they cheated you.

372
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,216
And they cheated other players.

373
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,218
And I'm really sorry and I'm embarrassed.

374
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,517
And that has nothing to do with what
this company and what this site stand for.

375
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,126
You saw it.

376
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,357
The donkeys in Compliance missed it.

377
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:01,798
This is why they're on airplanes

378
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,833
to wherever the fuck
donkeys from Compliance come from.

379
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,297
But you came to me.

380
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:07,731
You didn't tell anybody else.

381
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,394
Because you know rumors
of cheating and bullshit

382
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,471
can affect these sites like fucking bedbugs

383
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:12,909
and you can never get rid of it.

384
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,401
That took a lot of balls.

385
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,545
Honestly, I couldn't get to you
any other way.

386
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,344
Regardless, I'm very grateful.

387
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:22,746
I am nothing if not world-class
at showing my gratitude

388
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,513
so we have checked you in
to one of our company's

389
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,249
executive luxury penthouse suites

390
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,654
and your account has been credited

391
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,275
with the amount of money that you lost.

392
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,319
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

393
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:34,485
Thank you.

394
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:38,065
Just do me a favor and don't try to win
your tuition online again, okay?

395
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:39,303
How do you know about that?

396
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,196
How do you think I know?

397
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:47,066
Studying my player history,
ran it through your algorithm,

398
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,006
saw that I was playing
way above my mean.

399
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,167
No, none of that shit.

400
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:52,780
We bribed your roommate, Craig.

401
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:56,715
Look, Richie,
I understand why you did what you did.

402
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,782
I know about what happened
with that job on Wall Street.

403
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,117
You were trying to get rich,
and you were trying to be respectable.

404
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,440
And you would have,
if you had another year and a half.

405
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:05,989
Those people took your labor...

406
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,084
And my fucking money.

407
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:08,889
And your fucking money,
and they burned it all up.

408
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,057
And now you're fucked.

409
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,641
Because Wall Street's a different place.
The rules have changed.

410
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:16,461
The odds of getting a job
at a good hedge fund on Wall Street

411
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,766
are roughly the same
as hitting runner-runner flush

412
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,237
in a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.

413
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,287
You probably know what the odds of
hitting a runner-runner flush

414
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:26,781
in Texas Hold 'Em are, don't you?

415
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:28,581
Roughly four percent.

416
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,953
Roughly four percent.

417
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,616
Well, listen,

418
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:35,213
I put a little something
extra in here for your troubles.

419
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:37,417
That will get you through your Masters.

420
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,323
I think that ends our business here.

421
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:43,426
Unless, of course,
you feel like sticking around

422
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:46,090
and taking a shot at a real business.

423
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,496
Guaranteed seven figures
in the first 18 months.

424
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,274
Guaranteed eight figures
in the first three years.

425
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:55,444
I have met very few people in my career

426
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,773
who I think can be really, really
exceptional at this.

427
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,246
And you are one of those people.

428
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,181
The most important rule in the world
is that nobody gives you shit.

429
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,447
You want to do something in this
fucking life, you go out and build it.

430
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:09,750
What do you say?

431
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:13,291
Is it Newark,
or you stick around here with me?

432
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,855
What do you think?

433
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,232
I think any question that starts with.

434
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,963
"Either are you back to Jersey or"

435
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,502
the correct answer is.

436
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:32,045
<i>I was in.
And I took to it like a gambler? Son.</i>

437
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,046
<i>He gave me the full run of the place.</i>

438
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,880
<i>I started right in
tuning up the affiliate business.</i>

439
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:41,649
<i>I learned about payment processing,
off-shore banking.</i>

440
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,322
<i>He even let me bring in my own people.</i>

441
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:52,364
<i>They needed some Princeton math,
so I gave it to them.</i>

442
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:57,068
<i>Thirty billion in online gambling</i>

443
00:24:57,228 --> 00:24:59,037
<i>and I was there
to make sure we got our piece.</i>

444
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:05,146
<i>Three months went by
like a weekend in Vegas.</i>

445
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,514
<i>Suddenly I have everything I want.</i>

446
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,085
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

447
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:19,559
This is a good one to bet on.

448
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:21,754
His name is Ojo Rojo.

449
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,091
Mister Herrera.

450
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:26,664
Paid in total.
With dollars, as you wanted.

451
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,500
What was once paid in full
is now only half.

452
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,030
Next time bring 500.

453
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,572
Here we go.

454
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,401
You might find this hard to believe

455
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,379
because of how welcoming
my country can be,

456
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,882
but some of my colleagues
in the legislature

457
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,385
believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica.

458
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:49,953
Me doing damage?

459
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,354
I'm a fountain of money in this shithole.

460
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,930
I put millions into your economy.

461
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:59,129
I give employment to hundreds of people,

462
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:01,692
with better salaries than you can pay.

463
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,965
I understand, that's
exactly what I tell them.

464
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,233
But they go on and on

465
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,968
about how the gringos
and their online gaming money

466
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:14,207
attracts undesirables,
breeds prostitution, even drugs.

467
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,243
How much did I give you already?

468
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:20,812
Who knows?

469
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:29,263
If I give someone 5.7 million dollars
in three and a half years,

470
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,258
I notice it.

471
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:36,103
And in return, I expect more
than advice on a horse.

472
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,766
I want stability.

473
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:43,206
Listen to me.
You have stability and you know it.

474
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,141
We've been a democracy for over 50 years

475
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:48,476
because we don't give the people
a reason to unseat us.

476
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,347
And the people of this country
would love nothing more

477
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:54,352
than to haul an American in
as the face of corruption.

478
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:58,584
So, that's why it's gonna cost you
more money.

479
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,757
Good luck with the horse.

480
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:17,778
<i>All/had to do was make sure
the numbers added up</i>

481
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,313
<i>and maybe shave the player edge
here or there,</i>

482
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:24,681
<i>0.8 for blackjack, 0.6 for craps
and 3.4 for poker,</i>

483
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,887
<i>everybody was happy.</i>

484
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,887
- Hey.
- There he is.

485
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,317
Ivan.

486
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,521
Thanks for having me, man.

487
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:32,719
What do you think?

488
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:33,989
Uh, crazy.

489
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:36,724
It's a little over the top,
but what are you gonna do?

490
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,161
I invited your buddies, too.

491
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:39,683
I just can't catch
a fucking break.

492
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,293
What are you crying about?
You dropped three grand.

493
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,028
You'll pick it up later tonight.

494
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:44,638
It's like they want me to lose.

495
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,365
Yeah, that's why they build casinos.

496
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,568
No roll. Shooter, you can't slide the dice.

497
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:54,215
No roll? Fuck you, pay the bet.

498
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:55,305
Sir?

499
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,812
Pay the bet, you fucking greaseball.

500
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:59,377
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, man.

501
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:00,988
The stickman is just trying to do his job.

502
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,386
He fucks up again,
he's gonna have that stick up his ass.

503
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:05,823
Why don't you let me take over?

504
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,323
Ladies and gentlemen,
the point is still eight.

505
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,262
Get your hard ways in
while the dice are in the middle.

506
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,528
Oh, that's great, Zorro, work the stick.

507
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,831
Guess you don't have the stones to play.

508
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,029
How about this?

509
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:19,368
I'll fade your action.

510
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,601
Just me, or the whole table?

511
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,013
The whole tub.

512
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:26,571
Huh?

513
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,415
How about that?

514
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,312
If this goes bad, I may need some credit.

515
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:33,684
Will 30K cover it? We'll
call it an advance.

516
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,552
Hey, shooter, try to hit that back wall.

517
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,421
Believe me, she'll appreciate it.

518
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,260
What shot Jesse James? A 45.

519
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:48,328
Centerfield.

520
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:50,631
Press it. All the hard ways.

521
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:52,398
Shooter wants to press it.

522
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,000
Shooter, shooter.

523
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,579
Six, the hard way.

524
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:05,287
If he doesn't roll a seven and crap out,
this is gonna cost you 100 grand.

525
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:06,785
The house can't sweat the money.

526
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,686
Hey, shooter, do me a favor.

527
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,787
I'm thinking of a number.

528
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,027
That's the number.

529
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:19,765
Let's go.

530
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,596
Thanks for playing.

531
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:24,098
You know what?
You forgot the eternal truth.

532
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,036
The house always wins.

533
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:45,891
That was pretty impressive.

534
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,691
That was pretty lucky.

535
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,498
Thanks for backing me.

536
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,726
It was business. No thanks needed.

537
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,068
This is a single malt.

538
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:01,209
It's really good. You should try it.

539
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,004
You know, I'm more of
a pizza and beer guy myself.

540
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,875
Baked potato with cheese and baked beans.

541
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,477
And look at us now.

542
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,414
Look at you.

543
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,682
Wow.

544
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,323
You really do wear it.

545
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,337
Is this how you worked Ivan over?

546
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,489
I didn't work him over.

547
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,425
You know, part of my job

548
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:30,836
is getting close to the people
who are close to my employer.

549
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,531
So, that's it?

550
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:36,871
Just checking me out professionally.

551
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:38,911
Pretty much.

552
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:43,218
"Pretty much."

553
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,577
Good luck, sir.

554
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,479
It's the casino toss.

555
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:22,453
You know how at the casino
when they give you chips

556
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,820
they say "Good luck, sir"?

557
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,757
They don't tell you

558
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,694
that "sir" means "dummy",
and "good luck" means "fuck you".

559
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:35,937
Holy shit. Those are fucking crocodiles.

560
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,367
Yeah.

561
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:40,770
This guy wants me to invest
in a crocodile farm for their skin.

562
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,535
He sent me these as samples.

563
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,277
- Ivan...
- Mmm?

564
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:48,314
I appreciate the invite, man.
Tonight was a blast.

565
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,383
Good. You had fun.

566
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,883
You should have fun.

567
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,853
I didn't have fun, I fucking hated it.
I don't know why.

568
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:57,658
It used to be fun.

569
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:00,192
Started out, it was fun. Fuck.

570
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,523
Started out,
it was the greatest thing in the world.

571
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,029
It's like everything you ever thought

572
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,691
you wanted when you were 13 years old.

573
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,502
Listen, I got a guy,
he's coming in from London.

574
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:14,074
His name is Brett Sheck.
We call him "Shecky."

575
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,471
He's a super affiliate.

576
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:17,805
His players would represent
over 10 percent of our business.

577
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:19,142
Okay.

578
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,204
Currently, he's with these pussies
at Ultimate Bet.

579
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,685
I think you can sign him.

580
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,582
If you do, it's gonna be on for you.

581
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,063
Because you're going to commission
everything you bring in.

582
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,039
And that's when the real
exponential money starts.

583
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:34,854
And I'm excited to see you spend it.

584
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,258
You up for it?

585
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,455
I'm on it.

586
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:40,431
All right.
Good. You want to throw one?

587
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,696
What kind of question is that?
Of course I want to throw one.

588
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,908
I love those little slimy bastards.

589
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:56,648
They remind me of everybody who
wants to take a piece out of me.

590
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,591
Looks like somebody made a new friend.

591
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:14,327
- Yeah, I did.
- Well...

592
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,403
Good.

593
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,506
You want me to stay away.

594
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:21,309
No. I want you to do whatever you want.

595
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:24,009
- God knows I do.
- Hmm.

596
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,147
You certainly do.

597
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,860
Get some rest, yeah?

598
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:13,027
You called him on cheating you
and got yourself a job.

599
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,763
I think that deserves a round of applause.

600
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,761
What is this? Who the fuck are you?

601
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:20,595
If I un-cuff you, you're not gonna
do anything stupid, like run?

602
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,395
Because I'll shoot you.

603
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,736
The FBI is in the kidnapping business now?

604
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:28,935
I do whatever I want.

605
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:32,013
Man, I'm in fucking Costa Rica.

606
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,939
Look, I wanted to get you alone

607
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:37,042
and I didn't want your boss
to see us together.

608
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,209
You should be thanking me.

609
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,151
My name is Eric Shavers.

610
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,517
Don't call me "Eric."

611
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,881
Call me "Agent Shavers."

612
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,050
And you work for me now.

613
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:49,356
Can we just back up
for a fucking second here?

614
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,430
Like I said, you caught him cheating.

615
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,067
But what about...

616
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:56,166
What about bribing an official?

617
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,563
What about racketeering?

618
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:01,208
What about stealing
the player list from his former job

619
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,674
to start his new website, Midnight Black?

620
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,908
Now, there's rumblings
that he wants new territories.

621
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,549
You are gonna be my guy inside.

622
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,412
I don't know what you think I can do, man.

623
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,178
I'm an independent marketing consultant.

624
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,912
Look, don't play me for stupid!

625
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:17,286
You're too smart for that.
I'm too smart for that.

626
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:20,121
You could have worked
at any respectable place.

627
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,762
Any legitimate casino.

628
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,898
Caesars Palace. That's a nice place.

629
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,694
But you chose to sign up with Ivan Block.

630
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:28,794
I'm not even a principal
in the fucking company.

631
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,029
I can go wherever I want.

632
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:31,638
You can't go to New Jersey.

633
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:34,069
Or any place that has
reciprocal arrangements

634
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,633
with New Jersey, like New York.

635
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,575
What the fuck have
I done in New Jersey, huh?

636
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:40,076
Or New York, for that matter?

637
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,217
You're not that bright for a Princeton man.

638
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,373
It's sad.

639
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,986
I was talking to my associate, Agent Mohr,

640
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,215
and he has a sworn statement
from a Dean Monroe

641
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:52,588
that says you were
promoting gambling at Princeton.

642
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:55,456
Now, if you were my guy,
I could make it all go away.

643
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,620
Wipe the slate clean.

644
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:58,947
But if the sun comes up tomorrow
and you're still here,

645
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,229
and you're not my guy

646
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:03,264
then I pull the trigger.

647
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,273
And you can forget about working
on Wall Street or any legitimate casino.

648
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:11,708
Because you need a license for that,
and felons don't get them.

649
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:15,211
See, I can stand here
and say I'm doing it because it's my job.

650
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:17,943
Or I'm upholding the law,
blah-blah-fucking-blah.

651
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:22,488
But the truth is,
I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

652
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:24,082
Hmm?

653
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:27,219
I love fucking over Princeton guys.

654
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,625
Because I went to Rutgers.

655
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:49,250
Ivan! Hey, it's important.

656
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:52,048
- Oh!
- Ivan! I need to talk to you.

657
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,184
What's up?

658
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,085
Fuck, I'm so fucking terrible
at this game, man.

659
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:01,024
They only let me play
because I own the team.

660
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,295
I just fucking got kidnapped by the FBI.

661
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:07,163
Good.

662
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,635
Oh, that's good?

663
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,335
Oh, I knew they'd hit on you sometime,

664
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:11,770
I just didn't know what you'd do.

665
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,635
Now I do. Is it that guy Shavers?

666
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,208
Did he give you the line
about how I'm a bad guy,

667
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,436
you gotta leave town, all that shit?

668
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:17,500
Yeah, he's threatened me with jail.

669
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,478
He said I'd be barred
from re-entering the country.

670
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,812
Listen, you're not gonna go to jail, okay?

671
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:24,442
You got grabbed up by the FBI.

672
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,645
I get it. That's really fucking scary.

673
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:29,323
I was terrified
the first time it happened to me.

674
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,560
I wouldn't judge you at all

675
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:33,134
if you want to get on a plane
and just get the fuck out of here.

676
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:35,827
Just ask yourself one thing.

677
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,761
Are you doing something wrong?

678
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:38,856
Are we?

679
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,128
I make it possible for
a fat guy in Cleveland

680
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,933
to play Omaha Hi-Lo
in his underwear in his living room.

681
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,029
Shoot me.

682
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:47,335
I mean, these fucking shoe companies,

683
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,190
they pay a Chinese
eight-year-old two nickels

684
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,507
to hand-stitch these fucking things
till their fingers bleed,

685
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,605
then they sell them in the ghetto
in the United States for $250.

686
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:55,877
And I'm the fucking criminal?

687
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:58,646
Then why is this guy all over me,
huh? Why is he fucking with me?

688
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,321
Because he's jealous.
He's hating on you, that's why.

689
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:03,185
He sees what you have,
he sees what you're gonna have,

690
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:04,786
and he's plugging away in a bad suit

691
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:06,350
and heavy shoes for chump change.

692
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,291
Look, man, even if it was a crime,

693
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,058
there's nothing they could do about it

694
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,291
because they don't
have enough jurisdiction

695
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,493
to write us a fucking parking ticket
down here.

696
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:18,064
Richie, I look at you, and I see myself.

697
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:20,071
You got that same "fuck you" look
in your eye.

698
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,335
You've been beat up,
you've been knocked down,

699
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:23,738
you've been kicked around,
you've been told you weren't good enough,

700
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,540
and you have something to prove.

701
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:29,483
Now is the time to do it.

702
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:34,711
But let me know. Either way,
someone's got to deal with Shecky.

703
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:45,095
Block is a one man industry,
Shecky.

704
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:47,326
He figured out how to take online gambling

705
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,936
and make it sexy,
with the money and the women.

706
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,539
Because that's the true
crave-able experience.

707
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,232
Know what I crave?

708
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:55,570
Name it.

709
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:58,009
Thirty-three percent
rake-back on my poker players

710
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:00,375
and cost per acquisition
on my casino gamers.

711
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,182
We're at 30 percent and rev-share.

712
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,940
Well, I'm getting my terms at UB
and they're happy to have me, so,

713
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:08,613
I think I'm gonna stay where I am.

714
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,688
Tell you what, give me a day.

715
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:14,351
I'll talk to him about matching,
we'll lock this thing up.

716
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:15,757
All right, I'll give you a day.

717
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:16,923
But then I got to get home,

718
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:18,988
my wife and I
are about to have our first kid.

719
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:20,830
<i>Ah . Salad.</i>

720
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:23,200
Cheers.

721
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:27,403
Ivan.

722
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,275
- I spoke with Sheck.
- Yeah?

723
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,105
A few little things
and we're paganda blackjack.

724
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,905
What few little things?

725
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,670
He wants an extra three points rake-back

726
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:36,116
and to stay at cost per acquisition.

727
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:37,478
I know it's not the original deal,

728
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,247
but, uh, we still make a huge profit.

729
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,413
No. Fuck him.

730
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,548
If we give him that,
every piker who thinks he's an affiliate

731
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:44,489
is gonna want the same thing. No.

732
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:45,988
Then I don't think we get him.

733
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,810
Well, then I guess that's it,
you don't want the bonus.

734
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,090
You know what I mean? Pack your shit.

735
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,664
No, no, no. Ivan, wait.

736
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,095
I've got this.

737
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:54,896
Tell me how much room
I have to negotiate.

738
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,833
You have no room to negotiate.

739
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:58,563
You already tried negotiating.

740
00:39:58,728 --> 00:39:59,832
Now, you try leverage.

741
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,576
Everybody has something
they care about more than money.

742
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,643
Find out what that is.

743
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,743
Then you gotta do the hard thing.

744
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,245
That little voice
in the back of your head right now?

745
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,145
It's not your conscience.

746
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,314
It's fear.

747
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,134
Hey, man.

748
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,302
How you doing?

749
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,312
Thanks for hanging in there,
giving me the day.

750
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:43,140
How could I pass up the chance for marlin?

751
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,683
Are we good to go?

752
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,787
Just got to wait for the crew to board.

753
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,855
Who's this guy?

754
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,615
Oh, he drives the boat.

755
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,561
Here comes your crew.

756
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,630
Permission to come aboard?

757
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,638
God, I love that accent.

758
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:09,037
Permission granted.

759
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:10,969
Come on, girls.

760
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:14,678
Look, man. Eat, drink, fish.

761
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,511
Compliments of Ivan Block.

762
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,380
He's not gonna match the UB terms,

763
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,252
but we do want you to
think of us as friends

764
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:26,019
so, if you ever decide to switch,
we'll be your first call.

765
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:31,165
Have fun.

766
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,761
I'll try.

767
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:34,160
Hi.

768
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,703
Well, hi.

769
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,572
I'm a fucking idiot.

770
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:45,679
They are very good-looking.

771
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:50,415
It's my own fault.

772
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:51,950
I can't blame you, you're nothing.

773
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,412
I've got everything.

774
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,047
I've got a great wife,
a baby on the way, a business.

775
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,886
And I've got to come to Costa Rica
and act like an asshole.

776
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,690
I'm sure Block's gonna
press the terms now.

777
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:06,527
No, actually,

778
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:09,459
the terms are the same ones
we offered you.

779
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,900
Block wants you to feel great
about working with us.

780
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:14,769
Question is, where am I gonna be working?

781
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,136
You can still work in London.

782
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:22,879
Yeah, but will my checks be coming
from a Costa Rican bank,

783
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,748
or Caymans, or Malta, or somewhere else?

784
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,548
I've heard the whispers.

785
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:32,385
Block's not too popular
around these parts anymore.

786
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:34,956
One of the reasons I was gonna stay away.

787
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,594
Player list.

788
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,110
My man. You got it?

789
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,310
Got it.

790
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,647
You're a fucking genius.

791
00:42:58,808 --> 00:42:59,946
Come here, watch this.

792
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:02,612
Wilson, can you get 30 racks?

793
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:05,658
500,000 new international players. Right?

794
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:07,917
Emails, betting history.

795
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:12,260
By Sunday, 200,000 of these penguins
will be betting football on our site.

796
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,799
By the weekend, we'll
be doing nine million.

797
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,993
We'll lose some of them,

798
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,572
but luckily, we got Shecky out
there bringing them back for us,

799
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:19,801
so, we're gonna be all right.

800
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,273
And this is my thanks to you.

801
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,593
It's a little bonus to show
how much we appreciate you.

802
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,741
You're a fucking man
and you did what you had to do.

803
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:28,308
Spend it all in one place.

804
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:30,610
Knock yourself out.
Do some degenerate shit.

805
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:32,309
Do it in my car.

806
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,216
- Which one?
- Whichever one you want.

807
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:36,721
Thanks, Richie. You're a good man.

808
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:57,843
Richie. Honestly,
this is the greatest night of my life, man.

809
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,674
I can't thank you enough.

810
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,881
You don't look like
you're having any fun.

811
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:48,718
You know, we, uh, can't do this.

812
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:52,289
If you like me, what's the problem?

813
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,992
You know what the problem is.

814
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:00,840
You're right,
I should probably call you a car.

815
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:01,932
Mmm.

816
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:04,239
Immediately.

817
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,004
Get you out of here.

818
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,239
Mmm-hmm.

819
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:11,681
I think that's the best idea.

820
00:45:42,538 --> 00:45:46,714
My father described this place
as a gambler's paradise.

821
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,452
But to be honest,
I never really put too much stock

822
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:51,523
into what my father had to say, ever.

823
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:52,785
Especially about gambling.

824
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,724
Well, as a gaming professional,

825
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:57,387
that's exactly the type of customer
I want in the world.

826
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:58,827
You would love him then.

827
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:00,831
But as your friend, I'm sorry.

828
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:02,458
As my friend?

829
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:05,162
Let's just...

830
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:06,534
No. No, you're right.

831
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:08,403
Let's not get too excited, okay?

832
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:10,202
No, no, no. Too strong.

833
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:12,403
Um, wrong word. "Colleague."

834
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:13,638
Much better.

835
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:15,407
I can work with that.

836
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,516
How do you get used to all this?

837
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:19,982
Well...

838
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:22,180
There was no "all this"
when we came here.

839
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:25,087
We built it all, Ivan and I.

840
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:28,723
So, you two were together?

841
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:31,362
It was a moment. Um...

842
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:34,726
But it wasn't like this.

843
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:43,668
- Put your bags down.
- No fucking way, man.

844
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,406
I'm getting out of here
and you should do the same thing.

845
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:47,412
Come on, man.
The three amigos. You gotta stay.

846
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,538
What's up, boys?

847
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:49,708
Hey, Richie.

848
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,012
What a night, huh?

849
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:52,175
Crazy.

850
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:55,352
Yeah, fun ride, Richie. I'm out.

851
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:56,549
Out to where?

852
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,025
Out to home. I'm all the way out.

853
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,223
What are you talking about?

854
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,431
Tell him, Pet.

855
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:06,600
Just tell him.

856
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:08,934
Tell me.

857
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,106
I'm leaving my girl's hotel room
this morning when this real hard-ass,

858
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:15,174
Agent Whatever-the-fuck-his-name-is,
from the FBI,

859
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,675
rolls up on me,
tells me I'm breaking U.S. fiduciary...

860
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,006
I got braced, too.

861
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:21,239
Same guy, same speech.

862
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:22,612
You could tell him to kiss your ass.

863
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,015
He can't touch us down here.

864
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:25,449
He said some scary shit about Block.

865
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:27,681
He's a government functionary, Pet.

866
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,813
That's what they do.

867
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:31,418
Block is the biggest trophy
that Shavers could ever take down.

868
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,680
Who gives a shit what he says?

869
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,285
He told me I could be barred
from re-entering the country

870
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,489
if I didn't leave now.

871
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:38,666
So, what are you gonna do,
try and re-open your skin?

872
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:40,665
My brother owns a broker-dealer,
he offered me a job.

873
00:47:40,756 --> 00:47:41,791
Wall Street?

874
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:44,699
I'll be rich, not super-rich.
I can deal.

875
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,536
What the fuck?

876
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:50,166
What?

877
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,368
Oh.

878
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,710
I hide it in there from the maids.
They hate bran.

879
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,212
They eat everything else in the kitchen,
but they don't eat the bran.

880
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:58,181
Do me a favor. Invest it for me.

881
00:47:58,341 --> 00:47:59,684
I just don't have time to spend it
while I'm here.

882
00:47:59,842 --> 00:48:00,882
I'm in a basement all day.

883
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,386
You should come with.

884
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:05,549
No. I'm finally in the real shit,
optimizing the platform.

885
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:07,058
That's where the real money's at.

886
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:09,287
To be honest, super-rich works for me.

887
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:12,692
Richie, I understand the path you're on.

888
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,130
But you should pack it in, pal.

889
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:21,867
I can't do it, hoss.

890
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,635
My future is here.

891
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:32,174
All right, hoss.

892
00:48:33,843 --> 00:48:35,186
See you.

893
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,486
<i>- Hello.
- Young Richie!</i>

894
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:45,189
I got something I need you to do.

895
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:47,834
It's gonna be a crash course
in client relations.

896
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,028
Ivan.

897
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:50,331
Excuse me, Richie.

898
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:51,593
I'm sorry, what's the problem?

899
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:53,073
Send someone else.

900
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:55,566
Why would I do that?

901
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:58,841
You don't have any
personal feelings in this.

902
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,005
Please.

903
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:04,040
Okay, look, here's what I need you to do.

904
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:05,776
Meet Wilson at the casino.

905
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:07,851
<i>Wilson will give you a key.</i>

906
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,857
<i>You are gonna use that key
to go to the cage and open box 765.</i>

907
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:16,360
<i>You are gonna remove
the contents of that box.</i>

908
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,459
300 racks. Domestic.

909
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:22,896
<i>I want you to give what's inside
that briefcase to Mr. Herrera.</i>

910
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:26,737
<i>He's the gaming commissioner,
which makes him Caesar in this country.</i>

911
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,967
<i>Without him, we can't operate.</i>

912
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:36,315
My friend. How are you doing?

913
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,418
- Good, how are you?
- I'm really great.

914
00:49:38,574 --> 00:49:40,076
Let's make a hug.

915
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:43,985
I want you to meet a magical unicorn.

916
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,755
Very rare.

917
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,893
Would you like to partake?

918
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:50,658
I'm fine, thank you.

919
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:53,093
Okay. Come have a seat.

920
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:00,430
Sit. Sit.

921
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:02,006
Let me show you something.

922
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,166
Let's talk about the... Right?

923
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,334
It's something else.

924
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:06,741
First class.

925
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:09,282
Not coach. First class.

926
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:12,180
It's a very nice gesture. I'm good to go.

927
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:19,250
Right here!

928
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:46,979
Mmm?

929
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:56,120
Is there somebody else
coming with the rest of it?

930
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,328
The rest?

931
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:01,530
The rest.

932
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,631
No, that is the entire selection.

933
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:09,502
Well, maybe we have had
a misunderstanding.

934
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:14,171
Or perhaps your boss
is trying to send me a message.

935
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,312
Um...

936
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:25,857
I'd be happy to let him know
that you're unhappy.

937
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:29,158
Why don't I take care
of your tab for the evening, huh?

938
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,060
It'd be my pleasure.

939
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:35,567
Here. You know what?

940
00:51:42,832 --> 00:51:45,369
Thank you. It's very generous.

941
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:48,174
I will let Ivan know
about this misunderstanding.

942
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,014
Okay.

943
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:43,867
You think you can buy me

944
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:47,371
with some cheap whores
like some fucking congressman?

945
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,570
Tell your puta gringo boss
I'm sending a message.

946
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,920
Ivan!

947
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,259
Block!

948
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:10,525
Did you get in a fight
with your kid sister?

949
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:11,860
Funny guy. Where is he?

950
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,923
Richie, you were just a little
too good-looking for this racket.

951
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,024
Why did you short him?

952
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:16,398
I didn't short him.

953
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,237
It's an ongoing negotiation.

954
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,465
Then you got more than
an ongoing negotiation.

955
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:22,609
You have a fucking problem.

956
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,310
Did he take the money?

957
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:25,467
Yeah, he took it.

958
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:27,545
Then what's the fucking problem, Richie?

959
00:53:27,703 --> 00:53:29,623
I mean, it's the gambling business
in Costa Rica.

960
00:53:29,705 --> 00:53:30,877
Occasionally, you get punched in the face.

961
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,781
You let me walk right into it, Ivan.

962
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:35,548
This is your job. You understand?

963
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,791
If you want a safer job,
go work for the post office.

964
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:40,120
You want a clear conscience?
Go start a charity.

965
00:53:40,282 --> 00:53:42,660
But if you want your own fucking island

966
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:44,923
and your boss says
you gotta go out there and take a beating,

967
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,431
go out there, take it,
come back to work and say,

968
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,264
"Do you need me to do it again?"

969
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:56,308
Because right now,
lam giving you the keys to the kingdom.

970
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:58,274
How did you know
I'd even make it out of there alive?

971
00:53:58,334 --> 00:53:59,404
How did you know?

972
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,310
Because you're a winner.

973
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,147
Because I believe in you.

974
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:06,313
And you got hurt. I'm sorry.

975
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:09,615
But if I'm telling the
truth, I'd do it again.

976
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,691
What the fuck you looking at?

977
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,765
Did you see this coming?

978
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:26,098
Six months ago, Herrera wouldn't
have touched anyone I know.

979
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:29,198
And six weeks from now, that could be me.

980
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:30,844
Or it could be you.

981
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,139
We're moving up the timetable.

982
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:34,542
Okay?

983
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,588
<i>When the wrong card hits the board,
you can go from a great hand</i>

984
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:47,994
<i>to one that can't win.</i>

985
00:54:49,785 --> 00:54:51,765
<i>And if you're smart enough,</i>

986
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,069
<i>you get out while you can.</i>

987
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:14,345
Hey. What's going on?

988
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,755
What is the...

989
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,522
What the fuck?

990
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:31,865
Hello.

991
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,839
You have been selected
because of suspicion of drugs.

992
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:37,343
I don't have any drugs.

993
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:38,534
We'll see.

994
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,772
"We'll see"? I don't
have any fucking drugs!

995
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:56,158
I think the lab is going to test positive
for Mexican Brown.

996
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:57,490
That's not fucking mine.

997
00:55:57,653 --> 00:55:58,688
Tar heroin.

998
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:01,232
Come on, man. You planted that!

999
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:04,400
Pasaparte, United States, huh?

1000
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,631
You're not going to need this anymore.

1001
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,936
Oh, Richie, Richie, Richie.

1002
00:56:08,997 --> 00:56:10,533
You're making me look bad.

1003
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,670
Shavers, look, I believe you.

1004
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:15,713
Everything you said about Block
is true, okay?

1005
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,872
I'm trying to go home.

1006
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,349
You can't go home now.
Now that the fun's starting.

1007
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:20,988
Especially not without your passport.

1008
00:56:21,143 --> 00:56:22,423
And I know you can't go home now

1009
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:24,039
that the sergeant has his hands on you.

1010
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,616
He's been a bad boy.

1011
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:29,195
Now, Richie, this is what
I'm willing to do for you, man.

1012
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:31,627
So I'll talk to the sergeant
and have him wipe the slate clean.

1013
00:56:31,787 --> 00:56:33,323
You'll never know this happened.
How about that?

1014
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:34,991
You want me to do that for you, huh?

1015
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:36,397
Sergeant, can you do that?

1016
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:38,799
See that? Look at that smile on his face.

1017
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:40,474
See, that's the problem, Richie.

1018
00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:44,204
I keep fucking doing for you,
so when are you gonna do for me?

1019
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:45,709
When's it gonna be my turn?

1020
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:47,108
When's it going to be our turn?

1021
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:50,046
What are you,
the only guy here not on Block's payroll?

1022
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,688
- All right!
- Fuck, man!

1023
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,323
Why don't you just fucking arrest him?

1024
00:56:57,479 --> 00:57:00,050
You guys don't have
jurisdictional issues like the FBI!

1025
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,661
But if I walk him into a station house
or a courtroom,

1026
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:04,695
what do you think he's going to do, huh?

1027
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:07,766
He's going to buy the judge a steak dinner
and I don't have a job!

1028
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:11,769
All you got to do is help us
and all this goes away.

1029
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,736
Otherwise, you better
brush up on your prison Spanish

1030
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:15,967
because they don't take too kind

1031
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,443
to gringo drug dealers down here.

1032
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:34,056
Richie. Jesus,
where the hell you been, man?

1033
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:35,422
What the fuck happened to your face?

1034
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:37,894
Nothing. What did you want to show me?

1035
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:39,193
All right.

1036
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:41,734
So they got me running
these credit card security protocols.

1037
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,267
And I get in there, into the code,

1038
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:46,031
and I decide to freelance around
a little bit, right?

1039
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:48,937
So, I find there's nothing
in the individual players' accounts.

1040
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:50,169
What do you mean, "nothing"?

1041
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,939
Nothing. Practically drained, dude.

1042
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,579
They keep enough in there
to cover the floats.

1043
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:55,415
So if any given player wanted to cash out,

1044
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:57,665
the software would
find the money and then pay him off.

1045
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:59,218
In the meantime, Block's just using

1046
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:01,117
everybody else's funds as his own.

1047
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:02,687
Wait. So, what are you saying?

1048
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:04,565
This whole fucking thing is a Ponzi scheme.

1049
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,957
Hey, Richie!

1050
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:07,952
Block's upstairs. He wants to see you.

1051
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:09,557
All right.

1052
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:20,596
Hey.

1053
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,965
Come on in, Richie. Have a seat.

1054
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:30,143
So, Richie, here's the thing.

1055
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:34,215
People often make poor decisions
when they're desperate.

1056
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:35,442
You know what I mean?

1057
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:37,712
No.

1058
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:39,446
What do you mean?

1059
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:41,622
Let's say you're being charged by a bear.

1060
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:43,158
You're supposed to stand still.

1061
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:45,453
Most people run
and they end up getting killed.

1062
00:58:45,617 --> 00:58:47,893
It's understandable, right?

1063
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,662
Let me show you something.

1064
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:54,102
I really have Wilson to thank for this.

1065
00:58:54,259 --> 00:58:57,433
He don't look like much, but he's a dog
with a bone when he gets an assignment.

1066
00:58:57,595 --> 00:59:00,906
This is some surveillance
footage he dug up.

1067
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:10,152
Would you look at that?

1068
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:14,312
Take a few years off him and the old guy
really does look like you, doesn't he?

1069
00:59:14,479 --> 00:59:16,652
This is the Trop in AC.

1070
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,523
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say your dad was a deadbeat.

1071
00:59:23,621 --> 00:59:26,101
There isn't a casino,
a bookmaker, or shylock

1072
00:59:26,257 --> 00:59:28,294
from Vegas to New York

1073
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:31,463
that the old man isn't into
for some serious wood.

1074
00:59:31,896 --> 00:59:34,308
You owe money like that,
you get a reputation.

1075
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:36,678
That's how I knew how to find him.

1076
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:39,072
And now hopefully
we can get him some help.

1077
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:42,150
And get you some help, too.

1078
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:44,911
This is my favorite part, right here.

1079
00:59:45,076 --> 00:59:46,111
Look at this.

1080
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:49,121
That isn't just card counting,
that's passing a bobo.

1081
00:59:49,314 --> 00:59:53,023
Turns out, the old man's been kiting
counterfeit bills from Tunica to Nevada.

1082
00:59:53,584 --> 00:59:54,858
They were about to arrest him

1083
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:56,657
before I grabbed him up.

1084
00:59:56,988 --> 00:59:59,798
In fact, I have him over
at the Intercontinental Hotel,

1085
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,096
just down the street.

1086
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,599
Here's the thing, Richie.

1087
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,038
Your dad owes $187,000
to some guys that don't fuck around.

1088
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:09,777
But you're my man,
and you took some hits for me.

1089
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:11,777
And I don't forget that.

1090
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:15,512
So this is what I did. I bought the debt.

1091
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:17,509
I own the paper on your father.

1092
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,484
The only person
who can do anything to him now

1093
01:00:19,711 --> 01:00:21,156
is me.

1094
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:24,791
Which is good news, because I would
never do anything like that.

1095
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:26,986
I hold the debt, your dad stays healthy,

1096
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:29,461
and we can all go back
to exactly how it was.

1097
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:31,497
Okay?

1098
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,165
Yeah, thank you.

1099
01:00:35,326 --> 01:00:36,805
I appreciate it.

1100
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:41,972
Richie?

1101
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,637
Uh, come in.

1102
01:00:48,072 --> 01:00:49,312
Sit.

1103
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:53,087
See this?

1104
01:00:54,846 --> 01:00:57,486
What do you think?
This is where they put me.

1105
01:00:57,648 --> 01:00:58,752
It's a real soft spot, huh?

1106
01:00:58,916 --> 01:00:59,917
It's real nice, Dad.

1107
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:04,999
Yeah, it reminds me of that suite
we were comped in Atlantic City once

1108
01:01:05,156 --> 01:01:06,601
when you were a kid.

1109
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:11,269
Are you talking about the time
you left me all alone in the hotel room

1110
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:13,340
while you were at the casino?

1111
01:01:14,198 --> 01:01:15,336
Look, Rich, you know,

1112
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,709
I wish I had a time machine,
I'd go back and I'd fix everything,

1113
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:20,841
but I don't.

1114
01:01:22,006 --> 01:01:24,350
We're here now.

1115
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,116
And where do you think "here" is? Huh?

1116
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:30,549
Paradise?

1117
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:33,759
Well, you know,
it kind of looks that way to me.

1118
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:38,957
Let's go out on the balcony.
Check out the view.

1119
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,441
Look, I know where I am, all right?

1120
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:49,301
And I knew exactly what was happening
the minute my debt got bought

1121
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,276
and they offer me this trip.

1122
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:52,607
Come on.

1123
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:55,273
Been around gambling all my life,
and that would be a miracle.

1124
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,885
And miracles don't happen.

1125
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,611
So you know Block owns the debt.

1126
01:01:58,709 --> 01:01:59,744
Yeah.

1127
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,223
And I know that's worse
than any wise guys walking the boardwalk

1128
01:02:04,582 --> 01:02:07,495
because it isn't just me
that he's got under his hammer.

1129
01:02:10,154 --> 01:02:11,929
Yeah, I know.

1130
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,263
Apparently this shit runs in the family.

1131
01:02:14,425 --> 01:02:15,995
It doesn't have to.

1132
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,109
I just don't want to see you
making the same mistakes I made.

1133
01:02:21,265 --> 01:02:22,835
Going after this bullshit.

1134
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,502
Chasing the action.

1135
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:27,513
Come on, don't let them use me
to keep you here.

1136
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:29,447
Go. Run.

1137
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:31,348
Run, for Christ's sake. Just run.

1138
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:33,489
Go back. Go back to school.

1139
01:02:33,644 --> 01:02:34,816
I mean...

1140
01:02:37,815 --> 01:02:41,194
I've been a dead man walking
for the last 15 years.

1141
01:02:49,961 --> 01:02:53,033
Dad, try and sit tight.

1142
01:02:53,197 --> 01:02:55,507
I'll figure a way to get
us both out of this.

1143
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:57,668
No, no, no. Come on.

1144
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:02,784
After all these years,
you're still worrying about me?

1145
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:04,877
You're my dad.

1146
01:03:07,645 --> 01:03:09,056
That's your mother talking.

1147
01:03:11,549 --> 01:03:13,495
She raised you right, I guess.

1148
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:31,979
<i>Payoffs are haw the casino business
in Costa Rica works.</i>

1149
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:38,912
<i>It's why this government
doesn't shut Block down.</i>

1150
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:01,766
<i>Bu!' now it's time for me to buy
some goodwill of my own.</i>

1151
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,362
Yeah?

1152
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:32,430
Richie, it's me.

1153
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:35,037
<i>Agent Shavers was right about everything.
We should have left.</i>

1154
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:37,101
Shavers? You said
he didn't even approach you.

1155
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:39,628
<i>Listen, after the players' accounts,
I found something else.</i>

1156
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:41,378
<i>It's a way bigger scam than I thought.
We're screwed, man.</i>

1157
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:43,382
Cronin, slow the fuck down.

1158
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,145
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Just come see me.

1159
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:46,617
<i>I gotta show you in person.</i>

1160
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:51,125
Hey, Richie. Where you going, babe?

1161
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:52,590
- Going home.
- Yeah?

1162
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,871
Why don't you do that later?

1163
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:55,898
Come take a ride with me.

1164
01:05:05,596 --> 01:05:07,007
Wilson.

1165
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:09,267
Where are we going?

1166
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,108
Don't worry about it. Enjoy the ride, man.

1167
01:05:29,153 --> 01:05:31,463
So neither of you guys are
gonna tell me what the fuck we're doing?

1168
01:05:31,522 --> 01:05:33,024
Get off the boat. Come on.

1169
01:05:37,828 --> 01:05:39,034
Richie!

1170
01:05:39,463 --> 01:05:40,840
How you doing, bud?

1171
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:42,577
Fellas.

1172
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,872
Hey. Richie, remember, um,
that whole thing

1173
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:46,414
I was telling you about the Indians?

1174
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:50,676
Not the casino thing,
but the respecting what you kill.

1175
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:53,014
Or whatever that hokum shit was.

1176
01:05:53,577 --> 01:05:55,079
All right, here's the deal with this.

1177
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,989
The over-under is 90 seconds.

1178
01:05:58,149 --> 01:05:59,685
Bet is $10,000.

1179
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,557
Do I pay you guys enough
to jump in on 10 grand?

1180
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,164
Yeah, I take the over. How's that?

1181
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:04,425
What the fuck you talking about?

1182
01:06:04,588 --> 01:06:06,090
It's so fucking dark,
it's gonna be two minutes

1183
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,533
before they even get the fucking scent.

1184
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,763
I brought two idiots
to Latin America, Richie.

1185
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:13,272
It's like sand to the beach,
but what are you gonna do?

1186
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:14,671
What the fuck is this?

1187
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:17,442
This is where the Hio Tamales lets out.

1188
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:18,570
Ivan...

1189
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:21,840
Your problem is with me, let him go.

1190
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:24,920
Hey, Herrera,
if you hadn't acted like an asshole,

1191
01:06:25,076 --> 01:06:26,677
you wouldn't be on your knees right now.

1192
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:28,281
So don't try to be noble.

1193
01:06:28,879 --> 01:06:31,120
Basically, this place is to crocodiles

1194
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:33,694
what Goldman Sachs
is to pricks with skinny ties.

1195
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:35,922
There's just a fucking ton of them.

1196
01:06:36,087 --> 01:06:38,033
Cruise ships come down here,
they dump off their edible waste,

1197
01:06:38,189 --> 01:06:39,790
the crocs have learned to swim downriver

1198
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:41,884
and they know to bite
whatever jumps in the water.

1199
01:06:42,093 --> 01:06:43,128
This shit

1200
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:44,866
is chicken fat.

1201
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:48,567
I don't know why, but for some reason
these fuckers really like poultry.

1202
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:49,905
All right, go ahead.

1203
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:56,748
All right, ready? Ready to fire it up?

1204
01:06:56,907 --> 01:06:58,318
Wilson, keep the clock. Here we go.

1205
01:06:58,476 --> 01:06:59,614
One, two...

1206
01:07:03,714 --> 01:07:05,387
Fucking Christ, Ivan!

1207
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:08,624
Swim!

1208
01:07:09,153 --> 01:07:11,190
What do you want?!

1209
01:07:11,422 --> 01:07:13,493
You scared the shit out of them.
Can we fucking pull them back in?

1210
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:15,068
Hold on. Shh, shh.

1211
01:07:15,226 --> 01:07:16,432
Do you hear them?

1212
01:07:16,594 --> 01:07:18,471
I'm fucking talking to you, motherfucker!

1213
01:07:18,562 --> 01:07:19,597
Ivan!

1214
01:07:19,663 --> 01:07:21,165
We got fucking money on this, dude. Chill.

1215
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:23,938
You've scared the shit out of them.
Why don't you just pull them back in?

1216
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:25,381
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1217
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:26,506
Dude...

1218
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:29,014
I'm doing this for you, man.

1219
01:07:29,173 --> 01:07:30,243
80 seconds.

1220
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:31,781
Would you just pull them in?

1221
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:32,912
What do you need?

1222
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,580
10 dimes. 90 seconds.

1223
01:07:34,745 --> 01:07:35,815
Jesus Christ!

1224
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:38,426
Fucking bullshit local legend, I guess.

1225
01:07:38,649 --> 01:07:39,923
Give me the fucking thing.

1226
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:41,405
- All right, calm down.
- Fuck me.

1227
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:44,865
It's just a little fun, that's all.

1228
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:47,260
Come here. Hey, come here!

1229
01:07:48,826 --> 01:07:50,430
Oh, shit!

1230
01:07:51,762 --> 01:07:52,866
Now they fucking come!

1231
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,134
Do something!

1232
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:56,470
I got it.

1233
01:07:58,369 --> 01:07:59,507
Are you all right?

1234
01:07:59,603 --> 01:08:00,673
I'm not getting them out. You get them out.

1235
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:01,806
Pull them in.

1236
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:03,709
Holy fuck, man. Come on.

1237
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:06,313
Let's go.

1238
01:08:06,477 --> 01:08:07,683
What are the odds? I was kidding around.

1239
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:10,485
I didn't really think
crocodiles would come.

1240
01:08:10,648 --> 01:08:13,060
We just got lucky, I guess.

1241
01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:15,622
Are you all right, Richie?

1242
01:08:15,786 --> 01:08:17,546
You seem a little worked up,
a little sweaty.

1243
01:08:17,655 --> 01:08:19,726
Is it the hot night or...

1244
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,301
Are you okay?

1245
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:23,028
Yeah, I'm good.

1246
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:25,307
Okay, good.

1247
01:08:25,696 --> 01:08:26,868
Terrific.

1248
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:29,510
All right, clean them up.
Let's get them out of here.

1249
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:33,910
Good luck. Hey, how did that horse do?

1250
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:35,209
<i>Ojo Rojo.</i>

1251
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:37,811
I'm fucking with you.

1252
01:08:37,975 --> 01:08:39,175
I know this isn't a good time.

1253
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,689
All right, let's go. Let's go.

1254
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:42,522
See you soon, Richie.

1255
01:08:59,363 --> 01:09:00,740
Cronin?

1256
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:04,110
Andrew?

1257
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:06,247
Cronin.

1258
01:09:12,076 --> 01:09:13,612
Fuck, man.

1259
01:09:26,724 --> 01:09:28,465
What's happened?

1260
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:31,436
Did Block send you?

1261
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:33,802
No, he didn't send me.

1262
01:09:35,165 --> 01:09:37,236
Somethings happened to Cronin.

1263
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:39,744
He was cooperating with the Feds.

1264
01:09:39,904 --> 01:09:41,110
But you knew that already, didn't you?

1265
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:42,945
- I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1266
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:44,611
Let me ask you a question.

1267
01:09:44,775 --> 01:09:46,455
When I talk to you, am I talking to Block?

1268
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,581
- Not anymore.
- I wish I could believe that.

1269
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:49,816
You can. You can trust...

1270
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,186
No, I can't trust you.

1271
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:52,349
I did trust you!

1272
01:09:52,516 --> 01:09:53,824
I didn't know that he was going to use you.

1273
01:09:53,984 --> 01:09:56,328
Stop fucking lying to me!

1274
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:01,800
Ivan is set to pull out
of this place in a week.

1275
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:03,461
We're moving to Antigua.

1276
01:10:03,627 --> 01:10:04,662
And?

1277
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,436
And he's looking
to hang things on someone.

1278
01:10:07,498 --> 01:10:08,670
A mark.

1279
01:10:10,134 --> 01:10:11,306
Me.

1280
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:14,505
And when he's gone,
all of those people that we've crossed,

1281
01:10:14,672 --> 01:10:16,481
they're gonna come looking for you.

1282
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:18,953
How long have you known this?

1283
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:20,549
I started wondering after two years.

1284
01:10:20,678 --> 01:10:22,089
By the third year,
when we left the Caymans,

1285
01:10:22,246 --> 01:10:23,816
I knew for sure that he was stealing.

1286
01:10:23,981 --> 01:10:26,120
But by that point I was too far in.

1287
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:28,627
I'd signed a contract,
there was a paper trail.

1288
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:30,788
That's what Ivan does to you.

1289
01:10:32,756 --> 01:10:35,430
He figures out exactly what you want

1290
01:10:35,793 --> 01:10:37,830
and he gives it to you.

1291
01:10:41,432 --> 01:10:43,036
I'm sorry.

1292
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,677
I hope so.

1293
01:10:48,806 --> 01:10:50,877
Because what I have to do

1294
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:53,351
to get out of this,

1295
01:10:54,044 --> 01:10:55,717
I can't do it alone.

1296
01:11:07,658 --> 01:11:10,696
<i>The payoff merry-go-roun
has to keep spinning.</i>

1297
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:13,839
<i>And I need operating cash
to buy my way out.</i>

1298
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:17,138
<i>So it's less for them and more for me.</i>

1299
01:11:18,002 --> 01:11:21,472
<i>I'm just hoping I'll Be gone
before the hammer comes down.</i>

1300
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:54,508
Boys.

1301
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,176
Gotta love this country.

1302
01:11:57,675 --> 01:12:00,781
Yesterday you wanted to kill me
and today we're like brothers.

1303
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:03,588
We are not fucking brothers.

1304
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:06,254
I need to talk to Herrera.

1305
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:11,295
He's gone, he left the
country early this morning.

1306
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:16,871
Then we need to talk.

1307
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:19,737
Esteban?

1308
01:12:20,464 --> 01:12:21,807
Esteban!

1309
01:12:35,446 --> 01:12:36,447
Where is he?

1310
01:12:48,325 --> 01:12:52,467
I put together a savings account
for this guy, El Capitan.

1311
01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:56,425
<i>Yeah, that's his real name.</i>

1312
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,241
Is this gonna work?

1313
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,906
I guess we'll see.

1314
01:13:49,286 --> 01:13:52,460
Where the fuck is Cronin?

1315
01:13:52,656 --> 01:13:54,656
You tell me.
I thought he was working for you guys.

1316
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,364
You don't understand cooperation, do you?

1317
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:58,006
You're supposed
to keep me posted on Block.

1318
01:13:58,162 --> 01:13:59,732
- Circumstances have changed.
- What's changed?

1319
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:01,240
Block has my father.

1320
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:03,002
Well, if you had told us,
we could have kept him safe.

1321
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,078
But you didn't. So where
the hell is Cronin?

1322
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:06,236
I'm on the phone with him

1323
01:14:06,403 --> 01:14:07,882
and the next thing I know
he fucking disappears!

1324
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:09,006
Shit.

1325
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,581
You know what?
You guys are so full of shit.

1326
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,585
You blackmail me!
You beat the shit out of me!

1327
01:14:13,744 --> 01:14:16,088
You say you can protect me,
protect my father.

1328
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:18,087
You can't even protect
the only source you had!

1329
01:14:18,182 --> 01:14:19,743
Fuck both of you. I'm done.

1330
01:14:21,718 --> 01:14:24,221
You're going to fucking help us!
You understand me?

1331
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:25,560
I'm not doing shit!

1332
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,065
You want to arrest me? Fucking arrest me!

1333
01:14:27,224 --> 01:14:29,067
I'll fucking kill you! I don't give a shit!

1334
01:14:29,226 --> 01:14:31,228
All right, let him up!

1335
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:34,809
We went about this all wrong.
I'm sorry, are you okay?

1336
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:36,106
I'm sorry.

1337
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,341
But I don't have time
to fucking play with you.

1338
01:14:38,836 --> 01:14:40,406
Take a picture with me.

1339
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:42,175
<i>Happy smile, gringo.</i>

1340
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:43,340
Here we go.

1341
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:44,780
Good.

1342
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,378
Now you have 48 hours
to get me what I need on Block.

1343
01:14:47,578 --> 01:14:50,388
A piece of evidence
that will hold up in court.

1344
01:14:50,547 --> 01:14:54,586
If you don't, he gets that picture
and your life goes to shit.

1345
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,122
Let's go.

1346
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,636
Come on, Cronin,
what the fuck did you do with it?

1347
01:15:34,258 --> 01:15:36,135
<i>Cronin really got his nose in it.</i>

1348
01:15:36,293 --> 01:15:39,206
<i>Layers and layers of financial crimes.</i>

1349
01:15:39,363 --> 01:15:41,969
<i>Block using player accounts
as his own piggy bank.</i>

1350
01:15:42,532 --> 01:15:47,140
<i>Laundering money and, of course,
Block's contingency plan.</i>

1351
01:15:47,671 --> 01:15:49,378
<i>Me.</i>

1352
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:50,677
Oh, my God.

1353
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:53,913
<i>There's enough evidence on here
to put Block or me</i>

1354
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:56,522
<i>away for along time.</i>

1355
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,528
Have you been booking travel?

1356
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:03,164
I have.

1357
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,163
I put everything I have into it.

1358
01:16:05,322 --> 01:16:06,596
Planes aren't cheap.

1359
01:16:06,757 --> 01:16:07,997
Thank you.

1360
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:10,998
Block has been siphoning
the player account money

1361
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:15,041
and directly routing it to bank accounts
with my name on them.

1362
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:17,838
But when this goes public
it's going to look like I own them.

1363
01:16:18,101 --> 01:16:21,014
All the bank account info,
the missing money, everything.

1364
01:16:22,105 --> 01:16:24,244
Ivan's told me to pack.

1365
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:26,217
We leave in 48 hours.

1366
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,686
Everything's ready in Antigua.

1367
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,126
You know I'm with you.

1368
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:36,762
New love.

1369
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:38,826
What are you doing?

1370
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:41,335
Uh, you know, I was just leaving.

1371
01:16:41,491 --> 01:16:43,334
I was gonna go make the rounds.

1372
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:12,462
<i>One last payoff to El Capitan.</i>

1373
01:17:12,622 --> 01:17:17,401
<i>This isn't poker, this is my life.
And I have one play left.</i>

1374
01:17:17,728 --> 01:17:21,141
<i>Push all my chips in
and hope to get lucky.</i>

1375
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:23,875
Did you bring something for me?

1376
01:17:25,736 --> 01:17:27,340
I am a man of my word.

1377
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:29,611
Very good. I'm also a man of my word.

1378
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:42,111
Hey, where you going?

1379
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:44,833
You know, for being such a smart kid,

1380
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:47,596
you make some dumb fucking moves,
you know that?

1381
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,019
You don't think I know who that guy is?

1382
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,938
Where he works, what he does? Hmm?

1383
01:17:53,096 --> 01:17:55,406
You don't think I know
what you're trying to do?

1384
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,874
You're done, Richie.

1385
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:00,413
I think you should just walk outside
and get in my car.

1386
01:18:00,637 --> 01:18:02,913
There's gotta be some kind of deal
you and I can make.

1387
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:05,053
Thank you, Richie,
but I'm well taken care of.

1388
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:07,552
I think you should
stop embarrassing yourself,

1389
01:18:07,711 --> 01:18:11,249
walk outside,
and get in the motherfucking car, man.

1390
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:18,762
You don't think I'm taken care of, too?

1391
01:18:35,138 --> 01:18:36,173
<i>Richie Furst.</i>

1392
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:37,274
Shavers.

1393
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,547
<i>We found Cronin beat half to death,
but he's alive.</i>

1394
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:40,815
Thank God.

1395
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:42,754
Where are you?
Are you bringing me evidence?

1396
01:18:42,913 --> 01:18:45,086
No. I'm bringing you something better.

1397
01:18:46,216 --> 01:18:47,616
<i>Block tin? Ed it perfectly.</i>

1398
01:18:48,452 --> 01:18:50,056
<i>He's out the door
by the time the bribes stopped</i>

1399
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,325
<i>and the police took everything down.</i>

1400
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:27,404
Yeah?

1401
01:19:27,424 --> 01:19:29,461
Hey, Richie. Where are you?

1402
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:31,928
At the office.

1403
01:19:32,362 --> 01:19:34,672
Ivan, what the hell is going on?
The site's been frozen.

1404
01:19:34,764 --> 01:19:36,764
<i>Listen, Richie, you're about to
get arrested, okay?</i>

1405
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,144
<i>I'd love to tell you that I was gonna come
down to the police station</i>

1406
01:19:39,202 --> 01:19:41,443
<i>and bail you out
but we both know that's not true.</i>

1407
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:42,882
Sorry it worked out this way.

1408
01:19:42,939 --> 01:19:45,283
I like you, you're a good kid.

1409
01:19:45,342 --> 01:19:46,980
But it is what it is.

1410
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:48,886
<i>Sorry, pal. Bye.</i>

1411
01:19:51,114 --> 01:19:52,957
- You all right?
- Yeah, set.

1412
01:19:53,116 --> 01:19:55,494
You'll find another boyfriend
when we land at the next stop.

1413
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:57,529
Younger and dumber next time.

1414
01:19:57,687 --> 01:19:58,791
Dumber won't be easy.

1415
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:12,008
Where the fuck is Wilson?

1416
01:20:12,169 --> 01:20:13,512
I haven't seen him.

1417
01:20:40,397 --> 01:20:42,104
Let's go. He'll have to fend for himself.

1418
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:07,933
Do you mind? Sun.

1419
01:21:11,261 --> 01:21:13,138
I love new beginnings.

1420
01:21:13,463 --> 01:21:15,136
Any new industry, the first 10 years,

1421
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:17,041
it's like Russia after Communism.

1422
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,271
It's all strength and will.

1423
01:21:19,703 --> 01:21:22,775
And now, it's time
for a little nuance and finesse.

1424
01:21:38,622 --> 01:21:41,159
<i>Every player has a leak in his game.</i>

1425
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:42,894
<i>Even Black.</i>

1426
01:21:43,059 --> 01:21:44,629
<i>All you have to do is find it.</i>

1427
01:21:44,794 --> 01:21:47,934
You really saw me coming,
didn't you?

1428
01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:52,971
The cars, the boats, the money, everything.

1429
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:57,008
You handpicked me,
and you slow-played it perfectly.

1430
01:22:00,343 --> 01:22:02,323
What did you expect me to do, Richie?

1431
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:03,516
Walk into my party,

1432
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:05,251
accuse me of cheating
in front of all my friends.

1433
01:22:05,315 --> 01:22:06,658
I can't let that go by.

1434
01:22:07,183 --> 01:22:08,321
That's the problem with your generation.

1435
01:22:08,418 --> 01:22:09,954
You guys sat around
with your vintage T-shirts

1436
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,294
and your participation medals

1437
01:22:11,354 --> 01:22:12,958
and you never did anything.

1438
01:22:13,123 --> 01:22:15,535
And you got too big and too greedy.

1439
01:22:17,127 --> 01:22:19,835
Okay. What are you gonna do about it?

1440
01:22:19,996 --> 01:22:22,203
You don't think I own this place, too?

1441
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,776
And where exactly do you think this is?

1442
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:36,354
<i>Bien venidos a Puerta Rica, Ivan!</i>

1443
01:22:36,646 --> 01:22:40,219
Territory of the United States of America.

1444
01:22:46,723 --> 01:22:49,226
<i>The Captain, a man of his word.</i>

1445
01:22:51,294 --> 01:22:53,137
I knew deep down you were just homesick.

1446
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,337
You know what
your biggest problem is, Ivan?

1447
01:22:59,502 --> 01:23:02,711
You talk and you talk,
but you don't actually hear yourself.

1448
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:03,876
Well, I did.

1449
01:23:04,574 --> 01:23:08,147
And you're just like every other
gambler who comes onto your site.

1450
01:23:08,311 --> 01:23:12,350
You press it, when you should have
folded and moved on.

1451
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:17,726
Later on, when you're in prison,

1452
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:20,927
that voice you'll be hearing in your head

1453
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:23,196
isn't your conscience,

1454
01:23:23,259 --> 01:23:24,863
it's fear.

1455
01:23:24,928 --> 01:23:28,000
Ivan Block,
you're under arrest, my friend.

1456
01:23:28,064 --> 01:23:29,236
How's it going, fellas?

1457
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:30,402
Better than you.

1458
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,220
Money laundering, racketeering, wire fraud.

1459
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,611
Look under your feet.
That's American concrete.

1460
01:23:35,705 --> 01:23:38,185
Kiss it, because you'll be sleeping on it
for a long time.

1461
01:23:38,241 --> 01:23:39,345
We'll see.

1462
01:23:39,409 --> 01:23:42,856
That's the great thing about America,
we go soft on financial crime.

1463
01:23:43,012 --> 01:23:46,118
Maybe eight months on a farm,
something like that.

1464
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,853
Maybe I'll see you around, Richie.

1465
01:23:49,386 --> 01:23:50,865
Good luck, sir.

1466
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:52,895
Get this piece of shit in the car.

1467
01:23:52,956 --> 01:23:54,060
What about him?

1468
01:23:54,124 --> 01:23:55,728
Him? He's a cooperator.

1469
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:57,066
Yeah, don't worry about him.

1470
01:23:57,127 --> 01:23:59,437
Think about him banging your girl
while you're in jail.

1471
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:00,769
Now, here's the good part.

1472
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:02,866
You have the right to remain silent.

1473
01:24:02,932 --> 01:24:06,209
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1474
01:24:06,269 --> 01:24:08,408
You have the right to an attorney.

1475
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:10,747
If you cannot afford an attorney,

1476
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:13,913
a really fucked-up one
will be provided for you.

1477
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,596
Listen, I want you to get Richie Furst.

1478
01:24:24,654 --> 01:24:26,964
I want to start this debriefing ASAP.

1479
01:24:29,459 --> 01:24:30,904
You don't think he's on that plane?

1480
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,303
You got to be kidding me.

1481
01:24:32,462 --> 01:24:33,668
Go with the ground crew!

1482
01:24:35,098 --> 01:24:36,975
Hey! Somebody stop that plane!

1483
01:24:37,133 --> 01:24:38,669
We had a deal!

1484
01:24:44,974 --> 01:24:46,317
Shit!

1485
01:24:47,677 --> 01:24:49,623
- Agent Shavers?
- Yeah?

1486
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:50,953
I have something for you.

1487
01:24:51,014 --> 01:24:52,186
Thank you.

1488
01:25:14,604 --> 01:25:16,140
He's a free man.

1489
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:18,546
Let's go!

1490
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:21,514
<i>What would you do?</i>

1491
01:25:21,678 --> 01:25:24,158
<i>Back to Jersey, or...</i>

1492
01:25:24,314 --> 01:25:26,590
I've never even been on a private plane
before today.

1493
01:25:28,117 --> 01:25:30,427
You get used to it pretty quickly.

1494
01:25:31,087 --> 01:25:32,293
<i>Maybe I already have.</i>
