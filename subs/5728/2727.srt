1
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,140
Hey.

2
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,150
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

3
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,440
If you want any tickets,

4
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,610
you'll have to go around,

5
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,910
uh, to, uh, the front of the,

6
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,940
uh...

7
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,080
Oh, well, I suppose
it'll be all right.

8
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
What the hell am I
doing around here?

9
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,620
They walk in here and do
as they damn please.

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,790
Uh, let's see, uh,
I hope I got...

11
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,390
Three?

12
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,510
That'll be seven dollars...

13
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,920
...and 50 cents.

14
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,820
Shh!

15
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,900
Are you Frank?

16
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,750
Frank sent us.

17
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,240
Did you bring a horse for me?

18
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,460
Well...

19
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,650
Looks like we're...

20
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,500
Looks like we're shy one horse.

21
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,700
You brought two too many.

22
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,820
Hey, Pa! Look!

23
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,340
That's enough for now.

24
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,140
It's getting late,
come on home.

25
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,210
Boo!

26
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,050
Timmy.

27
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,670
Maureen, look.

28
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,380
Mm.

29
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,850
Ah!

30
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,410
Whatcha doin' there?

31
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,080
Go inside, quick,
and get washed.

32
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,520
And don't touch the
apple pie or the roast.

33
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,960
Patrick's already
left for the station, huh?

34
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,290
Oh, he's getting ready, Pa.

35
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,520
Damn it, Patrick!

36
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,550
Coming, Pa.

37
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,330
Well...

38
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,300
not bad, I'd say.

39
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,660
Bigger them slices,
what the hell.

40
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,230
We're throwing
a party, ain't we?

41
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,040
But these are the same
slices as usual.

42
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,610
Yeah, sure.

43
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,850
As usual.

44
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,590
Maureen...

45
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,050
soon you can cut the bread

46
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,550
in slices as big as a door
if you want to.

47
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,230
You'll have beautiful
new clothes,

48
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,130
and you won't have
to work no more.

49
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,130
We going to get rich, Pa?

50
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,570
Who knows?

51
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,940
Patrick!

52
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,570
Wait a minute.

53
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,650
Look at the filth on your boots.

54
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,740
Clean 'em.

55
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,780
The train'll come in

56
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,730
and there won't be no
one to meet your mother.

57
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,200
Our mother died six years ago.

58
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,070
Go now.
You'll really be late.

59
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,570
Hey, just a minute. Listen, Pa.

60
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,380
How am I gonna recognize her?

61
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,480
Well, you can't make
no mistake, Patrick.

62
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,680
She's, uh, she's young

63
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,250
and, uh, she's, uh, pretty,

64
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,620
and, uh, uh...

65
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,960
she's a lady.

66
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,260
Uh, uh...

67
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,820
"For... For-For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

68
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,130
"and the, and the same, uh,

69
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,200
straw hat I was wearing...
when we met."

70
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,010
Uh, uh... I'm going to get
some fresh water from the well.

71
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,650
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are callin'...

72
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,640
And all the roses fall...

73
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,350
Maureen!

74
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,510
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

75
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,890
Now that you've
called me by name...

76
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,630
Howdy, George!

77
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,840
Right on time, huh?

78
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,020
That's beyond them tracks.

79
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,990
I saw some mighty
fine stock down South.

80
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,330
Is that so?

81
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,860
And the prices are real good.

82
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,840
Are these your valises, ma'am?

83
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,940
Yes.

84
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,950
Come, Sam.

85
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,170
Bring them over to her, Race.

86
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,310
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

87
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,650
What have you got?

88
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,670
That true,
the sawmill needs hands?

89
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,970
Was yesterday.

90
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,370
Why don't you tell your brother?

91
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,500
Hiya, Gramps.

92
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,100
Hi, Bill.
We're back again.

93
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,700
Come on. Get a move on,
will ya?

94
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,310
Ha! Ha!

95
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,580
Get the lead out of your asses,
you red-skinned warriors.

96
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,920
I got a whole train
to unload.

97
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,080
All right.

98
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,090
Shut down those
feed sacks first.

99
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,250
Come on.

100
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,390
Come on.

101
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,340
What's your name, and the place
you wanted to go?

102
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,650
Sweetwater.

103
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,780
Hmm?

104
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,620
Brett McBain's farm.

105
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,520
McBain.

106
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,690
Yeah, sure.

107
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,790
That stubborn,
redheaded Irishman,

108
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,800
killing sand for years
way out there

109
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,630
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,540
Sweetwater.

111
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,560
Only a loony like him
could call that stinkin'

112
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,230
piece of desert "Sweetwater."

113
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,940
Sweetwater!

114
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,580
Hiya!

115
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,550
Sweetwater.

116
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,260
That's right...

117
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,260
a little more to the right.

118
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,460
Higher, higher.

119
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,330
Hold it there.

120
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,140
Here they are.

121
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,270
They got here
with their damn rails.

122
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,370
They caught up with us again,
hey, Lafayette?

123
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,810
Let's go!

124
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,580
- Right over.
- Hey, slow down.

125
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,780
What's the matter with you?
Slow down!

126
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,840
Hey, boys, watch out...

127
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,280
Watch out down there!

128
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,110
Slow down!

129
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,650
Ho!

130
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,450
Why are we stopping?

131
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,010
I told you I was in a hurry.

132
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,320
Don't the train stop?

133
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,360
Yeah.

134
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,360
What can I do for you, ma'am?

135
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,950
I would like some water,

136
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,120
if it's no trouble.

137
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,260
Water?!

138
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,730
Well, you see,
that word is poison

139
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,930
around these parts

140
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,130
ever since the days
of the great flood.

141
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,640
You mean you never wash?

142
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,140
We sure do.

143
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,140
Well, I'd like
to use the same facilities

144
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,300
you people do.

145
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,640
You sure can.

146
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,150
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

147
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,340
And you're lucky.

148
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,620
Only three people have
used it this morning.

149
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,480
Used it one at a time
or all together?

150
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,750
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

151
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,790
Bet you come
from one of those big

152
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,090
eastern cities.

153
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,760
New Orleans.

154
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,930
New Orleans?!

155
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,160
You've been there?

156
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,460
No.

157
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,730
But I got a cousin down there.

158
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,830
She runs a bar.

159
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,370
You know she...

160
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,350
Oh!

161
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,580
Oh.

162
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,430
Jug.

163
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,490
Do you only know how to play,

164
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,890
or do you know how to shoot?

165
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,620
You know how
to blow music from that?

166
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,680
Pick it up.

167
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,600
You!

168
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,550
You don't know how to play.

169
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,580
Try this one.

170
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,090
Take it.

171
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,280
Go on.

172
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,280
Here.

173
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,760
Bravo.

174
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,040
Huh.

175
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,150
Cheyenne.

176
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,460
We thought we'd never make it.

177
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,550
It's all right.

178
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,190
You're right on time.

179
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,760
To bury my escort.

180
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,900
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

181
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,680
Hey.

182
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,090
The gun.

183
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,850
You, uh, interested
in fashions, Harmonica?

184
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,100
I saw three of these
dusters a short time ago.

185
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,720
They were waitin' for a train.

186
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,200
Inside the dusters
there were three men.

187
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,150
So?

188
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,780
Inside the men
there were three bullets.

189
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,750
That's a crazy story,

190
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,320
Harmonica.

191
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,030
For two reasons.

192
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,970
One... nobody around
these parts

193
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,230
got the guts to wear
those dusters,

194
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,760
except Cheyenne's men.

195
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,970
Two... Cheyenne's men
don't get killed.

196
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,380
That surprise you?

197
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,410
Yeah.

198
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,720
Well, you know music...

199
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,750
Hmm.

200
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,320
And you can count...

201
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,620
all the way up to two.

202
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,540
All the way up to six
if I have to.

203
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,970
And maybe faster than you.

204
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah, go on.

205
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,730
Play, Harmonica.

206
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,700
Play, so you can't bullshit.

207
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,960
Only watch those false notes.

208
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,570
Like so?

209
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,560
And so this cousin
of mine keeps writing me

210
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,790
to come on down to New Orleans.

211
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,660
"Come on down,
help me with the bar.

212
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,790
Make a pile of money."

213
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,700
You know, I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

214
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,220
It's too full of fast men

215
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,670
and loose women...
beggin' your pardon, ma'am.

216
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,030
Oh, no.

217
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:48,200
Now I'm too used to a quiet,
simple country life.

218
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,080
He's Timmy.

219
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,590
Yes.

220
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,750
Dear God.

221
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,780
On the day...

222
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,090
On the very day
of your wedding.

223
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,690
Poor little miss.

224
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,230
Missus.

225
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,540
Mrs. McBain.

226
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,540
But we all...

227
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, but we thought...

228
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,870
I know.

229
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,870
It was to be a surprise today.

230
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,720
Brett McBain and I were married

231
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,220
a month ago...

232
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,250
in New Orleans.

233
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,240
I am the resurrection
and the life:

234
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,570
He that believeth in me,

235
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,580
though he were dead,
yet shall he live:

236
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,270
Whosoever liveth
and believeth in me

237
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,750
shall never die.

238
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,310
Amen.

239
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,530
Mr. Bennett!

240
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,660
What's he doing here?

241
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,630
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

242
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,550
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good

243
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,550
as a signature.

244
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,950
Cheyenne's hand.

245
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,950
But why?

246
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,110
Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

247
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,680
We'll make him tell us
before we hang him.

248
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,160
Let's get movin'.

249
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,810
Come on.

250
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,780
Let's go back to Flagstone.

251
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,410
No, Sam.

252
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,920
You go back.

253
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,390
You don't want to
stay out here alone.

254
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,260
Why not?

255
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,290
This is my home.

256
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,190
You know, Wobbles...

257
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,820
...I¡¯m kind of mad at you.

258
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,590
Frank wasn't there.

259
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,560
- Ow!
- He sent three friends.

260
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,400
I don't know nothin', I swear.

261
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,000
I only arranged
the meeting the way...

262
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,570
the way you wanted it.

263
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,410
I don't know why
Frank wasn't there.

264
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,210
I swear to you that I...

265
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,910
'Cause he was at the McBains'.

266
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,750
That's not true.

267
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,850
Cheyenne did that job...
everyone knows that.

268
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,410
We got proof.

269
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,390
That was always
one of Frank's tricks:

270
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,490
Fakin' evidence.

271
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,020
I don't know. I swear.

272
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,630
I-I only arranged the meeting.

273
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,660
I swear I don't know nothin'.

274
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,550
Who's there?

275
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,530
Did you make coffee?

276
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:27,030
Make it.

277
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,710
Didn't sleep a wink.

278
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,720
Pack of turds dressed in black

279
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:42,210
rode herd on me
the whole damn night.

280
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:46,050
Yeah, but I left 'em
in the middle of the desert.

281
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,960
They're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

282
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,080
I'll do it...

283
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:13,110
and you fix the coffee.

284
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,420
They want to hang me...

285
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,420
the big black crows.

286
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,760
Idiots.

287
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,590
What the hell?

288
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,260
I'll kill anything...

289
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,430
never a kid.

290
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,270
Be like killin' a priest.

291
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,200
A Catholic priest, that is.

292
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,370
Yeah, the world
is full of people

293
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,170
who hate Cheyenne.

294
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,390
You see, I ain't
the mean bastard

295
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,420
people make out.

296
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:06,060
Of course, uh...

297
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,860
if somebody had in mind
to kill me...

298
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,600
it fires me up...

299
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,710
and a fired-up Cheyenne...

300
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,070
...ain't a nice thing to see,

301
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,740
especially for a lady.

302
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:40,060
But you're too smart
to make him mad.

303
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,900
So this here's where I was
supposed to do

304
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,410
all the killin', hmm?

305
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,710
Hmm.

306
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,580
Don't seem the place
is worth a shit.

307
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:07,420
Now... if somebody gets
dressed up to look like me...

308
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:14,730
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

309
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,730
I don't like it none,

310
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,760
but I can understand it.

311
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,410
Hmm. What I don't understand

312
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,040
is the why.

313
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,640
Neither do I.

314
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:40,550
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

315
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,990
Yeah.

316
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,700
What if there were
a whole heap of whys...

317
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,870
round, yellow...

318
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,370
you know the kind.

319
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,380
You rap 'em on a stone,

320
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,880
and they go ding.

321
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,580
Maybe...

322
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,150
but I didn't find them.

323
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,910
Hmm.

324
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,720
By the way,

325
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,060
do you know anything

326
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,000
about a man going around
playing a harmonica?

327
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,830
He's somebody you'd remember.

328
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,670
Instead of talkin', he plays...

329
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:40,770
and when he'd better play,
he talks.

330
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,350
You know, ma'am,
when you've killed four,

331
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,250
it's easy to make it five.

332
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,190
Sure.

333
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,390
You're an expert.

334
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,800
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

335
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:10,370
Of course I have.

336
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:14,370
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money,

337
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,710
and if you want to,
you can lay me over the table

338
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,040
and amuse yourself,
and even call in

339
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,380
your men. Well...

340
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,220
no woman ever died from that.

341
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,050
When you're finished,
all I'll need

342
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,720
will be a tub of boiling water,

343
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,720
and I'll be exactly
what I was before

344
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,390
with just another
filthy memory.

345
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:52,880
You make good coffee, at least?

346
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,850
Not bad.

347
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,680
Congratulations.

348
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,510
Tell me,

349
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,850
was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

350
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,410
I only told you to scare them!

351
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,420
People scare better
when they're dyin'.

352
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,690
Then can you tell me

353
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:12,030
what good
was your stupid massacre?

354
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,360
Now a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

355
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,090
So, I didn't expect that.

356
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,700
It happens in business.

357
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,300
Let's say this is...

358
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,600
something we didn't plan on.

359
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,050
I have no time
for surprises, Frank.

360
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,880
You know that.

361
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,150
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

362
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:39,650
and before my eyes rot,

363
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,490
I want to see the blue
of the Pacific

364
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,320
outside that window.

365
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,560
I know where you got on board.

366
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,330
I was there, too, remember?

367
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,070
To, um...

368
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,340
...remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

369
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,210
Well, there were a few...

370
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,510
...but we traveled a long way
just the same,

371
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,080
and fast.

372
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,610
Even tuberculosis of the bones

373
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,650
travels fast.

374
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:23,360
Don't play the sick man
with me, Mr. Morton.

375
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,390
I knew you when you were
just barely limping.

376
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,230
I watched that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

377
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,740
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain,

378
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,650
but you... you just...
got a little more hasty.

379
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,810
Otherwise,
you ain't changed any.

380
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,150
I'd say you've changed, Frank...

381
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,320
a lot.

382
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,020
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

383
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,660
Now...

384
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,490
you're keeping
in the background.

385
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:04,990
You'll end up giving orders.

386
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,030
It's because now I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

387
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,010
You're going to need somebody
more and more every day

388
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,140
to stay near you...

389
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:18,810
- like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

390
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,480
Hmm?

391
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,460
How does it feel sitting behind
that desk, Frank?

392
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,660
It's almost
like holdin' a gun...

393
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:46,270
only much more powerful.

394
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,980
You see,

395
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,790
staying with you, uh...

396
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:10,960
I'm beginning to think big, too.

397
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:16,330
This McBain business

398
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:20,330
is giving me ideas.

399
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,670
I'm sorry for you,

400
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,680
Frank.

401
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,510
You're doing your best.

402
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:34,010
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

403
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,160
- Why?
- Because...

404
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,690
there are many things
you'll never understand.

405
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,540
This is one of them.

406
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,370
You see, Frank,

407
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:01,280
there are many kinds
of weapons,

408
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,370
and the only one
that can stop that

409
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,440
is this.

410
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,270
Now, shall we get back

411
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,740
to our little problem?

412
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,700
My weapons might look simple
to you, Mr. Morton,

413
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,870
but they can still shoot holes

414
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,040
big enough
for our little problems.

415
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,250
Pretty soon, the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

416
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,950
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

417
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:27,020
From now on,
there are no more surprises,"

418
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,500
and then you happen
to meet a man like this

419
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:31,900
who looked like a good man...

420
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:35,230
clear eyes, strong hands...

421
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:36,900
and he wants to marry you...

422
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,500
which doesn't happen often,

423
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,840
and he says he's rich, too,

424
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,270
which doesn't hurt.

425
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,210
So you think,
"To hell with New Orleans.

426
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,340
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

427
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:58,690
"I wouldn't mind giving him
a half a dozen kids after all...

428
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,420
take care of a house,
do something... what the hell?"

429
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,700
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain...

430
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,970
even if he's going
to have a job

431
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,040
pulling you out
of the devil's grip.

432
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:40,820
Still, I swear he left money
around someplace.

433
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:45,500
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

434
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,230
Mrs. McBain goes
back to civilization

435
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:52,040
minus a husband,
and plus a great future.

436
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,700
Hmm.

437
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,410
You deserve better.

438
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,690
The last man who told me that

439
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,820
is buried out there.

440
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:25,260
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

441
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:32,110
She was the biggest whore
in Alameda,

442
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,270
and the finest woman

443
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,150
that ever lived.

444
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,910
Whoever my father
was, for an hour

445
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:42,650
or for a month...
he must've been a happy man.

446
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,330
Hey. Hey! Ha, Ha!

447
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,170
Hey!

448
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,400
What do you want?

449
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,800
Cheyenne's right.

450
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,210
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

451
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,720
This isn't the time to leave.

452
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,170
Get me some water.

453
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:45,920
From the well.

454
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,260
I like my water fresh.

455
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:18,050
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

456
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,640
A sound?

457
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:21,780
Like what?

458
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,980
Like that.

459
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,610
He not only plays...

460
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:00,520
he can shoot, too.

461
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,100
Good morning, Mrs. McBain.

462
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,800
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

463
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,240
Maybe you don't remember,

464
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,010
but yesterday
at the funeral I...

465
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,310
I remember very well.

466
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:47,290
Is there something
I can do for you?

467
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,310
Yes.

468
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,080
See Frank...
and tell him I know everything.

469
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,420
Why is everybody

470
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,730
hounding me
about this guy Frank?

471
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,460
I don't know him.

472
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,660
I never heard of him.

473
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,670
I got my own worries

474
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,100
and all I want is
to be left in peace.

475
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,870
Tell Frank I want
to negotiate with him...

476
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,380
personally!

477
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,560
You were told
not to come here

478
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,900
for any reason.

479
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,770
Whatever business you have
with Frank,

480
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,140
keep it far away from here.

481
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,400
Yes, I-I know, Mr. Morton,

482
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,410
but when I heard

483
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,780
that woman say
she knew everything,

484
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,540
I thought that
the important thing was for me

485
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,570
to come over here right away
and tell you about it.

486
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,740
You never thought
it wasn't a trick?

487
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,250
Sure, but you know that
I'm mighty careful, Frank.

488
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,450
No one could've followed me.

489
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,620
That's the first thing I learned
working for you:

490
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,120
To listen unseen,
and to watch unheard.

491
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,150
Hmm, you should learn to live

492
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,530
as if you didn't exist.

493
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,060
You-You've known me
a long time, Frank.

494
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,370
You know you can
trust me.

495
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,900
Wobbles...

496
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,240
how can you trust a man

497
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,650
that wears both a belt
and suspenders...

498
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,380
a man can't even
trust his own pants?

499
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,500
Let's get out of here.

500
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,840
The end of the line.

501
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,910
Yeah.

502
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,280
Get him on board.

503
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,520
Tie him up.

504
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,600
Wait, Frank...

505
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,470
I...

506
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,740
So nobody followed you.

507
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,610
No... you gotta believe me.

508
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,510
So this is the way

509
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:58,810
I can trust you.

510
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,110
I can explain.

511
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,340
I didn't know that he...

512
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,720
Get out.

513
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,750
No, no... no, Frank...

514
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,190
Get out!

515
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,060
Shh.

516
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,200
Frank, wait...

517
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,000
I told you to keep quiet.

518
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:59,010
Where are Logan and Jim,

519
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,710
they take care of the woman?

520
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,880
Someone took care of them.

521
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,110
We found them out
at McBain's place.

522
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,120
Stone dead.

523
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,850
And the woman was gone.

524
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,950
Your friends have
a high mortality rate,

525
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:13,080
Frank.

526
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:26,130
First three, then two.

527
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,410
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

528
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,630
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

529
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,630
What do you want?

530
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:52,000
Who are you?

531
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,130
Dave Jenkins.

532
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,940
Dave Jenkins is dead
a long time ago.

533
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,080
Calder Benson.

534
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,350
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

535
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:19,420
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

536
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,990
You killed them.

537
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,590
Who are you?

538
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,330
Who are you?!

539
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,930
Frank!

540
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,640
The woman.

541
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,910
We're only losing time.

542
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,180
All right.

543
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,550
This time I'll take care
of her personally.

544
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:45,650
Yeah, it ought
to be easy for you.

545
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,360
Keep him warm for me.

546
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,330
If he gives you
any trouble, hit him.

547
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:57,960
Not in the mouth...
he's gotta talk...

548
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,200
and plenty.

549
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,550
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

550
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:09,020
By the way, I want you
to keep an eye on that cripple

551
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,240
all the time, understand?

552
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,340
Sure, Frank.

553
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,550
See anyone?

554
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:47,710
No.

555
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:07,940
There he is!

556
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:54,610
You only know how to shoot?

557
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:58,720
Or do you know how to cut, too?

558
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:10,530
Hey, you.

559
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:14,960
Wait a minute.

560
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:18,340
Let's have a good look at you.

561
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,610
Hey...

562
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,090
Mr. Choo-Choo.

563
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,970
It's easy to find you...

564
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:54,140
bastard.

565
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,840
I don't have to kill you now.

566
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,080
You leave a slime
behind you like a snail...

567
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:03,890
two beautiful shiny rails.

568
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,480
There's another bastard,

569
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,360
and he's getting
further away every minute.

570
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,610
There it is...

571
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,410
exactly what your
husband ordered from me.

572
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:26,570
And seeing as how he paid
cash on the barrelhead,

573
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,710
it all belongs to you.

574
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:33,350
Oak planks, beach, pine,
all first-grade lumber.

575
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:37,790
And there's beams and foundation
pilings, ten kegs of nails,

576
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:41,490
20 barrels of tar
and all these tools.

577
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:43,590
Maybe he wanted to enlarge
the farmhouse.

578
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:46,100
Enlarge the farmhouse?

579
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,430
He could've built
at least eight of them.

580
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:50,910
By the way, ma'am,

581
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,070
McBain also ordered this.

582
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:54,340
Said it was important.

583
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,540
Only... only seems he forgot

584
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,340
to tell me what he wanted
printed on it.

585
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,020
Station.

586
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,150
How's that again?

587
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,990
I said print "Station."

588
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,920
Lookin' for this?

589
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:50,530
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

590
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,800
I know that woman is here.

591
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,870
I don't want any more
useless killings.

592
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,040
I'm ready to make
a deal for that land...

593
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,100
to pay what's necessary.

594
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:04,850
I don't want to waste
any more time.

595
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:07,910
You made a big mistake, Morton.

596
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,290
When you're not on that train,

597
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,730
you look like a turtle
out of its shell.

598
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,390
Just funny.

599
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:18,900
Poor cripple... talking big

600
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:21,900
so nobody will know how scared
you are.

601
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,670
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

602
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:28,410
I don't have time
to compete with you.

603
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,380
Compete?

604
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:42,120
Why you...

605
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,320
You can't even stand

606
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,090
on your own feet by yourself.

607
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:58,670
Is that sufficient
to make you feel strong?

608
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:02,200
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

609
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:08,140
Sure...
but you won't do it,

610
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:12,690
because it's not to...
your advantage.

611
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,020
Hmm.

612
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:22,130
Who knows how far you'd have
gone with two good legs, huh?

613
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:31,330
Help him back to the train.

614
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,040
Keep your eye on him.

615
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,110
Oh, Morton, don't worry
about the land.

616
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,980
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay, of course.

617
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,210
Won't make any difference
to you,

618
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,620
dealing with a new owner.

619
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:13,680
Cheyenne.

620
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,020
Hey, Cheyenne, there's
a square staked out here.

621
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,890
It says "Water Tank."

622
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,360
Over here, too.

623
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,490
Only it says "Post Office."

624
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:25,260
And this one says "Corral."

625
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,730
And this here "Church."

626
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:30,290
What the hell is this?

627
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,860
Can't you see?

628
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:34,500
It's a station...

629
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:38,740
and all around it, a town.

630
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,880
It's Brett McBain's town.

631
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,850
Was he crazy.

632
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:49,980
Yeah, in a very special way.

633
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:54,150
An Irishman.

634
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,360
He knew sooner or later,

635
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,330
that railroad coming
through Flagstone

636
01:39:58,370 --> 01:40:00,800
would continue on West.

637
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,770
So he looked over all
this country out here...

638
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:06,440
until he found this
hunk of desert.

639
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,880
Nobody wanted it.

640
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:14,310
But he bought it.

641
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,690
Then he tightened his belt,

642
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:23,250
and for years he waited.

643
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:25,160
Waited for what?

644
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,000
For the railroad
to reach this point.

645
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:31,800
Aw, but how in the hell
could he be sure

646
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,960
the railroad would pass
through his property?

647
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:39,600
Them steam engines can't
roll without water,

648
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:41,170
and the only water
for 50 miles

649
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,010
west of Flagstone is right here,

650
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:45,410
under this land.

651
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,510
Aha.

652
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:49,220
He was no fool,
our dead friend, huh?

653
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,990
He was going to sell
this piece of desert

654
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:55,460
for its weight in gold,
wasn't he?

655
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,660
You don't sell

656
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,960
the dream of a lifetime.

657
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,370
Brett McBain wanted
his station.

658
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:07,600
He got the rights
to build it.

659
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,510
How do you know all this?

660
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:13,210
I saw a document.

661
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,580
It was all in order...

662
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,080
seals, signatures, everything.

663
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:19,640
One thing though...
in very small print,

664
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:23,020
there is a short clause

665
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:27,120
which says that McBain
or his heirs lose all rights

666
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:31,150
if by the time the railroad
reaches this point...

667
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,130
the station ain't built yet.

668
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:36,000
Aha.

669
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:42,500
Speaking of railroads,

670
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,940
I notice the rail gang's
already...

671
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,640
Hey.

672
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:52,590
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills,

673
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,750
and before you know it,

674
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:57,520
they're gonna be here.

675
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,930
Yeah.

676
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,800
Yeah.

677
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:03,800
Listen...

678
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:09,430
Harmonica, a town built
around a railroad...

679
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:14,640
You could make a fortune, huh?

680
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:18,310
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

681
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:21,010
Hey, more than that.

682
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:23,850
Thousands of thousands.

683
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:26,320
They call them millions.

684
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:32,060
Millions.

685
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,460
Yeah, millions.

686
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,370
I always thought it'd
be easy to make a deal

687
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,170
with a smart lady.

688
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,830
All you gotta do is...

689
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:48,400
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?!

690
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:51,710
But, Chief, what are
we supposed to do?

691
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,690
What are you supposed to do?

692
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,620
Build a station, idiots!

693
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:01,420
Figure it ain't gonna
look like much...

694
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:07,590
but it'll be the first thing
she sees

695
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:09,690
when she gets back.

696
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:13,070
If she gets back.

697
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:33,580
I think...

698
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:44,900
Yeah.

699
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,030
I'm beginning to think
I might be

700
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:48,870
a little sorry killing you.

701
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,710
You like being alive...

702
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:55,800
hmm?

703
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:10,690
And you also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

704
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:14,930
You like it.

705
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,600
Even if they're the hands
of the man

706
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,970
who killed your husband.

707
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:42,920
What a...

708
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:48,740
What a little tramp.

709
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,540
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do

710
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,910
to save your skin?

711
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:01,340
Nothing, Frank.

712
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:27,600
Mmm... now I understand
why they miss you so much

713
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:32,810
down there in...
New Orleans.

714
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:37,620
Great invention...
the telegraph.

715
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,020
Dit-dit, dit-dah,

716
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:42,150
dit-dit-dit, dit-dah, dit-dit...

717
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:45,420
Jill... the brunette?

718
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,120
My God, all the customers

719
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:49,760
of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

720
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,200
have been weeping
ever since she left.

721
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:58,170
Say, tell me...

722
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:01,040
did old McBain know?

723
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,940
Yeah.

724
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:05,680
Yeah, I bet he did.

725
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,210
He's just the type
to marry a whore.

726
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:14,420
Hey...

727
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:18,300
that's an idea.

728
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:20,800
I could marry you,

729
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:24,290
and the land'd become mine.

730
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,930
And maybe...

731
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,870
you'd make a perfect wife.

732
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:39,150
It'd be me wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

733
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:42,310
Too bad.

734
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:45,490
We'll have to think
of another solution.

735
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:47,790
Simpler.

736
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,920
Quicker.

737
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:18,090
As sheriff of this county

738
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:21,330
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

739
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,730
of all property belonging

740
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:26,600
to Mrs. Jill McBain,
here present.

741
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:29,900
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

742
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:34,640
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

743
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,650
This property
and all it contains...

744
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,340
lock, stock and barrel...

745
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:42,250
will be turned over
to the lucky purchaser

746
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:43,910
at the time of sale.

747
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,350
All the contents therein

748
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:47,980
are listed by number
on the inventory sheet

749
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,390
distributed among you.

750
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:53,420
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

751
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:55,130
All right,
that's clear to everybody.

752
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:58,660
I declare the auction open.

753
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,300
Now who's going
to make the first bid?

754
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:14,610
All right, now who's
going to make the first bid?

755
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,650
Two hundred dollars!

756
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:24,190
Well, I have an opening
bid of $200.

757
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,130
Two hundred dollars.

758
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,660
Do I hear more?

759
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:32,760
That stinkin' piece of land
ain't worth it, old timer.

760
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:34,540
Well, come on,
my friends. $200?

761
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:38,910
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

762
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:41,780
Well...

763
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:45,340
Who's going to bid $300?

764
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:50,720
Now look, friends,

765
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,630
I realize we're not
offering California here,

766
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:57,630
but $200 is damn little
for all that property.

767
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:58,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

768
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,160
I wouldn't even take
$200 as a deposit.

769
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:08,240
Well, nobody's going to bid
it up.

770
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:19,690
You sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

771
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:23,690
I wish I were wrong,
Mrs. McBain,

772
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:25,160
but you're liable
to end up

773
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,260
selling the place
for a plate of beans.

774
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:37,130
All I want is to sell.

775
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:44,770
He looks sad, huh?

776
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:47,010
If you say so.

777
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,180
How many?

778
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,340
One card.

779
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:53,790
And one for me.

780
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:57,580
Dealer takes three.

781
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:10,860
Can I... can I take a hand?

782
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:18,310
Fifteen.

783
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,250
Yeah, sit down.

784
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,990
I'll deal.

785
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:46,660
How do you, uh...

786
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,870
how do you play this game,
Mr. Morton?

787
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:54,950
It's very simple.

788
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:58,110
As long as you use your head,

789
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:00,480
you never lose.

790
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:02,490
Five hundred dollars.

791
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:08,020
Hmm.

792
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:09,530
Five hundred dollars.

793
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,190
Mm-hmm.

794
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,600
Do I hear any other bids?

795
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:18,000
I don't think so.

796
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:29,410
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain, but...

797
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:33,390
I think I'm gonna have to knock
down on that last bid.

798
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,170
Five hundred, once...

799
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,800
Five hundred dollars, twice...

800
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,270
Five hundred dollars...

801
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:57,070
Five thousand dollars.

802
01:56:20,770 --> 01:56:23,210
You said $5,000?

803
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:26,370
It's on its way.

804
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:40,120
- That's Cheyenne.
- It's Cheyenne.

805
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:53,000
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

806
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,600
Judas was content
with $4,970 less.

807
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:01,340
There were no dollars
in them days.

808
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,280
Mm. But sons of bitches, yeah.

809
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:21,560
Hey, wait a minute.

810
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:24,540
The jail's that way.

811
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:26,130
Yeah, I know.

812
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:30,440
Yeah, but, uh, you're going
to the railroad station.

813
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,210
I'm sending you
to Yuma, Cheyenne.

814
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,650
They got a modern jail there.

815
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:38,740
It's got more walls,
more bars...

816
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:40,810
more guards.

817
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:43,550
Oh, you'll like it...
in 20 years.

818
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:45,490
You'll see.

819
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,650
Whoa! Hey-hey!

820
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:48,250
Two tickets, amigo,

821
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:49,850
to the next station.

822
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:52,160
One-way only.

823
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,630
Mm.

824
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:57,260
Here's to you,
and congratulations.

825
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:05,270
You've got yourself
a good deal.

826
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:07,110
Oh, the auction.

827
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,480
Forget it.

828
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:11,510
I don't invest in land.

829
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:15,910
You don't look at all
like the noble defender

830
01:59:15,950 --> 01:59:18,150
of poor, defenseless widows.

831
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:22,320
But then again...

832
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:28,230
I don't look like
a poor, defenseless widow.

833
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:37,070
Cheyenne's right...
you're a remarkable woman.

834
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:41,640
And you're a remarkable man...

835
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:44,050
but you have something
on your mind.

836
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:52,450
And you've got something
on your mind.

837
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,990
Hot water.

838
01:59:58,030 --> 02:00:00,090
A bathtub full of hot water.

839
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:21,610
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

840
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:53,690
Who are you?

841
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:17,480
Jim Cooper.

842
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,250
Chuck Youngblood.

843
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:22,480
More dead men.

844
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:28,650
They were all alive until
they met you, Frank.

845
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:38,670
You paid $5,000 for
somethin' belongs to me.

846
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:45,030
Five thousand...

847
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:53,310
plus one.

848
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:59,360
You got a right
to make a profit, too.

849
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,250
I wouldn't take too long

850
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:29,450
thinking about it
if I were you.

851
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:36,630
You've got yourself into
something's bigger than you are.

852
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:39,760
You got a chance to get out
easy, you better take it.

853
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:43,140
You sound like a real
businessman, Frank.

854
02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:46,510
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

855
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:56,180
And you've learned
some new methods.

856
02:02:58,390 --> 02:03:01,420
Yeah, Mr. Morton is showing you
a lot of new ways.

857
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,830
Even though you haven't
given up the old ones.

858
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:13,360
Pick any method you like,
just make the deal.

859
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:17,440
Which deal, Frank?

860
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:22,410
We have more than one,
you and me.

861
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,850
Well, we can...

862
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:30,580
lump 'em together
into one bundle,

863
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:31,680
settle all of them

864
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,160
here and now.

865
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:37,890
Easy, Frank.

866
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:40,590
Easy.

867
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:42,900
You gotta learn
not to push things.

868
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:46,200
Taking it easy is the first
thing a businessman should do.

869
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:52,840
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

870
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:58,520
How much?

871
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:01,220
One dollar.

872
02:05:06,490 --> 02:05:07,720
Giddy-up.

873
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,050
Giddy-up.

874
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,530
I could swear we're going
to have that strange sound.

875
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:52,030
Right now.

876
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,350
Time sure flies.

877
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:49,950
It's already past 12:00.

878
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:51,810
But... but they were his men.

879
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:52,840
Yeah.

880
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:54,880
And they tried to kill him.

881
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,790
They must've found somebody
who pays better.

882
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:57,850
And you...

883
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:00,760
you saved his life.

884
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:05,930
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

885
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:20,980
Sure.

886
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:24,040
It's not the same thing.

887
02:11:30,430 --> 02:11:32,260
You get dressed.

888
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:33,960
It's time to go home.

889
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:55,400
Did you make coffee?

890
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:59,130
This time I did.

891
02:17:38,850 --> 02:17:40,610
Good.

892
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:46,320
My mother used to make
coffee this way...

893
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:50,390
hot, strong...

894
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:52,090
and good.

895
02:18:00,910 --> 02:18:02,700
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

896
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:06,500
What's he waiting for out there?

897
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:10,870
What's he doing?

898
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:18,990
He's whittlin'
on a piece of wood.

899
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:25,690
I got a feeling,
when he stops whittling,

900
02:18:25,730 --> 02:18:27,760
something's gonna happen.

901
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,630
Surprised to see me here?

902
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,180
I knew you'd come.

903
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:10,140
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

904
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:12,800
Now I understand why.

905
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,580
Wouldn't have bothered him

906
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,740
knowing you were around
somewhere alive.

907
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:21,920
So you found out
you're not a businessman

908
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,890
after all.

909
02:20:23,930 --> 02:20:25,120
Just a man.

910
02:20:27,890 --> 02:20:30,190
An ancient race.

911
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:37,930
Other Mortons will be along,

912
02:20:37,970 --> 02:20:40,130
and they'll kill it off.

913
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:42,770
The future
don't matter to us.

914
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:45,540
Nothing matters now...
not the land,

915
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:47,980
not the money, not the woman.

916
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:50,610
I came here to see you.

917
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:53,790
'Cause I know

918
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:56,050
that now you'll tell me
what you're after.

919
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:14,070
Only at the point of dying.

920
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:18,010
I know.

921
02:22:02,130 --> 02:22:04,260
I heated some water for you.

922
02:22:04,300 --> 02:22:05,990
I also found a razor.

923
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:09,090
Put it there, please...

924
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:14,470
so I can watch
the railroad move up

925
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:15,800
while I shave.

926
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:23,510
You know what?

927
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:25,840
If I was you,

928
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:27,950
I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

929
02:22:37,430 --> 02:22:39,420
Can't imagine

930
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:43,730
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

931
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:48,030
Just to look at her.

932
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:55,410
And if one of them
should, uh, pat your behind...

933
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,780
just make believe it's nothing.

934
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,790
They earned it.

935
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:40,380
Keep your lovin' brother happy.

936
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:02,130
Who-who are you?

937
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:12,140
Hey...

938
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:13,830
you're sort of a handsome man.

939
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:19,080
But I'm not the right man.

940
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:33,860
And neither is he.

941
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:39,730
Maybe not...
but it doesn't matter.

942
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:47,870
You don't understand, Jill.

943
02:32:47,910 --> 02:32:52,970
People like that
have something inside...

944
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:54,480
something to do with death.

945
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:00,550
That fella lives,

946
02:33:00,590 --> 02:33:02,820
he'll come in
through that door,

947
02:33:02,860 --> 02:33:06,350
pick up his gear and say adios.

948
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:14,400
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

949
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:47,760
Now I gotta go.

950
02:35:34,050 --> 02:35:36,480
It's gonna be a beautiful town...

951
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:37,650
Sweetwater.

952
02:35:42,090 --> 02:35:44,960
I hope you'll come back someday.

953
02:36:02,210 --> 02:36:03,700
Someday.

954
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:17,950
Yeah...

955
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,990
I gotta go, too.

956
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:47,790
Make believe it's nothing.

957
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:58,160
Sorry, Harmonica,
I gotta stay here.

958
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:37,830
Who?

959
02:39:41,310 --> 02:39:44,540
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

960
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:48,850
I didn't count
on that half-man from the train.

961
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:50,380
He got scared.

962
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:14,270
Hey, Harmonica,
when they do you in,

963
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:17,110
pray it's somebody who knows
where to shoot.

964
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,920
Go away.

965
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:38,500
Go away.

966
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:41,440
Go away. I don't want you
to see me die.
