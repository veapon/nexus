1
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:19,486
No cigarettes, no sleep,
no light, no sound.

2
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:23,120
Nothing to eat...

3
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:26,118
No one to drink.

4
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:37,590
Sometimes all I need is the
air that I breathe and to love you.

5
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:43,386
All I need is the air that
I breathe and to love you.

6
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,547
All I need...

7
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,146
Watch where you're going, would ya?

8
00:02:58,924 --> 00:02:59,844
Oh...

9
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:01,962
Hey!

10
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,494
Hey!

11
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,166
Delta team, check in.

12
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,252
Delta team holding.

13
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,526
Maybe the source is wrong?

14
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:34,756
The source is good.

15
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,903
It's 10 after, the source
said 4 a.m. on the dot.

16
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,732
Wait!

17
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,547
Creedence.

18
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,326
It's probably just a radio station
someplace outside of the city.

19
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,877
No.

20
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:54,666
It's him.

21
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:17,374
Do we have to listen to the whole song,

22
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,674
all 7 minutes and 40 seconds of it?

23
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,131
Why do you insist on asking that every time?

24
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,666
Gum, I don't mess with your superstitions.

25
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,323
God knows we don't want to fluck with the formula.

26
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,389
But how about a new band?

27
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:36,832
Over the last six years we have listened to the
entire "Creedence Clearwater Revival" songbook

28
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:40,085
over and over and...

29
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:41,633
Hello?

30
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:42,613
Hi, Sweetie!

31
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:44,637
Why are you up so early?

32
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:46,923
What?

33
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,101
Which one?

34
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,738
Which one? Oh, the Care Bears book.

35
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,620
Oh, okay, I thought you were taking the even pages.

36
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,552
Oh, okay, I'm supposed to color the evens.

37
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,354
Oh, okay, well, I'll take my turn as soon as I get home.

38
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,867
Save the purple crayon for daddy.

39
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:08,497
Well, I told you, your daddy
has to work, but guess what?

40
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,787
When I get home I'm gonna make
you those... those happy-face pancakes

41
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,523
that you like so much, okay?

42
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,398
I love you, Baby.

43
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,426
Okay, big kiss.

44
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,883
Don't.

45
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,687
What?

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,763
Actually, you wouldn't understand.

47
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,166
About Care Bears?

48
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,727
Parenthood.

49
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,951
No, no, you're totally right.

50
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,966
Every father talks to his little
girl before he commits a class H felony.

51
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,524
Absolutely normal, so sweet.

52
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,230
Hoyt, it's late.

53
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,988
4 minutes - it's not late.

54
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,640
Sensors are reset in 20,
4 minutes less from 20 is 16.

55
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,543
2 to enter, 3 for the wall,

56
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:52,843
10 to drill...

57
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,908
That puts us inside of 15 minutes.
That's not enough cushion.

58
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,136
Let's call it.

59
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,540
Dude is runnin' 5 minutes behind.
He's probably just takin' a dump.

60
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,174
We're not callin' it, we're good.

61
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,456
This is an ace boon swipe dung.

62
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:09,242
There's not another one of these
in the headlights for a long while.

63
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,094
I don't know.

64
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,626
Suddenly I'm not feeling so good.

65
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,745
Well then, relax.

66
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,322
Put on a little "Bad Moon Rising."

67
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,079
This is a Diamond Dog.

68
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:22,116
I'm in the mainframe now.

69
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:23,784
The blouse is open.

70
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,860
Undoing the bra strap now.

71
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,118
Fire alarms are down.

72
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:29,738
<i>Seismics are down.</i>

73
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,715
<i>Killin' the cameras now.</i>

74
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,122
<i>Good to go when you are.</i>

75
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,495
<i>Go radio silent 'til I say.</i>

76
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,599
The van's leaving.

77
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:28,143
Okay, fellas, as ready to rock as Riley's Diaphragm.

78
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,015
Really, Hoyt?

79
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,421
Sorry, Sugar.

80
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,405
Sir, I've go seismics, sounds like it blew a wall.

81
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:45,544
We got 'em.

82
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,140
It doesn't make any sense, it's too easy.

83
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,165
This crew doesn't do too easy.

84
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,833
3 minutes, guys.

85
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:53,962
Okay, let's go.

86
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,203
Okay, get 'er up.

87
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,645
- That's 3! Let's go!
- Move it!

88
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,809
Dude! Come on!

89
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,663
Okay, grab some extra stuff.

90
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,804
We're in tunnel now.

91
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:32,121
The proverbial hand is up the skirt,
headin' straight for the moose-knuckle.

92
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:33,117
Awesome.

93
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,057
That's why I love working with dudes.

94
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:38,810
It's all the clever variations you
can come up with for the word "vagina".

95
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,315
Vagina.

96
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,430
I need some air.

97
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,963
Drill's up. 3 minutes out.

98
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:15,741
They started drilling.

99
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,002
Wait... for my go.

100
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,645
Lock is out.

101
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,724
It's a go.

102
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,382
All right. We'll 'em.

103
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,655
Come on now, master at work.

104
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,697
You got 30 seconds.

105
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,222
Plenty of time.

106
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,329
Number 1's down.

107
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,269
You only got 15 seconds, come on.

108
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,154
Number 2, down.

109
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,172
Go!

110
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,986
- Clear!
- Clear!

111
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:46,883
What the hell's goin' on?

112
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:52,686
It doesn't make any sense.

113
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,420
They were casing this place for 3 weeks.

114
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,743
Seth! Get someone in that toy store!

115
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,117
Now!

116
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,493
We're in.

117
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,047
They're in the bank vault, Baby,
2 minutes until we're rich.

118
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,523
Jesus! Right!

119
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,611
It's like looking into heaven.

120
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:21,842
Stay focused!

121
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:24,361
Coming up on creepy toy store now.

122
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,406
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

123
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,474
<i>All clear.</i>

124
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,386
<i>Scary wall can't be now.</i>

125
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:34,917
<i>Common stage has not been breached.
Repeat, secondary the wall is intact.</i>

126
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,282
You know, I like bright, shiny things, Gummer.

127
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:40,974
This is the oldest and bright, shiny thing.

128
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,756
How much weight can you carry? Each one
of those bars weights 27 and a half pounds!

129
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,558
I played football

130
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,334
We got our 10 million right here.

131
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,456
Time!

132
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:59,279
Sir, I've got 500 meters of dark,
empty tunnel in front of me.

133
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,602
Somebody screwed up.

134
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:02,829
We're on the wrong block.

135
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,367
They're robbing the bank!

136
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,268
- Quick!
- Go! Go! Go!

137
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,630
Let's do it!

138
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,087
Bring that friggin' gear over here!

139
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,322
Get rid of the store!

140
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:56,987
Let's go! Let's go!

141
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:01,890
Go, go, go, go!!!

142
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,130
Open the door!

143
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:15,172
Let's go, Guys, c'mon, move it, let's go!

144
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,704
Go, go, go, go!!

145
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,296
...be in the vault!

146
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,701
Hey, what are you young fellas doing?

147
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,357
Just get moving!

148
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,323
- Did you have to hit him so hard?
- He saw our faces!

149
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,186
No. Put it down! No homicides!

150
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,158
No, I am not going back to prison, not again.

151
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:44,538
Fuck! In this bag for us to disappear,
no need for anymore jobs. Let's just go!

152
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,747
Come on, guys.
What the hell are they doing!

153
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,246
Damn!

154
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:58,499
I have been to prison, and I didn't like it.

155
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,481
In fact, I fuckin' hated it!

156
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,385
Oh, shit!

157
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:11,181
You shot me!

158
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:12,846
Let's find the back of this place.

159
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,593
Oh, my God!

160
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,567
Keep quiet!

161
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,504
What are you doing?

162
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,710
- What happened?
- Shawn shot me in the leg.

163
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:25,904
No, you shot me!

164
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,197
Oh, shit!

165
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,270
I left the money, I have to get the money!

166
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,246
What? No! We're heated!

167
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:37,126
Let's go, guys, come on, move it, let's go!

168
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,312
God!

169
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,652
This sucks!

170
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,971
I want this guy nailed!
Now everyone spread out!

171
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,337
- What the hell are you doing?
- He's on his own now, Baby.

172
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,657
No, Will!

173
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,641
Your rider's gone.

174
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:01,652
Hoyt! Hoyt!

175
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,292
Put your hands in the air!

176
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,495
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

177
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,146
All units, 217 on east side of Rampart.

178
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,647
Assault on 2 police officers.

179
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:47,576
Suspect has fled the scene of the police cruiser.

180
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,765
Oh, we got 'im!

181
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,115
There he is, straight ahead.

182
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,896
All units, Operaville and Burgundy.

183
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:17,118
On the upward ramp!

184
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,745
Shit!

185
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,346
God damn it!

186
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:17,935
Man! Don't shoot!

187
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,209
Get out of the way!

188
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:45,746
Bring out the money and yourself...slow.

189
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,769
Real slow.

190
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,893
Stop.
Turn around.

191
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,552
On your knees.

192
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,631
My wedding day.
The birth of my twins.

193
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,754
And now this.
Highlightsville. Fuckin' highlights.

194
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:18,548
Cuff him!

195
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,025
Hey! Where's the money?

196
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,971
Fletcher, you're doing well.

197
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,455
Hope you were raped every day.

198
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:39,327
Harlend wants to give you a lift.

199
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:44,876
He's not asking.

200
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:54,782
- Welcome home.
- Harlend.

201
00:21:56,206 --> 00:22:01,664
- So, where to?
- Coronado and Prentiss.

202
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,283
So, how's the Federal penal system?

203
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,025
Not as tough as they say, huh?

204
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,864
- How's the wife?
- She's good.

205
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,220
- I guess.
- She left you?

206
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:29,864
- Four years ago.
- I'm sorry.

207
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:33,792
You ought to be.

208
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,928
Why did you pick me up, Harlend?

209
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,770
I thought you might pick up
where you left off.

210
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,481
- Now that you're free as a bird.
- Well, that's all behind me now.

211
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:51,089
You can probably afford to retire now with that
sizable withdrawal from Parish Community you made.

212
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:54,665
You knew, you got caught with that money,
you'd be lookin' at an extra 10 years,

213
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:58,044
so you ditched it somewhere.
And now that you're out,

214
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:03,056
I thought you'd go and get that 10 mill.
Aren't you, Will?

215
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,156
Much like a squirrel returning back to his
hoard after a long cold winter.

216
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:10,251
I'm not the squirrel playing
with his nuts here, Harlend.

217
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,562
I don't have the money.

218
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,715
You know that Vincent is dead, right?

219
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,338
I don't think he knows.
Do you, Agent Fletcher?

220
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,068
How does that make you feel?

221
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,409
He was my friend.

222
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,431
Yeah.

223
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,282
He had a tough time of it
after you left.

224
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,319
You being the brains behind the operation.

225
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,351
I guess he owed money to the wrong people.

226
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,251
Your ex-wife's place, huh?

227
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,001
- I'm not here for her.
- Do you really think your kid wants to see you?

228
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,127
I'm about to find out.

229
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:59,642
Grandma Harlend used to say,
"Love makes time pass,

230
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,868
but time is certain to make love pass."

231
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:07,703
Can I enjoy my day now?
Thanks for the lift.

232
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:11,500
Oh, Happy Fat Tuesday, Will.

233
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,406
I'm starting to think you liked the guy.

234
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:23,947
Admiring someone doesn't
mean you like him.

235
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:25,857
Let's go, Fletcher.

236
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:38,019
- What are you doing? You scared me.
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

237
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:39,354
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:45,472
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

239
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,468
I know I should have called,
I didn't have the number.

240
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:50,968
You look like your mom.
She's not here, is she?

241
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,046
She's in Shreveport.

242
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:56,449
- With Mr. Loeb?
- Yes, with David.

243
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:04,701
This came for you this morning,
it was just left on the mat.

244
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,897
Thanks. Can we talk?

245
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:09,854
- I really should get going.
- Just for a few minutes.

246
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:23,246
I have something for you, I saw it
on the way in, reminded me of you.

247
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,561
Cool.

248
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,088
No one sets-out to be a criminal.

249
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:43,788
But through...
But through...

250
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:50,279
I've had so many conversations with you,
now that you're...

251
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,460
sitting across from me,

252
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:57,378
it's like my mind's going blank.

253
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:10,676
No one sets-out to be a criminal, Alison.

254
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:15,437
But through circumstances,
bad choices, needs...

255
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:20,775
unfor... unforeseeable obstacles,
unreliable friends,

256
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,191
dishonesty, life intervenes.

257
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,821
I not trying to justify it,
I'm not making excuses for it.

258
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:33,767
I was a bad man,
but I've... I've had eight long years

259
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,112
to get rid of that man.

260
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,183
To ready myself.

261
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:42,799
To get to know you.

262
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,934
I have to go.

263
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:01,267
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm late.

264
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:04,802
- Late for what?
- My shrink session.

265
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,279
- I go every Tuesday.
- Really?

266
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:15,411
Yeah, apparently I have abandonment issues.
Go figure.

267
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:23,610
I meant what I said, Alison.

268
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:38,906
Keep it!
I'm not seven anymore.

269
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:48,193
-Alison.
- Just go, please.

270
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,274
Thanks for the visual massage, Pete.

271
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:31,594
Riley, you are just too damn fine, girl.
And you don't give me the time of day.

272
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,630
How 'bout you call your wife and
see when you're available.

273
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:40,118
Ah, why do you gotta bring her up?
Talk about a buzz-kill. You have a good one.

274
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,573
You too.

275
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,327
How is it that after eight years
you have only gotten younger?

276
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:53,038
Oh, God, Will!
I can't believe it.

277
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:56,053
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

278
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,152
You should have let me know,
I woulda come to pick you up.

279
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,036
It's all right, Agent Harlend was
kind enough to give me a lift.

280
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:04,902
You're kidding!
God, that guy needs to get laid like yesterday!

281
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,980
- Let me get you a drink. Tequila?
- Yes, ma'am.

282
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,409
What the hell, Riley, you're
working in a cop bar?

283
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:19,320
Yeah, well, you know, it's a good way
to guarantee I don't go back to wrong.

284
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,873
"Back to wrong"?

285
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,948
Yeah, self-restraint was never my strong suit.

286
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,316
I'm honored to be your first stop.

287
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,775
- Actually I dropped by Alison's first.
- Ooh! And how is she?

288
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,784
Not as honored.

289
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,259
Don't worry, Will, she'll come 'round.
I missed you, Will.

290
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,832
You know, I never got to thank
you after all that with Vin.

291
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:49,872
Don't mention it.

292
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,142
I wasn't allowed to come visit,
my lawyer wouldn't let me, and um...

293
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:58,426
- Harlend never really stopped sniffing around.
- I know, I know.

294
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,803
But you not ratting us out,
really means something to me, Will.

295
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:04,726
Like I said...

296
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,521
You coulda ratted-out Hoyt though,
that I wouldn't have minded.

297
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,567
Which... yeah, yeah,
I'm looking for that guy.

298
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,961
And I take it you heard about Vince?

299
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,151
- Yeah, it's terrible.
- Yeah, I mean he went really dark.

300
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,474
Well, I mean, do they know who killed him?

301
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:30,035
No, I don't think so, He was hangin'
out with a sketchy crowd, you know.

302
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:36,064
- Looking for the new "you" I suppose.
- It's good to see you again, Riley.

303
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:45,032
I think we woke-up your package.

304
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:52,090
Riley, give Jake a tap.

305
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,937
- Two beers.
- Be right back.

306
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:05,872
Hello.

307
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,606
<i>Hello, Will Montgomery.</i>

308
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,266
Who is this?

309
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,500
<i>You don't recognize my voice, Gum?</i>

310
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,073
<i>Yeah, I wanted to be
there for ya at the prison.</i>

311
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,024
Vincent?

312
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:27,007
<i>Give you a welcome you when you got out,
but you know how it is, time just slipped away.</i>

313
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:32,002
Well, Hallelujah, man, you're alive.
Shit! You know what?

314
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:33,803
Everybody's tellin' me you're dead.

315
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:38,101
<i>Well, that depends on how you're
interpretation of the word "dead".</i>

316
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:40,759
<i>I'm clearly not "living".</i>

317
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,993
Where are you, can we meet?
How are you?

318
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:49,125
The years you've been gone
have not been kind to me, Gum.

319
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:53,066
Constantly running from loan sharks, the Feds.

320
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:56,360
<i>Broker than a dead-dick dog
that couldn't get another swipe.</i>

321
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:00,458
- I AM sorry to hear about that.
- You listen to me, Gum.

322
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:04,818
- I have waited eight years for this.
- Go ahead.

323
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,556
I had to change my name,
erase everything.

324
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,488
And then, that little matter
of the bullet in my leg.

325
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,253
A constant, friendly reminder

326
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,075
<i>of the partner who
ruined my life that night.</i>

327
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:17,764
Come on, man! Really, we gonna go back there?

328
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,878
- You did that to yourself.
- Semantics.

329
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,789
I want my share! I want MY share

330
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:25,482
<i>of the 10 million dollars</i>

331
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:27,581
<i>that was going to
change our lives forever.</i>

332
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:29,649
Vinny, there is no cash.

333
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,753
I had a feeling you'd say that, Gum.

334
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,171
I burned it just before
Harlend got to me.

335
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:41,469
No. Stop it!

336
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,322
<i>It's true.</i>

337
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,708
- What's taking so long?
- Hold on.

338
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:48,914
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

339
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,339
<i>Who... who..</i>

340
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:53,077
- that voice, who is that?
- That's right, you don't know.

341
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:55,394
I'm a cab driver now.

342
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,112
My fare is this sweet little girl
trying to get to her shrink's office

343
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,181
so she can discuss her "daddy issues"

344
00:33:02,222 --> 00:33:07,845
and how they have manifested into
an unhealthy disdain for the world at large.

345
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,137
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hold on, please, Gum.

346
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:16,479
All right, Miss, terrible Fat Tuesday traffic.
Be there in a jiffy.

347
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:19,120
See how it lays?

348
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:26,387
<i>Now, Gum, it all depends on whether or not you're
gonna stick to your story about the burnt cash.</i>

349
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:30,286
You touch her and I'll take you down
the Levy and kick your fuckin' ass.

350
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:35,492
I don't know if you heard what I just said,
but this all depends on you.

351
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,095
VINCENT!

352
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,078
He's on the move.

353
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,060
Where are we going?

354
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:17,329
- What are we doing, why are we in here?
- I hope you understand this is not my preference.

355
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:23,208
Help me! No! Help!

356
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:26,473
I'm considering your father
an elemental end to your suffering.

357
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:33,578
But you see, Alison,
I've got a sickness.

358
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,290
I'm not well.

359
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:40,224
Your father abandoned me in my time of need

360
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:44,705
so I know what it is to
to be in the position you're in.

361
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:50,507
Really, I do. I know what it is to be
left high and dry by Will Montgomery.

362
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,673
And you and me...we are kindred spirits.

363
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:57,740
And I am going to make him pay for the both of us.

364
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:11,893
Relax!

365
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,355
Where's Alison?

366
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,440
Did you change your mind or are you
still sticking with that bullshit story?

367
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,449
Can I talk to her?

368
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:26,784
Alison.

369
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:30,391
She's waiting for you to decide
whether she's going to remain fine.

370
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:32,580
Vincent, don't do this.

371
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,033
I'm  hangin' up now.

372
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,218
No, no! Wait! Okay! Wait! I can get it.

373
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:42,296
<i>I can get the money. I just need time.</i>

374
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,028
<i>It's not here.</i>

375
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,421
It's in Tuscaloosa, my lawyer has it.

376
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:50,576
In a truck, so I need 24 hours.

377
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,469
You got 12.

378
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:56,248
<i>A phone in your hand. I'll be
tracking you with it at all times.</i>

379
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:58,504
8 rings! 8 rings and you pick it up!

380
00:35:58,604 --> 00:36:02,889
You miss a single phone call from me, Alison doesn't live.

381
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,572
Vincent.

382
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,819
This is my last chance to
to dance, Buddy.

383
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:10,792
You haven't seen me recently.
Let's just say I've got 2 left feet.

384
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:13,805
<i>Hello. Vincent!</i>

385
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:15,341
Hello.

386
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:08,192
- I need to get a phone.
- I'm sorry, Sir, you're gonna have to wait.

387
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:11,554
- Excuse me, Ma'am, I really need a phone.
- Sir, I will be with you in a moment.

388
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,841
- How much is this one?
- 29.99.

389
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:21,294
Want your change?

390
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:33,956
Passenger service to Tuscaloosa
now boarding platform 2.

391
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,482
Help, get me out of here.

392
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,489
Fletcher, I can't hear you.

393
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:52,613
You lost him on his first morning out. Shit!

394
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,766
- Will Montgomery is here for you.
- Send him in.

395
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,874
So your dead, former partner Vincent Kinsey

396
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,413
has kidnapped your daughter and
is holding her somewhere in New Orleans?

397
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,987
- In a cab.
- The cab, yes, that's right. In the cab, yeah.

398
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,440
And what does he want in return?

399
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,051
- 10 Million dollars.
- 10 Million dollars.

400
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:17,919
- Remind me why that's a familiar figure.
- I burned the cash.

401
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:28,075
Just before you grabbed me.
That's the God's honest truth.

402
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:31,003
'Cause I knew I'd get less
time if I ditched the money.

403
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:36,061
I don't have it but he has my daughter
and I need your help.

404
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,538
Why would I be here if I had the money?

405
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,577
I would just pay Vincent off and
get my little girl back.

406
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,102
This is how I see it, Will.

407
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:48,930
You're a thief, a crook and a scumbag,
but you're also a very clever tree frog.

408
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:53,311
So you concoct this "Kinsey is alive and
has snatched my kid" fantasy

409
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:57,988
so that A, you can show that you don't have the
money otherwise why wouldn't you pay the ransom,

410
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:03,909
or B, send us running around all over town
searching for your daughter and her abductor

411
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,884
to afford you the time to dig-up the dough

412
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:10,387
and jump onto a cigarette boat
and zip-down to the Bahamas

413
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:13,284
where you can sip rum for the rest of your days

414
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:16,306
and listen to classic rock

415
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,402
played by bands with muscular guitarists
and dead drummers.

416
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,214
Ah, my faithful buddy.

417
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,179
Couldn't find a couch in the living room.

418
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:32,944
This is Vincent's file.

419
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,902
The prints match as you can see.

420
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,892
They cut his body up before they burnt it.

421
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:43,414
We managed to get the prints of
a few fingers that survived the fire.

422
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,691
- We can visit his grave if you want.
- No, we can't

423
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:49,881
because he's alive. He faked his own death.

424
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:54,279
Please, Tim, I'm running out of time.

425
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,891
I'm not being played by you again, Will.

426
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:03,617
All right, let's go.

427
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,203
Please help me.

428
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:10,765
Escort our pal out of the building, will ya?

429
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,081
A little help, guys.

430
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:19,635
Will Montgomery, on behalf of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

431
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,413
I'd like to thank you for stopping by today.

432
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:24,992
Hold up, hold up.

433
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:38,262
Harlend thinks you're some
kind of criminal mastermind.

434
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,557
A criminal mastermind?

435
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:43,483
I don't share this belief because criminal
masterminds don't go away for eight year jolts.

436
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,256
Or do they?

437
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,505
One more, please.

438
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,863
Thank you.

439
00:42:16,254 --> 00:42:20,631
We called Montgomery's ex home and cell.
Both voicemails say she's out of town.

440
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,449
Have you tried his
daughter's cell phone?

441
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:29,998
Right, it says the account's been suspended
2 weeks per request of the stepfather.

442
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:35,931
I think I'll call local PD on it.

443
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,635
If she has been kidnapped,
we're FBI, we do something about it.

444
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:41,386
- You don't think he's telling the truth?
- No, I do not.

445
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:10,930
Hey! Is there anybody out there?

446
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:21,742
Jacobs.

447
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:25,487
Crap.

448
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,779
We have a problem.

449
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,922
That's good.
All right, well, keep trackin' 'im to Tuscaloosa.

450
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,439
If he deviates from the route
let me know.

451
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:36,101
You're are exactly the woman
I want to see in clothes that tight.

452
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:47,397
The only thing with any balls to
cover this town was The Hurricane.

453
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:50,398
Get away from the car!

454
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,528
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cab's off duty.

455
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:59,506
G'day, Mate, how ya doin'?
Look, look, I just gotta get to the...

456
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:00,832
The cab's off duty, man.

457
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:04,218
Yeah, Mate?. I just gotta catch
up with these chicks that I met...

458
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:04,992
Hey!

459
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:08,509
Please? Good on ya, Mate.

460
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:12,989
Help.

461
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,015
I haven't had my dong a dip since I got here, eh.

462
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,355
One of them was preg as heck.
Yeah, I know.

463
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:39,039
Mate, I better get of this blow.
This cabby's gonna chuck a wobbly.

464
00:45:41,774 --> 00:45:43,697
All right, Mate, so, let me tell
you about those sheilas, eh.

465
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:47,362
So, the pregnant one is sayin
nice things to ya, I really don't know why.

466
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:50,513
But made me realize a guy that
was violent cab on a kit plant race.

467
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:55,595
What the hell, the chicks are quite
different in New Orleans, eh, Mate?

468
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:58,224
New Orleans, it all comes back.

469
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:02,550
Heard you kid by the name King Louis 15?

470
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,647
King Louis 15 he don't know all this.

471
00:46:07,366 --> 00:46:11,264
- Frenchman to cross the ocean to visit.
- It wasn't happening.

472
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,286
So in order to get some use out of it

473
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,845
finally he starts shippin' over
boatloads of French prisoners.

474
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,414
That was coal up your ass, bugger.

475
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:27,037
Thieves, gamblers, prostitutes, murderers,
pirates, gypsies, pickpockets.

476
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,381
and psychopaths.

477
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,804
Is this me stop?

478
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:43,025
Those were the pioneers of this land.

479
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:48,568
And the forefathers of this town.

480
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,615
That you so casually dismissed.

481
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:21,652
All computers in this building are tracked.

482
00:47:21,735 --> 00:47:25,966
This is the page that corresponds to the
exact moment in the video where he stops.

483
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:33,888
This is Agent Harlend, I need an assault
team at Apartment 9, 23 St. Claude.

484
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:55,481
Ya hear me! Shut up, stupid, stupid dog.

485
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,442
I'm gonna skin you and make
a pair of shoes out of you.

486
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:03,179
I hate you and your owner.
Shut up.

487
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:09,744
- Jesus, Will!
- Shut up. Drop the bag.

488
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:12,685
That's my lunch.

489
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:16,399
- And that's my gun.
- Drop the bag.

490
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:25,236
That's for the last ten years.

491
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:32,380
- Where's Vincent?
- Vincent? Vincent's dead, man.

492
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:37,098
- Try again.
- I swear, I swear on my life.

493
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:37,861
I haven't seen Vincent...

494
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:40,944
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it's
not your brains you care about.

495
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,992
A bullet to the stomach is the most painful.
And it takes hours to die.

496
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,973
Okay, look, look, look,
Mate, what do you want to know?

497
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,731
What does he have you doing?

498
00:48:51,332 --> 00:48:54,668
Nothing, baby, gee, you know,
bags drops, recons, stuff like that.

499
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:57,250
He told me to drop off the phone
for you so I dropped off the phone.

500
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,010
And my daughter? My daughter?!?

501
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:03,505
You know, the whole bottom fell out of
our operation when you went away, Will.

502
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:05,719
I mean, look around you, does it look
like I'm puttin' on the Ritz here?

503
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:08,214
We want our share, just our share.

504
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:19,021
So help me God, Hoyt, you tell me where she is,
or I'll blow your lunch all over this carpet.

505
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:24,606
He's  drivin' around with her,
in the trunk of his cab.

506
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:28,258
- In the trunk?
- And I gotta be honest with you, Will, 'cause

507
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:30,881
I didn't think the taking of
your daughter part was right.

508
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:36,042
I mean, bad idea to steal from
America's greatest bank robber.

509
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:47,726
After he had lost the leg,
something changed in him, Will.

510
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:51,952
He said he just felt numb to
everything, numb like a statue.

511
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:57,320
And he blames that on you, Will.
He blames the leg on you,

512
00:49:57,365 --> 00:50:00,771
so he also blames the numb on you.

513
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,358
Go.

514
00:50:49,586 --> 00:50:52,952
Let the squirrels squabble,
then we'll go after their hoard.

515
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,431
Hold it!

516
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,987
Let's go!

517
00:51:30,232 --> 00:51:34,089
Will, stop.

518
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:14,898
Street level! Go!.

519
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:29,101
What the hell are you doing?

520
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,522
Man, are you listening, tapioca?

521
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:33,980
Just go, please.

522
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,725
Medallion.

523
00:53:55,889 --> 00:53:58,858
License and registration, please.

524
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:02,476
Do you know why I pulled you over?

525
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:07,115
- I do not.
- Your brake light's out.

526
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:10,413
- What's funny?
- Nothing, it's just...

527
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,110
it's Mardi Gras, and the streets
are filled with drunken lunatics

528
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,642
and you pull me over for a broke, brake light.

529
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:19,507
Help.

530
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:23,077
That reminds me of my father
who's dying of bone cancer.

531
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:27,673
all day he'd bitch about the nick he
got on his chin from shaving that morning.

532
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:32,372
I know what you're thinking:
Why would a dying man shave?

533
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:36,775
No, I wasn't thinking that at all.

534
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:39,928
Get this vehicle back to the barn
and get that light taken care of.

535
00:54:43,856 --> 00:54:46,134
Please, can you hear me?

536
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,559
Because he had tremendous vanity.

537
00:54:52,117 --> 00:54:55,943
Sir, you mind coming around
here and open the trunk?

538
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:03,587
He did not go gently, my father.
He screamed a lot.

539
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,417
The pain was agonizing, searing.

540
00:55:09,508 --> 00:55:13,166
- Eels squirming through his veins.
- Buddy, I don't really give a damn.

541
00:55:55,102 --> 00:56:00,247
Somebody help me.

542
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:03,099
Somebody please help me.

543
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:08,497
C'mon, you look more like him than I thought.

544
00:56:08,592 --> 00:56:10,861
- No.
- You don't remember me?

545
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:13,881
You were young, Princess,
and I did look a little different.

546
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:17,343
I had all my fingers then and both legs.

547
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,813
Nice fingers, sweetie.

548
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,876
You know that the FBI, they use these
little lines in order to find people.

549
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,757
Until they were looking for me, anyway.

550
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:30,316
But, one day, I came up with a plan.

551
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:34,202
Yeah, I dug up a body, see, it wasn't hard,
the resemblance was reasonable.

552
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:39,683
Then I cut him up into small pieces,
and added a little bit of myself to the mix.

553
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:44,754
I was a Golden Boy, dollface,
now I'm a freakin' Picasso.

554
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:52,428
And don't ever mess with my lights again.

555
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:01,270
What are you looking at, shrimp?

556
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,781
Listen, brother, take the cab, take the money and
take the cab, I don't give a crap, but don't take me.

557
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,122
- What is this?
- It's a meter.

558
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:15,116
No, I know what a meter is, asshole.
Not that, this.

559
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:17,991
This, GPS, everyone has 'em,
in case the cars are stolen.

560
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:20,583
- Tells you their location?
- Within a few blocks, yes.

561
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:22,463
Okay, call your dispatch.

562
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:27,879
Man, you have got to clean out that backseat,
before you sign-off tonight.

563
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,342
Yesterday I had to put on a biohazard suit,
hip-waders, and rubber gloves

564
00:57:32,391 --> 00:57:35,228
and I got the garden hoe and
scraped that crap outta there.

565
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:40,090
Looked like boogers or jalapeno jelly, asshole.

566
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:43,287
- I got a question for you.
- 9 inches.

567
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:45,985
And it can reload after 14 minutes and a tickle.

568
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:47,009
<i>What else do you want to know?</i>

569
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,438
About the driver.

570
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,992
<i>Is this about me docking you pay
again on account that fender-bender,</i>

571
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,196
the same policy applies for
everybody and I ain't lippin'

572
00:57:57,752 --> 00:58:01,207
- No, it's not about that.
- A white guy with a fake leg.

573
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:04,544
- It is a white man with a fake leg.
- Maybe missing some fingers.

574
00:58:04,926 --> 00:58:06,470
- Really?
- Tell him.

575
00:58:06,513 --> 00:58:08,302
And maybe missing some fingers.

576
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:11,591
Are you messin' with me today?

577
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:13,187
<i>Whatchya want him fo?</i>

578
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,762
He cuts me off at the light.

579
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:16,389
<i>You think I give a snot, huh?</i>

580
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:18,978
Tell him he's stealing money,
you saw him pocketing fares.

581
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:22,400
- He's stealin' fares, pocketed.
- Wait!

582
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:27,360
<i>Are you saying that this creepy, limpin' bastard
be runnin' around snitchin' my dough.</i>

583
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:30,075
- Get his location.
- Where is he right now?

584
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,831
- Whatchya wanna know dat fo?
- I confront him for you, get the truth.

585
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:42,542
- You would do that for me, Bertrand?
- You're a good boss.

586
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:47,234
In the French Quarter,

587
00:58:47,428 --> 00:58:48,849
<i>Bugundy and St. Philip.</i>

588
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,848
- Thank you.
- Well done, get his medallion number.

589
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:56,636
- And his medallion number.
- Man.

590
00:58:56,688 --> 00:59:00,473
He a freaky disk, dis guy, you best
be careful there, Berty Boy.

591
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,685
- Get out
- It's all yours, brother.

592
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:08,922
<i>It's 5-KILO-2-0.</i>

593
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,987
Again, that's 5-K-20.

594
00:59:11,413 --> 00:59:12,826
Thanks, pal.

595
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:18,210
Lookie here, did you just turn
white on me all of a sudden?

596
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,747
Who dat is?

597
01:00:11,497 --> 01:00:15,851
Do you remember where we dropped off Montgomery?
His daughter's address.

598
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:19,237
- Yeah, it's Coronado and something.
- Prentiss.

599
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:24,632
Boss, we got a matching Montgomery's
description just jacked a cab 5 blocks from here.

600
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:29,108
Get this, the cabby said he was sweating about
a guy missing a leg and his fingers.

601
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:31,822
The tracking is throwing the
cab back into the Quarter.

602
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:03,758
- Don't hurt me, man.
- Who's cab is this?

603
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:06,893
It's mine, but that ain't my number.

604
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,140
Open the trunk.

605
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,651
There he is, we got him.

606
01:02:16,072 --> 01:02:18,476
What, that's someone else's GPS.

607
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:23,110
Montgomery!
Put your god damned knees on the ground.

608
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,287
Will Montgomery you are under
arrest for violation of parole,

609
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:30,539
illegally accessing confidential
FBI records, assaulting a federal agent,

610
01:02:30,628 --> 01:02:32,371
and resisting arrest.

611
01:02:32,922 --> 01:02:35,755
- We're bringin' him back now.
- You gotta listen to me.

612
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,340
- No, we don't.
- He's going to kill her.

613
01:02:38,385 --> 01:02:42,551
Oh, it's a neat story, Vincent Kinsey
has come back from the dead. Yeah.

614
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,477
Hey, if I were comin' back from the dead
it wouldn't be for daughter killin',

615
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:52,349
it'd be to go to Rick's Cabaret
to see some naked ladies.

616
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:56,688
- I gotta take that.
- Ah, ya want me to take a message?

617
01:02:56,783 --> 01:03:00,530
- I've got only eight rings to pick up that call.
- Hey, hey, sit back.

618
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,200
Hello?

619
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:45,198
I'm here.

620
01:03:50,518 --> 01:03:51,978
I'm here.

621
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,878
You're really comin' down to the
wire on this one, eh, Gum?

622
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,295
We're gonna have trouble getting out of your pocket?

623
01:03:58,263 --> 01:04:01,262
I'm not, I just... I just...

624
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,968
Sounds like you're out of breath.

625
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,605
<i>Tell me something, Gum.</i>

626
01:04:04,688 --> 01:04:06,976
What's the scenery like down there in Tuscaloosa?

627
01:04:07,149 --> 01:04:09,140
I always wanted to take that ride along the Gulf.

628
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:10,733
I don't have it.

629
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:14,905
And better yet, why don't you tell me how Hoyt's
doing since that's where you were anyway.

630
01:04:14,993 --> 01:04:16,534
I don't have the money.

631
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:19,658
What did I say to you about lying to me?

632
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:22,499
I'm sorry, I just... I just...

633
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:25,917
- Your daughter's dead.
- No, wait, wait!

634
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:29,295
You really don't have it, do you?

635
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:33,380
- I'll get you the money.
- Good.

636
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:35,048
May I ask how?

637
01:04:39,015 --> 01:04:40,925
We're going back to "wrong".

638
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:54,280
You got a real 40 went down the alley,
okay, we gotta set-up a perimeter.

639
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:56,026
Move! Clear out!

640
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:42,923
Hello?

641
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:36,745
What's going on?
Where are the Feds at?

642
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:41,305
- There's no time, Vincent's alive.
- What? What are you talking about?

643
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:44,895
He wants 10 million dollars, he wants it
in 3 hours and he has Alison.

644
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:47,167
Oh, my God!

645
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:51,435
The bank we robbed that night,
there was something else in that vault,

646
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:54,866
a gold reserve, it must've been 100 million, easy.

647
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:56,950
There's no way you can walk in there

648
01:06:57,037 --> 01:07:00,906
and steal 10 million dollars worth of
gold bricks in the middle of the business day.

649
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:03,328
That's why I need your help.

650
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,142
- I already told you, this isn't my life anymore.
- I know, I know.

651
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:10,510
- And it's not yours either.
- He's going to kill her.

652
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:17,553
I can... I can hear it in his voice,
He's not the same person.

653
01:07:20,065 --> 01:07:22,353
He's gonna kill my little girl.

654
01:07:49,303 --> 01:07:53,176
- Are you LeFleur?
- Yes, Sir, I am. LeFleur, yes, Sir.

655
01:07:53,264 --> 01:07:56,103
A guy jacked your cab a little while ago,
he was looking for someone.

656
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:59,396
Well, he was looking fo dat Mog...
Jimmy Morgan, Sir.

657
01:07:59,438 --> 01:08:01,898
Be a peach and show me his hack license, will ya.

658
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:05,621
Yes, officer, Sir.
I'll look it up for you, Inspector.

659
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:09,740
He been with us two years, never any problem.

660
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:11,323
Although...

661
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:16,278
He do scare my kids when they come
to visit their daddy at work.

662
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:18,955
More kids are in their twenties.

663
01:08:22,802 --> 01:08:24,423
That's him, Kinsey.

664
01:08:26,633 --> 01:08:30,472
Much obliged. Let's go!

665
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:47,153
Fat Tuesday, everybody go crazy.

666
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:28,107
We're 6 blocks away from the bank,
do you realize that?

667
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,693
Have a little faith.

668
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:36,491
I considered doing this for the last eight years.

669
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,076
30 meters, then we go left.

670
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:30,612
Montgomery doesn't have the money,
but he NEEDS the money.

671
01:11:30,705 --> 01:11:32,867
Which means he's got only one play to make.

672
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,875
Give me a list of every bank that he stepped
into in the City of New Orleans.

673
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:40,546
My guess is one of them is
going to step into the game.

674
01:11:52,272 --> 01:11:53,684
We're through.

675
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:58,231
- 5 minutes 'til the alarm.
- Is that going to be enough?

676
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:08,622
Here it comes.

677
01:12:54,713 --> 01:12:57,677
Fire alarm just went off
at Parrish Community Bank.

678
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,631
That's him! Get up there now!

679
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,853
Hurry up, boys!

680
01:13:26,788 --> 01:13:28,836
The alarm will have
triggered by now, we gotta go.

681
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,460
Just wanna see if I can get
a little more gold out of it.

682
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,748
Would you hurry up, Sir?

683
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,877
Come on, Will, we gotta go.

684
01:14:15,947 --> 01:14:17,524
Come on!

685
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:34,331
What do you know.

686
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:18,304
So you worked all this out in the prison?

687
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,601
I was bored.

688
01:15:24,147 --> 01:15:25,619
Boss! Hey! Listen to this.

689
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:26,270
Say again.

690
01:15:26,277 --> 01:15:27,717
<i>We have the key suspects.</i>

691
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,267
<i>They're in Riley's truck on North Peters
heading towards the ferry.</i>

692
01:15:30,362 --> 01:15:32,435
Do not take them until
they're off the ferry,

693
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:35,363
<i>I repeat, do not take them
until they're off the ferry.</i>

694
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:37,565
We take 'em now, we got 'em boxed in.

695
01:15:37,668 --> 01:15:39,388
If you want to corner a weasel,
this is the one that got bit.

696
01:15:39,389 --> 01:15:41,102
Boss, I hope you
know what you're doing.

697
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:43,012
Takes only eight minutes to get
across the river in that ferry.

698
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:45,129
Wait for "strength in numbers".

699
01:15:45,202 --> 01:15:48,716
And when we get Montgomery, he'll
be as red-handed as the boy who put

700
01:15:48,717 --> 01:15:52,348
his palm on the gas stove to
see how hot it really was.

701
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:53,645
Okay.

702
01:16:00,934 --> 01:16:04,763
Don't make a move until all 4 wheels
touch Louisiana soil.

703
01:16:04,846 --> 01:16:06,394
<i>Copy that.</i>

704
01:16:34,763 --> 01:16:37,558
Hands in the air. In the air, now!

705
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:42,887
Happy Fat Tuesday, officer.

706
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:44,021
Come on, come on, come on, get up! Get out!

707
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:48,630
<i>Time's is up, good buddy.</i>

708
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:50,331
I've got it.

709
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:53,375
I am impressed.

710
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:55,495
Do you listen to a little
Creedence before you went in?

711
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,718
No, I didn't listen to CCR, that didn't
work out so well the last time, did it?

712
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:05,224
- I missed you, old buddy.
- I want to talk to her.

713
01:18:05,328 --> 01:18:07,372
No, you'll talk to her when I get me the money.

714
01:18:07,612 --> 01:18:09,672
I want to talk to my daughter NOW!

715
01:18:09,673 --> 01:18:11,733
<i>I want to hear her voice NOW!</i>

716
01:18:11,957 --> 01:18:14,297
- It's your father.
- Hello.

717
01:18:14,407 --> 01:18:18,084
- Allison, Alison, did he hurt you?
- No.

718
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:20,240
<i>But he scares me.</i>

719
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:22,624
I gonna be there soon, honey,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

720
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,588
<i>This is my fault.</i>

721
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:29,405
Get my money to the fairgrounds NOW!

722
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:45,429
Sorry, boss.

723
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:49,552
Finally thought I recognized the
skills of Will Montgomery, huh?

724
01:18:49,645 --> 01:18:51,744
Do you have those listings
from the cab's dispatcher.

725
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,850
GPS breakdowns, why?

726
01:18:54,838 --> 01:18:58,151
I told you Kinsey ditched his GPS in the
back of the cab in the French Quarter.

727
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:01,335
I'm not interested in todays,
I want to see the last few weeks.

728
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:02,873
Kinsey gonna get the money from Montgomery

729
01:19:02,964 --> 01:19:07,085
then he's gonna have some kind of
neutral rendezvous, and if that's the case

730
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,548
he's been casing it for weeks.

731
01:19:08,634 --> 01:19:11,388
Uptown, Lakefront, Beauvoir, Broadmoor, West Bank.

732
01:19:11,471 --> 01:19:14,473
Beauvoir? Isn't that the fairground?

733
01:19:14,558 --> 01:19:17,112
Yeah, I think so.
20 minutes from out of town.

734
01:19:18,106 --> 01:19:19,232
Doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.

735
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:21,853
It's the dough, Boss,
we'll actually catch this prick.

736
01:19:59,816 --> 01:20:02,835
Where's Allison?

737
01:20:06,114 --> 01:20:08,806
In the trunk?

738
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,789
- You look good, Will. Same.
- Where is she?

739
01:20:16,488 --> 01:20:19,608
She's safe.

740
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:42,562
The money. Hand her over.

741
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:47,792
I said hand her over!

742
01:20:48,401 --> 01:20:51,823
You got the money, you win!
Vincent!

743
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:54,435
Over a janitor.

744
01:20:54,471 --> 01:21:00,519
You piss away 14 years of friendship
over an old man janitor?

745
01:21:00,757 --> 01:21:03,566
We're not killers.

746
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:08,175
- Well, maybe not then.
- None of this has anything to do with my daughter.

747
01:21:10,202 --> 01:21:14,613
But it does, Will, because you TRULY love Alison.

748
01:21:14,706 --> 01:21:19,250
And in that single act of
betrayal 8 years ago, YOU

749
01:21:19,339 --> 01:21:24,962
destroy the only thing I ever truly loved.

750
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,553
Me.

751
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:37,062
No! No!

752
01:21:39,569 --> 01:21:43,796
Daddy! Daddy, please!

753
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:53,062
Get me out of here.

754
01:21:57,337 --> 01:22:00,207
Help.

755
01:22:03,455 --> 01:22:06,225
Daddy, hurry, it's hot in here.

756
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:14,486
Help.

757
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:25,455
No.

758
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:17,692
Help.

759
01:24:24,953 --> 01:24:27,692
I got you, I got you.

760
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:09,602
Forehead. You're bleeding.

761
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:17,083
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

762
01:25:20,222 --> 01:25:25,247
I don't want to be alone, so don't die.
Don't die, please.

763
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:30,975
Somebody help us.

764
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:34,727
No, you can't die.

765
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:37,978
Just stay with me.

766
01:25:41,911 --> 01:25:49,313
They're coming, they're coming, hang in there.
Over here! Over here!

767
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:52,120
There.

768
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:56,950
It's gonna be okay.

769
01:26:15,531 --> 01:26:18,118
No, no, no, he can't die.
You gotta save him.

770
01:26:18,242 --> 01:26:20,614
Come on, let's get him out of here.

771
01:26:37,764 --> 01:26:39,506
You gonna send him back to jail?

772
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:44,771
Now, why would I do that? I'm sure that
Vincent Kinsey stole that gold. Take her up!

773
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:51,441
- Alison.
- I'm here, Dad.

774
01:27:50,612 --> 01:27:52,170
Hi, Dad.

775
01:27:52,258 --> 01:27:53,718
I'll call a HAZMAT team.

776
01:27:53,761 --> 01:27:55,923
- Why?
- You're cooking again.

777
01:27:57,933 --> 01:28:00,139
Wake me up if something happens.

778
01:28:18,914 --> 01:28:20,951
You ever clean your truck?

779
01:28:25,293 --> 01:28:28,430
Honey, can you flip the shrimp in 3 minutes?

780
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:32,465
- Let go of control, Dad, I got it.
- I'm letting go.

781
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:41,078
Definitely north of 3 hundred thousand dollars.

782
01:28:41,602 --> 01:28:43,846
The house could use a new roof and kitchen...

783
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:48,271
He's got it! He's got that missing 10 pounds of gold.
That's what they're talking about.

784
01:28:48,362 --> 01:28:51,239
- That something enough for you?
- Yeah, that is something.

785
01:28:52,047 --> 01:28:55,577
<i>- Well, if you take that gold...
- I know, I know, they'll nail me.</i>

786
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:57,241
I can't see his lips.

787
01:28:57,394 --> 01:29:00,504
<i>I'm gonna disappear it in... in the mud.</i>

788
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:05,972
<i>There.</i>

789
01:29:07,131 --> 01:29:09,855
He's not going to throw it.

790
01:29:09,891 --> 01:29:12,251
He just might and if he does wink I'll jack 'im.

791
01:29:12,345 --> 01:29:14,170
- Don't throw it.
- Look.

792
01:29:14,652 --> 01:29:20,225
- Don't do it!
- Do it!

793
01:29:20,261 --> 01:29:23,567
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Do it!

794
01:29:29,435 --> 01:29:30,815
Yeah, sure! Keep it!

795
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:35,960
Sell it, get rich.
And then go back to jail.

796
01:29:38,661 --> 01:29:42,447
No. All right.
Goin' in.

797
01:29:54,015 --> 01:30:00,348
Oh, thank you, Will.
I'll return to my life now.
