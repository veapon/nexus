2
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,696
TARS: Mars,

3
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,600
so you name it,
and think that you know it.

4
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,868
The Red Planet.

5
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,967
No air, no life.

6
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:50,639
But you do not know Mars,
for its true name is Barsoom.

7
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,386
And it is not airless, nor is it dead,

8
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,781
but it is dying.

9
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,220
The city of Zodanga saw to that.

10
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,096
Zodanga, the predator city,

11
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,793
moving, devouring,

12
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,105
draining Barsoom of energy and life.

13
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,240
Only the great city of Helium
dared resist, stood strong,

14
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,679
matched Zodanga airship for airship,

15
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,149
holding fast for a thousand years.

16
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,287
Until one day the ruler of Zodanga

17
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,689
became cornered in a sandstorm.

18
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,152
And everything changed.

19
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,224
(EXPLOSION)

20
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,531
I need clean lights!

21
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,657
Full loft, aye!

22
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,861
(SCREAMS)

23
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,896
Full loft!

24
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,879
Intensity full!

25
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,217
- Hard turn! Come about!
- Facing new plot!

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,790
No time! Hard turn now!

27
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,557
(ALL SHOUTING)

28
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,535
There!

29
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,673
- Shadow!
- Shadow!

30
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,815
(BATTLE CRY)

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,285
Death to Helium!

32
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,523
(SCREAMING)

33
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,004
Being a fool is a great luxury, Sab Than.

34
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,370
Get up.

35
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,674
Who... What are you?

36
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,754
We serve the Goddess.

37
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,284
And she has chosen you
to receive this weapon.

38
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,196
Do as we command
and you will rule all of Barsoom.

39
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,691
With none to defy you.

40
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,698
And nothing to stand in your way.

41
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,836
(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

42
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,313
- (LAUGHING BREATHLESSLY)
- Ma'am.

43
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,491
Ten words a minimum.

44
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,502
That's 50 cents,
unless you want special delivery.

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,299
Special delivery it is.

46
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,308
Name of sender?

47
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,140
Carter.

48
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,009
John Carter.

49
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,647
CONDUCTOR: Croton-on-Hudson!

50
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,383
Mr. Burroughs? I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.

51
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,117
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.

52
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,300
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton,
your uncle's attorney.

53
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,778
My deepest sympathies.

54
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,311
His death came as a shock to all of us.

55
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,975
He was a model of health and vigor.

56
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,746
He just dropped dead in his study

57
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,585
not five minutes after sending
word for me and the doctor.

58
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,093
When I arrived he was already gone.

59
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,434
The man never stopped digging.

60
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,335
All over the world.

61
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,244
No soon he started digging one hole
than he was off to Java

62
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,779
or the Orkney Islands to dig another.

63
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,273
He said it was pure research,

64
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:01,786
but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

65
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,950
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

66
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,206
Every inch a cavalry man,
to the very end.

67
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,869
Mother always said that Jack
never really came back from the war.

68
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,008
That it was only his body
that went west.

69
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,955
He used to tell me
the most wondrous stories.

70
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,289
I'd like to pay my respects.

71
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,325
DALTON: You won't find a keyhole.

72
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,960
Thing only opens from the inside.

73
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,732
He insisted.

74
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,671
No embalming,
an open coffin, no funeral.

75
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,968
You don't acquire the kind of
wealth your uncle commanded

76
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,240
by being like the rest of us.

77
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,974
Come. Let's go inside.

78
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,662
"And lastly, I hereby direct

79
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,207
"that my estate
shall be held in trust for 25 years,

80
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,936
"the income to benefit
my beloved nephew,

81
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,943
"Edgar Rice Burroughs,

82
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,447
"at the end of which term
the principal will revert to him.

83
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,578
"In full."

84
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:51,388
Of course I always adored him,
but it's been so long.

85
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,792
Why me?

86
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,391
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

87
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,568
It was his private journal.

88
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,577
He was most explicit that you,

89
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,580
and only you, would read its contents.

90
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,448
Now, you might possibly find
some kind of explanation in here.

91
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,121
I'll leave you now.

92
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:23,490
Again, my condolences.

93
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,756
JOHN: My dear Edgar,

94
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,795
I remember how
I used to take you on my knee

95
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,592
and tell you wild tales,

96
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,532
which you always
did me the great courtesy of believing.

97
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,693
Now you are grown.

98
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,429
Time and space have parted us,

99
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,598
but I reach out across that distance

100
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,232
to that same wide-eyed boy

101
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,402
and ask him to believe me once more.

102
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,305
This wild tale begins 13 years ago

103
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,110
in the Arizona Territory

104
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,879
between the Pinaleo Mountains

105
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,749
and the backside of hell.

106
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,804
(LAUGHTER)

107
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,436
Ah.

108
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,873
Coming to load up on spider bait.

109
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,679
(MAN LAUGHS)

110
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,378
No more, Carter.

111
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,583
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?

112
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,614
- Yes, you're a goddamn loon!
- (LAUGHTER)

113
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,226
I done took all your money, Carter.

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,191
Your tab's $100 in arrears.

115
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,523
I'll pay.

116
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,460
This old Yavapai I met
said he'd seen a cave...

117
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,628
No. Stop! Not one more word
about your cave of gold.

118
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,199
MAN 2: Oh, now, now.

119
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,203
Show some respect!

120
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,977
It's the evil spider cave of gold.
(LAUGHS)

121
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,574
You're cut off, Carter.

122
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,051
Now get on home.

123
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,987
MAN 1: Now, I do believe

124
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,592
he done told you to get on out of here.

125
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,990
I'll leave when these bags are full.

126
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,807
I found that two days ago up by Bonita.

127
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,576
That ought to cover my tab
and then some.

128
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,616
Beans.

129
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,153
The first item is beans.

130
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,848
SERGEANT: John Carter?

131
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,657
Your presence
is requested up at the fort.

132
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,056
I suggest you come peaceably.

133
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,597
Do you, now?

134
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,730
(COUGHS)

135
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:31,672
You are a difficult man to find,
Captain John Carter.

136
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,482
First Virginia Cavalry,

137
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,885
Army of Northern Virginia,

138
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,081
Confederate States of America.

139
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,921
I'm Colonel Powell.

140
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,792
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry
of the United States...

141
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,887
(GRUNTS)

142
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,530
Excellent horseman.

143
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,706
Fine swordsman.

144
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,241
Decorated six times,
including the Southern Cross of Honor.

145
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:06,175
At Five Forks, the company under
your command nearly turned the tide.

146
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,612
(GRUNTS)

147
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,248
In short, a born fighter.

148
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,993
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam,

149
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,328
a necessary man for the defense
of the Arizona Territory.

150
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,797
No.

151
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,665
Son, we are up to
our chinstraps in Apaches.

152
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,828
Ain't my concern.

153
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,463
I believe it is your concern, Captain.

154
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,304
Folks are being attacked
in their own homes. Slain.

155
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,277
You started it. You finish it.

156
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,981
You've gone native, have you?

157
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,142
Apaches can go to hell, too.

158
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,912
We're nothing but a warring species,
and I want no part of it.

159
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,285
You're a cavalry man.

160
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,258
That makes you valuable
to our country and our cause.

161
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,761
Colonel Powell, sir,

162
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,764
whatever it is you suppose I owe you,

163
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,666
our country or any other beloved cause,

164
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,864
I have already paid.

165
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,440
I have paid in full, sir.

166

Dejah, ever since you were a little girl,

337
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,725
you've always met the expectations
placed on you.

338
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,075
It's Sab's terms.

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,705
What are they?

340
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,847
He will spare Helium

341
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,381
if you accept his hand in marriage.

342
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,187
No!

343
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,485
He is a monster!

344
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,582
You must refuse him!

345
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,562
He's already on his way here.

346
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,192
But all of my work...

347
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,732

348
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,631
- Dejah!
- How can you...

349
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,397
You can't just bow down to Zodanga!

350
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,768
A wedding will save the city.

351
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,898
Perhaps, but it could lose you Barsoom.

352

Dejah!

353
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,510
With no one to stop Zodanga,
it will be the beginning of the end!

354
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,207
- We do not have the luxury...
- You are the Jeddak of Helium!

355
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,907
You must find another way!

356
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,677
There is no other way!

357
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,961
If there were,
I would risk anything to seize it.

358

This is the chance we have been given.

359
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,105

360
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,878
No.

361

It is your will.

362
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,250
So, when I was little,
and we would look up at the stars

363
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,959

whose glory was written in the sky,

would be written on it?

Let go! Bad dog!

00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,967
You are ugly, but you are beautiful.

508

515
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:21,889
Yes, my Jeddak!

has conquered us,

517

has found a way to defeat you

519

and now you seek
a mighty weapon of your own.

520
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,644
But Virginia fights for us!

521

I don't fight for anyone.

527
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:09,104
Virginia, reject this honor

528
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,046

the safety of your red girl.

War is a shameful thing.

Not when a noble cause is taken up
by those who can make a difference.

535
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,109
You made a difference today, Virginia.

536
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,552
Okay.

537
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,317
See, my name is John Carter.

538
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,390
Virginia is where I'm from.

539
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,023
Where did you learn to jump that way?

540
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,961
I don't know.

541
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,897
How'd you learn to fly?

542
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,629
Your ships cannot sail
on light in Virginia?

543
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,507
No, Professor.

544
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,036
See, our ships sail the seas.

Must be the density of your bones.

- Jump for me.
- SOLA: Enough!

There will be time for playfulness later.

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,863
I want no playfulness from him.

552
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,196
I want his help.

553
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,766
Explain to me how you do it.

about the time of oceans.

- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.

She is a good match for you,

Don't call me that.

There are no seas on the planet.

Then Cosoom.

I'm on Mars.

So, now home is Jasoom

No. Not like that.

00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,596

Well, that explains everything, then.

- It does?
- Yes.

You're a Thern

Yes.

What does she say?

00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,782
You called me a Thern.

Is that what she is?

No, she is Issus.

608

Therns are holy messengers
of the Goddess.

00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,872
My right arms offend me.

673
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,708
I will cut them off.

674
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,608
No.

675
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,819
You must hurry. I mean to release you.

676
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,160
I make one condition.

677
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,629
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

678
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,958
My Jeddak.

679
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,067
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess

680
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,070
than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

681
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,973
Where you go, she goes.

682
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,608
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?

683
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,202
Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

684
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,119
Is it done, my Jeddak?

685
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,359
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

686
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,191
JOHN: Woola!

687
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:56,763
You belong to him.

688
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,368
Woola would follow you
anywhere on Barsoom.

689
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,463
DEJAH: It's three days' ride. Follow me.

690
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,187
JOHN: What happened to this place?

691
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,390
DEJAH: Zodanga happened.

692
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,440
Sailing on light.

693
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,844
Still playing the madman?

694
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,370
Or the liar.

695
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,687
DEJAH: Keep moving! We'll get there!

696
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,640
SAB THAN: Why pursue this wedding
any longer? I've already won.

697
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,734
Not yet. You must aim past the horizon,
Sab Than.

698
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:52,838
To truly demoralize a nation requires a
public spectacle on the grandest scale.

699
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:56,009
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

700
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,711
If you insist.

701
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:02,089
If you cannot see the wisdom in that,
then we will find another who can.

702
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,807
Dotar Sojat.

703
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,102
Carter!

704
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,512
I do not think she leads us to the Iss.

705
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,988
All right, then, Sola.

706
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,157
Just play along.

707
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:37,748
(GASPS)

708
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,795
What do you think I'd do
once I saw your city and not some river?

709
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,624
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.

710
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,056
They should be at our backs by now.

711
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,466
You lead us toward Helium!

712
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,671
Once we reach there,

713
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,142
you would see for yourself
the virtue of our cause.

(SCOFFS)

715

their cause is virtuous... Professor.

No!

John Carter!

720
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,186
You can't!

721
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,921
I like this plan better.

722
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,554
Just wait.

723
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,098
She'll come around.

724
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:20,135
You mad fool!

725
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,833
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!

726
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,800
I only told you what you wanted to hear
so you'd get us out!

727
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:28,667
Stop!

728
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,075
I can't!

729
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,181
I cannot marry him!

730
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,481
Can't marry who?

731
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,107
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

732
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,185
Sab Than.

733
01:02:44,786 --> 01:02:48,017
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

734
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,713
Your father?

735
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:52,189
Tardos Mors.

736
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,454
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

737
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,760
A princess of Mars.

738
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,335
How about that?

739
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:06,198
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

740
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,140
No.

741
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,437
Is that all there is to the story?

742
01:03:11,012 --> 01:03:13,776
No, I didn't run away!

743
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:17,009
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

744
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:19,446
So marry the guy and save your people.

745
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,318
A life of oppression!
That's not living! (GASPS)

746
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,234
If you had the means to save others,

747
01:03:34,336 --> 01:03:37,362
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

748
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,774
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

749
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:45,712
I would lay down my life for Helium.

750
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:52,678
Yes, I ran away.

751
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,756
I was afraid,

752
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:57,989
weak.

753
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:02,830
Maybe I should have married.

754
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:10,697
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

755
01:04:14,743 --> 01:04:18,008
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

756
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:21,613
there are no Gates of Iss.

757
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:23,879
They are not real.

758
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,327
I'm sorry, Princess.

759
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:39,132
But this, this is real.

760
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:45,239
And so is my cave of gold.

761
01:04:57,419 --> 01:04:59,444
Prudence demands you take an escort.

762
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:00,851
No.

763
01:05:00,955 --> 01:05:02,923
I go alone, General.

764
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:05,817
But, Jeddak...

765
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:08,953
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

766
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:11,157
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

767
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,969
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

768
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:22,700
I'm starting to talk like you.

Hekkador, they have reached the Iss.

It took them longer than I thought.

771

THERN 2: If they reach the Gates...

772
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,386

They can breach the sanctuary.

773

of the Ninth Ray is already...

777
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,870
I'm already there.

778

779
01:06:06,454 --> 01:06:09,287

01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,842
It is my way, Dotar Sojat, not yours.

786
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,079
I must honor my Jeddak
and redeem my unworthiness!

you're the only one worthy of him.

Just help me find the Gates.

what honor requires.

What do you think it says?

839
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,154
It appears to be
a kind of technical diagram.

840
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,424
Here is Barsoom. There is Jasoom.

841
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:29,555
This glyph here,

842
01:12:29,662 --> 01:12:33,530
it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy,

843
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:37,093
sent along these lines here,
between the worlds.

844
01:12:37,336 --> 01:12:38,325
Like...

845
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,405

846
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,333
You're saying I was telegraphed here.

847
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:46,577
I'm a copy of myself.

848

Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

I don't like guessing.

850
01:12:58,023 --> 01:13:01,015
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

851
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,693
Right.

852
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,764
And where might we find those?

853
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,601
In the Hall of Science.

854
01:13:11,404 --> 01:13:13,372
And where's that?

855
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,573
Helium.

856
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:19,641
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

857
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:21,171
What do you take me for?

858
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,578
I take you for a man who's lost.

how to work this thing!

I will!

861
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:30,286
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

862
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:33,317
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

870
01:13:59,452 --> 01:14:03,081
I felt the heart of a man
willing to lay down his life for others,

871
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:08,087
a man willing to fight for a cause.

Don't you see, Carter?

875
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,829
I fled to find another way.

- Who are you, sir?

1024
01:27:09,374 --> 01:27:12,036
"Sir." Definitely the South.

1025

1030

Sorry, sir. The streets are blocked.

1031

Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?

1077

History will follow
the course we have set, Earthman.

1078

And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.

1079

must remain in the hands

1081

And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

1082
01:31:14,919 --> 01:31:18,116
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

1083
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:21,454
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

1334
01:54:30,747 --> 01:54:32,772
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

1335
01:54:34,384 --> 01:54:36,375
I had that feeling you get, suddenly,

1336
01:54:38,154 --> 01:54:41,055
that you left a light burning

1337
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,553
or a door open.

1338
01:54:51,334 --> 01:54:53,359
Go back to bed.

1339
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:55,896
I won't be long.

1340
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,971
Be back in one xat,

1341
01:55:06,516 --> 01:55:08,575
John Carter of Earth.

1342
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,469
Come.

1343
01:55:56,967 --> 01:55:58,935
John Carter of Earth.

1344
01:56:12,682 --> 01:56:13,876
Yup.

1345
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:19,780
John Carter of Mars
sounds much better.

1346
01:56:25,261 --> 01:56:28,822
Sire, I must express the deepest
of gratitude for saving Helium.

1347
01:56:28,932 --> 01:56:30,866
Please. The honor is mine.

1348
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:33,196
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.

(GROANING AND PANTING)

1352
01:56:55,725 --> 01:56:57,750
No, no.

1353
01:57:00,296 --> 01:57:02,093
No.

1354
01:57:02,465 --> 01:57:03,727
Powell?

1355
01:57:13,076 --> 01:57:14,043
No!

1356
01:57:17,047 --> 01:57:19,072

Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:45,570
Bars... Barsoom.

1360
01:57:50,914 --> 01:57:55,044
50 million miles apart
and no way to bridge the gap.

1361
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:58,552
No way to return my body
and my soul to their true home.

1362
01:57:59,522 --> 01:58:02,320
Like a fool,
I had thrown away my medallion.

1363
01:58:05,128 --> 01:58:07,119
Then I recalled Matai Shang.

1364
01:58:07,297 --> 01:58:09,765
His knowledge of Earth, of my history.

1365
01:58:09,966 --> 01:58:12,161
It meant Therns
were a presence on this world.

1366
01:58:12,469 --> 01:58:14,266
The cave in Arizona was proof.

1367
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:18,068
There might be other such proofs,
other Thern way stations

1368
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:19,971
hidden all around the world.

1369
01:58:20,110 --> 01:58:23,341
I knew now what the cave
of gold must be used for.

1370
01:58:23,646 --> 01:58:26,410
So for ten bitter years, I searched.

1371
01:58:26,616 --> 01:58:28,277
On the trail of rumor and legend

1372
01:58:28,384 --> 01:58:31,353
I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns,

1373
01:58:31,454 --> 01:58:33,319
but I found no medallion.

1374
01:58:35,525 --> 01:58:38,494
And then it came to me.

1375
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:46,028
MAN: (SHOUTS AND
WHOOPS EXCITEDLY) I've got it!

1376
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:48,765
I've found it!

1377
01:58:48,872 --> 01:58:51,272
(EXCITED CHATTER)

1378
01:58:57,113 --> 01:58:59,240
JOHN: And once it came,
there were many plans

1379
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:01,247
I had to make in secret.

1380
01:59:01,351 --> 01:59:03,410
I could trust no one else.

1381
01:59:03,853 --> 01:59:08,119
I had long suspected that the Therns
were following my movements.

1382
01:59:14,864 --> 01:59:16,832
Sir.

1383
01:59:16,966 --> 01:59:19,127
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.

1384
01:59:20,203 --> 01:59:23,331
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1385
01:59:23,506 --> 01:59:25,474
And, Thompson...

1386
01:59:26,543 --> 01:59:28,443
My attorney as well.

1387
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,804
Of course, sir.

1388
01:59:37,887 --> 01:59:40,856
Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.

1389
01:59:46,696 --> 01:59:49,529
The reason
for my bizarre funeral instructions.

1390
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:56,731
Why the door can only be opened
from the inside.

1391
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:03,468
For if my body dies on Earth,
then my copy dies on Mars.

1392
02:00:05,748 --> 02:00:06,976
You are the key.

1393
02:00:07,083 --> 02:00:10,314
This is the task I entrust to you
along with all my fortune.

1394
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:13,651
Protect my body.
The Therns will attempt to destroy it.

1395
02:00:13,756 --> 02:00:15,849
In the time it has taken you
to read these pages,

1396
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,984
they may have already done so.

(PANTING)

1398
02:00:26,202 --> 02:00:28,193
I am the key. I am the key.

1399
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:30,397
I, Edgar.

Ed!

1403
02:00:37,947 --> 02:00:39,847
It should work!

1404
02:00:50,293 --> 02:00:52,022
Dear Ned.

1405
02:00:54,097 --> 02:00:56,088
You sneaky devil!

1406
02:00:56,232 --> 02:00:59,690
You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!

You never found the medallion.

1412
02:01:40,343 --> 02:01:41,571
No.

1413
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:46,039
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

1414
02:01:47,684 --> 02:01:51,120
I... I was just bait?

1415
02:01:51,354 --> 02:01:54,619
No. You're far more than that.

1416
02:01:55,024 --> 02:01:57,083
I really do need a protector.

1417
02:01:59,162 --> 02:02:01,289
That is, if you're willing.

1418
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:11,438
Goodbye, Ned.

1419
02:02:16,045 --> 02:02:18,104
Oh, and, Ned...

1420
02:02:19,215 --> 02:02:20,773
Take up a cause.

1421
02:02:20,883 --> 02:02:22,817
Fall in love.

1422
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:24,477
Write a book.

1423
02:02:26,556 --> 02:02:28,547
It's time I went home.
