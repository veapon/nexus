How's business?

24
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,010
日本人 做得很大
The Japanese are here in a big way.

25

劳动力低廉 厂房又大

一冲动就来了
You know, I came by on impulse.

40
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,850
我冲动了可会做点别的
Well, I could do with some impulse.

41
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,050
怎么了?
What happened?

42
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,250
家里付了赎金
Family paid the ransom

43
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,550
他们几天后就放了小孩回家
then they sent the kid home after a couple of days

44
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
当然是少了一只耳朵
minus an ear, of course.

45
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,370
现在墨西哥城有钱的母亲 都想请个好一点的保镖
Now every mother in Mexico City with a little bit of moneywants bigger and better bodyguards

46
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,340
我太太也想雇
my own wife included.

47
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,170
我真想反驳你 但她做得对 她做得对
I hate to break it to you, but she's right. She's right.

48
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,840
听着 山米 我的所有客户 都有被绑勒索的保险
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh, kidnap and ransom insurance.

49
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,200
我有保单 美商公司 我父亲给的
I have a policy. A.I.G. My dad gave it to me.

50
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,550
是 我知道 我帮你父亲保的
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

51
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,490
但你若不续保60天后怎么办?
But what are you gonna do in 60 days whenyou can't renew it?

52
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,820
- 这样不行 因为你没保镖 - 我知道 但我得让艾美里欧走
- You can't because you don't have a bodyguard. - I had to let Emilio go.

53
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,940
你得让莉莎开心 我是说 那样才算是个好丈夫
You gotta please Lisa. I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

54
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,580
听着 保镖就像其它东西一样
Look, a bodyguard's like anything else.

55
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,830
一分价钱一分货
You get whatyou pay for, okay?

56
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,820
你做得到 能找个有经验的保镖
You could do this. You get one that's got a decent resume.

57
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,330
我们又不找什么超人 对吧?
We're not looking for goddamn Superman here, right?

58
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,060
更新保单前找个便宜点的
Get someone cheap till you renew the policy

59
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,840
然后换掉那个不中用的人
and then, uh then fire the prick forwhatever. Incompetence.

60
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,170
言归正传 最重要的是 你女儿能回去上学
All kidding aside, the most important thing is thatyour daughter goes back to school

61
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,310
你太太也不用担心害怕
and thatyourwife gets to save face.

62
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,150
那样你一家就不会是唯一 小区内未受保护的人家
This way, you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood.

63
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,100
没错 当保镖 你的西班牙语够了
That's right. A bodyguard. YourSpanish is good enough.

64
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,600
- 你疯了 - 想想好的一面
- You're crazy. - You even look the part.

65
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,170
凭我这状态 连死人都保护不了
I n my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

66
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,080
是露财炫耀的有钱人 都是做给人看的
It's rich guys flashing their cash. It's all forshow.

67
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,210
- 不会有事的 - 是吗? 他们会雇老酒鬼吗?
- Nothing's gonna happen. - Yeah? You think they'd hire a drunk, a has- been?

68
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,300
你得自我克制一下
You have to keep it under control.

69
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,400
如果真有绑架 我该怎么办?
What if there was, you know, say, a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

70
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,400
尽力而为 人家付钱就是要你做得出色
You do your best. They're not gonna be payingyou enough to perform miracles.

71
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,990
- 不知道 - 也不是要你骗钱 克雷塞
- I don't know. - It's not exactly a scam, Crease.

72
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,260
- 使出你一半力气就足够了 - 是啊
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good. - Yeah.

73
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
保镖必须得贴身护人
Bodyguard's gotta be close to people though.

74
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,660
而且还得不停地说话 你知道这个我不在行
He gotta talk all the time, and I'm no good at that.

75
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,330
你是沉默型的 人家会感激的
You'll be the silent type. People are gonna appreciate that.

76
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,040
当保镖 雇主是谁?

Besides, I'm glad to see you. I got nobody to talk to down here.

I'm surprised anybody could afford you. What's the catch?

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,920
听着 也许我不太适合
Iook, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

269
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,820
也许你先生应该找个 更擅于社交的人
Maybe your husband should find somebodywho's a little more sociable.

270

你收了钱是保护她

我有信心你能做好

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,590
我明天和你们一起上学 希望大家相安无事
I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I hope that's all right.

274
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,500
你认为上帝会宽恕我们做的吗?
You think God will forgive us for what we've done?

275
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,920
我厌倦杀人 雷
I'm tired ofkillin ', Ray.

276
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,440
上帝会宽恕我们做的吗?
You think God will forgive us for what we 've done?

In my state, I couldn 't I couldn 't guard a corpse.

278
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,710
不停地说话

You know, I pulled the trigger and and and

291
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,620
什么也没发生
click, nothing.

292
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
你在说枪管哑火
You're talking about a bad primer.

293
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,750
是 是 是

296
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,290
就像我们过去说的

子弹会说真话

307
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,880
适应这里的交通不容易
It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.

308
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,060
是 对不起

00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,270
- 你是游泳健将 - 从来没赢过
- You're a strong swimmer. - I neverwin.

313
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,550
谢谢

314
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,380
- 我该怎么做? - 你认为你该怎么做?
- So what do I do? - What do you think you should do?

315
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,450
你在水里游得最快 在街上却走得最慢
You're the fastest one in the water, the slowest one off the blocks.

316
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,210
- 你认为是什么意思? 该怎么做? - 赶快走出街区
- What do you think that means? What do you gotta do? - Get faster off the blocks.

317

没错 赶快走出街区

318

323
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,480
也许你是慢了点
All right. Maybe you are slow then.

324
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,620
今晚我们请到了改革报社的 玛丽安娜 葛蕾诺

325
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,920
来谈谈关于绑架事件

326
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,020
你认为墨西哥 的绑架事件该由谁来负责?

327
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,900
这是有组织的犯罪活动 并非随意绑架事件

328
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,000
它们不是哥伦比亚那种政治绑架

329
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,210
快走 小鸟
Vamos, Bird!

330

它怎么会在外面?
How do you think he got out?

332
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,730
- 我放了它的 - 最好让其自由 是吗?
- I let him go. - It's better to be free, right?

333
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,600
对它是没错
It's better for him.

334
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,520
其实是它令我心烦

闭上眼睛?
Eyes are closed?

348
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,020
怎么了?
What happened?

349
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,530
- 吓我一跳 - 吓一跳? 枪声吓不了我
- I flinched. - You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

350
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,550
- 说一遍 - 枪声吓不了我
- Say it. - The gunshot holds no fear.

351
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,140
枪声吓不了我! 说一遍
The gunshot holds no fear! Say it.

352
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,210
- 枪声吓不了我 - 大声点!

355
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,710
你释放了你的声音
You welcome the sound.

356
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,130
其实是声音释放了你
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

357
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,340
在声音释放你之前 你就是这石块上的囚犯
You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free.

358
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,710
- 准备好了? - 是

Okay, like nowadays in- in the West, they have one husband for one wife.

369

- Why, you feel sorry for the husband? - Yeah.

372
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,310

Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?

373
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,810

Jordan Kalfus, andit looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals.

1104
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:37,840

你敢乱动
You move

1116
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,160
不说真话
you make one sound

1117
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,550
我就把你宰了 明白吗?
I'll snatch the life right outta you, you understand?

1118
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,460
怎么回事 莉莎?

1119

Yeah, the moneywas stolen. You're right. He's right.

1124
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:33,140
钱被威特 范托斯偷了 偷走多少?

他存入了凯门岛的银行户头 可惜他无命享用
that he put in an account in the Cayman Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

1130
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,880
另外500万在哪里 山姆?
What happened to the other five, Sam?

1131

- You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't have a wife.

1135
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:06,320
那你就不会知道告诉你太太真相有多难
Then you'll never know how hard it could be to tell your wife the truth.

1136
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:08,660

1146
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:42,180
乔丹告诉我她坐在房间里
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room

1147
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,580
整天都在看卡通片
and watch cartoons all day

1148
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:47,550
还有冰淇淋吃两天后就还给我们
and she'd eat ice cream and we'd have her back in two days.

1149
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,230
他骗我!
He lied to me!

1150
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:53,220
所以他得妈的去死! 我干的!
That's why he's fucking dead! I did it!

1151
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,470
我干的 莉莎!
I did it, Lisa!

1152
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:58,310
我同意了绑架
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1153
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:01,750
我做是为了我们 为了我们三个
I did it for us for the three of us.

1154
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,370
真抱歉 莉莎
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1155
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,470
杀了他
You kill him.

1156
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,900
你不杀我杀
You kill him or I will.

1157
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,300
你知道 他们都说
Huh. You know, they say a, um

1158
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,930
子弹会说真话
a bullet always tells the truth.

1159
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:12,990
从不说谎
It never lies.

1160
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:30,300
这对我不适用 山默尔 也许
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe

1161
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:35,070
也许对你适用
maybe it'll work for you.

1162
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,930
我会为你祈祷
I'll prayfor you.

1163
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:26,650
这就是由ATM卡得知的住址

1164
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:31,860
PIN密码帮了大忙

1165
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:36,730
但却根本没有 嗓音 这个人

1166
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:41,200
那是谁?

1167
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:43,170
就是他

01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,760
嗓音

1169
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:47,970
我的人进入了屋子

1170
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:52,490
以注射 霍乱 疫苗为借口

1171
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:57,220
我们必须注射整个区

1172
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:03,830
我们在屋子里装了窃听器 并偷走了他的照片

1173
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,590
现在是时候去追捕他了

01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:19,810
明天就让他的照片见报
