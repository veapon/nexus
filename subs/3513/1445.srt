1
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,947
PUKCH'ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA

2
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:58,659
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to...

3
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:47,639
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q.
De-Militarised Zone
North Korea

4
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,051
Open the bag.

5
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,731
That will teach you to lecture me.

6
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,641
Retract the blast doors.

7
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,914
Find me a new anger therapist.

8
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,610
I am Zao.

9
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,279
You are late.

10
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,814
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking
forward to this meeting.

11
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,112
Me too.

12
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,690
My African military friends owe you
many thanks, Colonel Moon.

13
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,623
Few men have the guts to trade
conflict diamonds since the U.N. embargo.

14
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,857
I know all about the U.N.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

15
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,298
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

16
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:22,667
From your modest collection of cars,
I wouldn't have guessed.

17
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:26,775
Show me the diamonds.

18
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,007
Show me the weapons.

19
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,584
Bring the weapons.

20
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:49,360
Hiding weapons
in the de-militarised zone.

21
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:54,602
- It's a bit of a minefield out there.
- America's cultural contribution.

22
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:59,676
One million landmines. And
my hovercrafts float right over them.

23
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:18,219
RPGs, flamethrowers,
automatic weapons...

24
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:21,298
...and enough ammunition to run
a small war.

25
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,559
My diamonds?

26
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,571
Check it over quick.

27
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,074
Don't blow it all at once.

28
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,911
I have special plans
for this consignment.

29
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,765
His name is James Bond,
a British assassin.

30
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,853
Mr. Van Bierk,
let me show you something.

31
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,819
Our new tank buster.

32
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,289
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.

33
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,053
Naturally.

34
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,735
And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?

35
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:52,148
It's pathetic that you British still beliee
you have the right to police the world.

36
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:56,555
You will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

37
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:59,697
Then you and I have something
in common.

38
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:02,356
Who is it?

39
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:03,869
Where's my son?

40
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,470
It's the General.

41
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:09,333
Hello... Father.

42
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:10,606
Why is there a fire?

43
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,777
I'll be there in five minutes.

44
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,042
Get the weapons out of here.

45
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,045
...and kill the spy.

46
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,958
Saved by the bell.

47
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,680
My son is dead.

48
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:50,321
14 months later

49
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,644
I don't condone what they do here.

50
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,608
Tell it to the concierge.

51
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:30,620
Still you jest.

52
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,354
Defiant to the last.

53
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,558
Your people have abandoned you.

54
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:40,900
Your very existence denied.

55
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,975
Why stay silent?

56
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,814
It doesn't matter anymore.

57
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,506
Things are out of my hands.

58
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:36,592
We reach the end, Mr. Bond.

59
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,350
Spare me the unpleasantries.

60
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:46,595
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two...

61
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,236
...and then you arrive.

62
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:52,271
A British spy, an assassin.

63
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:57,906
And now the hard-liners have
their proof.

64
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:01,140
We cannot trust the West.

65
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,814
You...

66
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,720
You took away my son.

67
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,656
Your firing squad should have done
the job for me.

68
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,803
I hoped a Western education
would help him become a bridge...

69
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,199
...between our worlds.

70
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:28,605
But all it did was to corrupt him.

71
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:31,507
Let's get this over with, shall we?

72
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:35,578
My son had an ally in the West.

73
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,284
For the last time, who was it?

74
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,318
Who made him betray his country
and name?

75
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,229
The same person who betrayed me.

76
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,900
Turn around.

77
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,740
Start walking.

78
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,967
Keep walking, please.

79
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:29,969
Keep moving.

80
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:46,846
Zao.

81
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:49,545
I'm being traded...

82
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,555
...for you.

83
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,457
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

84
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,393
Your time will come.

85
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:01,564
Not as soon as yours.

86
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:06,539
Keep walking, please.

87
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,486
Look at him.

88
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:21,745
Double check.

89
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,583
You'd think he was some kind
of a hero.

90
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,658
- Reference nine.
- Sir.

91
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,025
Section four.

92
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,096
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.

93
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,401
Watch his legs now.

94
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,240
All right, let's go.

95
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:54,647
No biological agents in the prelim scan.
He's clean.

96
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,449
Pulse, 7 2. Blood pressure, 1 20/80.

97
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:03,186
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.

98
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,058
Scorpion venom.

99
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,733
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.

100
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,232
They'd sting him
then administer the antidote.

101
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:13,406
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

102
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,735
Liver not too good.
It's definitely him then.

103
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:23,977
Morning.

104
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,623
Welcome back.

105
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,669
Such hospitality.

106
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,512
You don't seem too pleased to see me.

107
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:06,416
If I'd had my way, you'd still be
in North Korea.

108
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,556
Your freedom came at too high a price.

109
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,298
Zao.

110
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:17,764
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

111
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:21,769
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.

112
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,270
And now he's free.

113
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,335
I never asked to be traded.

114
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,879
I'd rather die than let him loose.

115
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:34,915
- You had cyanide.
- Threw it away years ago. What is this?

116
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:36,845
The top American agent...

117
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:40,923
...in the North Korean High Command
was executed a week ago.

118
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:44,755
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

119
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:47,022
- And they think it's me?
- You were the only inmate.

120
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,366
They concluded you cracked
and were hemorrhaging information.

121
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,764
We had to get you out.

122
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,333
And what do you think?

123
00:24:10,054 --> 00:24:13,319
With the drugs they gave you,
you wouldn't know what you said.

124
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,817
I know the rules.

125
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,755
And number one is, no deals.

126
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:21,124
Get caught and you're given up.

127
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,526
The mission was compromised.

128
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:27,329
Moon got a call exposing me.

129
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,701
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew.

130
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:35,536
- Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
- No, it isn't.

131
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,911
The same person who set me up then
set me up to get Zao out.

132
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,709
So I'm going after him.

133
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,580
You're going to our evaluation center
in the Falklands.

134
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,416
Double-O status rescinded.

135
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,687
Along with my freedom?

136
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:53,021
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.

137
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,493
You're no use to anyone now.

138
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:10,164
- He's in cardiac arrest.
- Get the crash cart. Notify his superiors.

139
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:14,003
- He's flat-lining on the ECG.
- Stand by.

140
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:16,841
Two hundred joules.

141
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,208
Three hundred.

142
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:23,648
Get me some atropine.
We're losing him! Stand by. Clear.

143
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,059
I'm checking out.

144
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,433
Thanks for the kiss of life.

145
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:45,165
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

146
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,775
Apprehend and detain with force.

147
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:52,142
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

148
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,340
Apprehend and detain with force.

149
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:58,647
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

150
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:43,995
My goodness, standards are falling.

151
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:47,035
No tie, dear me.

152
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,871
My usual suite, please.

153
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,805
Do you have a credit card?

154
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:57,981
Or even any luggage, sir?

155
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:00,782
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.

156
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:03,350
- It's been a long time.
- Mr. Chang.

157
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:05,522
Open the Presidential Suite.

158
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:08,388
Send up my tailor. And some food.

159
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:13,285
The lobster's good, with quails'
eggs and sliced seaweed.

160
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,126
- And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.
- Of course.

161
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,030
Do it... quickly.

162
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,201
Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond?

163
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,468
Just surviving, Mr. Chang.
Just surviving.

164
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:50,598
I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire,
the masseuse.

165
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:53,766
I come with compliments
of the manager.

166
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,531
I'm sure you do. Come in.

167
00:29:02,746 --> 00:29:05,681
On the bed, please. Face down.

168
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:10,180
Yes, of course.

169
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:15,985
I'm not that kind of masseuse.

170
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,523
I'm not that kind of customer.

171
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:31,964
You think I haven't always known
you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?

172
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:35,542
- Hong Kong is our turf now.
- Don't worry about it.

173
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:38,078
I'm not here to take it back.

174
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:43,749
Put your hands down.

175
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,581
What the hell do you want?

176
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,383
Just to help you settle a score.

177
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,757
Zao killed three of your men.

178
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:55,961
You get me into North Korea,
I'll take care of him for you.

179
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,126
What's in it for you?

180
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:02,101
Chance to get even.

181
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:05,274
Zao has information I need.

182
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:13,275
- I'll have to ask Beijing.
- Do it.

183
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:15,576
Now get out.

184
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:19,022
Unless you really wanna give
me a massage.

185
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,497
Mr. Bond.

186
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:41,135
A little thank-you from us.

187
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:49,352
Cuba?

188
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:52,488
It seems Mr. Zao has lost himself
in Havana.

189
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,214
If you find him, say goodbye from us.

190
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,987
With pleasure.

191
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:04,963
HAVANA

192
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:35,223
I'm here to pick up
some Delectados.

193
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:39,493
Delectados? We haven't made
Delectados in 30 years.

194
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:43,070
Universal Exports.
Check with your boss.

195
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:47,107
Raoul...

196
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,706
Universal Exports.

197
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:53,873
Follow me.

198
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:56,012
Your passport, se? Or.

199
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:35,122
I'd come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.

200
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:40,252
They are particularly hazardous
for one's health, Mr...?

201
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,192
Bond.

202
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,264
Mr. Bond.

203
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,129
Do you know why?

204
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,066
It's the addition
of the Volado tobacco.

205
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:51,206
Slow burning.

206
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,671
It never goes out.

207
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:58,280
Just like a sleeper.

208
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:01,041
Sorry for the rude awakening.

209
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:05,078
I love my country.

210
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:07,984
I'd never ask you
to betray your people.

211
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,557
- I'm after a North Korean.
- A tourist?

212
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,818
A terrorist.

213
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,963
One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

214
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:18,095
Zao has no interest
in other people's freedom.

215
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:29,534
I still have some friends
in high places.

216
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:36,513
Favors called in.
Some dollars spread about.

217
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,383
We find your friend is here,
on an island.

218
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:42,215
In Los Organos.

219
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:46,651
There is a strange clinic
run by Dr. Alvarez.

220
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:49,354
He leads the field in gene therapy.

221
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:54,435
Increasing the life expectancy
of our beloved leaders.

222
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,936
And, of course,
the richest Westerners.

223
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:02,400
We may have lost our freedom
in the revolution...

224
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:05,342
...but we have a health system
second to none.

225
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:08,210
You didn't do too badly
out of the revolution.

226
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:11,148
We all have our ways
of getting by.

227
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:15,620
You'd be surprised how many
government officials come to me...

228
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:19,522
...for reminders of the decadent times.
- Yeah, well...

229
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:22,790
- Mind if I borrow these?
- Please.

230
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,934
My sources tell me
this Zao is very dangerous.

231
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:28,502
I wish I could give you more help.

232
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,607
I could use a fast car.

233
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:15,982
Mojito, por favor.

234
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:19,713
Mr. Krug, your admittance papers
for the Alvarez Clinic.

235
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:21,617
About bloody time, Fidel.

236
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:24,692
Round up more girls
and take them to room 42.

237
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:30,761
Unless you want to be known
as Fidel Castrato.

238
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,028
Magnificent view.

239
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,498
It is, isn't it?

240
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,727
Too bad it's lost on everybody else.

241
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,133
Mojito?

242
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,103
You should try it.

243
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:57,008
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.

244
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,875
My friends call me James Bond.

245
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,452
Jinx, you say?

246
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,450
Born on Friday the 1 3th.

247
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,357
Do you believe in bad luck?

248
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,190
Let's just say my relationships
don't seem to last.

249
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,389
I know the feeling.

250
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,705
The predators
usually appear at sunset.

251
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:21,863
And why is that?

252
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,236
It's when their prey
comes out to drink.

253
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,880
Too strong for you?

254
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:33,375
I could learn to like it.
If I had the time.

255
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:35,981
How much time have you got?

256
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,883
Until dawn. What about you?

257
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,855
I'm just here for the birds.

258
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,356
Ornithologist.

259
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,727
Ornithologist, huh?

260
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:50,735
Now there's a mouthful.

261
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:56,806
So you're gonna be busy tonight
with the owls then?

262
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,970
No owls in Los Organos.
Nothing to see till the morning.

263
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:04,943
Not out there anyway.

264
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:11,247
So, what do predators do...

265
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,017
...when the sun goes down?

266
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,754
They feast...

267
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,189
...like there's no tomorrow.

268
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,683
Are you always this frisky?

269
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,685
I've been missing the touch
of a good woman.

270
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,389
Who says I'm good?

271
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,527
What do you want?

272
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,204
- I don't need a wheelchair.
- No?

273
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,497
You do now.

274
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:56,956
Se? Or.

275
00:40:58,093 --> 00:41:00,391
- Okay.
- Gracias.

276
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:06,156
Isla Los Organos

277
00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:47,098
So you are to have
DNA-replacement therapy.

278
00:42:47,302 --> 00:42:49,532
Let me explain the two phases.

279
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:54,175
First, we kill off your bone marrow.
Wipe the DNA slate clean.

280
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:55,807
Phase two:

281
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:58,979
Introduction of new DNA
harvested from healthy donors.

282
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,738
Orphans, runaways...

283
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,281
...people that won't be missed.

284
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,379
I like to think of myself
as an artist.

285
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,583
And this is when I create.

286
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:15,086
Thank you.

287
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:19,459
It is a painful process,
I'm afraid, but...

288
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:22,233
...all great art is.

289
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:26,102
I'll certainly enjoy working on you.

290
00:43:28,643 --> 00:43:32,875
Of course, most artists
are only truly appreciated...

291
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:34,708
...after they're dead.

292
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:57,668
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.

293
00:43:57,872 --> 00:44:00,966
I have fond memories
of the countryside.

294
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,897
Good.

295
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,831
Got your attention.

296
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,805
Who's bankrolling
your makeover, Zao?

297
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,538
Same person who set me up
in North Korea?

298
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,266
James? What's going on?

299
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,539
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

300
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,334
Move it!

301
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:17,501
Let's go!

302
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,949
You see, my friend,
the chemical composition shows...

303
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,421
...this is from Sierra Leone.
Conflict diamonds.

304
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,888
There's some kind
of marking here.

305
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,658
- "GG."
- Let me see.

306
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,571
Yes.

307
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:06,040
From the Graves Corporation
in Iceland.

308
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,808
That's his laser signature.

309
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,878
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there...

310
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:15,216
...a year or so ago.

311
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,980
Yet they're identical
to conflict diamonds.

312
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:22,392
What an amazing coincidence.

313
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,890
How can he escape
from a British warship...

314
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,091
...in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?

315
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,294
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- I got a storm warning.

316
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,634
You were supposed
to throw away the key...

317
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,832
...not leave the door wide open.

318
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,637
Are you implying I had a hand
in his escape?

319
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:44,781
Well, Bond got away real fast,
didn't he?

320
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,847
It is what he's trained to do.

321
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,643
Your boy's been very busy.

322
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,912
He torches a clinic in Cuba.

323
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:54,255
Listen, you put your house in order...

324
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,120
...or we're gonna do it for you.

325
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,106
Your drink, sir.

326
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:16,940
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

327
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,333
- When's he coming?
- I don't know.

328
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,978
- Looks like your man won't make it.
- He's right on time.

329
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,277
Wonderful day to become a knight.

330
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,651
Will you be using your title,
Mr. Graves?

331
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:34,052
I'm proud of my adopted nation,
but I'd never stand on ceremony.

332
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,419
After that entrance,
you can't be surprised...

333
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,755
...you're called a self-publicizing
adrenaline junkie, can you?

334
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:41,591
I prefer "adventurer."

335
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:45,166
We've heard about the Icarus
space program. What's the secret?

336
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:48,827
It's a surprise.
You'll soon be enlightened.

337
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,372
You work 24l7. Is it true
that you don't need sleep?

338
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,443
You get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?

339
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,342
Aren't you trying out for
the Olympic fencing team?

340
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,712
- We hear you're training furiously.
- I never get furious.

341
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,319
As they say in fencing,
"What's the point?"

342
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:05,614
Thank you.

343
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:09,122
We don't want to keep Her Majesty
waiting any longer.

344
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,385
- Mr. Graves.
- Mr. Graves.

345
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,100
Hit.

346
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,572
That's a hit.

347
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,247
Hit.

348
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,991
Verity?

349
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,460
James Bond.

350
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,428
Your lesson.

351
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,461
I see you handle your weapon well.

352
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,828
I have been known
to keep my tip up.

353
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,845
Do you mind?
I think I've come undone.

354
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,380
Why not?

355
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,413
Hit. Positions. Play.

356
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,380
Feast your eyes
on the finest blade in the club.

357
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,820
Gustav Graves?

358
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:20,197
His publicist, Miranda Frost.

359
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:28,027
My prot¨¦g¨¦.
Gorgeous, isn't she?

360
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,535
She took the gold at Sydney.

361
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,672
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?

362
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,971
The one who beat her
OD'd on steroids.

363
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,944
Miranda deserved that gold.

364
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,614
Now she's teaching Graves
how to win one.

365
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,117
He only plays for cash.

366
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,986
He's won so much,
nobody else wants to fight him.

367
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,528
You wanna meet him?

368
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,629
Absolutely.

369
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,361
Lead on.

370
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,468
- Gustav?
- Verity.

371
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,878
- And Mr...?
- Bond.

372
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:11,804
James Bond.

373
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,716
- Have we met before?
- I think I'd remember.

374
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,090
Of course you would. My mistake.

375
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:26,057
- Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond?
- If the stakes are right.

376
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,694
A thousand a point
too much for you?

377
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,704
Care to place a bet, Verity?

378
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,272
No, thanks.

379
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,441
I don't like cockfights.

380
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:44,667
Shall we?

381
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,810
Excuse me.

382
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:52,147
Best of three hits?

383
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:55,455
Positions.

384
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,420
Ready. Play.

385
00:54:57,726 --> 00:54:58,715
En garde.

386
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,828
Hit.

387
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,528
Positions.

388
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:13,804
Play.

389
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:21,173
Hit.

390
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:23,180
Two-nil.

391
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:25,242
Do you want to continue?

392
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:29,583
- You wanna up the wager?
- How much can you afford?

393
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:33,055
Let's play for this.

394
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:36,624
I picked it up in Cuba.

395
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:39,761
I believe it's one of yours.

396
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:44,836
My, my. They do get around.

397
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,936
But then diamonds are for everyone.

398
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:53,841
Brilliant specimen.
Completely flawless.

399
00:55:54,048 --> 00:55:57,779
And chemically identical
to African conflict diamonds.

400
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,751
Then you're about to lose
something very precious.

401
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,683
Positions.

402
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:08,490
Ready.

403
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:10,288
- Play.
- En garde.

404
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:18,372
Oh, dear.

405
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,942
You want to continue?

406
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:26,011
Of course I want to bloody continue!

407
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:28,409
But since we're upping the wager...

408
00:56:28,616 --> 00:56:30,709
...let's up the weapons,
shall we?

409
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:37,681
Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.

410
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:52,851
That is enough!

411
00:58:57,564 --> 00:58:59,964
It's just a little sport, Miranda.

412
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,103
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.

413
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,138
Settle downstairs, shall we?

414
00:59:29,263 --> 00:59:31,925
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.

415
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:37,468
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?

416
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:40,873
Perhaps you could join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements.

417
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,975
Once I've smoothed things over
with the club.

418
00:59:44,178 --> 00:59:46,612
What would I do without you?

419
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,985
Can I expect the pleasure of you
in Iceland?

420
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:55,883
I'm afraid you'll never
have that pleasure.

421
00:59:57,758 --> 01:00:00,591
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.

422
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:05,757
Place needed redecorating anyway.

423
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:54,971
I heard of this place.

424
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:59,814
Never thought I'd find myself here.

425
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:03,113
Some things are best kept underground.

426
01:01:03,824 --> 01:01:08,488
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.

427
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,163
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?

428
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:15,702
You burn me...

429
01:01:17,304 --> 01:01:20,535
...and now you want my help?
- Did you expect an apology?

430
01:01:20,741 --> 01:01:24,302
I know you'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.

431
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:27,344
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise.

432
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:32,174
Well, I don't have the luxury of
seeing things as black and white.

433
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:36,345
- While you were away, the world changed.
- Not for me.

434
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:43,393
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn't be here right now.

435
01:01:43,597 --> 01:01:48,159
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

436
01:01:48,535 --> 01:01:50,901
Orphan working in a diamond mine...

437
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:56,838
...learns engineering, makes a huge find
in Iceland and gives half of it to charity.

438
01:01:57,077 --> 01:02:00,012
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

439
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:06,381
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

440
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,316
Tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

441
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,717
Gene therapy.

442
01:02:11,925 --> 01:02:15,861
New identities courtesy
of DNA transplants.

443
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:21,330
So-called "beauty parlor." We'd heard
rumors. I didn't think it really existed.

444
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:24,194
It doesn't anymore.

445
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:29,706
Zao got away,
but he left these behind.

446
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:33,839
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

447
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:40,281
I think it's a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

448
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:44,924
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

449
01:02:46,426 --> 01:02:48,519
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

450
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:51,227
It seems you've become useful again.

451
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:58,434
Then maybe it's time
you let me get on with my job.

452
01:04:18,218 --> 01:04:21,187
Forgive my mentioning it,
but a perfect marksman...

453
01:04:21,388 --> 01:04:24,755
...isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

454
01:04:27,227 --> 01:04:29,058
Check the replay.

455
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:33,562
You'll find he's dead and
she's only got a flesh wound.

456
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,327
There's always an excuse,
isn't there, double-O zero?

457
01:04:37,637 --> 01:04:40,504
Give me the old firing range any day.

458
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:44,507
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.

459
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:48,704
So this is where they keep
the old relics, then, eh?

460
01:04:48,915 --> 01:04:53,249
This is where our most cutting-edge
technology is developed.

461
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:56,115
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

462
01:04:56,323 --> 01:04:58,416
Does this still work?

463
01:05:03,964 --> 01:05:07,900
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

464
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:10,068
I'm trying to get to it.

465
01:05:12,672 --> 01:05:14,867
Weapon, please.

466
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:25,083
One pane unbreakable glass,
one standard-issue ring finger.

467
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:28,880
Twist so. Voil¨¤.

468
01:05:29,122 --> 01:05:32,649
Ultra-high frequency
single-digit sonic agitator unit.

469
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:36,124
- You're cleverer than you look.
- Better than looking cleverer...

470
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:38,024
...than you are. Follow me.

471
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:41,792
Now, a new watch.
This will be your 20th, I believe.

472
01:05:42,002 --> 01:05:44,027
- How time flies.
- Yes, well, 007...

473
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:48,105
...why don't you establish a record
by returning this one.

474
01:05:48,308 --> 01:05:51,038
Your new transportation.

475
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:05,821
- Maybe you've been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.

476
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:10,625
- You must be joking.
- As I learned from my predecessor...

477
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,560
...I never joke about my work.

478
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:19,069
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish,
we call it the Vanish.

479
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,708
- Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

480
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:28,813
Tiny cameras project
the image they see...

481
01:06:29,015 --> 01:06:32,712
...onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.

482
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:36,855
To the casual eye, as good as invisible.
Plus, the usual refinements:

483
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:42,756
Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking
shotguns to shoot down mobile objects.

484
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,764
The manual. Should be able to
shoot through that in a couple of hours.

485
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:56,237
Just took a few seconds, Q.

486
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,808
Wish I could make you vanish.

487
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:04,510
Come in.

488
01:07:07,988 --> 01:07:11,754
Before you leave on your mission
for Iceland...

489
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,927
...tell me what you know
of James Bond.

490
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:18,026
He's a double-O.
A wild one, as I discovered today.

491
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:22,126
He'll light the fuse
on any explosive situation...

492
01:07:22,369 --> 01:07:26,965
...and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.

493
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:31,610
His method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get close to.

494
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:35,335
A womanizer.

495
01:07:35,577 --> 01:07:38,876
You're going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.

496
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:44,011
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.

497
01:07:44,987 --> 01:07:50,118
You volunteered for this, but in three
months, you've found next to nothing.

498
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,350
Graves seems to be clean.

499
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:57,512
Bond thinks differently, so I'm going to
let him do what you so ably described:

500
01:07:57,724 --> 01:08:01,251
Mix things up a little with Mr. Graves.
With you there...

501
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:03,861
...things won't get out of hand.

502
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:09,327
In your three years in Cryptology, you've
kept business and pleasure separate.

503
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:15,873
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite several advances.

504
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:20,375
It would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

505
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:22,878
Especially James Bond.

506
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,584
I'm Mr. Kil.

507
01:09:00,787 --> 01:09:03,347
Well, there's a name to die for.

508
01:09:30,851 --> 01:09:34,844
Three hundred and twenty-four
miles an hour. A new personal best.

509
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,751
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed.

510
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:43,585
- Glad you could make it. Like my run?
- You were on the edge of losing control.

511
01:09:43,797 --> 01:09:48,200
It's only by being on the edge that we
know who we really are. Under the skin.

512
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:54,305
Take your Donald Campbell.
1967, the Bluebird. Water speed record.

513
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:59,707
- Campbell died on his return run.
- But he died chasing a dream.

514
01:09:59,913 --> 01:10:03,280
- Isn't that the way to go?
- I'd rather not go at all.

515
01:10:03,483 --> 01:10:07,817
- You don't chase dreams, you live them.
- A virtue of never sleeping.

516
01:10:08,054 --> 01:10:13,458
I have to live my dreams. Besides,
plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.

517
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,486
Mr. Bond.

518
01:10:17,197 --> 01:10:20,166
- Miss Frost.
- I'll show you your room.

519
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,164
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.

520
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,998
This was built
for tonight's demonstration.

521
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:29,573
The human element necessitates
a balance of heat and cold.

522
01:10:29,776 --> 01:10:32,643
Built on a lake?
Hope Graves got things right.

523
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:35,906
- What's that property next door?
- The diamond mine.

524
01:10:36,116 --> 01:10:38,016
And Gustav's living quarters.

525
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:50,995
Thank you.

526
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:56,526
This is you.

527
01:10:57,669 --> 01:11:02,003
Wonderful.
Would you like to show me more?

528
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:19,891
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.

529
01:11:24,296 --> 01:11:25,558
Mojito?

530
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,801
James. Here for the penguins this time?

531
01:11:32,136 --> 01:11:36,368
- Or for the view again?
- I'm only interested in endangered species.

532
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:38,565
Well, does that include me?

533
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:42,937
- Depends on what you're up to this time.
- So I left you in an explosive situation.

534
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:45,809
Figured you could handle yourself.

535
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:51,884
- No wonder your relationships don't last.
- I just don't like to get tied down.

536
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,062
You look terrible.

537
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:42,039
You aren't looking too good yourself.

538
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:52,714
- You're still feeling the side effects?
- The insomnia is permanent for me.

539
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:55,943
An hour on the Dream Machine
keeps me sane.

540
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:59,549
- What happened to you?
- Bond.

541
01:12:59,924 --> 01:13:02,688
He knows nothing.
I've been this close to him...

542
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:05,328
...and he didn't know
who I really was.

543
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:12,262
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.

544
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:17,339
- General Moon still mourns your death.
- My death.

545
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,201
Mr. Bond.

546
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:25,873
- And Miss...?
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.

547
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:30,744
Really? I take it Mr. Bond's been
explaining his big-bang theory?

548
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:35,423
- Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
- I see.

549
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:41,425
The demonstration's about
to begin in five minutes. Shall we?

550
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:43,689
Shall we?

551
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:51,664
- Not "Jinx" anymore?
- I'll always be a jinx to you.

552
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:05,184
I'm always trying to give the planet
something in return...

553
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:07,320
...for what it has given me:

554
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:11,252
Those little shards of heaven
known as diamonds.

555
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:16,192
Diamonds aren't just expensive stones.
They are the stuff of dreams.

556
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,625
And the means to make dreams real.

557
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:43,319
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world...

558
01:14:43,524 --> 01:14:47,460
...being able to grow crops year-round,
bringing an end to hunger.

559
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:50,789
Imagine a second sun...

560
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:54,490
...shining like a diamond in the sky.

561
01:14:56,837 --> 01:14:58,236
Let there be light.

562
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:07,904
I give you Icarus!

563
01:15:15,556 --> 01:15:20,050
Icarus is unique. Its miraculous
silver skin will inhale the sun's light...

564
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:23,196
...and breathe it gently
upon the Earth's surface.

565
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,529
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.

566
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:45,308
And now let us brighten this night
with our inner radiance.

567
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:09,399
All right, that's a wrap.

568
01:17:20,314 --> 01:17:23,977
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.

569
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:28,217
Here is the self-defense mechanism
you asked me to build in.

570
01:17:28,455 --> 01:17:31,049
- Fifty-thousand volts?
- A hundred.

571
01:17:34,027 --> 01:17:35,927
Armed...

572
01:17:36,396 --> 01:17:40,093
...and very dangerous.
- Very.

573
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,190
M warned me this would happen.

574
01:18:39,426 --> 01:18:41,986
That's why you tried
not to be interested in me.

575
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:45,323
God, you're even worse
than your file says.

576
01:18:47,568 --> 01:18:49,627
They don't look too convinced.

577
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:52,304
Come on, put your back into it.

578
01:18:57,744 --> 01:19:03,182
I know all about you. Sex for dinner, death
for breakfast. Not gonna work with me.

579
01:19:03,383 --> 01:19:05,044
- No?
- No.

580
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,560
- You're getting good at this.
- Stop it. Are we still being watched?

581
01:19:17,798 --> 01:19:21,234
- They left ages ago.
- God, you're impossible.

582
01:19:21,435 --> 01:19:23,164
Let's get out of here.

583
01:19:52,032 --> 01:19:55,593
You'd better stay here.
Keep up the charade of being lovers.

584
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:56,928
All right.

585
01:19:57,237 --> 01:20:02,300
I admire your restraint. You were here
a full two hours before anything blew up.

586
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:07,072
The way you're going,
you'll get us both killed.

587
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:13,747
James, tell me what really happened
in North Korea.

588
01:20:13,954 --> 01:20:15,888
I was betrayed.

589
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:17,750
That was all.

590
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:23,654
Occupational hazard.

591
01:20:31,071 --> 01:20:33,972
This is crazy. You're a double-O.

592
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,506
It's only a number.

593
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,117
James...

594
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:19,820
...be careful.

595
01:21:22,692 --> 01:21:26,355
Go back to your room.
I'll come back for you.

596
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:59,824
Why do you want to kill me?

597
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:04,097
I thought it was
the humane thing to do.

598
01:22:09,205 --> 01:22:10,399
Who sent you?

599
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:13,832
Your mama.

600
01:22:14,043 --> 01:22:16,534
And she's really disappointed in you.

601
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:21,608
I'll let you in on a little secret.

602
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:26,052
This mine is fake, but the lasers...

603
01:22:27,623 --> 01:22:29,113
...are real.

604
01:22:50,212 --> 01:22:52,077
She won't talk.

605
01:22:53,048 --> 01:22:54,845
Let's make it permanent.

606
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,950
I'll use the laser.

607
01:22:57,153 --> 01:22:59,246
Don't leave a mess.

608
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:18,829
- Jinx?
- James! James! No, no!

609
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:21,502
Turn it off! Off! Off!

610
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,662
James, I could use a little help here.

611
01:24:57,907 --> 01:24:59,238
Switch it off...

612
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,372
...or I'll be half the girl
I used to be.

613
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:46,947
So, the girl who hates
to be tied down, huh?

614
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:48,885
Are you gonna get me off this?

615
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:51,559
- What are you, CIA?
- NSA.

616
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,696
- We're on the same side.
- Doesn't mean we're after the same thing.

617
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:58,992
Sure it does.
World peace, unconditional love...

618
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:02,136
...and our little friend
with the expensive acne.

619
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:05,104
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.

620
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:09,102
He's back there with some weird,
psychedelic light mask.

621
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:12,576
Probably brought it from the clinic
in Cuba.

622
01:26:12,781 --> 01:26:14,646
He couldn't have brought it.

623
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:17,248
It was already here.

624
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:22,854
It belongs to another Korean.

625
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:25,356
His boss.

626
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:32,797
- We need Kil to help us get out of here.
- I got a better idea.

627
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:45,704
- I'm going to get backup.
- Wait.

628
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:48,940
Go to Miranda first. She's MI6.
Warn her to get out.

629
01:26:49,151 --> 01:26:50,812
And what are you gonna do?

630
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,215
Unfinished business.

631
01:27:06,068 --> 01:27:08,969
So you live to die another day...

632
01:27:10,406 --> 01:27:11,430
...colonel.

633
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:17,310
At last. I was beginning to think
you'd never guess.

634
01:27:17,513 --> 01:27:19,378
Was it painful?

635
01:27:20,182 --> 01:27:23,015
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn't possibly imagine.

636
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:25,880
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

637
01:27:26,355 --> 01:27:28,880
But there have been compensations.

638
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:31,992
Like watching you flail around
in your ignorance.

639
01:27:32,194 --> 01:27:35,129
Granting you life just to see
if you'd get wise.

640
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:37,355
It's been fun.

641
01:27:37,566 --> 01:27:40,535
Well, the fun is about to come
to a dead end.

642
01:27:41,837 --> 01:27:44,533
We only met briefly, you and I...

643
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:47,300
...but you left a lasting impression.

644
01:27:47,509 --> 01:27:51,343
When you forced me to present
the world with a new face...

645
01:27:51,547 --> 01:27:55,711
...I chose to model the disgusting
Gustav Graves on you.

646
01:27:57,119 --> 01:27:59,679
Just in the details.

647
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:03,688
That unjustifiable swagger.

648
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:08,829
Your crass quips, a defense mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.

649
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:11,591
My defense mechanism is right here.

650
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:19,871
So, Miss Frost is not all she seems.

651
01:28:20,309 --> 01:28:23,039
Looks can be deceptive.

652
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:26,912
Yes.

653
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:31,078
Did you find out who betrayed you
in North Korea?

654
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,685
Only a matter of time.

655
01:28:32,888 --> 01:28:37,348
You never thought of looking
inside your own organization?

656
01:28:41,096 --> 01:28:43,690
She was right under your nose.

657
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:50,364
It was so good of you
to bring your gun to bed.

658
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:53,808
Yes. Occupational hazard.

659
01:28:57,279 --> 01:28:59,907
You see, I have a gift.

660
01:29:00,115 --> 01:29:02,903
An instinct for sensing
people's weaknesses.

661
01:29:03,113 --> 01:29:06,947
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning, whatever the cost.

662
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:11,086
When I arranged for the fatal overdose
of the true victor at Sydney...

663
01:29:11,288 --> 01:29:14,746
...I won myself
my very own MI6 agent...

664
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:21,498
...using everything at my disposal:
her brains, her talent...

665
01:29:21,698 --> 01:29:23,859
...even her sex.

666
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,932
The coldest weapon of all.

667
01:29:29,172 --> 01:29:30,764
Hello.

668
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,433
Miranda?

669
01:29:40,317 --> 01:29:42,308
There will be others after me.

670
01:29:42,519 --> 01:29:45,010
You mean your American friend, Jinx.

671
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,658
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.

672
01:29:50,861 --> 01:29:56,128
- An ice palace can be a treacherous place.
- Hand over the toys.

673
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,301
Oh, yeah.

674
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:05,431
You know, I've missed
your sparkling personality.

675
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:08,205
How's that for a punch line?

676
01:30:08,412 --> 01:30:10,209
Kill him.

677
01:30:11,048 --> 01:30:12,948
I enjoyed last night, James...

678
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,048
...but it really is death for breakfast.

679
01:30:31,768 --> 01:30:32,962
Kill him, quietly.

680
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,971
Kill him. Now!

681
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,649
- He got away.
- No matter.

682
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,410
The pleasure of the kill
is in the chase.

683
01:31:23,887 --> 01:31:25,184
Bring me the generals.

684
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:38,161
Gentlemen...

685
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,529
...I promised you a demonstration.

686
01:31:41,104 --> 01:31:44,039
Now you will see the true power
of Icarus.

687
01:31:52,615 --> 01:31:55,948
The Western spy runs,
but he cannot hide.

688
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:11,457
Icarus will lock on to the heat signature
and concentrate the sun's power.

689
01:32:29,352 --> 01:32:32,515
Hey, boss, he beat your time.

690
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:39,848
Time to draw the line.

691
01:34:10,787 --> 01:34:13,517
Global warming is a terrible thing.

692
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:16,343
Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond.

693
01:35:16,786 --> 01:35:19,846
He was pretty vigorous last night
as well.

694
01:35:20,056 --> 01:35:21,523
He did you?

695
01:35:21,724 --> 01:35:24,887
- I didn't know he was that desperate.
- He's not coming for you.

696
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:28,391
He just died running,
trying to save his own skin.

697
01:35:30,299 --> 01:35:32,199
That's pretty good tailoring.

698
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:36,167
I hope it doesn't shrink
when it gets wet.

699
01:36:06,169 --> 01:36:08,729
Soon, we will be victorious.

700
01:36:18,915 --> 01:36:23,113
We've got one hour to wrap this up.
Let's move.

701
01:37:22,411 --> 01:37:24,971
Come on, Jinx, where are you?

702
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,618
All units report. Now!

703
01:37:57,777 --> 01:38:00,143
Warning, adaptive camouflage failure.

704
01:39:53,592 --> 01:39:56,823
Time to give the American her bath.

705
01:42:13,732 --> 01:42:15,962
Adaptive camouflage restored.

706
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:07,881
Vlad, does the word "ergonomics"
mean anything to you?

707
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,112
Man? Machine?

708
01:43:10,323 --> 01:43:13,520
This is still a suitcase.

709
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:16,521
Finish it, will you?

710
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,275
Come on, it's warm in here.
Come on.

711
01:44:27,954 --> 01:44:32,084
The cold kept you alive, huh?
It must've kept you alive.

712
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:34,452
Come on.

713
01:44:42,768 --> 01:44:44,963
What took you so long?

714
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:46,138
I'm sorry.

715
01:45:19,839 --> 01:45:20,999
Agent Johnson.

716
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:24,372
- James.
- Charles.

717
01:45:25,244 --> 01:45:27,974
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.

718
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:32,947
Another division mobilized north
of the DMZ. 80,000 troops and counting.

719
01:45:33,152 --> 01:45:37,282
- And another million in reserve.
- Moon's father won't allow a war.

720
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:40,756
General Moon's under arrest.
Hard-liners staged a coup.

721
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:44,689
You deliberately misled me
by implicating Bond.

722
01:45:44,895 --> 01:45:48,228
- If you'd told us about your agent...
- She'd be dead.

723
01:45:48,432 --> 01:45:51,560
- Your mole would've made sure.
- We wouldn't have a mole...

724
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:56,728
...if you'd told us that Frost and Moon
were on the Harvard fencing team together.

725
01:45:57,074 --> 01:46:00,305
Knowing who to trust
is everything in this business.

726
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:02,774
Well, well, James Bond.

727
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:06,472
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let's get down to business.

728
01:46:06,884 --> 01:46:08,351
We're at DEFCON 2.

729
01:46:08,552 --> 01:46:12,249
And if the North goes south,
they're gonna go south big-time.

730
01:46:12,556 --> 01:46:15,320
You don't just stroll through
a minefield.

731
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,621
You need some kind of an edge.

732
01:46:18,896 --> 01:46:21,057
- Icarus.
- We're taking care of that...

733
01:46:21,265 --> 01:46:24,063
...with an ASAT launch in one hour.

734
01:46:24,268 --> 01:46:27,601
- Where's Graves?
- In a North Korean air base.

735
01:46:27,804 --> 01:46:31,001
They're right where we can't touch him.

736
01:46:33,777 --> 01:46:35,244
You can't...

737
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:38,171
...but I can.
- Look...

738
01:46:38,382 --> 01:46:42,614
...we're here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.

739
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:46,551
No incursions into the North.
President gave me a direct order.

740
01:46:46,924 --> 01:46:49,358
And when did that ever stop you?

741
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,393
You make your own decision.
I'm sending in 007.

742
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:57,092
You think I'd leave this
in the hands of the British?

743
01:46:58,301 --> 01:47:00,269
You go with him.

744
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:02,971
Approaching drop zone.

745
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:09,703
Okay, let's go!

746
01:47:21,157 --> 01:47:24,593
- They've entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.

747
01:47:24,794 --> 01:47:30,858
If our radar can't see those switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can't.

748
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:54,322
Hey, boss, they launched
against Icarus.

749
01:47:55,291 --> 01:47:56,519
Leave it on automatic.

750
01:48:07,337 --> 01:48:12,172
I hope nobody here is superstitious.
That's one big mirror we're about to break.

751
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:22,845
Oh, my God.

752
01:48:23,053 --> 01:48:27,046
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And get me the president, now!

753
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:29,589
Still no news of Bond?

754
01:48:43,206 --> 01:48:44,901
Vehicles.

755
01:48:46,276 --> 01:48:47,504
Some big shots.

756
01:48:52,215 --> 01:48:53,546
It's him.

757
01:48:55,919 --> 01:48:59,252
- Three hundred meters.
- Windage, one and a half.

758
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:08,622
We gotta get on that plane.

759
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,341
You, have my father brought down.

760
01:50:42,157 --> 01:50:43,124
Father...

761
01:50:44,493 --> 01:50:47,792
...I regret our meeting had to be like this.

762
01:50:48,764 --> 01:50:52,757
You can't tell it's me?

763
01:50:53,102 --> 01:50:54,899
I don't know you.

764
01:50:56,805 --> 01:51:00,002
You've always found it difficult
to accept me.

765
01:51:00,209 --> 01:51:03,667
That made my exile easier to bear...

766
01:51:03,879 --> 01:51:06,279
...but I never forgot
what you taught me.

767
01:51:06,482 --> 01:51:10,885
In war, the victorious strategist
only seeks battle...

768
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,055
...after the victory has been won.

769
01:51:15,556 --> 01:51:19,993
You see, Father, I remember
my Art of War...

770
01:51:20,194 --> 01:51:23,652
...and this is what guarantees
that victory.

771
01:52:06,374 --> 01:52:08,535
My son...

772
01:52:10,011 --> 01:52:13,037
What have you done to yourself?

773
01:52:14,115 --> 01:52:14,672
Come, Father.

774
01:52:17,017 --> 01:52:20,248
Watch the rising of your son.

775
01:52:48,849 --> 01:52:51,079
The second that hits
the 38th parallel...

776
01:52:51,285 --> 01:52:53,310
...hit them with
everything we got.

777
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,954
That may not be enough.

778
01:53:10,571 --> 01:53:13,499
Do you see, Father?

779
01:53:13,573 --> 01:53:15,336
Icarus is clearing the minefield...

780
01:53:15,542 --> 01:53:18,477
...creating a highway for our troops.

781
01:53:18,812 --> 01:53:23,181
If the Americans don't run,
Icarus will destroy them.

782
01:53:46,906 --> 01:53:50,706
Japan is a bug waiting
to be squashed...

783
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:53,970
...and the West will shake with fear.

784
01:53:57,917 --> 01:54:00,181
But the Americans will
send nuclear warheads.

785
01:54:00,387 --> 01:54:03,447
Icarus will swat them from the sky.

786
01:54:47,867 --> 01:54:50,631
You will destroy us.

787
01:54:56,276 --> 01:54:58,073
You would kill your own son?

788
01:54:58,278 --> 01:55:01,111
The son I knew died long ago.

789
01:55:19,065 --> 01:55:23,092
Father... you disappoint me.

790
01:56:16,155 --> 01:56:18,316
Caution. Caution.

791
01:56:18,525 --> 01:56:19,492
- Manual.
- Up!

792
01:56:19,692 --> 01:56:21,717
Manual.

793
01:56:27,066 --> 01:56:28,328
- Up! Up!
- Caution.

794
01:56:28,868 --> 01:56:30,802
- Manual.
- Come on!

795
01:56:50,723 --> 01:56:52,623
Okay, guys.

796
01:56:53,026 --> 01:56:55,119
Okay.

797
01:56:58,231 --> 01:56:59,721
I got it.

798
01:56:59,933 --> 01:57:04,768
My, my. You get around.
Let's see your gun.

799
01:57:05,872 --> 01:57:07,999
Left hand.

800
01:57:08,975 --> 01:57:10,738
That's it.

801
01:57:11,744 --> 01:57:12,938
That's it.

802
01:57:13,146 --> 01:57:15,512
Now drop it.

803
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:20,045
Looks like your friends have bailed.

804
01:57:27,393 --> 01:57:29,759
Push on autopilot.

805
01:57:29,963 --> 01:57:31,521
Come on.

806
01:57:31,731 --> 01:57:34,291
That's it. Good girl.

807
01:57:55,254 --> 01:57:57,449
Well, drowning you
didn't seem to work.

808
01:57:57,657 --> 01:57:59,921
I'll have to try something
more to the point.

809
01:58:03,896 --> 01:58:05,659
One thousand meters and closing.

810
02:00:10,087 --> 02:00:12,749
I can read your every move.

811
02:00:16,727 --> 02:00:18,957
Read this.

812
02:00:19,296 --> 02:00:21,321
Bitch.

813
02:00:56,733 --> 02:01:00,965
Look, parachutes
for the both of us.

814
02:01:03,607 --> 02:01:05,768
Not anymore.

815
02:01:11,314 --> 02:01:15,512
You see, Mr. Bond,
you can't kill my dreams.

816
02:01:17,754 --> 02:01:21,121
But my dreams can kill you.

817
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:24,025
Time to face destiny.

818
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:42,806
Time to face gravity.

819
02:02:22,751 --> 02:02:25,584
I think I broke her heart.

820
02:02:28,457 --> 02:02:31,221
Looks like we're
going down together.

821
02:02:32,394 --> 02:02:33,361
Not yet.

822
02:02:37,332 --> 02:02:39,857
- Get the back open.
- Okay.

823
02:02:57,319 --> 02:02:58,616
Come on!

824
02:04:08,857 --> 02:04:11,257
- Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.

825
02:04:11,893 --> 02:04:13,656
I should have warned you...

826
02:04:13,862 --> 02:04:16,490
...my relationships don't last either.

827
02:04:21,636 --> 02:04:24,230
At least we're gonna die rich.

828
02:04:27,909 --> 02:04:31,106
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on.

829
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:33,038
Come on.

830
02:04:52,767 --> 02:04:54,735
Now...

831
02:04:54,936 --> 02:04:59,373
...you said something about
going down together?

832
02:05:38,213 --> 02:05:40,070
James.

833
02:05:40,279 --> 02:05:42,110
Moneypenny.

834
02:06:26,525 --> 02:06:28,652
Oh, James.

835
02:06:38,704 --> 02:06:41,395
Moneypenny?

836
02:06:42,841 --> 02:06:47,107
I was just testing it out.

837
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:50,405
It's rather hard, isn't it?

838
02:06:50,615 --> 02:06:54,381
Yes. Very.

839
02:07:28,653 --> 02:07:31,679
Wait, don't pull it out.
I'm not finished with it yet.

840
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:35,849
See? It's a perfect fit.

841
02:07:36,928 --> 02:07:40,159
- Leave it in.
- It's gotta come out sooner or later.

842
02:07:40,365 --> 02:07:45,268
No, leave it in, please.
Few more minutes?

843
02:07:47,205 --> 02:07:50,299
We really have to get these back.

844
02:07:50,842 --> 02:07:53,242
Still the good guys, huh?

845
02:07:57,482 --> 02:08:02,181
I'm still not quite sure
how good you are.

846
02:08:04,756 --> 02:08:07,247
I am so good.

847
02:08:09,394 --> 02:08:12,591
Especially when you're bad.
