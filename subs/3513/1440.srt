Officer of the Watch, come hard right, 1-4-1.

140
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,364
声纳没有收到讯号，一定是米格机放下的
There's been no sonar contact, sir. The MiGs must have dropped it.

141
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,505
方位稳定，它会击中我们
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

142
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,775
准备被撞击
Brace, brace, brace.

143
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:09,057
- 目标是1200 - 开门
- Target: 1200. - Knock knock.

144
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,312
到楼上去
Let's go upstairs.

145
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,464
- 左转 - 旋转90度
- Turn left. - Rotating 90 degrees.

146
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,118
他们正在猜为什么鱼雷没爆炸
Now they're wondering why the torpedo hasn't exploded.

147
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,488
全面损毁报告
PWO, Captain. Full damage report.

148
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,090
立即开动后备能量
Backup power, immediately!

149
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,070
开动替代能源
Switch to alternate supply.

150
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:12,611
三具发电机损毁，船尾第四层淹水
Three generators are down, sir. Flooding on four deck aft.

151
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,742
船头向下14度
Sir, we're now down 14 degrees by the stern.

152
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:21,252
通知将军：“遭中国米格机鱼雷击中，下沉中”
Yeoman, send to Admiralty: "Have been torpedoed by Chinese MiGs. Sinking. "

153
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:25,583
说出我们的方位，好的，弃船
Give them our position. Right. Abandon ship.

154
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:28,214
弃船！弃船！
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

155
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,055
遭米格机鱼雷击中下沉中

156
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,896
全部上甲板
Everyone on deck! Come on!

157
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,848
对米格机发射一枚导弹
One missile at the MiGs.

158
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,562
保持无线电静默
Maintaining radio silence.

159
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,584
他们最后的发报
Their last broadcast, sir.

160
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,254
古达的编码器见效了
Mr. Gupta's little trick with the encoder worked.

161
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:20,415
他们报告最后的位置是离此70里
They gave their final position 70 miles from here.

162
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,926
英国海军永远找不到他们
The British Navy will never find them.

163
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,987
海面有生还者
Survivors in the water.

164
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,638
英国海军遇害

165
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,909
英国海军被谋杀

166
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,820
史丹博先生，我正在写标题
Mr. Stamper, I'm having fun with my headlines.

167
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,721
我需要知道生还者的正确数目
I need to know the exact number of survivors.

168
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:53,622
我开会要迟到了，确保用正确的子弹
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure you use the right kind of ammunition.

169
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,253
知道
Yes, sir.

170
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,163
太美妙了
Delicious.

171
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,070
开始打捞行动
Start the recovery operation.

172
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
派潜水员到得文夏号
Send our divers down to the Devonshire.

173
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:46,763
导弹室

174
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,536
古达先生？已完成第一阶段
Mr. Gupta? Phase one is complete.

175
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,679
早安，忠心的员工
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

176
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,089
今天卡佛集团该为世界制造什么混乱呢？
What kind of havoc shall the Carver Media Group create in the world today?

177
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,290
- 新闻 - 巴基斯坦水灾，巴黎暴动
- News. - Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris.

178
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:23,601
- 加州坠机 - 好极了
- And a plane crash in California. - Excellent.

179
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:27,702
琼斯先生，我们准备好推出新软件了吗？
Mr. Jones, are we ready to release our new software?

180
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:31,242
是的，如你的要求，有许多问题…
Yes, sir. As requested, it's full of bugs...

181
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,803
人们在未来会被迫将软件升级
which means people will be forced to upgrade for years.

182
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,044
了不起
Outstanding.

183
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:38,284
沃勒斯先生，打电话给总统
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

184
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:41,755
他如不签署降低有线电视收费的法案
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill lowering the cable rates...

185
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,795
我们会播出他和啦啦队长鬼混的录影带…
we'll release a video of him with the cheerleader...

186
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,796
- 在芝加哥饭店… - 知道
- in the Chicago motel room. - Inspired, sir.

187
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,296
他签署后仍将录影带播出
After he signs the bill, release the tape anyway.

188
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,997
我一定会这么做
Consider him slimed.

189
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,737
失陪一下
Excuse me.

190
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,908
- 他在七号应答器 - 史丹博？
- He's on transponder seven. - Mr. Stamper?

191
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:02,249
开始第二阶段，我有录影带
Phase two is underway. I have the videotape.

192
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,290
我还没看过，但听说片段很精彩
I haven't seen it myself, but I'm told the footage is excellent.

193
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,220
还有17名生还者，可让你作标题
Plus, there were 17 survivors for your headlines.

194
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,021
干得好
Good work, Stamper.

195
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,202
- 谢谢你 - 不客气
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

196
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,133
确保放在安全地方
Make sure you keep it in a safe place.

197
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,373
各位…
Gentlemen and ladies...

198
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:25,004
停止所有的印刷
hold the presses.

199
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,014
刚收到的
This just in.

200
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,515
在稀奇突发的命运下，今晚卫星新闻网络…
By a curious quirk of fate, we have the perfect story...

201
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:35,286
的首播有大新闻
with which to launch our Satellite News Network tonight.

202
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:40,828
南中国海好像正在耘酿一个小危机
It seems a small crisis is brewing in the South China Sea.

203
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:44,528
我要报章全面报导，杂志报导
I want full newspaper coverage. I want magazine stories.

204
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,469
书刊、电影、电视及电台广播
I want books. I want films. I want TV. I want radio.

205
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,379
我要我们24小时转播
I want us on the air 24 hours a day.

206
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,380
这是我们的时刻
This is our moment!

207
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,341
地球上有十亿人…
And a billion people around this planet...

208
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,981
会收看、收听…
will watch it, hear it...

209
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,852
和阅读由卡佛媒体集团报导的消息
and read about it from the Carver Media Group.

210
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:10,223
没有什么比得上坏消息了
There's no news like bad news.

211
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:24,217
邦德先生，我对你的进展很满意
I am pleased with your progress, Mr. Bond.

212
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:30,658
我一直都有兴趣学习新语言，教授
I've always enjoyed studying a new tongue, Professor.

213
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:35,689
你很有天分
One might say you have a natural ability.

214
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:39,629
但熟能生巧
But practice makes perfect.

215
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,142
丹麦话“我不在”怎么说？
How do you say "I'm not here" in Danish?

216
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,773
别管它
Just ignore it.

217
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:58,053
在他们的词汇里没有这些字
Those are words they just don't have in their vocabulary.

218
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:03,895
- 我是邦德 - 用安全线路，007
- Bond here. - Go to a secure line, 007.

219
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,425
用干扰器，第四频道
Going to a scrambler, channel four.

220
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,866
太荒谬了，他们在国际水域
That's ridiculous. That ship was in international waters.

221
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:15,277
- 我们不能肯定 - 詹姆斯？你在哪里？
- We can't be certain. - James? Where are you?

222
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,318
莫尼彭妮
Oh, Moneypenny.

223
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:22,818
我在牛津练习一下丹麦语
I'm just up here at Oxford brushing up on a little Danish.

224
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:24,289
一下？
Little?

225
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,949
恐怕你得跟你的课程吻别了
I'm afraid you're going to have to kiss off your lesson, James.

226
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,660
国防部有事
We've got a situation here at the Ministry of Defense.

227
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:31,761
要派舰队到中国
We're sending the fleet to China.

228
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:36,831
我一小时后到
I'll be there in an hour.

229
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:38,532
半小时吧
Make that 30 minutes.

230
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:42,003
再见，我的甜心
Good-bye, my sweet.

231
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,313
你一向都是口舌巧妙的语言家
You always were a cunning linguist, James.

232
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,245
- 别问 - 别说
- Don't ask. - Don't tell.

233
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,268
这太不合理了，我们知道军舰的正确方位
That's preposterous. We know exactly where that ship was positioned.

234
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:10,708
全球定位卫星不可能会出错
The G.P.S. System... Global Positioning Satellites... do not lie.

235
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,719
是的，但是新加坡控制中心在军舰受到攻击时…
Yes, but our Singapore station picked up a mysterious signal...

236
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,840
全球定位卫星截获了神秘的讯号
on the G.P.S. Frequency at the time of the attack.

237
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,851
那有可能让军舰偏离航道
It could've sent that ship off course.

238
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,911
- 英国巡洋舰失踪了 - 我知道
- I have a missing British frigate... - I'm aware of that!

239
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:24,392
你只想调查而不采取果断的行动
And instead of decisive action, all you want to do is investigate.

240
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,832
我希望避免第三次世界大战，而且我不认为…
My goal is to prevent World War Three, Admiral, and I don't think...

241
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:29,893
派舰队去寻找地点是最好的方法
sending an armada into the recovery area is the best way to do it.

242
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:33,273
那些神秘的全球定位卫星信号从哪里发出来的？
Where, exactly, did this mysterious G.P.S. Signal come from?

243
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:36,274
- 我们仍在调查  - “调查”
- We're still investigating. - "Investigating. "

244
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:40,045
M，我看你没种执行任务
M, sometimes I don't think you have the balls for this job.

245
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,485
或许吧，但是…
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

246
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:44,676
我从来都不用担心这个问题
I don't have to think with them all the time.

247
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,527
够了，现在的情形是如何？
That's enough. Now, where do we stand?

248
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:53,687
我们的军舰在国际水域受到无谓的攻击
It was an unprovoked attack on a ship in international waters.

249
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:57,398
我们派舰队去搜索跟准备反击
We send in the fleet for recovery and prepare for full retaliation.

250
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,869
用温和的作法展开我们的调查
Moderation. We investigate...

251
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,170
而不是派遣英国海军舰队…
and stop short of sending the entire British Navy...

252
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,440
进入世界最强大空军的领域内
within ten minutes of the world's largest air force.

253
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,570
- 我们的舰队何时能到达？  - 48小时
- When will our ships be in position? - Forty-eight hours.

254
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,781
我的天！
Christ!

255
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:11,782
报章已要求报复
The press are already screaming for blood.

256
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:14,912
我们不能让局势变得更紧张
The last thing we want to do is escalate the situation.

257
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:16,923
恐怕已经太迟了
I'm afraid it may be too late to worry about that.

258
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:22,754
17名英国海军被杀
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

259
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,395
“据发现尸体的越南官员宣称”
"According to Vietnamese officials who recovered the bodies...

260
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,205
“死者被中国空军子弹”
the victims were riddled with the same ammunition...

261
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:30,536
“打得满是窟窿”
used by the Chinese Air Force. "

262
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,276
- 是你泄露出去的吗？ - 不是
- Did you leak this? - No.

263
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:37,977
- 我第一次听到 - 就这样决定吧
- It's the first I've heard of it. - Well, this settles it.

264
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:41,448
我们派舰队去
We send in the fleet.

265
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,928
M，你有48小时的时间调查
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

266
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,141
有件事很奇怪
There is one strange thing.

267
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:57,801
当我打电话给西贡的人员时，他说越南人…
When I called our contact in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

268
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,102
在三小时前才发现海军的尸体
only found our sailors three hours ago.

269
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,802
报纸怎会这么快就刊出？
How'd they get the paper out so fast?

270
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:05,513
明日报的人比越南政府更早知道
Somebody at Tomorrow knew before the Vietnamese government did.

271
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:09,383
你知道多少艾利欧卡佛的事？
How much do you know about Elliot Carver, 007?

272
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:10,854
全球媒体大亨
Worldwide media baron.

273
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,694
可藉报导推翻政府
Able to topple governments with a single broadcast.

274
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,495
明日报是卡佛的
Carver owns that newspaper Tomorrow.

275
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,796
我不想在部长面前讨论这件事
I didn't want to discuss it in front of the minister...

276
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:21,836
那些神秘信号来自卡佛的其中一个卫星
but that mysterious signal came from one of Carver's satellites.

277
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:26,897
如果首相知道你在调查他，一定会杀了我
The P.M. Would have my head if he knew you were investigating him.

278
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:29,948
007，我派你去汉堡，我们已经安排好
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007. We've arranged for you to be invited...

279
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:32,108
你受邀参加卡佛媒体集团的酒会
to a party at Carver's Media Center.

280
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,589
他们庆祝发射新卫星
They're celebrating the launch of a new satellite...

281
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:38,349
因为他现在有能力将消息传播到世界的每个角落
because now he has the ability to reach every human being on the Earth.

282
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
但是中国拒绝给他广播权
Except the Chinese, who have refused broadcast rights.

283
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:47,661
你的机票，掩护的身分跟租车预约的收据
Your ticket, cover story and rental car reservation.

284
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,402
请签名
Sign here, please.

285
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:53,243
我记得你曾跟卡佛的太太有过一段情
I believe you once had a relationship with Carver's wife, Paris.

286
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:56,514
那已是陈年往事
That was a long time ago, M...

287
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,514
在她结婚之前
before she was married.

288
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:02,875
我不晓得原来是众所周知的
I didn't realize it was public knowledge.

289
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,975
请以国家为重，詹姆斯
Queen and country, James.

290
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,926
你的责任是要找出是否卡佛或他的下属…
Your job is to find out whether Carver or someone in his organization...

291
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,156
让军舰偏离航道，还有他这样做的原因
sent that ship off course and why.

292
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:13,237
尽量利用你跟卡佛太太的关系
Use your relationship with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

293
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,628
我很怀疑她还记不记得我
I doubt if she'll remember me.

294
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,568
那就去提醒她
Remind her.

295
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,139
从她身上刺探出消息
Then pump her for information.

296
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,609
你只要决定如何刺探出消息
You'll just have to decide how much pumping is needed, James.

297
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,050
莫尼彭妮，如果我跟你是这样就好了
If only that were true of you and I, Moneypenny.

298
00:27:43,234 --> 00:28:07,469
明日报：中国警告英国舰队

299
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,629
请你在这里签名，邦德先生
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

300
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,300
这是你漂亮的新车的…
It's the insurance damage waiver...

301
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:19,371
保险损毁豁免书
for your beautiful new car.

302
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:23,081
- 你需要碰撞保险吗？ - 需要
- Will you need collision coverage? - Yes.

303
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:24,622
火险呢？
Fire?

304
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,883
可能需要
Probably.

305
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:29,683
- 财物保险呢？ - 当然要
- Property destruction? - Definitely.

306
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:31,454
伤亡保险呢？
Personal injury?

307
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,864
希望不要，但意外有时难以避免
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

308
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,054
只要有你，意外是跑不掉
They frequently do with you.

309
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:41,335
这样应该可以了吧
Well, that takes care of the normal wear and tear.

310
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,306
我还需要其他的保护吗？
Do I need any other protection?

311
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:48,617
如果你弄坏车子，我会修理你
Only from me, 007, unless you bring that car back in pristine order.

312
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:51,018
- 你先请 - 你先请
- Shall we? - Shall we?

313
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:57,059
你的新宝马750
Your new BMW 750.

314
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,929
做了一般精细的设备，有机关枪，火箭炮…
All the usual refinements... machine guns, rockets...

315
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,230
全球卫星定位系统
the G.P.S. Tracking system.

316
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,741
欢迎，请系上安全带，遵照指示以确保安全
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt and obey all instructions for a safe trip.

317
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,572
我想你比较注意女性的声音
I thought you'd pay more attention to a female voice.

318
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,873
- 我想我们见过面了 - 我对你那些…
- I think we've met. - I am not interested...

319
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,913
脏脏的恶作剧没什么兴趣
in your sordid escapades.

320
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:18,884
让我们继续吧，好吗？
Let's get on with it, shall we?

321
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:20,884
你的新电话
Your new telephone.

322
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,724
听跟说都是这里
Talk here, listen here.

323
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,315
所以这几年我都做错了
So that's what I've been doing wrong all these years.

324
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,396
它还有指纹扫瞄…
It also includes a fingerprint scanner...

325
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,437
跟两万瓦的保全系统
and a 20,000-volt security system.

326
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,527
还有我最得意的…
And this I'm particularly proud of...

327
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,478
你车子的遥控器
the remote control for your car.

328
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,238
压两次
Tap twice.

329
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,979
一，二
One, two.

330
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,790
移动你的手指
Now, draw your finger...

331
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,380
慢慢地划过垫子…
very slowly across the pad...

332
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,461
来开车
to drive the car.

333
00:29:58,302 --> 00:30:01,892
做起来有点困难但经过练习…
It's surprisingly difficult to drive, but with practice...

334
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:05,443
我们来看看她对我的触摸有什么反应？
Well, let's see how she responds to my touch, eh, Q?

335
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:32,009
我们很了解彼此
I think we understand each other.

336
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,939
别那么幼稚了，007
Grow up, 007.

337
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:54,623
注意，车子仍开动，请关上门
Attention. Engine running. Please shut door now.

338
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:56,604
别让她玩得团团转
Don't let her push you around.

339
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:11,417
这些恶意的谣言完全不正确
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth in this malicious rumor...

340
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:14,018
竟然说是我开始报导狂牛病事件
that I started running Mad Cow Disease stories...

341
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:17,998
是因为英国的牛肉大王安格斯布拉克爵士…
simply because Sir Angus Black, the great British beef baron...

342
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,689
在牌局中输给我一万镑，最后又不认帐
lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game of poker and refused to pay up.

343
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,500
另一个谣言更不正确
Moreover, there's even less truth in the rumor...

344
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,541
说法国给我一亿法郎
that I took 100 million francs from the French...

345
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,841
要我在未来的一年中继续报导这则新闻
to keep the stories running for another year.

346
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:32,671
- 打扰了，卡佛先生 - 是的
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver. - Yes.

347
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:35,612
这是新来的银行家
This is the new banker, Mr...

348
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,583
詹姆斯邦德
Bond. James Bond.

349
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:41,713
另一个新银行家，我好像在收集他们
Another new banker. I seem to collect them.

350
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:45,024
请告诉我，邦德先生
Tell me, Mr. Bond.

351
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,565
市场对这次危机的反应如何？
How's the market reacting to the crisis?

352
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:50,725
货币下跌，你们公司的股票正在上升
Well, currencies are off. Your stock is soaring.

353
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:54,076
我们以前没见过
I don't believe we have met.

354
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,237
- 我是艾利欧卡佛 - 我是林葳
- Elliot Carver. - Wai Lin.

355
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:59,437
我在中国新华社工作
I'm from the New China News Agency.

356
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,608
我没在宾客名单看到你的名字
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.

357
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:03,278
坦白说
I have a confession.

358
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:06,748
我是偷溜进来的
It's not. I snuck in.

359
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,379
你为什么要这么做，亲爱的？
Why would you do that, my dear?

360
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,390
我想见你
I wanted to meet you.

361
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,430
非常好
Outstanding.

362
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,401
我欣赏主动的女人
I admire a woman who takes the initiative.

363
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,901
- 你该在我的北京分社工作 - 卡佛先生
- You should work in my Beijing bureau. - Mr. Carver.

364
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:23,632
- 你在北京没有分社 - 叫我艾利欧就可以
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing. - Call me Elliot.

365
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:38,245
我一直好奇再次见到你会是什么感觉？
I always wondered how I'd feel if I ever saw you again.

366
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,598
现在我知道了
Now I know.

367
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,368
是我说了什么吗？
Was it something I said?

368
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:55,009
对“我马上回来”这句话有印象吗？
How about the words, "I'll be right back?"

369
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,450
- 突然有事 - 你总是突然有事
- Something came up. - Something always came up.

370
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,551
- 你好吗？帕莉丝 - 现在好多了，我们扯平了
- And how are you, Paris? - Much better now. We're even.

371
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:07,562
你要喝点什么吗？卡佛太太
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

372
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:11,462
给邦德先生一杯用摇的不是用搅的伏特加马汀尼
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

373
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,833
卡佛太太要一杯纯龙舌兰酒
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila, straight shot.

374
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:19,604
不，卡佛太太要一杯卡佛先生的香槟
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass of Mr. Carver's champagne.

375
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:23,405
看来你的身分提高了不少
I see you've moved up in the world, Paris.

376
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,455
今晚你是个银行家，我看到宾客名单
And tonight, you're a banker. I saw the guest list.

377
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:31,076
你睡觉时仍将枪放在枕头下吗？
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

378
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,769
- 敬你 - 不，敬你的枪
- To you. - No, to the gun.

379
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:54,911
我想你不是为社交活动来的吧？
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

380
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:57,012
你先生可能有麻烦
Your husband may be in trouble.

381
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,552
他是传播界之王
The emperor of the air.

382
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,183
如果你认为可以捉到他，那你才有麻烦
If you think you're going after him, you're the one who's in trouble.

383
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:05,993
或许吧，但不是他就是他的属下
Perhaps, but it's either him or someone in his organization.

384
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:09,404
原来如此，你以为能从我这儿得到线索
I see. And you figured you could charm the dirt out of me.

385
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:12,265
不，那不是我的计划
No. That wasn't my plan.

386
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:14,776
很好，如果要我在…
Good. Because if it comes to a choice...

387
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,206
你们之中选择，我已做了抉择
between you and Elliot, I've made my bed.

388
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:19,547
你已被三振出局
You don't sleep in it anymore.

389
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:21,207
原来你在这里
There you are.

390
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,208
亲爱的
Darling.

391
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,899
我到处找你
I've been looking everywhere for you.

392
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:33,289
我想让你见见林葳，她在新华社工作
I want you to meet Wai Lin, New China News Agency.

393
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,130
- 你好，卡佛太太 - 很荣幸认识你
- Hello, Mrs. Carver. - It's a pleasure.

394
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,671
这是詹姆斯邦德
And this is James Bond.

395
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:41,331
我不知道你们认识
I didn't realize you knew each other.

396
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,312
- 我们是老朋友 - 泛泛之交
- We're old friends. - Casual acquaintances.

397
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,742
他在苏黎世时是我室友的男友
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

398
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:51,083
我想雇用林葳小姐
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin behind a news desk.

399
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,584
那太好了，我想她一定不会…
That's wonderful. I'm sure she won't resist...

400
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,614
拒绝
too much.

401
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:00,565
告诉我，我在想着关于你的卫星
Tell me, Elliot, I was just wondering about your satellites...

402
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,136
你在全球部署的方式
the way you've positioned yourself globally.

403
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:06,226
它们只是用来广播资讯
They're merely tools for information, Mr. Bond.

404
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,897
也可能是虚假资讯
Or disinformation.

405
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:12,377
例如，你能用卫星去干扰政府或人们
Say, if you wanted to manipulate the course of governments or people.

406
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:14,438
甚至是一艘船
Or even a ship.

407
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,349
真有趣，邦德先生
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

408
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,090
作为一个银行家，你的想像力非常丰富
You have a vivid imagination for a banker.

409
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,630
或许我该委任你写小说
Perhaps I should commission you to write a novel.

410
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,631
不行，我会迷失在大海中，漂流
Oh, heavens, no. I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

411
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:40,273
开幕的时间到了
It's time to begin the festivities.

412
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,874
失陪一下，亲爱的？
Excuse me. Darling?

413
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,045
你怎么认识他的？
So, how do you really know him?

414
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:52,146
我已说了，他是个银行家，我们在苏黎世认识的
I told you, he's a banker. I met him in Zurich.

415
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:54,357
你说谎的技巧很差
You're a terrible liar, dear.

416
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:00,468
我看那个银行家不顺眼
I have a problem with a banker.

417
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:03,268
你可否跟我来一下？
Could I see you a moment?

418
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,939
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen.

419
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,170
卡佛先生十分钟后会在大厅开始致词
Mr. Carver's broadcast will be starting in ten minutes in the main studio.

420
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:18,261
你擅长哪方面的银行业务？
Exactly what kind of banking do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

421
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:23,852
敌意收购，我们走吧？
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

422
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:36,645
卡佛在这里一定感觉像在家一样
Carver must feel at home in a room like this.

423
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,186
能够对着全世界说话真好
It's nice to talk to the world.

424
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,587
看起来有人想跟你谈谈
Looks like there's someone who wants to talk to you.

425
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,758
邦德先生，你有一通紧急电话
Mr. Bond, you have an urgent phone call.

426
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,500
各位，五秒后现场播出，五
Ladies and gentlemen, we are live in five...

427
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,111
四，三，二…
four, three, two...

428
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,111
晚安
Good evening.

429
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,912
今晚的广播应该是个庆典
Tonight's broadcast was supposed to be a celebration...

430
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,753
显示卡佛全球卫星网络的完成
marking the completion of the Carver Global Satellite Network.

431
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:15,353
但你们知道
But, as you're well aware...

432
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:18,524
南中国海出现冲突
a terrible conflict looms tonight in the South China Sea...

433
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,325
不加制止的话
which, unchecked...

434
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:26,136
可能会毁灭地球上每一个人
has the potential to destroy every human being on Earth.

435
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:29,806
- 我想向观众保证，我… - 这边请
- I want to assure my viewers that I... - This way, please.

436
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:33,247
艾利欧卡佛跟英首相…
Elliot Carver, have spoken with the prime minister in London...

437
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,248
及在北京的主席谈过
and the chairman in Beijing...

438
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:37,948
提出我作为不偏不倚的…
and have offered my services as an impartial...

439
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,459
这房间有隔音设备，没人会听到你的叫声
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond. Nobody hears you scream.

440
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,691
史丹博，我们已接头了
Herr Stamper, we have made contact.

441
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,302
好好对付他
Make him uncomfortable.

442
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:57,712
我待会儿就来
I'll be there in a few moments.

443
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:01,183
24小时刊印新闻
...with its printing presses that run 24 hours a day...

444
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:04,484
卫星联系每一个…
and its satellite facilities linking every last...

445
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:11,555
你好像很关心卡佛先生的生意
You seem very concerned about Mr. Carver's business.

446
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:16,066
他想知道原因
He wants to know why.

447
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,467
你们问我为何这么做
Why did I do it, you ask.

448
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,838
答案很简单，权力
The answer is simple: Power.

449
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:25,738
启发地球偏远地区的人权力
The power to illuminate the far corners of the globe.

450
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,749
不为利润
Not for higher profits...

451
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:32,279
而是促进人与人之间的了解
but for higher understanding between the people of this great planet.

452
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,120
让他坐在椅子上，我们在他头上玩点把戏
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play a little number on his head.

453
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:44,892
我想得到什么回报？
And what do I expect in return?

454
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,663
支配全球
Worldwide domination.

455
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:51,903
完完全全，彻底的支配全球
Complete, utter, total worldwide domination.

456
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:55,214
但不是凌驾政府或意识形态
But not over governments or ideology.

457
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:59,755
是凌驾暴政，隔绝及无知
Over tyranny and isolation and ignorance.

458
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:04,046
卡佛媒体集团有能力
The Carver Media Group Network has the ability...

459
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:08,227
接触每一个人，在每个村庄，每个国家
to reach every person in every village in every nation.

460
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,288
但别感到害怕
But do not fear me...

461
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,928
我今晚提出的原则宣言
for tonight I offer you my declaration of principles:

462
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:16,239
承诺地球上每一个男女
A promise to the men and women of this planet...

463
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:19,609
我所服务的兄弟姐妹
my brothers and sisters whom I so humbly serve.

464
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,981
不偏不倚，没有恐惧的报导新闻
I promise to report the news without fear or favor.

465
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:28,581
我承诺作为这世上的善良力量
I promise to be a force for good in this world...

466
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:32,252
反抗不公正，压倒偏执
fighting injustice, crushing intolerance...

467
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,623
向不人道宣战
battling inhumanity.

468
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:36,463
该是…
It's time for...

469
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:40,664
广播中断的时候了
a station break.

470
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,045
- 怎么了？ - 我们失去了电力
- What's happening? - We've lost power.

471
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,306
- 广播中断 - 什么？
- We're off the air. - What?

472
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:59,178
各位，请保持冷静，不用离去
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm. There's no need to go for the exit.

473
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,628
几分钟后会恢复电力
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

474
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:05,259
什么意思，你不知道？你被开除了！滚！
What do you mean, you don't know? You're fired! Get out of my sight!

475
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,229
颇令人尴尬的…
And, in a rather embarrassing note...

476
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,920
好战的媒体巨子卡佛今晚在全球的…
scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver was cut off the air tonight...

477
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,431
卫星网络首播致词时
in mid-speech during the inaugural broadcast...

478
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,401
被半途中断
of his Worldwide Satellite Network.

479
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:06,102
很抱歉，艾利欧，不是我们做的
Sorry, Elliot, but we didn't do it.

480
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,813
很光彩的晚上，不是吗？
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

481
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:13,143
别管那些人
Come on, Elliot. Ignore those people.

482
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:15,914
- 这种事常常会发生 - 不会在我身上的
- Sometimes these things happen. - Not to me.

483
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,925
不会在我身上的
Not to me!

484
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:31,898
我16岁时在香港一间报社工作
When I was 16, I went to work for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

485
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:37,809
是间小报社，但编辑教导了我最重要的事
It was a rag, but the editor taught me one important lesson.

486
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:41,009
出色的报导，关键不在于人物
The key to a great story is not who...

487
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,350
内容或时间
or what or when...

488
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:46,491
而是原因
but why.

489
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:52,021
你的朋友邦德先生把今晚搞砸了
Your friend, Mr. Bond, made a mess tonight.

490
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:57,192
- 我想知道原因 - 我已说了，我跟他是泛泛之交
- I want to know why. - I told you, I barely know him.

491
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:00,694
泛泛之交？
Barely?

492
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,340
我正在好奇卡佛先生会派谁来
I was curious who Carver would send.

493
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:33,971
他要对付你
He's on to you.

494
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,481
我们都知道你站在谁那边
Well, we know where you stand.

495
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:41,352
你已做了抉择
You made your bed.

496
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,723
我正站在你的房门口
I'm standing in your doorway.

497
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,004
你可以转身回家了
Then turn around and go home.

498
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:55,195
告诉他从我这儿套不出什么
You can tell him you didn't get anything out of me.

499
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:01,036
就这样？回家去？
That's it? Go home?

500
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:05,417
我并没有要你牵涉这件事
I didn't ask you to get involved in this.

501
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:07,888
已经太迟了
It's too late for that.

502
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,170
你为何要嫁给他？
Why did you marry him?

503
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,170
他说他爱我
He told me he loved me.

504
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,741
这话很中听
That always sounds good.

505
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:29,042
我曾每天看报纸找你的仆闻
Do you know I used to look in the papers every day for your obituary?

506
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:33,083
抱歉，我令你失望了
Well, I'm sorry I keep disappointing you.

507
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,425
到底是为什么？
What was it, James?

508
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,336
我太接近吗？
Did I get too close?

509
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,477
近到让你不舒服？
Did I get too close for comfort?

510
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,320
是的
Yes.

511
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,921
我想念你
I missed you.

512
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,393
你查到什么？
What did you find?

513
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:10,763
我黑入银行的电脑，他们在使用SSL2…
I hacked into the mainframe at the bank. They're using an SSL2 encryption...

514
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:14,174
省掉这段高科技词汇
Spare me the technobabble, please.

515
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,835
邦德有完美的受雇记录，十年
Bond's got a perfect employment record. Ten years.

516
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,375
他做事非常小心谨慎
He's crossed every "T," he's dotted every "I."

517
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:21,606
- 什么意思？ - 是政府的情报员
- Which means? - Government agent.

518
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,586
我称之为古达创意异例定律
I call it Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

519
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:27,587
若是毫无破绽的，定有问题
If it sounds too good to be true, it always is.

520
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,218
你认为我老婆知道吗？
Do you think my wife knows?

521
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,999
太多杂音，但若调低四周的声音…
There's a lot of garbage, but if you dial down the ambient noise...

522
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,410
你睡觉时仍将枪放在枕头下吗？
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

523
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:47,481
再来一次
Play it again.

524
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:51,382
你睡觉时仍将枪放在枕头下吗？
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

525
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:56,883
我想该安排她跟医生见面了
I think we should set an appointment for my wife with the doctor.

526
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:18,078
- 我必须走了 - 不，你不必
- I have to go. - No, you don't.

527
00:46:18,148 --> 00:46:20,378
我可以让你在四小时内离开这个国家
I can get you out of the country in four hours.

528
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:22,319
我别无选择
I have no choice.

529
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:25,829
没人可以保护我免遭他毒手，连你都不行
No one can protect me from him, not even you.

530
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,730
- 你有选择 - 除非你放过他
- You do have a choice. - Only if you let him go.

531
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,730
我办不到
I can't do that.

532
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:38,202
他在顶层有个秘密实验室，甚至连我都不应该知道
He has a secret lab on the top floor even I'm not supposed to know about.

533
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:40,212
在屋顶有个紧急天窗
There's an emergency hatch on the roof.

534
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:42,513
- 你不必告诉我 - 那是最容易进去的地方
- You don't have to do this. - It's the easiest way to get in.

535
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,553
别跟我争辩
Don't argue with me, James.

536
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:48,454
你知道吗…
You know...

537
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:51,825
你的这个工作…
this job of yours...

538
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:57,166
是个感情上的致命武器
it's murder on relationships.

539
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,793
我不在的这段时间，派两个人…
Until I get back next week, I want two guards...

540
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:23,234
每天24小时在外面守卫
outside this office 24 hours a day.

541
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,164
谁也不能够进来
Nobody gets in. Got it?

542
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:27,365
我们会处理
We'll take care of it.

543
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,566
卫星怎么办？
What do we do with the satellite?

544
00:48:34,717 --> 00:48:37,517
送到发射站，小心点
Send this thing off to the launch site. And be careful.

545
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:41,817
它值三亿元，你打破了它，你就要买下来
It's worth 300 million dollars. You break it, you bought it. Understand?

546
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:44,448
我讨厌旅行，从来都不知道要打包什么
I hate travelling. I never know what to pack.

547
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,340
在找寻新的题材吗？
Looking for a news story?

548
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:38,897
现在他们什么都印
They'll print anything these days.

549
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,781
哪位？
Yes?

550
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:46,791
早安，邦德先生，我是卡佛
Good morning, Mr. Bond. Elliot Carver.

551
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:50,162
我相信你拿走两件属于我的东西
I believe you've got two items that belong to me.

552
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,253
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

553
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,303
红色的盒子，邦德先生
The red box, Mr. Bond...

554
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:58,204
还有我老婆在你饭店的房间
and my wife in your hotel room.

555
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:12,587
他来了
He's coming.

556
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:19,899
指纹身分已被确认
Fingerprint I.D. Accepted.

557
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:29,471
请选择保全程度
Please select security system level.

558
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:55,006
你如果找到编码器便通知我
Tell me if you find the encoder.

559
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,137
- 立刻打电话给我 - 好
- Call me immediately. - Yeah.

560
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,720
最新消息
And in breaking news...

561
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,831
我们伤心的宣布帕莉丝卡佛的死讯
it is with great sadness that we announce the death of Paris Carver...

562
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,531
她自成为卡佛太太后
who has become an international figure since she became the wife...

563
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,872
名闻国际
of Elliot Carver, chairman of this network.

564
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:27,113
德国汉堡警方表示
According to police officials in Hamburg, Germany...

565
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:29,113
她今早被发现
Mrs. Carver was found dead this morning...

566
00:55:29,184 --> 00:55:33,644
倒毙在饭店套房，死因异常
in a hotel suite in that city in unusual circumstances...

567
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:36,315
警方拒绝进一步透露详情
on which police have refused to elaborate.

568
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:39,125
法医验尸在三天后…
A coroner has been called for and is expected to deliver...

569
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:42,636
会有全面报告
his full report within the next three days.

570
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:46,437
她身旁有一个不知名男子的尸体
Her body was discovered along with the body of an unidentified man...

571
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:49,667
相信他是吞枪自杀
who appeared to be the victim of a self-inflicted gun wound.

572
00:55:49,738 --> 00:55:52,038
在他的私人飞机上联络到他…
Reached aboard his private jet en route...

573
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,139
我已经瞄准你的头，邦德先生
I have a clear shot at your head, Mr. Bond.

574
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:59,119
慢慢的站起来
Stand up, slowly.

575
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,680
扔下枪将它踢过来给我
Drop your gun and kick it toward me, ja?

576
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:04,191
警方拒绝猜测…
At present, police have refused to speculate...

577
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,591
这宗杀人跟自杀的动机
on a motive in this murder/suicide.

578
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:08,492
好的，现在…
Good. Now...

579
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:11,262
躺在卡佛太太身旁
lie down on the bed next to Mrs. Carver.

580
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:14,273
我们向卡佛先生致深切慰问
We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Carver.

581
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:19,834
一小时后会有报导
This story will be on the news in an hour.

582
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:24,045
- 今天的明日报新闻 - 没错
- Tomorrow's news today. - Just so.

583
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:33,157
我是高夫曼医生
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

584
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:36,627
是一名出色的神枪手
I am an outstanding pistol marksman.

585
00:56:36,698 --> 00:56:38,858
请相信我，好吗？
Take my word for it, ja?

586
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:45,909
拿长柄大锤过来
Get the sledgehammers.

587
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:01,123
她很奋力的反抗
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

588
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:04,723
你不该将她牵涉入此事
It's a pity you got her involved in all this.

589
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,994
你从那儿开枪杀我就不像是自杀
It won't look like a suicide if you shoot me from over there.

590
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:12,765
我是法医学教授
I am a professor of forensic medicine.

591
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,406
相信我，就算我从远方射杀你…
Believe me, Mr. Bond, I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

592
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:18,076
也可以有自杀的效果
and still create the proper effect.

593
00:57:26,158 --> 00:57:29,148
我的技术很受欢迎
My art is in great demand, Mr. Bond.

594
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:31,219
世界各地都有人雇用我
I go all over the world.

595
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:35,739
我擅长使名人服食过量药物死亡
I am especially good at the celebrity overdose.

596
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,300
但恐怕我们的…
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond, that our little...

597
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:45,472
史丹博，别在我的耳朵大叫，好吗？
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, ja?

598
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:48,042
他们打不开车门
Sir, they can't get into the car.

599
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:50,613
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious.

600
00:57:50,724 --> 00:57:54,384
- 有找过汽车拖吊所吗？ - 你要打电话给他们吗？
- Did you call the Auto Club? - Do you want to call them?

601
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,424
逼他说出如何打开车门
Make him tell you how to open it.

602
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:58,435
好，我来问
Okay, I ask.

603
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,336
这真难为情
This is very embarrassing.

604
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:04,636
好像有个红盒子在你车上
It seems there is a red box in your car.

605
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,566
他们无法打开车门
They can't get to it.

606
00:58:06,637 --> 00:58:10,577
他们要我逼你打开车门
They want me to make you unlock the car.

607
00:58:10,648 --> 00:58:13,448
我感觉像个白痴，不知道应该说什么
I feel like an idiot. I don't know what to say.

608
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:18,149
若你不听话，我就折磨你
I am to torture you if you don't do it.

609
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:21,489
- 你也是这方面的博士？ - 不…
- You've a doctorate in that too? - No, no, no.

610
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,460
算是个嗜好，但我很有天分
This is more like a hobby. But I'm very gifted.

611
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,861
我相信你
Oh, I believe you.

612
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:30,732
- 我的手机可以打开车门 - 不，邦德先生
- My cell phone opens the car. - No, Mr. Bond.

613
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,872
让我来，好吗？
I do it, ja?

614
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:40,043
重拨，再按三，然后送出
Recall, three, send.

615
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,426
等一下
Wait.

616
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:55,436
我是职业杀手，只是收钱办事
I'm just a professional doing a job.

617
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,797
我也是
Me too.

618
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,064
高夫曼医生
Dr. Kaufman.

619
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:02,211
欢迎，请系上安全带
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt.

620
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,583
减速
Reduce speed.

621
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:11,823
有行人在路上
Pedestrians in roadway.

622
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:18,767
司机请小心
Driver alert.

623
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,277
前面有障碍，请马上减速
Obstruction ahead. Reduce speed now.

624
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:46,305
请注意，鲁莽驾驶将使保证无效
Reminder: Unsafe driving will void warranty.

625
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:33,935
恭喜你一路平安
Congratulations on a safe journey.

626
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:44,608
南中国海美国空军基地
U.S. Air Base, South China Sea

627
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,231
詹姆斯
Yo! Jimbo!

628
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,331
韦德，你为什么会在这里？
Wade, what are you doing here?

629
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:06,412
你知道我是四海为家的，走这边吧
You know the world's my office. Let's go this way.

630
01:04:06,512 --> 01:04:08,442
Q博士有跟你解释清楚吗？
Did Q bring you up to speed?

631
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:11,483
有，我已经带了全球定位卫星的校准仪器来
Yeah. I brought along the G.P.S. Calibration unit.

632
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:16,315
顺便跟你提一下，正式来说，美国在这次行动是中立的
By the way, officially Uncle Sam is completely neutral in this turkey shoot.

633
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,785
非正式呢？
And unofficially?

634
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,985
除非是美国先开战，否则我们不希望看到世界大战
We have no interest in seeing World War Three, unless we start it.

635
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,426
格林渥特博士是定位卫星的专家
Dr. Greenwalt. He's the Air Force G.P.S. Expert.

636
01:04:24,496 --> 01:04:26,436
很抱歉，保安那么严密
Sorry about all this security...

637
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:29,767
定位卫星的编码器…
but the G.P.S. Encoder is one of the most closely guarded secrets...

638
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:31,267
是美国军方的最高机密
in the U.S. Military.

639
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:33,208
让他看看你有什么
Show him what you got.

640
01:04:37,549 --> 01:04:40,479
我的天，这是失去了的编码器，你怎样拿到的？
Jesus, it's the missing encoder. How the hell did you get that?

641
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:43,150
昨天早上在汉堡找到的
Picked it up in Hamburg yesterday morning.

642
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,590
它可以使船舰偏离航道吗？
Could somebody use this to send a ship off course?

643
01:04:46,661 --> 01:04:48,181
- 你指的是得文夏号？ - 别瞎猜
- Like the Devonshire? - Whoa!

644
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:50,451
没人说过得文夏号，是吗？
I didn't you hear anybody mention the Devonshire. Did you?

645
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:54,492
- 是 - 那你快回答他的问题
- No. - Good. So just answer his question.

646
01:04:54,573 --> 01:04:57,063
理论上，如果你能影响计时芯片
In theory, if you could alter the timing chip...

647
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,573
你就可以使船舰偏离航道
you could slowly send a ship off course.

648
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:03,634
- 好像在指南针旁边放置磁铁 - 没错
- Like putting a magnet near a compass. - Yeah, exactly.

649
01:05:03,714 --> 01:05:06,074
- 请你检查一下这个 - 好的
- Then check this out. - Oh, yeah.

650
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:21,557
这两个圆圈是应该重叠的
Those two circles should be lining up on top of each other.

651
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:23,538
有人曾经改动过编码器
Somebody's tampered with your encoder.

652
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:28,639
如果知道得文夏号最后显示的时间和位置
If we knew the last time and position the Devonshire thought she was...

653
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,470
你能够找出它沉没的地点吗？
could you figure out exactly where she sank?

654
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,040
当然可以
Sure.

655
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,681
韦德
Wade...

656
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,781
我要请你帮个小忙
I have a small favor to ask.

657
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:48,333
高空起跳、低空张伞…
The high-altitude, low opening jump... the HALO jump...

658
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:51,594
是最易致命的，所以请听清楚
is where we get the most fatalities, so listen up.

659
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:55,975
你自由下降五英里和要使用氧气，否则你会窒息而死
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

660
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,595
就像我的第一段婚姻
Sounds like my first marriage.

661
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,706
自由下降之后…
After the free-fall...

662
01:05:59,776 --> 01:06:02,446
在离地二百尺时打开降落伞，那能避开中国的雷达
pop the chute at 200 feet, below the Chinese radar.

663
01:06:02,517 --> 01:06:04,447
你的时速将会超过二百英里
You'll be traveling at over 200 miles an hour.

664
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:06,457
风力随时能扭断你的脖子
This snaps your head back like a cantaloupe.

665
01:06:06,518 --> 01:06:09,078
头部别撞到氧气筒
Don't crack your skull open on the tanks.

666
01:06:09,158 --> 01:06:10,748
我会紧记着
I'll keep that in mind.

667
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:14,529
最后，当你到达水面就马上切断降落伞
One last thing: When you hit the water don't forget to cut away your chute.

668
01:06:14,629 --> 01:06:19,189
百分之九十进行这种跳法的人都被降落伞缠着而溺毙
90% of people killed in the HALO jump got tangled in their chutes and drowned.

669
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,530
明白吗？
Got it?

670
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,801
为了拯救世界，要做的事情可真不少
Seems like a lot just to save the world.

671
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:24,471
我没有别的选择
I've got no choice.

672
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:27,641
我要证明军舰是被故意引离航道
I have to prove that ship was deliberately set off course.

673
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:28,942
一分钟
One minute!

674
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:30,912
- 安排好接应了吗？ - 当然
- Is the pickup set? - You bet.

675
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:35,083
完成任务之后就把无线电开着，我们会来接应你
After your mission, turn on your beacon. The extraction team will pick you up.

676
01:06:37,054 --> 01:06:39,394
祝你好运
Buddha bless!

677
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:41,755
- 我刚刚发现… - 什么？
- I just noticed something. - Yeah?

678
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,455
这里是军舰误认的地点
This is where the ship thought it was.

679
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:46,936
这里是军舰真正的地点，看到这个岛吗？
This is where it really is. But see that island?

680
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:50,406
- 是的 - 他将要降落的地方
- Yeah. - That means where he's jumping...

681
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:53,137
刚好在英国跟中国的舰队中间
between the British and Chinese fleets...

682
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:55,507
严格来说，这里不是中国的领海
Technically they're not in Chinese territorial waters.

683
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,208
- 这里其实是越南的领海 - 越南的？
- They belong to Vietnam. - Vietnam?

684
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,489
他身上有美国政府的标记吗？
Does he have any U.S. Government markings on him?

685
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,649
降落伞、潜水衣、蛙鞋全都有
The parachute, the wet suit, the fins.

686
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,960
如果越南人捉到他，他们会发疯的
If the Vietnamese catch him, they're gonna go crazy.

687
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:14,391
他不辞而别
He didn't even say good-bye.

688
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:36,146
对敌意收购有兴趣吗？
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

689
01:11:36,987 --> 01:11:40,357
我最喜欢当银行家可以到处旅行
It's the opportunities for travel that I like best about banking.

690
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,258
开过来这边
Bring the boat.

691
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:47,889
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

692
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:01,842
带他们上来
Get them out of the water.

693
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:20,765
若是不知道，还以为你在跟踪我
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were following me around, Mr. Bond.

694
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:22,846
你也得承认…
You'll have to admit, though...

695
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:26,007
我们似乎发展了密不可分的关系
we seem to have developed a certain attachment to each other.

696
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:29,178
希望只是暂时的
Hopefully not for long.

697
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:35,579
另一幢卡佛的大厦
Another Carver building.

698
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:39,289
若是不知道，我还以为他开发了一整片的摩天大厦
If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd developed an edifice complex.

699
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:03,124
张将军？你的朋友？
General Chang? Friend of yours?

700
01:13:05,396 --> 01:13:07,866
邦德先生，林小姐
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

701
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:11,227
欢迎来到西贡市
Welcome to Saigon.

702
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:13,237
真高兴又看到你，艾利欧
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

703
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:16,837
我准备在明天启用这幢大厦
I hadn't intended opening this center until tomorrow...

704
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:20,778
你现在来到，刚好可以帮我写开幕故事
but as you're here you can help me to write the inaugural story...

705
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:22,469
就是你的仆文
your obituaries.

706
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:25,349
希望你对帕莉丝也这么好
I hope you extended the same courtesy to Paris.

707
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:31,550
其实当你叫我已故的太太出卖我时…
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one who wrote my late wife's obituary...

708
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:33,521
你已经为她写了仆文
when you asked her to betray me.

709
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:36,622
没关系，让我们看看…
Still, let's see...

710
01:13:36,732 --> 01:13:39,822
“英国情报员詹姆斯邦德”
"British secret service agent James Bond...

711
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:41,993
“跟中国情报员”
and his collaborator Wai Lin...

712
01:13:42,073 --> 01:13:45,003
“林葳小姐”
of the Chinese People's External Security Force...

713
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:46,604
“在今天早晨”
were found...

714
01:13:47,444 --> 01:13:49,714
“被发现…”
dead this morning...

715
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:51,715
“死于越南”
in Vietnam. "

716
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:56,516
太平淡了，是吗？
Lacks punch, don't you think?

717
01:13:56,586 --> 01:14:00,546
这已不是新闻，我跟她合作几个月了
It's old news, Elliot. We've been working together for months.

718
01:14:00,657 --> 01:14:03,627
我们两国政府都知道你跟张将军的勾当
Both our governments know what you and General Chang are up to.

719
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:07,498
我看不是
I don't think so.

720
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,839
你们也许在走廊看到张将军
You may have seen the general in the hallway just now...

721
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:12,069
但是你们可能太忙吧
but perhaps, with all your jetting around...

722
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,270
未看到今天的头条新闻
you've not had chance to peruse today's headlines.

723
01:14:20,451 --> 01:14:24,221
我最喜欢这一句，这还不是我的报纸呢
I rather like the last one. It isn't even mine.

724
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:26,382
我从不相信报纸的新闻
I never believe what I read in the press anyway.

725
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:29,583
这就是你的问题，邦德先生
Ah. Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

726
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:34,103
我们都是能干的人，但你跟林小姐的时代已成过去
We're both men of action, but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

727
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:38,634
现在，文字就是力量，卫星就是武器
Words are the new weapons, satellites the new artillery.

728
01:14:38,705 --> 01:14:41,935
而你就是世界联盟的最高统帅？
And you become the new supreme allied commander?

729
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,376
完全对！
Exactly!

730
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:46,386
凯撒跟拿破仑都有自己的军队
Caesar had his legions, Napoleon had his armies...

731
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:50,417
而我也有我的队伍… 电视、报纸、杂志
I have my divisions... TV, news, magazines.

732
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,618
到今晚午夜，收听到我广播的人…
And by midnight I'll have reached and influenced more people...

733
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:58,389
将是前所未见的多，除了上帝
than anyone in the history of this planet, save God Himself.

734
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,130
就算上帝也只是在山上讲道罢了
And the best He ever managed was the Sermon on the Mount.

735
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,730
你真的疯了
You really are quite insane.

736
01:15:05,311 --> 01:15:08,041
疯子跟天才的差别…
The distance between insanity and genius...

737
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,081
也不过是成功与失败
is measured only by success.

738
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:11,472
对不起
Excuse me.

739
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:14,802
张将军在等你
General Chang is waiting.

740
01:15:14,923 --> 01:15:15,923
很抱歉
If you'll forgive me,

741
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:17,543
你们的出现逼得我…
your appearance here has forced me...

742
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:19,693
得把时间表提早一点
to move up my timetable slightly.

743
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:23,424
我将你们交给史丹博跟他的玩具处理
I'll leave you in the capable hands of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

744
01:15:23,495 --> 01:15:25,085
或许你们想看看
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

745
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,725
直升机正在等
Sir. The helicopter.

746
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:29,096
谢谢，古达
Thanks, Gupta.

747
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:32,226
已故的史丹博是高夫曼医生的徒弟
Mr. Stamper is a protege of the late Dr. Kaufman...

748
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:35,467
高夫曼医生教授他古代的折磨艺术
who was schooling him in the ancient art of chakra torture.

749
01:15:36,547 --> 01:15:38,477
他就像我的父亲一样
He was like a father to me.

750
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:41,678
真的？很有趣的榜样
Really? Interesting role model.

751
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:44,849
根据东方的哲学，人体有七个要穴
According to Eastern philosophy, the body has seven chakra points.

752
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:48,189
它们是身体的能量中心，例如心脏或是性器官
Energy centers, like the heart or genitals.

753
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,590
这些工具是用来刺进那些器官的
The purpose of these implements is to probe those organs...

754
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:53,861
让痛苦达到极限
inflicting the maximum amount of pain...

755
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:57,091
而又能让受害者存活久一点
whilst keeping the victim alive for as long as possible.

756
01:15:57,172 --> 01:15:59,662
高夫曼的纪录是52小时
Dr. Kaufman's record was 52 hours.

757
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:02,532
我希望能打破它
I'm hoping to break it.

758
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:06,303
我以为看你的节目已是虐待了
Hmm. I would've thought watching your TV shows was torture enough.

759
01:16:07,714 --> 01:16:09,144
这个留到最后
Save this one till last.

760
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:12,274
当你拿出邦德的心脏时
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

761
01:16:12,355 --> 01:16:16,515
应该还有时间，让他看着自己的心脏停止跳动
there should be just enough time for him to watch it stop beating.

762
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:18,056
失陪了
Excuse me.

763
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:48,382
快走…
Go! Go! Go! Go!

764
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:58,034
我们能利用大型海报
We can use the banner.

765
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:02,545
希望可以支撑得了
Hope it holds.

766
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:07,106
- 快去追他们！ - 准备好没有？走
- Get after them! - Ready? Go!

767
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:33,852
下次我会搭电梯
Next time I'll take the elevator.

768
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,623
用力推…
Push! Push!

769
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:02,048
- 找部车来！ - 不…
- Get a car! - No, no!

770
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:04,488
- 是的，找车！ - 摩托车快一点
- Yes, a car! - A bike is quicker.

771
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,889
有钥匙，总是有人忘记
The keys. Someone always forgets them.

772
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:10,619
你在干嘛？我来骑，下来
What are you doing? I'm driving. Get off.

773
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,590
你坐后面
Get on the back.

774
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:18,201
我在滑下去
I'm slipping.

775
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,172
别在后面动来动去
Stop fidgeting back there.

776
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:26,913
你在做什么…
What are you...

777
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:28,473
给我另一边
Give me that.

778
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:30,614
离合器！离合器！离合器！
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

779
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:32,244
- 右转 - 不，左转
- Turn right. - No, left.

780
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:34,324
是谁在骑？快！
Who's driving? Come on!

781
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,221
离合器
Clutch!

782
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,893
左转…
Left! Left!

783
01:19:17,974 --> 01:19:19,604
后面有多少车跟来？
How many back there?

784
01:19:19,684 --> 01:19:21,674
我看不到，等等
I can't see. Hold on.

785
01:19:24,455 --> 01:19:26,115
你在做什么？
What are you... What?

786
01:19:28,256 --> 01:19:31,696
- 别想歪 - 我没想过
- Don't get any ideas. - I'd never dream of it.

787
01:19:33,627 --> 01:19:34,427
一台…不，两台
One... No, two.

788
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:43,009
- 利用那些桶子 - 什么？
- Go for the barrels. - What?

789
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,280
非常好
Very good.

790
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,794
抓紧
Hold on!

791
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,676
我们走上面
Let's take the highway.

792
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,441
- 直升机！ - 好，别太兴奋
- Helicopter! - All right, keep your shirt on.

793
01:21:29,372 --> 01:21:32,432
- 到后座去 - 你想要保护我？
- Get on the back of the bike. - Are you trying to protect me?

794
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:35,002
不，我需要平衡摩托车，到后座去
No. I need to balance the bike. Get on the back.

795
01:21:43,655 --> 01:21:45,455
- 准备好了吗？ - 好了
- You ready? - Yeah.

796
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,715
走！
Go!

797
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:01,838
放开离合器
Pop the clutch.

798
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:33,005
它在我们后面
It's behind us.

799
01:22:33,085 --> 01:22:34,545
快让开！
Move!

800
01:22:36,716 --> 01:22:39,086
让开！
Get out of the way!

801
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:11,493
你看到直升机吗？
You see the chopper?

802
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,663
我看不到，等等
I can't see. Hold on.

803
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:21,165
你又在…
What are you...

804
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:35,588
我们被困住了
Trapped.

805
01:23:38,429 --> 01:23:39,689
绝不会
Never.

806
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,619
你能拿肥皂给我吗？
Would you pass the soap?

807
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,960
在那里
Over there.

808
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:40,761
你甩钩子的技巧不错
You were pretty good with that hook.

809
01:24:40,872 --> 01:24:44,102
因为我出身恶劣的居住环境
It comes from growing up in a rough neighborhood.

810
01:24:44,172 --> 01:24:46,432
你骑摩托车的技术不错
You were pretty good on the bike.

811
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:50,413
因为我从没长大
Well, that comes from not growing up at all.

812
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:52,474
这里，让我来
Here. Allow me.

813
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:56,425
别动歪脑筋，邦德先生
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

814
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,425
我想起来，我们或可联手
Just off the cuff, I thought we might link up.

815
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:02,696
携手合作？
Work hand in hand?

816
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:06,166
彼此更接近
Stick closer to each other.

817
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:08,167
或许我们可一起对付张将军
Maybe we go after General Chang together.

818
01:25:10,268 --> 01:25:11,928
轮到你了
Your turn.

819
01:25:12,038 --> 01:25:14,008
谢谢你帮我洗头发
Thanks for washing my hair.

820
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,249
我喜欢独自行动
I work alone.

821
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:49,981
幸好我刚好经过
Lucky for you I stopped by.

822
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:52,932
我本可以自己解决他的
I could've taken care of him.

823
01:27:54,732 --> 01:27:56,862
但你没有
But you didn't.

824
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:58,873
耳环给我
Give me the earring.

825
01:28:00,714 --> 01:28:04,734
中国军方标准用枪
Copy of a Makarov 59. Standard issue, Chinese Army.

826
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,905
看起来张将军想杀你
Looks like General Chang wants you dead.

827
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:10,175
你仍认为你能独自行动？
You still think you can do this alone?

828
01:28:10,256 --> 01:28:13,716
那要看你的任务是和平的或是想报复
It depends whether your mission is peace or revenge.

829
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:16,226
我的任务是要制止战争
This is about stopping a war.

830
01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:24,328
去年我们发现一些隐形材料…
Last year we found stealth material was missing...

831
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:26,669
在张将军的基地失踪了
from one of General Chang's bases.

832
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:29,209
我追查线索到卡佛的汉堡总部
I followed a lead to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

833
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,870
隐形材料？
Stealth material?

834
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:32,910
我们以为他要做隐形飞机
We thought he was building a stealth plane.

835
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:37,041
不对，是一艘隐形船
No. Stealth boat.

836
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:39,141
那是他们唯一能接近得文夏号的方法
That's the only way they could get close to the Devonshire...

837
01:28:39,262 --> 01:28:41,592
所以他们才能钻开导弹室
so they could drill inside the missile room.

838
01:28:41,662 --> 01:28:45,462
记得吗？他们偷走了军舰上的导弹
Remember? They stole a cruise missile from that ship.

839
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:48,433
他说将时间表提前到午夜
He said he was moving the timetable forward to midnight.

840
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:50,564
对，他当然会这么做
Yes, of course he did.

841
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:52,904
他会利用黑夜，将船停靠在…
Under cover of darkness he'll position the stealth boat...

842
01:28:52,975 --> 01:28:54,705
接近英国舰队的地方
near the British fleet...

843
01:28:54,775 --> 01:28:57,405
然后向中国发射导弹
fire the missile into China.

844
01:28:57,476 --> 01:29:01,386
- 如此我们两国就会展开报复 - 卡佛就能大肆报导
- And we will retaliate. - And Carver will provide the pictures.

845
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:04,087
- 我必须警告北京 - 不
- I have to warn Beijing. - No.

846
01:29:04,157 --> 01:29:06,647
警告中英双方政府，让他们去谈
Let's warn both our governments, get them talking.

847
01:29:06,728 --> 01:29:08,558
这样我们就有时间能找到船
It'll give us time to find the boat.

848
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:09,618
站起来
Stand up.

849
01:29:31,223 --> 01:29:33,243
真有家的感觉
Hmm. It's just like home.

850
01:29:33,323 --> 01:29:35,753
你提供设备，那就我来发信
You get the equipment, I'll send the messages.

851
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:42,965
再仔细想想
On second thought...

852
01:29:43,035 --> 01:29:44,295
还是你来打字好了
you type.

853
01:29:45,366 --> 01:29:47,066
首先，我们得先找到船
First we find the boat.

854
01:29:48,706 --> 01:29:51,436
归属张将军管辖的所有港口跟海口…
Of all the harbors and inlets controlled by General Chang...

855
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:55,347
有22点人口密集地区
22 are in highly populated areas.

856
01:29:55,418 --> 01:29:58,048
剩下14点能让他藏匿隐形船
That leaves 14 where he could hide a stealth boat.

857
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:00,048
白天一定能看到它
You can see it during the day.

858
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:02,559
雷达探测不到，但肉眼一定能看到
It's invisible to radar, but not the human eye.

859
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:06,890
非常新奇
Very novel.

860
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,990
他一定将船藏在…
He'd have to hide it someplace...

861
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,401
能在一晚内往返得文夏号的地方
where he could sail to the Devonshire and back in one night.

862
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:15,332
这个看起来好熟悉
This looks familiar.

863
01:30:15,442 --> 01:30:17,342
我们做了一些改良
We've made some improvements.

864
01:30:18,143 --> 01:30:19,203
真的吗？
Have you, indeed?

865
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:23,513
好的，往返共八小时
Okay. Four hours out and four hours back.

866
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:27,644
我们可以假设船速三十海里
Let's assume the boat is traveling at a speed of 30 knots.

867
01:30:29,895 --> 01:30:33,055
我一向都很崇拜中国的科技
I've always been a fan of Chinese technology.

868
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:35,896
根据电脑显示
According to this...

869
01:30:35,966 --> 01:30:38,656
有四个地方能让他停靠那艘船
there are four places where he could harbor the boat.

870
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:40,597
小心你的左边
Up on your left.

871
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:45,768
查询看看那个地区有无可疑之处
Run a cross check on those areas for anything suspicious.

872
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,880
新型华特枪
Ah, the new Walther.

873
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,050
我已跟Q博士要求一支
I asked Q for one of these.

874
01:31:09,903 --> 01:31:12,303
我找到了，你来看看
I've got it. Look.

875
01:31:13,544 --> 01:31:16,274
四艘船失踪，三艘因不明原因下沉
Four missing boats. Three unexplained drownings.

876
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:17,605
这一定就是了
That has to be it.

877
01:31:19,686 --> 01:31:21,616
哈隆湾
Ha Long Bay.

878
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:39,909
他对那个岛很了解
He knows the island.

879
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:43,840
他说在黄昏时船只驶近那里会很危险
He says that it's dangerous for boats to be around there at sunset...

880
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:47,011
但为了五千元美元
but for 5,000 American dollars...

881
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:48,521
他会带我们去
he'll take us.

882
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:49,782
很好
Good.

883
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:51,792
或许他愿意收支票
Maybe he'll take a check.

884
01:32:06,775 --> 01:32:09,205
这是个沉闷的例行公事
It's mostly dull routine, of course...

885
01:32:09,276 --> 01:32:13,216
但偶而能有机会在迷人的黄昏出海
but every now and then you get to sail on a beautiful evening like this...

886
01:32:13,287 --> 01:32:17,687
有时跟腐败的西方势力的情报员合作
and sometimes work with a decadent agent of a corrupt Western power.

887
01:32:17,758 --> 01:32:20,318
大家都说共产主义者不懂享乐
And they say Communists don't know how to have fun.

888
01:32:21,188 --> 01:32:23,178
我不想让你感到失望
I hate to disappoint you...

889
01:32:23,259 --> 01:32:25,729
但我连毛语录都没有
but I don't even have a little red book.

890
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:31,200
如果我有不测
If anything happens to me...

891
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,741
水雷的引线在这里
the fuses for the mines are in here.

892
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,972
我们会一起完成任务
We're gonna finish this together.

893
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:42,012
如果我可以这么说的话，你找到了一位…
And if I may say so, you found the right...

894
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:45,543
合适的腐败的西方情报员…
decadent, corrupt Western agent...

895
01:32:45,624 --> 01:32:47,554
为工作伙伴
as a partner.

896
01:33:07,618 --> 01:33:09,738
- 看到隐形船了吗？ - 还没
- See the stealth? - No.

897
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:13,449
越来越晚了，这是附近最后一个海湾
It's getting late and this is the last cove in the bay.

898
01:33:21,801 --> 01:33:23,731
找到了
Yeah, that's it.

899
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:54,568
设定时间十分钟
Set the timers for ten minutes.

900
01:33:54,638 --> 01:33:57,628
应该有足够时间让我们在船爆炸之前离开
That'll give us time to get out of here before the ship explodes.

901
01:33:57,709 --> 01:34:00,409
就算它没沉也会显示在雷达上
Even if it doesn't sink, it'll show up on radar.

902
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:03,409
- 我们的舰队会完成工作 - 如果他们收到我们发出的信
- Our fleets will finish the job. - If they got our message.

903
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,420
- 你上去，移到那边 - 好的
- Okay, you, up and over. - Okay.

904
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:24,274
我们已在舰队之间
We're in position between the fleets.

905
01:34:24,344 --> 01:34:28,474
向双方舰队旗舰各发射一枚导弹
Fire one missile at the flagship of each fleet.

906
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:32,445
中国会以为英国耀武扬威
The Chinese will think the British are rattling the saber...

907
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:36,216
而英国会以为中国好战
the British will think the Chinese are being belligerent...

908
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:40,227
这时媒体就可提供精彩客观的报导
and the media will provide cool, objective coverage.

909
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:44,528
开始破坏行动
Let the mayhem begin.

910
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:54,510
英国舰队皇家比德福号

911
01:34:54,711 --> 01:34:56,011
被导弹锁定目标
Missile lock-on.

912
01:34:56,081 --> 01:35:00,411
通知海军总部“特遣舰队受到导弹攻击”
Send a signal to the Admiralty: "Task group under missile attack. "

913
01:35:02,122 --> 01:35:05,422
警报控制系统报告有米格21号机
Sir, AWACS reports two waves of land-based MIG 21s inbound.

914
01:35:05,493 --> 01:35:08,183
第一批将在两分钟内出现在雷达荧幕上
The first group should be on our screens in two minutes.

915
01:35:08,264 --> 01:35:12,494
还有多久米格机就会在英国舰队射程范围内？
How long before the MiGs are within firing range of the British fleet?

916
01:35:12,564 --> 01:35:13,654
12分钟
Twelve minutes.

917
01:35:15,205 --> 01:35:17,695
我雇用你来干嘛的？
What the hell do I pay you for?

918
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:23,606
如果她在那里，邦德也在那里
If she's there, Bond is there.

919
01:35:23,677 --> 01:35:25,237
史丹博，去找他们
Stamper, find them.

920
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:33,848
林葳…有摄影机！
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

921
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:45,041
她敢动一下，就杀了她
If she blinks, kill her.

922
01:35:45,101 --> 01:35:46,971
你跟我来
You come with me.

923
01:36:32,891 --> 01:36:36,191
史丹博呼叫驾驶台，邦德已死了
Stamper to Bridge. Bond is dead.

924
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:37,662
太好了
Delicious.

925
01:36:37,732 --> 01:36:41,132
要确保清除所有的水雷，将那个女的带来见我
Make sure you clear all the mines, and bring the girl up to me.

926
01:36:46,544 --> 01:36:48,674
你确定要带她上来？
Are you sure you want her up here?

927
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:51,485
这是我的事
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

928
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:53,385
我喜欢有观众
I like an audience.

929
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:01,797
林小姐
Ah, Miss Lin.

930
01:37:01,897 --> 01:37:04,627
你的同胞真合作
Your countrymen are being so cooperative...

931
01:37:04,698 --> 01:37:07,138
很急切的想要挽回面子
so predictably eager to save face.

932
01:37:07,209 --> 01:37:10,499
我的政府知道你在这里，他们正在找你
My government knows you're out here. They're looking for you.

933
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,379
据我们的雷达显示
Not according to our radar...

934
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:17,850
你们的米格机快要攻击英国舰队
where it seems your MiGs are about to attack the British fleet...

935
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:19,581
还有多久的时间？
in how many minutes?

936
01:37:19,651 --> 01:37:20,911
再九分钟就在射程范围内
Nine minutes to firing range.

937
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:24,421
就算他们正在找我
And even if they were looking for me...

938
01:37:24,492 --> 01:37:26,052
可是我们在隐形船上
we're on a stealth boat.

939
01:37:27,493 --> 01:37:30,723
他们看不见我，甚至你…
They can't see me, or you...

940
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:32,233
或是你的朋友…
or even your friend...

941
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:33,764
死去的邦德中校
the late Commander Bond...

942
01:37:33,834 --> 01:37:38,464
他这时正沉下南中国海底
who is at this moment on his way to the bottom of the South China Sea.

943
01:37:39,545 --> 01:37:41,515
他是我的新主播
He's my new anchorman.

944
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:55,518
真可怜
Pathetic.

945
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:02,030
到底发生了什么事？
What on earth's going on?

946
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,540
007发出的信息
A message from 007...

947
01:38:04,611 --> 01:38:07,541
也经中国情报主管证实
just confirmed by my opposite number in China.

948
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:11,911
“要求舰队搜寻一艘雷达几乎侦测不到的隐形船”
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship that's almost invisible to radar. "

949
01:38:12,782 --> 01:38:14,412
敌人不是中国
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

950
01:38:14,483 --> 01:38:17,923
卡佛愚弄了我们双方
Carver's been playing both sides for fools.

951
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:22,964
将军，从海军总部发出的急电
Admiral, sir, urgent message from the Admiralty.

952
01:38:25,295 --> 01:38:26,625
你看这个
Look at this.

953
01:38:28,706 --> 01:38:32,536
在雷达上侦测到任何小东西吗？像是救生艇或潜望镜吗？
Anything on radar that looks very small? Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

954
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:36,076
- 没有，长官 - 隐形船？他们一定疯了
- No, sir. - Stealth boat, sir? They have gone mad.

955
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,019
林小姐，你将看到的不只是导弹攻击
What you're about to witness, Miss Lin, is not so much a missile attack...

956
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,080
而是一个新时代的诞生
but the launch of a new world order.

957
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,430
五分钟后，你的同胞就会攻击英国舰队
In five minutes, after your countrymen have attacked the British fleet...

958
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:58,201
那时候我将会帮英国报复
I shall retaliate for dear old England...

959
01:38:58,272 --> 01:39:01,102
把导弹射向北京
by sending this missile into Beijing...

960
01:39:01,172 --> 01:39:04,612
就是张将军跟其他高级官员
where General Chang has just called an emergency meeting...

961
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:06,843
召开紧急会议的地方
of the Chinese high command.

962
01:39:06,914 --> 01:39:08,504
不幸的是…
Unfortunately...

963
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:13,144
张将军因为交通挤塞将会迟到
General Chang will be delayed in traffic...

964
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:18,026
会在其他领导人毙命后到达
arriving just after the missile has killed your leaders...

965
01:39:18,096 --> 01:39:22,496
他来不及阻止空军击沉英国舰队
and too late to stop the air force from sinking the entire British fleet.

966
01:39:24,237 --> 01:39:28,367
但是他将会接管中国政府与英国谈判停战
But he will be just in time to take over the government, negotiate a truce...

967
01:39:28,438 --> 01:39:31,168
摇身一变成为一个世界领袖
and emerge as a world leader...

968
01:39:31,249 --> 01:39:33,809
还会获得诺贝尔和平奖
with a Nobel Peace Prize.

969
01:39:33,879 --> 01:39:36,079
- 你可以得到什么？ - 我？
- And what do you get? - Me?

970
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,890
什么也没有
Oh, nothing.

971
01:39:40,521 --> 01:39:44,581
只有未来一百年，中国的独家电视广播权
Just exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next hundred years.

972
01:39:47,032 --> 01:39:48,962
已经准备好攻击
Ready to rock and ruin.

973
01:39:50,003 --> 01:39:53,533
林小姐，请恕失陪，我有工作需要去完成
If you'll excuse me, my dear, I have something of a deadline to meet.

974
01:39:53,603 --> 01:39:55,163
准备发射导弹
Prepare for the missile launch.

975
01:39:58,845 --> 01:40:00,105
古达先生
Mr. Gupta.

976
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:02,545
你好，艾利欧
Hello, Elliot.

977
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:04,915
很有趣的计划
Interesting plan.

978
01:40:04,986 --> 01:40:07,456
但是我有一些属于你的东西
But I think I have something of yours.

979
01:40:07,526 --> 01:40:10,756
德国人的办事效率真高
So much for German efficiency. Mr. Stamper.

980
01:40:19,969 --> 01:40:22,339
- 迟些才杀他 - 不要开枪
- Don't shoot him yet. - Hold your fire.

981
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,710
邦德先生，欢迎参观这次世界危机
Welcome to my world crisis, Mr. Bond.

982
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:28,471
公平的交易
Even trade, Elliot.

983
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:30,411
古达换林葳
Gupta for Wai Lin.

984
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:33,111
没有他你无法发射导弹
You can't fire the missile without him.

985
01:40:33,182 --> 01:40:36,812
而且你好像抗拒不了我拥有的女人
And it seems you can't resist any woman in my possession.

986
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:40,423
你还在等什么？射死他
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

987
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,663
我已说了我们会一起完成任务
I told you we're going to finish this together.

988
01:40:43,734 --> 01:40:45,724
真的非常浪漫
Oh, how romantic.

989
01:40:47,235 --> 01:40:49,895
你了解你现在的情况多荒谬吗？
Do you realize how absurd your position is?

990
01:40:50,005 --> 01:40:52,665
可没有你为了增加收视率而发动战争那么荒谬
No more absurd than starting a war for ratings.

991
01:40:52,776 --> 01:40:57,717
伟人都是利用媒体去拯救世界
Great men have always manipulated the media to save the world.

992
01:40:57,817 --> 01:41:00,447
威廉赫斯特曾对他的摄影师说
Look at William Randolph Hearst, who told his photographers...

993
01:41:00,518 --> 01:41:04,618
“你提供照片，我提供战争”
"You provide the pictures, I'll provide the war. "

994
01:41:04,688 --> 01:41:06,918
我只是先跨一步
I've just taken it one step further.

995
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:11,960
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

996
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:15,490
我刚才有点分心
I tuned out there for a moment, Elliot.

997
01:41:15,571 --> 01:41:17,371
太可惜了？
Touch?

998
01:41:18,371 --> 01:41:19,601
古达先生
Mr. Gupta...

999
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:21,442
导弹准备好发射没有？
is the missile ready to fire?

1000
01:41:21,512 --> 01:41:23,942
一按下按钮，北京就会消失
Press the magic button, Beijing disappears.

1001
01:41:25,153 --> 01:41:28,143
看来你活得比你的合约长
Then it seems you've outlived your contract.

1002
01:41:30,594 --> 01:41:33,554
我有个备用计划
You see, Mr. Bond, I have a backup plan.

1003
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:35,454
我也有
Uh-huh. So do I.

1004
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:02,520
他炸开了船身，雷达将会侦测到我们
He's breached the hull. They'll see us on radar.

1005
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:06,191
长官，我们收到一个在水面上微弱、间断的讯号
Sir, we have a small, intermittent contact on the surface.

1006
01:42:06,261 --> 01:42:09,101
在方位112度标绘出来
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

1007
01:42:09,172 --> 01:42:13,332
讯号很微弱，但我发誓几秒前它不在雷达上
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

1008
01:42:13,403 --> 01:42:17,573
通知舰队先别向中国发动攻击
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

1009
01:42:17,644 --> 01:42:20,344
通知中国舰队指挥官
Send the message to the Chinese fleet commander:

1010
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:21,904
“发现不明船只”
"Have sighted unknown ship... "

1011
01:42:21,985 --> 01:42:24,855
快将火扑灭！
Get those fires out!

1012
01:42:24,925 --> 01:42:27,015
下去保护导弹
Get down there and protect the missile.

1013
01:42:27,096 --> 01:42:31,616
史丹博，杀了那两个王八蛋
Oh, and Mr. Stamper, would you please kill those bastards?

1014
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,310
做得好
Nice work.

1015
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:55,711
他们正在加速
They're speeding up.

1016
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:58,952
- 我们必须停止它 - 你能解决引擎室吗？
- We have to stop the boat. - Can you take care of the engine room?

1017
01:42:59,032 --> 01:43:01,552
- 当然 - 好，做完后快离开船
- Of course. - Good. Do it and get off the ship.

1018
01:43:03,433 --> 01:43:05,373
我要去阻止导弹
I'm going to stop the missile.

1019
01:43:15,486 --> 01:43:17,416
中国舰队指挥官发出的信
Signal from the Chinese fleet commander.

1020
01:43:19,087 --> 01:43:21,017
“致皇家海军特遣舰队”
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

1021
01:43:21,087 --> 01:43:23,987
“我们的雷达也出现不明船只”
We also have the unknown ship on our screens.

1022
01:43:24,058 --> 01:43:27,158
“除非它向我们攻击，否则我们将不会开火”
We will not fire unless it turns toward China.

1023
01:43:27,228 --> 01:43:29,028
“它交由你们处理”
Until then, she's yours. "

1024
01:43:29,099 --> 01:43:32,429
“无论那是什么，将它击沉”
Now, Captain, whatever the hell that thing is, sink it.

1025
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:35,959
好的，回音是否太弱无法瞄准？
Right, sir. Is that echo too weak for missile lock?

1026
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:37,370
- 是的 - 好吧
- Yes, sir. - Right.

1027
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,500
我们采取传统的方法
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

1028
01:43:46,622 --> 01:43:49,182
邦德让我们变成目标
Bond turned us into the target.

1029
01:43:49,253 --> 01:43:51,223
他也一起陪葬
Along with himself.

1030
01:43:51,293 --> 01:43:53,923
准备迂回行动
Take evasive action.

1031
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:56,324
立即准备导弹倒数
Prepare the missile countdown immediately.

1032
01:43:56,394 --> 01:44:00,964
开始发射程序，倒数五分钟
Initializing launch sequence. "T" minus five minutes and counting.

1033
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:04,525
倒数五分钟
"T" minus five minutes and counting.

1034
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,736
他们时速48海里
Uh, sir, they're making 48 knots.

1035
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:09,367
两分钟后便超出射程范围
They'll be out of range in two minutes.

1036
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:11,507
继续开火，拖慢他们
Keep firing. Slow them down.

1037
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,451
引擎失灵，我们坐以待毙，引擎室
The engines are out. We're sitting ducks here. Engine room.

1038
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,680
跟我来！
Follow me!

1039
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:51,330
倒数四分钟
"T" minus four minutes and counting.

1040
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,760
做的好，最高速度
Well done. Officer Watch, increase max.

1041
01:47:38,531 --> 01:47:39,731
继续开火！
Keep firing!

1042
01:47:41,902 --> 01:47:43,562
每个人，弃船
All hands, abandon ship.

1043
01:47:43,642 --> 01:47:45,302
弃船
Abandon ship.

1044
01:48:09,568 --> 01:48:12,978
史丹博，你要怎么处置那个女的？
Mr. Stamper, what are you doing about the girl?

1045
01:48:13,038 --> 01:48:16,478
或许你该去引擎室看看
Perhaps you'd consider looking in the engine room.

1046
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:23,480
倒数三分钟
"T" minus three minutes and counting.

1047
01:49:16,152 --> 01:49:19,052
你又来迟了一步
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

1048
01:49:19,952 --> 01:49:22,512
这是你的坏习惯
It's a bad habit of yours.

1049
01:49:22,593 --> 01:49:24,463
你无能为力了
There's nothing you can do.

1050
01:49:32,475 --> 01:49:36,375
倒数两分钟
"T" minus two minutes and counting.

1051
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:38,606
导弹已输入程序
The missile's fully programmed.

1052
01:49:38,676 --> 01:49:40,806
不能制止了
It can't be stopped.

1053
01:49:40,887 --> 01:49:43,047
我的计划很快就会成功
In minutes my plan will succeed.

1054
01:49:44,988 --> 01:49:47,048
感谢你的努力
Thanks largely to your efforts...

1055
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:49,518
英国海军会毁掉证据
the British Navy will destroy the evidence...

1056
01:49:49,589 --> 01:49:52,929
我会离开这里，乘着卡佛新闻直升机…
and I'll be out of here in a Carver news helicopter...

1057
01:49:52,999 --> 01:49:54,619
作报导
covering the event.

1058
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,960
将会是很精彩的节目
It's going to be a fantastic show.

1059
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:00,970
我可能有个突发新闻要告诉你
I may have some breaking news for you, Elliot.

1060
01:50:06,712 --> 01:50:10,272
你忘了大众传播的第一守则
You forgot the first rule of mass media, Elliot...

1061
01:50:13,084 --> 01:50:15,024
满足人们的需要
Give the people what they want.

1062
01:50:29,607 --> 01:50:32,547
倒数一分钟
"T" minus one minute and counting.

1063
01:50:46,831 --> 01:50:48,451
扔掉
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

1064
01:50:48,531 --> 01:50:50,161
否则扔了你的朋友
or I drop your friend.

1065
01:50:51,332 --> 01:50:53,562
全都结束了，史丹博
It's over, Stamper.

1066
01:50:53,672 --> 01:50:55,292
放了她
Let her go.

1067
01:50:55,402 --> 01:50:56,932
只是你跟我
Not between you and me.

1068
01:50:58,913 --> 01:51:02,573
试用雷管，导弹会引爆
James, try the detonators. The missile will set them off.

1069
01:51:02,644 --> 01:51:05,814
别跟女性争辩，她们通常都对
Never argue with a woman. They're always right.

1070
01:51:20,568 --> 01:51:23,668
倒数四十秒
"T" minus 40 seconds.

1071
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,670
为卡佛报仇
For Carver!

1072
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:36,451
还有高夫曼
