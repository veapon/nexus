1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000


2
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,947
北川海岸，北韩
PUKCH'ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA

3
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:58,659
喂，这是怎么回事？我应该要--
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to...

4
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:47,639
孟谭尚上校总部
北韩非军事区域
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q.
De-Militarised Zone
North Korea

5
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,051
打开袋子
Open the bag.

6
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,731
看你还敢不敢训我
That will teach you to lecture me.

7
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,641
芝麻开门
Retract the blast doors.

8
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,914
找个新的心理辅导医生
Find me a new anger therapist.

9
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,259
传送中

10
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,610
我是赵
I am Zao.

11
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,279
你迟到了
You are late.

12
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,814
范彼克先生
久违了
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking
forward to this meeting.

13
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,112
幸会
Me too.

14
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,690
孟上校，我非洲的军事伙伴
让我转达他的谢意
My African military friends owe you
many thanks, Colonel Moon.

15
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,623
联合国禁运后
没几个够胆交易叛军钻石
Few men have the guts to trade
conflict diamonds since the U.N. embargo.

16
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,857
联合国的事我还略知一二
我在哈佛和牛津读过
I know all about the U.N.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

17
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,298
主修西方伪善
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

18
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:22,667
从你收藏的车子来看，我可不这么想
From your modest collection of cars,
I wouldn't have guessed.

19
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:26,775
我要看钻石
Show me the diamonds.

20
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,007
我要看武器
Show me the weapons.

21
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,584
开过来
Bring the weapons.

22
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:49,360
在非军事区域藏匿武器
Hiding weapons
in the de-militarised zone.

23
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:54,602
-这儿地雷可不少
-多亏了美国鬼子
- It's a bit of a minefield out there.
- America's cultural contribution.

24
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:59,676
就算再多地雷
我的气垫船都可在上面漂过
One million landmines. And
my hovercrafts float right over them.

25
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:18,219
RPG,火焰喷射器
自动武器…
RPGs, flamethrowers,
automatic weapons...

26
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:21,298
数不尽的弹药
足够发动一场小战争
...and enough ammunition to run
a small war.

27
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,559
我的钻石呢？
My diamonds?

28
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,571
马上检查一遍
Check it over quick.

29
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,074
省着点花
Don't blow it all at once.

30
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,911
这一批货我有特别用途
I have special plans
for this consignment.

31
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,765
他叫詹姆士邦德
英国杀手
His name is James Bond,
a British assassin.

32
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,853
范彼克先生，给你看一样东西
Mr. Van Bierk,
let me show you something.

33
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,819
我们的最新坦克克星
Our new tank buster.

34
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,289
衰变铀炮弹，不二之选
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.

35
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,053
当然了
Naturally.

36
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,735
我看你怎么杀的了我，邦德先生？
And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?

37
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:52,148
可悲啊，你们英国人还以为
可以对别人指手划脚
It's pathetic that you British still beliee
you have the right to police the world.

38
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:56,555
你就快要死了
而北韩就快要统一全韩了
You will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

39
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:59,697
你总算说到点子上去了
Then you and I have something
in common.

40
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:02,356
是谁？
Who is it?

41
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:03,869
我儿子在那里？
Where's my son?

42
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,470
是将军
It's the General.

43
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:09,333
喂，爸爸
Hello... Father.

44
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:10,606
为什么有火光？
Why is there a fire?

45
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,777
我五分钟后就到
I'll be there in five minutes.

46
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:17,041
把武器撤走
Get the weapons out of here.

47
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,045
杀了间谍
...and kill the spy.

48
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,958
阿弥陀佛
Saved by the bell.

49
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,680
想不到是白发人送黑发人
My son is dead.

50
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,936
谁与争锋

51
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:50,321
14个月之后
14 months later

52
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,644
看来你吃了不少苦
I don't condone what they do here.

53
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,608
这事你得问她
Tell it to the concierge.

54
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:30,620
亏你还笑的出
Still you jest.

55
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,354
死到临头还那么狂妄
Defiant to the last.

56
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,558
他们抛弃了你
Your people have abandoned you.

57
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:40,900
当你不存在
Your very existence denied.

58
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,975
你却守口如瓶
Why stay silent?

59
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,814
无所谓了
It doesn't matter anymore.

60
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,506
我已经管不了了
Things are out of my hands.

61
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:36,592
到地头了，邦德先生
We reach the end, Mr. Bond.

62
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,350
你省省吧
Spare me the unpleasantries.

63
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:46,595
超级强权把韩国一分为二
五十年后…
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two...

64
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,236
你出现在北韩
...and then you arrive.

65
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:52,271
以英国间谍，杀手的身份
A British spy, an assassin.

66
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:57,906
落了个话柄给强硬派
And now the hard-liners have
their proof.

67
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:01,140
我们不能相信西方人
We cannot trust the West.

68
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,814
你….
You...

69
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,720
你夺走了我儿子的性命
You took away my son.

70
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,656
他早就该打靶了，我代劳而已
Your firing squad should have done
the job for me.

71
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,803
我本希望西方教育
能让他成为…
I hoped a Western education
would help him become a bridge...

72
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,199
两个世界的桥梁
...between our worlds.

73
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:28,605
想不到却腐化了他
But all it did was to corrupt him.

74
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:31,507
过去的就让它过去，好不好？
Let's get this over with, shall we?

75
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:35,578
我儿子在西方有同党
My son had an ally in the West.

76
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,284
最后一次问你，是谁？
For the last time, who was it?

77
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,318
是谁让他背叛了国家
和他自己的姓氏？
Who made him betray his country
and name?

78
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,229
他也背叛了我
The same person who betrayed me.

79
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,900
转过去
Turn around.

80
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,740
向前走
Start walking.

81
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,967
请继续走
Keep walking, please.

82
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:29,969
继续走
Keep moving.

83
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:46,846
赵
Zao.

84
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:49,545
我被用来交换的…
I'm being traded...

85
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,555
居然是你
...for you.

86
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,454
继续走，请继续走
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

87
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,393
你总有玩完的时候
Your time will come.

88
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:01,564
咱们走着瞧
Not as soon as yours.

89
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:06,539
请继续走
Keep walking, please.

90
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,486
看他那熊样
Look at him.

91
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:21,745
再次检查
Double check.

92
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,583
你还当他是英雄
You'd think he was some kind
of a hero.

93
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,658
-9号参考资料，帮我查查
-长官
- Reference nine.
- Sir.

94
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,025
第四区
Section four.

95
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,096
好，抓紧他，抓住了
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.

96
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,399
小心他的腿
Watch his legs now.

97
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,240
好，走了
All right, let's go.

98
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:54,647
初步检查没发现生化物质
他很干净
No biological agents in the prelim scan.
He's clean.

99
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,449
脉搏72，血压120/80
Pulse, 7 2. Blood pressure, 1 20/80.

100
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:03,186
有神经毒，组织胺
复合胺，酵素抑制剂
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.

101
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,058
蝎子毒液
Scorpion venom.

102
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,733
但有也抗毒血清的痕迹
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.

103
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,232
他们先让蝎子蛰他
再为他解毒
They'd sting him
then administer the antidote.

104
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:13,406
但他的内脏没有受到影响
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

105
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,735
肝的状况不太好
但的确是他
Liver not too good.
It's definitely him then.

106
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:23,977
早
Morning.

107
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,623
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

108
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,669
你们真客气
Such hospitality.

109
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,512
你好像不是很高兴看到我
You don't seem too pleased to see me.

110
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:06,416
如果照我的方式
你现在还在朝鲜
If I'd had my way, you'd still be
in North Korea.

111
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,556
把你赎回来花了我们不少代价
Your freedom came at too high a price.

112
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,298
赵
Zao.

113
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,731
他差点炸了
中国和南韩的高峰会
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

114
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:21,736
死了三个中国特工才抓到他
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.

115
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,237
现在他自由了
And now he's free.

116
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:28,302
我从没要求赎我出来
I never asked to be traded.

117
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:30,845
我情愿死也不想他被放出来
I'd rather die than let him loose.

118
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,882
-你有那个药的
-老早就丢了，这怎么回事？
- You had cyanide.
- Threw it away years ago. What is this?

119
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:36,811
美国在北韩的高级情报员…
The top American agent...

120
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:40,890
一周前被处决了
...in the North Korean High Command
was executed a week ago.

121
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,720
美国人从你的监狱里
截听到指证他的讯息
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

122
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,023
-他们认为是我？
-就你关在那里
- And they think it's me?
- You were the only inmate.

123
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,331
他们认为你吃不了苦头
已经动摇了
They concluded you cracked
and were hemorrhaging information.

124
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,731
我们必须救你出来
We had to get you out.

125
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,300
那你又是怎么想的？
And what do you think?

126
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,285
从你身上残留的药物分析来看
你根本就不知道说过什么
With the drugs they gave you,
you wouldn't know what you said.

127
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:15,784
我知道规则
I know the rules.

128
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:17,722
第一条就是，无情
And number one is, no deals.

129
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:21,091
被抓了就是被遗弃了
Get caught and you're given up.

130
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,526
那次任务出了问题
The mission was compromised.

131
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:27,329
孟上校接到线报认出了我
Moon got a call exposing me.

132
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,701
连他爸都知道
他在西方有同党
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew.

133
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:35,536
-不管是真是假，都没有关系
-不，有关系
- Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
- No, it isn't.

134
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,911
陷害我的人
再度设计用我来赎出赵
The same person who set me up then
set me up to get Zao out.

135
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,709
我一定要逮到他
So I'm going after him.

136
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,580
你先去福克兰的评估中心
You're going to our evaluation center
in the Falklands.

137
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,416
你的情报员资格已经取消了

00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:35,157
我以为再不会有人抽得雷他多了
I'd come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.

207
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:40,252

220
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,963

One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

You didn't do too badly
out of the revolution.

234
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:11,148
日子总得过下去啊
We all have our ways
of getting by.

235
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:15,620
你不知道有多少政府官员…
You'd be surprised how many
government officials come to me...

236
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:19,522
-为了回味过去糜烂的生活来找我
-是啊….
...for reminders of the decadent times.

00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,727
真可惜其他人都没欣赏到

249
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,133
要喝魔嘻朵吗？

250
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,103
试试看
You should try it.

251

256
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,190
这么说吧
我的感情关系似乎都不持久
Let's just say my relationships
don't seem to last.

257

为什么呢？
And why is that?

260
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,236
因为此时他们的猎物出来喝酒
It's when their prey
comes out to drink.

261
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,880
喝的惯吗？
Too strong for you?

262
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:33,375

真会说话咧
Now there's a mouthful.

今晚要忙着找猫头鹰？
So you're gonna be busy tonight
with the owls then?

Nothing to see till the morning.

271
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:04,943
至少外面没有
Not out there anyway.

272
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:11,247
掠食者…
So, what do predators do...

273
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,017
在太阳下山后做什么呢？
...when the sun goes down?

274
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,754
他们大吃大喝…
They feast...

275
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,189
今朝有酒今朝醉
...like there's no tomorrow.

276
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,683
你一向都是这么好动的吗？
Are you always this frisky?

277
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,685
那种要死要活的感觉
让人回味无穷
I've been missing the touch
of a good woman.

278
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,389
谁要死要活来着？
Who says I'm good?

279
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,527
你要干什么？
What do you want?

280
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,204
-我不需要轮椅
-是吗？
- I don't need a wheelchair.
- No?

281
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,497
现在需要了
You do now.

282
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:56,956
先生
Se? Or.

283
00:40:58,093 --> 00:41:00,391
-好了
-谢谢
- Okay.
- Gracias.

284
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:06,156
洛斯欧甘诺斯岛
Isla Los Organos

285
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:47,065
你要做染色体重置治疗
So you are to have
DNA-replacement therapy.

286
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,498
让我来解释这两个阶段
Let me explain the two phases.

287
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:54,141
首先，我们要杀死你的骨髓
清除染色体板块
First, we kill off your bone marrow.
Wipe the DNA slate clean.

288
00:42:54,442 --> 00:42:55,773
第二阶段：
Phase two:

289
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:58,912
引入由健康捐赠人身上
得来的新染色体
Introduction of new DNA
harvested from healthy donors.

290
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:00,706
孤儿，逃亡者…
Orphans, runaways...

291
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:03,247
流浪汉
...people that won't be missed.

292
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:07,345
我觉得我是一位艺术家
I like to think of myself
as an artist.

293
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:10,550
这就是我创作的时候
And this is when I create.

294
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:15,053
谢谢
Thank you.

295
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,425
恐怕这是一段痛苦的历程
不过…
It is a painful process,
I'm afraid, but...

296
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:22,200
百炼始得金嘛
...all great art is.

297
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:26,069
我很高兴能为你服务
I'll certainly enjoy working on you.

298
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,842
当然，大部分艺术家…
Of course, most artists
are only truly appreciated...

299
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:34,674
都在他们死后才被尊敬
...after they're dead.

300
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:57,635
我父亲是一位外科医师
我们住在新罕布夏州
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.

301
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,933
我对乡间的生活有美好的回忆
I have fond memories
of the countryside.

302
00:44:29,204 --> 00:44:31,035
第一阶段完成

303
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,297
第二阶段准备

304
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:37,233
11号房

305
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,864
很好
Good.

306
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,799
你总算注意到我了
Got your attention.

307
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,772
赵，你整容谁买的单？
Who's bankrolling
your makeover, Zao?

308
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,505
是不是就那个在
北韩陷害我的那个人？
Same person who set me up
in North Korea?

309
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,233
詹姆士？怎么回事？
James? What's going on?

310
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,506
珍芮，赶快离开这里！
快走！快！
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

311
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,300
快走！
Move it!

312
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,468
我们走！
Let's go!

313
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:44,916
你看，这化学成份显示…
You see, my friend,
the chemical composition shows...

314
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,387
这是狮子山来的叛军钻石
...this is from Sierra Leone.
Conflict diamonds.

315
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,855
这儿有个标记
There's some kind
of marking here.

316
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,625
-“葛”
-我看看
- "GG."
- Let me see.

317
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:02,538
对
Yes.

318
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,007
是冰岛的葛拉夫企业
From the Graves Corporation
in Iceland.

319
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,774
是他的雷射签名
That's his laser signature.

320
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,845
一位名叫古斯塔夫葛拉夫的人…
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there...

321
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,182
一年前在那儿发现了钻石
...a year or so ago.

322
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:18,947
但它们和叛军钻石完全一样
Yet they're identical
to conflict diamonds.

323
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,358
真是巧合啊
What an amazing coincidence.

324
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:27,857
你怎么能眼睁睁地看着他…
How can he escape
from a British warship...

325
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,057
从香港港口中央的
英国战舰上逃出来？
...in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?

326
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,260
-有趣的电台，蒙尼潘妮？
-我听到有暴风雨要来了
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- I got a storm warning.

327
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,601
你该把他牢牢看住的…
You were supposed
to throw away the key...

328
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,798
而不是把大门打开
...not leave the door wide open.

329
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,603
你在暗示我和他的脱逃有关？
Are you implying I had a hand
in his escape?

330
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,747
邦德腿跑的可真快，不是吗？
Well, Bond got away real fast,
didn't he?

331
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,814
他要遛的慢了就毕不了业
It is what he's trained to do.

332
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,609
可他手底下可没闲着
Your boy's been very busy.

333
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,878
在古巴烧了一家诊所
He torches a clinic in Cuba.

334
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,222
听着，他要是没有什么好家教…
Listen, you put your house in order...

335
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,087
那我不介意给他上堂课
...or we're gonna do it for you.

336
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,073
先生，您的饮料
Your drink, sir.

337
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,907
幸好我是点的是摇匀的
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

338
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,920
古斯塔夫葛拉夫
钻石之王

339
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:44,300
-他啥时候来？
-我不知道
- When's he coming?
- I don't know.

340
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,945
-看来他赶不上了
-他正好赶上
- Looks like your man won't make it.
- He's right on time.

341
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,277
今天可是你册封为爵士的大喜日子
Wonderful day to become a knight.

342
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,651
你承认这份荣誉吗？
葛拉夫先生
Will you be using your title,
Mr. Graves?

343
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,051
老实不客气的讲：
我为我现在的身份骄傲
I'm proud of my adopted nation,
but I'd never stand on ceremony.

344
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,419
别出心裁的进场仪式
你该不会奇怪…
After that entrance,
you can't be surprised...

345
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,755
人家说你是爱出风头的“做秀客”吧？
...you're called a self-publicizing
adrenaline junkie, can you?

346
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,590
我更希望我是个“冒险家”
I prefer "adventurer."

347
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,165
我们听说了伊卡鲁斯太空计划
到底是什么呢？
We've heard about the Icarus
space program. What's the secret?

348
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:48,827
是个惊喜
你们很快就会知道
It's a surprise.
You'll soon be enlightened.

349
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,372
你每天工作24小时
你不需要睡眠的说法是真的吗？
You work 24l7. Is it true
that you don't need sleep?

350
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,443
人生苦短
干嘛浪费时间睡觉？
You get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?

351
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,342
您参加了奥林匹克剑术选拔？
Aren't you trying out for
the Olympic fencing team?

352
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,712
-听说您发狂般地练习
-我一点都不粗鲁
- We hear you're training furiously.
- I never get furious.

353
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,319
就像在击剑中所说的
“分数是什么（有什么用）？”
As they say in fencing,
"What's the point?"

354
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,613
谢谢您
Thank you.

355
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:09,121
不要让女皇等太久
We don't want to keep Her Majesty
waiting any longer.

356
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,385
-葛拉夫先生
-葛拉夫先生
- Mr. Graves.
- Mr. Graves.

357
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,100
命中
Hit.

358
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,572
命中
That's a hit.

359
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,246
命中
Hit.

360
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,990
维绿蒂？
Verity?

361
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,460
詹姆士邦德
James Bond.

362
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,427
向您讨教
Your lesson.

363
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,461
花架子倒不错
I see you handle your weapon well.

364
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,828
台上三分钟，台下三年功啊
I have been known
to keep my tip up.

365
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,844
帮个忙好吗？
来时没穿好
Do you mind?
I think I've come undone.

366
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,380
乐意之至
Why not?

367
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,413
命中，就位，开始
Hit. Positions. Play.

368
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,380
好好瞧瞧我们这最棒的
Feast your eyes
on the finest blade in the club.

369
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,820
古斯塔夫葛拉夫？
Gustav Graves?

370
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,196
他的公关，米兰达佛洛斯特
His publicist, Miranda Frost.

371
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,026
我的得意门生
她很棒，对不？
My protégé.
Gorgeous, isn't she?

372
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,534
她在悉尼拿过金牌
She took the gold at Sydney.

373
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,671
-是晋位的，如果没记错的话
-晋位？
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?

374
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,971
打败她的那个家伙
类固醇用药过量
The one who beat her
OD'd on steroids.

375
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,943
米兰达的金牌当之无愧
Miranda deserved that gold.

376
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,613
于是她现在教葛拉夫如何赢得金牌
Now she's teaching Graves
how to win one.

377
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,116
他只为利而战
He only plays for cash.

378
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,986
他在这通杀四方，独孤求败
He's won so much,
nobody else wants to fight him.

379
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,528
要不要见个面？
You wanna meet him?

380
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,629
那是
Absolutely.

381
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,361
劳驾
Lead on.

382
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,468
-葛拉夫？
-维绿蒂
- Gustav?
- Verity.

383
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,878
-您是…？
-邦德
- And Mr...?
- Bond.

384
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:11,804
詹姆士邦德
James Bond.

385
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,716
-我们见过吗？
-如果有我会记得的
- Have we met before?
- I think I'd remember.

386
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,090
当然，是我弄错了
Of course you would. My mistake.

387
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:26,057
-邦德先生，你赌不赌？
-那得看赌什么了
- Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond?
- If the stakes are right.

388
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,694
一分一千元
会不会太多？
A thousand a point
too much for you?

389
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,704
维绿蒂，要下注吗？
Care to place a bet, Verity?

390
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,272
不，谢了
No, thanks.

391
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,476
我不喜欢看斗鸡
I don't like cockfights.

392
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:44,667
开始吧？
Shall we?

393
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,810
失陪了
Excuse me.

394
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:52,147
三战两胜？
Best of three hits?

395
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:55,455
就位
Positions.

396
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:57,419
准备，开始
Ready. Play.

397
00:54:57,725 --> 00:54:58,714
小心了
En garde.

398
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,828
命中
Hit.

399
00:55:10,037 --> 00:55:11,527
就位
Positions.

400
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:13,804
开始
Play.

401
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:21,172
命中
Hit.

402
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:23,180
2比0
Two-nil.

403
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:25,241
还要继续吗？
Do you want to continue?

404
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:29,583
-要不要加注？
-你有几个钱？
- You wanna up the wager?
- How much can you afford?

405
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:33,055
就赌这个
Let's play for this.

406
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:36,623
我在古巴拿到的
I picked it up in Cuba.

407
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:39,760
相信是你的物产
I believe it's one of yours.

408
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:44,835
哼哼，硬通货
My, my. They do get around.

409
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:47,935
钻石人人爱
But then diamonds are for everyone.

410
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:53,841
精品之选，完美无瑕
Brilliant specimen.
Completely flawless.

411
00:55:54,048 --> 00:55:57,779
就象非洲叛军钻石那样
And chemically identical
to African conflict diamonds.

412
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:01,750
你会输的很惨
Then you're about to lose
something very precious.

413
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,683
就位
Positions.

414
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:08,490
准备
Ready.

415
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:10,288
-开始
-小心了
- Play.
- En garde.

416
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:18,372
噢，亲爱的
Oh, dear.

417
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,942
还要来吗？
You want to continue?

418
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:26,011
今天我不见红就不罢休！
Of course I want to bloody continue!

419
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:28,409
既然我们已经加码…
But since we're upping the wager...

420
00:56:28,616 --> 00:56:30,709
干脆就玩大点，你敢吗？
...let's up the weapons,
shall we?

421
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:37,681
老规矩，谁见红谁就输
Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.

422
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:52,884
够了！
That is enough!

423
00:58:57,564 --> 00:58:59,964
米兰达，我们松松筋骨而已
It's just a little sport, Miranda.

424
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,103
看来还是你占了上风，邦德先生
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.

425
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:14,137
我们去楼下办手续吧？
Settle downstairs, shall we?

426
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:31,924
你是个难得的对手，邦德先生
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.

427
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:37,468
这个周末我在冰岛有个科技展
关于“伊卡鲁斯”的
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?

428
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:40,873
想必你有兴趣
米兰达，安排一下
Perhaps you could join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements.

429
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,975
先让我把这烂摊子收拾好再说吧
Once I've smoothed things over
with the club.

430
00:59:44,177 --> 00:59:46,611
真不敢想象没有你我该怎么办？
What would I do without you?

431
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,985
你说我们两个在冰岛会不会重逢呢？
Can I expect the pleasure of you
in Iceland?

432
00:59:53,186 --> 00:59:55,882
你死了这条心吧
I'm afraid you'll never
have that pleasure.

433
00:59:57,757 --> 01:00:00,590
邦德指挥官
有人让我把这个交给您
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.

434
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:05,756
这里是该重新装璜了
Place needed redecorating anyway.

435
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:54,970
我听说过这个地方
I heard of this place.

436
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,813
从没想到有一天我也会在这里
Never thought I'd find myself here.

437
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:03,113
有些事还是不知道的好
Some things are best kept underground.

438
01:01:03,823 --> 01:01:08,487
废弃的车站，废弃的情报员
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.

439
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:13,162
-你的请柬
-你在葛拉夫身上查到什么？
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?

440
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:15,701
你陷我于不义…
You burn me...

441
01:01:17,304 --> 01:01:20,535
-现在却要我帮你？
-你想我道歉？
...and now you want my help?
- Did you expect an apology?

442
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,301
我知道你为求任务完成
会不惜一切
I know you'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.

443
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:27,344
-就像你一样
-不同的是，我不会妥协
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise.

444
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:32,174
你不能要求我每样事情都做到黑白分明
Well, I don't have the luxury of
seeing things as black and white.

445
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:36,344
-你走后，我们都变了
-我没有
- While you were away, the world changed.
- Not for me.

446
01:01:39,592 --> 01:01:43,426
你在怀疑葛拉夫
不然你也不会叫我过来
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn't be here right now.

447
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:48,192
-你查到什么？
-除了本他的自传外一无所知
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

448
01:01:48,568 --> 01:01:50,934
在钻石矿工作的孤儿…
Orphan working in a diamond mine...

449
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:56,871
主修工程，在冰岛找到钻石
把一半捐给慈善团体
...learns engineering, makes a huge find
in Iceland and gives half of it to charity.

450
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,045
一夕之间
从一无所有到拥有一切
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

451
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:06,414
-科技展是在是这个周末吗？
-不过是他又一个炒作噱头
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

452
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:09,349
告诉我古巴诊所的事
Tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

453
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:11,750
基因治疗
Gene therapy.

454
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:15,894
用染色体移植产生新的身份
New identities courtesy
of DNA transplants.

455
01:02:16,096 --> 01:02:21,363
所谓的“美容院”我倒是听说过
想不到是真的
So-called "beauty parlor." We'd heard
rumors. I didn't think it really existed.

456
01:02:22,669 --> 01:02:24,227
都不重要了
It doesn't anymore.

457
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:29,739
赵逃走了
不过他留下这些
Zao got away,
but he left these behind.

458
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:33,872
全是葛拉夫矿里来的
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

459
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:40,314
我认为葛拉夫的矿只是个幌子
卖的全是非洲叛军钻石
I think it's a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

460
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,957
我们查证要很小心
葛拉夫买通了很多官员
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

461
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:48,552
光脚的不怕穿鞋的
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

462
01:02:48,962 --> 01:02:51,260
看来你又咸鱼翻生了
It seems you've become useful again.

463
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:58,467
你是该恢复我的工作了
Then maybe it's time
you let me get on with my job.

464
01:04:18,218 --> 01:04:21,210
请原谅我的坦白：
哪有打工的…
Forgive my mentioning it,
but a perfect marksman...

465
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,788
把枪口对准老板的
...isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

466
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,091
你可以倒回去看
Check the replay.

467
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:33,595
你会发现他死了
而她只是一点皮外伤
You'll find he's dead and
she's only got a flesh wound.

468
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:37,360
你总有借口是不是，零零零？
There's always an excuse,
isn't there, double-O zero?

469
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,537
你要不信我的枪法
我可以去靶场证明给你看
Give me the old firing range any day.

470
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,540
可这不是靶场
你要适应新方法
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.

471
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:48,737
这儿就是你们扔垃圾的地方？
So this is where they keep
the old relics, then, eh?

472
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:53,282
这儿是我们开发尖端科技的地方
This is where our most cutting-edge
technology is developed.

473
01:04:53,486 --> 01:04:56,148
-懂了
-你非得这么好奇吗？
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

474
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:58,449
这个还能用吗？
Does this still work?

475
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:07,933
-听着….
-尖端科技“尖”在哪儿？
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

476
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,101
我正要说到
I'm trying to get to it.

477
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:14,900
把枪给我
Weapon, please.

478
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:25,116
一片安全玻璃
一只普通的戒指
One pane unbreakable glass,
one standard-issue ring finger.

479
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:28,913
转一下…哇啦
Twist so. Voilà.

480
01:05:29,155 --> 01:05:32,682
超高频单音振动器
Ultra-high frequency
single-digit sonic agitator unit.

481
01:05:32,892 --> 01:05:36,157
-你的聪明盖过了你的样貌
-我比你想象中还要聪明…
- You're cleverer than you look.
- Better than looking cleverer...

482
01:05:36,362 --> 01:05:38,057
包括你。跟我来
...than you are. Follow me.

483
01:05:38,264 --> 01:05:41,825
给你的新表
我相信这是第20只了
Now, a new watch.
This will be your 20th, I believe.

484
01:05:42,035 --> 01:05:44,060
-时间过得真快
-是啊，007…
- How time flies.
- Yes, well, 007...

485
01:05:44,304 --> 01:05:48,138
过去的这么多年里
你从没还过我表
...why don't you establish a record
by returning this one.

486
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:51,071
你的新座骑
Your new transportation.

487
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:05,854
-也许你干活太累了
-英国顶尖的工程科技
- Maybe you've been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.

488
01:06:07,427 --> 01:06:10,658
-你是在拿我开涮吧
-我跟我的前任一样…
- You must be joking.
- As I learned from my predecessor...

489
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:13,593
工作十分严谨
...I never joke about my work.

490
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,102
奥斯顿马丁叫它“反窥视”
我们称它做“反凝视”
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish,
we call it the Vanish.

491
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,741
-很好
-自适应伪装
- Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

492
01:06:25,945 --> 01:06:28,846
我们用微型摄像机把周围的环境
Tiny cameras project
the image they see...

493
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:32,745
投影到车身的发光聚合物表皮上
...onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.

494
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:36,888
一般人不仔细看是看不出来的
再加上几个精心设计：
To the casual eye, as good as invisible.
Plus, the usual refinements:

495
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:42,789
弹射椅，鱼雷，自锁定机枪
可用以射击移动的目标
Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking
shotguns to shoot down mobile objects.

496
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:47,797
这是说明书，顶多两个钟头你就能搞掂它
The manual. Should be able to
shoot through that in a couple of hours.

497
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:56,270
Q，只要几秒钟就搞掂了
Just took a few seconds, Q.

498
01:06:57,043 --> 01:06:59,841
我如果能让你也消失就好了
Wish I could make you vanish.

499
01:07:02,882 --> 01:07:04,543
进来
Come in.

500
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:11,787
如果你执意要去冰岛执行任务…
Before you leave on your mission
for Iceland...

501
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:14,960
告诉我你是怎么看詹姆士邦德的
...tell me what you know
of James Bond.

502
01:07:15,261 --> 01:07:18,059
他是零零情报员
我今天才发现他是特狂野的那种
He's a double-O.
A wild one, as I discovered today.

503
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:22,159
他喜欢火上浇油…
He'll light the fuse
on any explosive situation...

504
01:07:22,402 --> 01:07:26,998
累己累人，草菅人命
...and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.

505
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,643
挑衅，好战
一个冷面杀手
His method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get close to.

506
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:35,368
一个花花公子
A womanizer.

507
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,909
你在冰岛跟他碰头的机会很多
You're going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.

508
01:07:39,948 --> 01:07:44,044
我很尊重您的意旨
但他可能会暴露我的身份
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.

509
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:50,151
你自愿做这个案子
但三个月来几乎没什么成果
You volunteered for this, but in three
months, you've found next to nothing.

510
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,350
葛拉夫看来没什么问题
Graves seems to be clean.

511
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:57,512
邦德不这么认为
所以我想让他象你所说的那样：
Bond thinks differently, so I'm going to
let him do what you so ably described:

512
01:07:57,724 --> 01:08:01,251
去葛拉夫先生那里搅局
你在那里…
Mix things up a little with Mr. Graves.
With you there...

513
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:03,861
正好让事情不会失控
...things won't get out of hand.

514
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:09,327
过去三年你做密码研究时
工作和私人生活分开得很清楚
In your three years in Cryptology, you've
kept business and pleasure separate.

515
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:15,873
并没和任何同事发生纠葛
即使有好几次别人追求你
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite several advances.

516
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:20,375
和同一个圈子里的人交往
是非常不智的
It would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

517
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:22,878
尤其是詹姆士邦德
Especially James Bond.

518
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,584
我是奇尔先生（音同杀）
I'm Mr. Kil.

519
01:09:00,787 --> 01:09:03,347
真是个死而无憾的好名字
Well, there's a name to die for.

520
01:09:30,851 --> 01:09:34,844
时速324里，新的个人最好纪录
Three hundred and twenty-four
miles an hour. A new personal best.

521
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,751
第二推进器又坏了
修好它
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed.

522
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:43,585
-很高兴你能来，羡慕我吗？
-我羡慕你可以死的快
- Glad you could make it. Like my run?
- You were on the edge of losing control.

523
01:09:43,797 --> 01:09:48,200
只有在生与死的边缘我们才能
真正认清自己，褪下伪装
It's only by being on the edge that we
know who we really are. Under the skin.

524
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:54,305
拿唐诺坎贝尔1967年的“青鸟”为例
他创下了水上纪录
Take your Donald Campbell.
1967, the Bluebird. Water speed record.

525
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:59,707
-没到第二圈他就挂了
-但他拼了命是在追寻自己的梦想
- Campbell died on his return run.
- But he died chasing a dream.

526
01:09:59,913 --> 01:10:03,280
-人不也该这样的嘛？
-死活我也不去
- Isn't that the way to go?
- I'd rather not go at all.

527
01:10:03,483 --> 01:10:07,817
-追寻梦想不如创造梦想
-不睡觉的好处之一
- You don't chase dreams, you live them.
- A virtue of never sleeping.

528
01:10:08,054 --> 01:10:13,458
就是我必须创造我的梦想
再说，死后你想不睡都难
I have to live my dreams. Besides,
plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.

529
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,486
邦德先生
Mr. Bond.

530
01:10:17,197 --> 01:10:20,166
-佛洛斯特小姐
-我带您去您的房间
- Miss Frost.
- I'll show you your room.

531
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,164
冰的殿堂，你有没有家的感觉？
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.

532
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,998
这是为了今晚的演示而建造的
This was built
for tonight's demonstration.

533
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:29,573
人们既能观赏到火爆的演出
同时也能感受到冰冷的舒适
The human element necessitates
a balance of heat and cold.

534
01:10:29,776 --> 01:10:32,643
那为什么建在湖上？
希望葛拉夫选错址
Built on a lake?
Hope Graves got things right.

535
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:35,906
-隔壁是什么？
-钻石矿
- What's that property next door?
- The diamond mine.

536
01:10:36,116 --> 01:10:38,016
和葛拉夫先生的住处
And Gustav's living quarters.

537
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:50,995
谢谢
Thank you.

538
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:56,526
你的房间
This is you.

539
01:10:57,669 --> 01:11:02,003
太好了
还有什么要交待的吗？
Wonderful.
Would you like to show me more?

540
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:19,891
伏特加马丁尼
加多点冰，如果你不介意的话
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.

541
01:11:24,296 --> 01:11:25,558
魔嘻朵？
Mojito?

542
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,801
詹姆士，来赏企鹅吗？
James. Here for the penguins this time?

543
01:11:32,136 --> 01:11:36,368
-还是又来赏景的？
-我只对濒临绝种的动物有兴趣
- Or for the view again?
- I'm only interested in endangered species.

544
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:38,565
那么，包括我吗？
Well, does that include me?

545
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:42,937
-那得看这次你又想干什么
-上次我在危急关头舍你而去
- Depends on what you're up to this time.
- So I left you in an explosive situation.

546
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:45,809
是因为你这么本事肯定不用我照顾的
Figured you could handle yourself.

547
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:51,884
-难怪你的感情关系都不持久
-我只是不喜欢有人碍手碍脚
- No wonder your relationships don't last.
- I just don't like to get tied down.

548
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,062
你看起来气色真差
You look terrible.

549
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:42,039
你也好不到哪去
You aren't looking too good yourself.

550
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:52,714
-还有副作用吗？
-我老是睡不着
- You're still feeling the side effects?
- The insomnia is permanent for me.

551
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:55,943
这玩意可让我短时间恢复精力
An hour on the Dream Machine
keeps me sane.

552
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:59,549
-怎么会这样？
-邦德
- What happened to you?
- Bond.

553
01:12:59,924 --> 01:13:02,688
他什么都不知道
我和他距离这么近…
He knows nothing.
I've been this close to him...

554
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:05,328
他却不知道我到底是谁
...and he didn't know
who I really was.

555
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:12,262
-在易容之后你见过我父亲？
-是的
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.

556
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:17,339
-孟将军仍在哀悼你的不幸
-我的不幸
- General Moon still mourns your death.
- My death.

557
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,201
邦德先生
Mr. Bond.

558
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:25,873
-你是…？
-史威夫,太空科技杂志社的
- And Miss...?
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.

559
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:30,744
是吗？邦德先生有没有跟你吹
他的“大爆炸”理论？
Really? I take it Mr. Bond's been
explaining his big-bang theory?

560
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:35,423
-啊对，我想我已经被感动了
-看出来了
- Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
- I see.

561
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:41,425
演示会五分钟后就要开始了
走吧
The demonstration's about
to begin in five minutes. Shall we?

562
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:43,689
走吧
Shall we?

563
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:51,664
-怎么不是珍芮（白虎星）？
-我什么时候都是你的白虎星
- Not "Jinx" anymore?
- I'll always be a jinx to you.

564
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:05,184
我一直都在努力
试着回报这片土地…
I'm always trying to give the planet
something in return...

565
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:07,320
生我养我的土地：
...for what it has given me:

566
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:11,252
因为赐给了我宝贵的钻石
Those little shards of heaven
known as diamonds.

567
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:16,192
钻石不仅仅是块值钱的石头
它们是梦想
Diamonds aren't just expensive stones.
They are the stuff of dreams.

568
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,625
有了它就可梦想成真
And the means to make dreams real.

569
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:43,319
想像一下：
这个世界灿烂光明…
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world...

570
01:14:43,524 --> 01:14:47,460
百姓五谷丰登
人民丰衣足食
...being able to grow crops year-round,
bringing an end to hunger.

571
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:50,789
想像一下又一颗太阳…
Imagine a second sun...

572
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:54,490
如钻石一般闪耀在天空
...shining like a diamond in the sky.

573
01:14:56,837 --> 01:14:58,236
光芒四射
Let there be light.

574
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:07,904
向您呈现伊卡鲁斯！
I give you Icarus!

575
01:15:15,556 --> 01:15:20,050
伊卡鲁斯的设计非常独特的，
它的银色外皮能吸收太阳光…
Icarus is unique. Its miraculous
silver skin will inhale the sun's light...

576
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:23,196
再慢慢的散发到地球表面
...and breathe it gently
upon the Earth's surface.

577
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,529
你们想像不到伊卡鲁斯
将会如何改变你的生活
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.

578
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:45,308
让我们用内心的狂热
去闪耀美丽的夜晚
And now let us brighten this night
with our inner radiance.

579
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:09,399
好了，可以收工了
All right, that's a wrap.

580
01:17:20,314 --> 01:17:23,977
-小毛，给我看看你改的怎么样了
-是
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.

581
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:28,217
这是你要我加进去的自卫装置
Here is the self-defense mechanism
you asked me to build in.

582
01:17:28,455 --> 01:17:31,049
-5万伏特？
-十万
- Fifty-thousand volts?
- A hundred.

583
01:17:34,027 --> 01:17:35,927
用起来…
Armed...

584
01:17:36,396 --> 01:17:40,093
-不是很危险？
-非常危险
...and very dangerous.
- Very.

585
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,585
高压回流阀
警告！

586
01:18:02,389 --> 01:18:05,984
进汽阀未关闭前
请勿关闭

587
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,166
入侵警告！

588
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,190
日防夜防，家贼难防
M warned me this would happen.

589
01:18:39,426 --> 01:18:41,986
我就知道是M在背后搞鬼
That's why you tried
not to be interested in me.

590
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:45,323
老天
你比传说中还更衰格
God, you're even worse
than your file says.

591
01:18:47,568 --> 01:18:49,627
做戏就要做全套
They don't look too convinced.

592
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:52,304
加油，更要毫无保留
Come on, put your back into it.

593
01:18:57,744 --> 01:19:03,182
你有什么花花肠子我一清二楚
你一点安全感都没有
I know all about you. Sex for dinner, death
for breakfast. Not gonna work with me.

594
01:19:03,383 --> 01:19:05,044
-没有？
-没有
- No?
- No.

595
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,560
-可是你现在很享受嗳
-住口，你想吃豆腐吃到什么时候？
- You're getting good at this.
- Stop it. Are we still being watched?

596
01:19:17,798 --> 01:19:21,234
-他们老早就走开了
-老天，真受不了你
- They left ages ago.
- God, you're impossible.

597
01:19:21,435 --> 01:19:23,164
我们走
Let's get out of here.

598
01:19:52,032 --> 01:19:55,593
你既然对我这么有兴趣
干脆留下来好了
You'd better stay here.
Keep up the charade of being lovers.

599
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:56,928
行
All right.

600
01:19:57,237 --> 01:20:02,300
你那毛糙的性格有进步嘛，
足足两小时过后你才开始捣乱
I admire your restraint. You were here
a full two hours before anything blew up.

601
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:07,072
你再这样下去我们两个迟早得完蛋
The way you're going,
you'll get us both killed.

602
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:13,747
詹姆士
告诉你在北韩怎么了
James, tell me what really happened
in North Korea.

603
01:20:13,954 --> 01:20:15,888
我被出卖了
I was betrayed.

604
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:17,750
就这样
That was all.

605
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:23,654
这就是江湖
Occupational hazard.

606
01:20:31,071 --> 01:20:33,972
天，枉你还是零零情报员
This is crazy. You're a double-O.

607
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,506
那都素些浮云
It's only a number.

608
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,117
詹姆士…
James...

609
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:19,820
小心点
...be careful.

610
01:21:22,692 --> 01:21:26,355
回到你房间
我会回来找你的
Go back to your room.
I'll come back for you.

611
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:59,824
你为什么要“杀”我？
Why do you want to kill me?

612
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:04,097
准确的说是“人道毁灭”
I thought it was
the humane thing to do.

613
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:10,432
谁派你来的？
Who sent you?

614
01:22:12,842 --> 01:22:13,866
你妈
Your mama.

615
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:16,567
她要我转达她对你是多么的失望
And she's really disappointed in you.

616
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:21,642
我就告诉你吧
I'll let you in on a little secret.

617
01:22:22,218 --> 01:22:26,018
这个矿是蒙人的，但这个镭射刀…
This mine is fake, but the lasers...

618
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:29,146
却是杀人的
...are real.

619
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:52,111
她不肯说
She won't talk.

620
01:22:53,082 --> 01:22:54,879
那她以后也不用说了
Let's make it permanent.

621
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:56,984
我习惯用刀
I'll use the laser.

622
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,279
手脚干净点
Don't leave a mess.

623
01:24:16,632 --> 01:24:18,862
-珍芮？
-詹姆士！快！
- Jinx?
- James! James! No, no!

624
01:24:19,068 --> 01:24:21,536
快关掉它！
Turn it off! Off! Off!

625
01:24:48,364 --> 01:24:50,696
詹姆士，打扰一下
James, I could use a little help here.

626
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,271
快关掉它…
Switch it off...

627
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:02,405
不然我就要被大卸八块了
...or I'll be half the girl
I used to be.

628
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:46,980
记得有人说我碍手碍脚来着？
So, the girl who hates
to be tied down, huh?

629
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:48,918
你要不要放我下来吗？
Are you gonna get me off this?

630
01:25:49,124 --> 01:25:51,592
-你哪格庙的，中情局？
-国家安全局
- What are you, CIA?
- NSA.

631
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:55,730
-我们一条船上的
-却是同船（床）异梦
- We're on the same side.
- Doesn't mean we're after the same thing.

632
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:59,025
错，世界和平，爱满人间…
是我们共同的梦想
Sure it does.
World peace, unconditional love...

633
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:02,169
当然，还有这位
一脸富贵相的小“痘痘”
...and our little friend
with the expensive acne.

634
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:05,137
-赵？
-对，是他
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.

635
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:09,135
他回那边去了
还有那个诡异迷幻面具
He's back there with some weird,
psychedelic light mask.

636
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:12,610
可能是从古巴诊所带回来的
Probably brought it from the clinic
in Cuba.

637
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:14,680
不可能是他带回来的
He couldn't have brought it.

638
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:17,281
那个东西本来就是这里的
It was already here.

639
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:22,888
它属于另一个韩国人
It belongs to another Korean.

640
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:25,389
他的上司
His boss.

641
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:32,830
-我们需要奇尔的指纹来开门
-我有更好的主意
- We need Kil to help us get out of here.
- I got a better idea.

642
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:38,406
使用者代号

643
01:26:38,607 --> 01:26:40,507
身份无误

644
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,738
-我要去寻求支援
-等一下
- I'm going to get backup.
- Wait.

645
01:26:45,948 --> 01:26:48,974
先去找米兰达，她是MI 6号
叫她先离开
Go to Miranda first. She's MI6.
Warn her to get out.

646
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:50,845
那你有什么打算？
And what are you gonna do?

647
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:53,248
我还有事要做
Unfinished business.

648
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:09,002
你苟延残喘就是为了挑个黄道吉日…
So you live to die another day...

649
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:11,463
是吗，上校？
...colonel.

650
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:17,343
很好，我还以为你做梦都想不到呢
At last. I was beginning to think
you'd never guess.

651
01:27:17,546 --> 01:27:19,411
痛不痛？
Was it painful?

652
01:27:20,215 --> 01:27:23,048
-基因治疗？
-你无法想像
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn't possibly imagine.

653
01:27:23,252 --> 01:27:25,914
很好，这下我放心了
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

654
01:27:26,388 --> 01:27:28,913
吃得苦中苦，方为人上人
But there have been compensations.

655
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,025
把你当猴耍玩玩也不错
Like watching you flail around
in your ignorance.

656
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:35,162
老鼠没有被玩够
猫咪是不急于吞下肚的
Granting you life just to see
if you'd get wise.

657
01:27:35,364 --> 01:27:37,389
我玩的挺开心的
It's been fun.

658
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:40,568
不好意思，
快乐的时光总是那么短暂
Well, the fun is about to come
to a dead end.

659
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:44,566
你我打交道的时间不长…
We only met briefly, you and I...

660
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:47,333
却给我留下了难以磨灭的印象
...but you left a lasting impression.

661
01:27:47,543 --> 01:27:51,377
当我重获新生，重新做人的时候…
When you forced me to present
the world with a new face...

662
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:55,744
我就刻意的在模仿你
...I chose to model the disgusting
Gustav Graves on you.

663
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:59,712
详细点来说
Just in the details.

664
01:27:59,922 --> 01:28:03,722
就是话中有话，模棱两可
That unjustifiable swagger.

665
01:28:03,926 --> 01:28:08,863
莫名其妙，胸无点墨
Your crass quips, a defense mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.

666
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:11,624
我喝的墨水全灌这里了
My defense mechanism is right here.

667
01:28:16,105 --> 01:28:19,905
看来，佛洛斯特小姐也不简单啊
So, Miss Frost is not all she seems.

668
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,072
不要以貌取人
Looks can be deceptive.

669
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:26,946
是的
Yes.

670
01:28:27,983 --> 01:28:31,111
知道是谁在北韩出卖你吗？
Did you find out who betrayed you
in North Korea?

671
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:32,718
迟早的事
Only a matter of time.

672
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:37,381
就没想过是内鬼所为？
You never thought of looking
inside your own organization?

673
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:43,724
远在天边，近在眼前
She was right under your nose.

674
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:50,397
睡觉也带着枪是个好习惯
It was so good of you
to bring your gun to bed.

675
01:28:50,873 --> 01:28:53,842
没办法，江湖险恶
Yes. Occupational hazard.

676
01:28:57,312 --> 01:28:59,940
你知道，我有一种天赋
You see, I have a gift.

677
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:02,937
可以察知别人弱点
An instinct for sensing
people's weaknesses.

678
01:29:03,146 --> 01:29:06,980
你的弱点是“女人”，她和我的
弱点是“必胜”
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning, whatever the cost.

679
01:29:07,184 --> 01:29:11,120
在悉尼我使计把她扶上金牌奖座…
When I arranged for the fatal overdose
of the true victor at Sydney...

680
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:14,779
现在她则成了我专用的
MI 6号情报员…
...I won myself
my very own MI6 agent...

681
01:29:15,592 --> 01:29:21,531
想怎么用就怎么用：
她的智慧，她的天才…
...using everything at my disposal:
her brains, her talent...

682
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:23,893
甚至是她的肉体
...even her sex.

683
01:29:24,101 --> 01:29:25,966
女人的致命武器
The coldest weapon of all.

684
01:29:29,206 --> 01:29:30,798
哈
Hello.

685
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:33,466
米兰达？
Miranda?

686
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,341
杀了我一个，还有后来人
There will be others after me.

687
01:29:42,552 --> 01:29:45,043
你是说你的美国朋友，珍芮
You mean your American friend, Jinx.

688
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:50,692
又一个无辜者
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.

689
01:29:50,894 --> 01:29:56,161
-这儿看似宫殿其实却是地狱
-除下你的设备
- An ice palace can be a treacherous place.
- Hand over the toys.

690
01:29:56,366 --> 01:29:58,334
行，没问题
Oh, yeah.

691
01:30:01,972 --> 01:30:05,464
你知道吗，我爱死你的“大麻子”了
You know, I've missed
your sparkling personality.

692
01:30:06,543 --> 01:30:08,238
临死还嘴硬？
How's that for a punch line?

693
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,242
杀了他
Kill him.

694
01:30:11,081 --> 01:30:12,981
邦，昨晚真是棒…
I enjoyed last night, James...

695
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,050
不过你真的没有安全感
...but it really is death for breakfast.

696
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,995
杀了他，不要声张
Kill him, quietly.

697
01:31:07,036 --> 01:31:09,004
快动手！
Kill him. Now!

698
01:31:17,714 --> 01:31:20,683
-他逃掉了
-没有关系
- He got away.
- No matter.

699
01:31:20,884 --> 01:31:23,444
猫嬉老鼠乐趣多多
The pleasure of the kill
is in the chase.

700
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,217
请将军过来
Bring me the generals.

701
01:31:36,966 --> 01:31:38,194
诸位…
Gentlemen...

702
01:31:38,401 --> 01:31:40,562
我答应会演示给你们看的
...I promised you a demonstration.

703
01:31:41,137 --> 01:31:44,072
现在你将要看到
伊卡鲁斯真正的威力
Now you will see the true power
of Icarus.

704
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:55,982
西方间谍逃得了一时
但他躲不过一世
The Western spy runs,
but he cannot hide.

705
01:32:05,495 --> 01:32:11,491
伊卡鲁斯能锁住发热方位
然后聚焦太阳能
Icarus will lock on to the heat signature
and concentrate the sun's power.

706
01:32:29,385 --> 01:32:32,548
老板，他破了你的记录
Hey, boss, he beat your time.

707
01:33:38,254 --> 01:33:39,881
我要切下这一整块
Time to draw the line.

708
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:13,550
全球变暖真的很可怕的
Global warming is a terrible thing.

709
01:35:13,282 --> 01:35:16,376
好身手，和邦德一样
Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond.

710
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:19,879
他昨晚也是一样强劲有力
He was pretty vigorous last night
as well.

711
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:21,556
他上了你？
He did you?

712
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:24,921
-想不到他会饥不择食
-他不会看上你的
- I didn't know he was that desperate.
- He's not coming for you.

713
01:35:25,228 --> 01:35:28,425
他现在跑的比谁都快
He just died running,
trying to save his own skin.

714
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:32,233
好料子
That's pretty good tailoring.

715
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:36,201
希望湿了以后不会缩水
I hope it doesn't shrink
when it gets wet.

716
01:36:06,202 --> 01:36:08,762
我们很快就会成功
Soon, we will be victorious.

717
01:36:18,948 --> 01:36:23,146
一小时后动身，快去做准备
We've got one hour to wrap this up.
Let's move.

718
01:37:22,445 --> 01:37:25,005
珍芮，你在那里？
Come on, Jinx, where are you?

719
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:34,651
所有单位向我报告！
All units report. Now!

720
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:00,176
警告，自适应伪装失败
Warning, adaptive camouflage failure.

721
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:56,856
是时候给美国人洗澡了
Time to give the American her bath.

722
01:42:13,765 --> 01:42:15,995
顺应伪装修复
Adaptive camouflage restored.

723
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:07,881
小毛，什么叫“人体工程学”？
Vlad, does the word "ergonomics"
mean anything to you?

724
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,112
以人为本？还是机器为本？
Man? Machine?

725
01:43:10,323 --> 01:43:13,520
怎么看都象个手提箱
This is still a suitcase.

726
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:16,521
给我造个相衬的外形
Finish it, will you?

727
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,275
快点，这里很暖的
快呀
Come on, it's warm in here.
Come on.

728
01:44:27,953 --> 01:44:32,083
低温可以保持生命，对不对？
快点给我醒过来啊
The cold kept you alive, huh?
It must've kept you alive.

729
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:34,452
快点
Come on.

730
01:44:42,768 --> 01:44:44,963
你怎么这么久才来？
What took you so long?

731
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:46,137
对不起
I'm sorry.

732
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:03,988
美国指挥部
非军事区域，南韩

733
01:45:19,838 --> 01:45:20,998
约翰探员
Agent Johnson.

734
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:24,372
-詹姆士
-查尔斯
- James.
- Charles.

735
01:45:25,244 --> 01:45:27,974
好吧，我们长话短说，直奔主题
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.

736
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:32,947
非军事区域北面有另一个部队集结
已经有8万人并在增加中
Another division mobilized north
of the DMZ. 80,000 troops and counting.

737
01:45:33,151 --> 01:45:37,281
-另有一百万军力储备
-孟的父亲不主张打仗
- And another million in reserve.
- Moon's father won't allow a war.

738
01:45:37,489 --> 01:45:38,822
孟将军被捕了，强硬派是主谋
General Moon's under arrest.
Hard-liners staged a coup.

739
01:45:40,957 --> 01:45:44,688
你故意陷邦德入罪来误导我
You deliberately misled me
by implicating Bond.

740
01:45:44,894 --> 01:45:48,227
-如果你早告诉我你的情报员--
-她早就死了
- If you'd told us about your agent...
- She'd be dead.

741
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:51,559
-你的地下组织已经证实了
-我们哪有什么地下组织…
- Your mole would've made sure.
- We wouldn't have a mole...

742
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:56,728
如果你早告诉我们佛洛斯特
和孟都在哈佛的剑术队
...if you'd told us that Frost and Moon
were on the Harvard fencing team together.

743
01:45:57,073 --> 01:46:00,304
我们这行最重要的是知道要信任谁
Knowing who to trust
is everything in this business.

744
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:02,774
好啊，詹姆士庞德
Well, well, James Bond.

745
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:06,471
-正赶上看烟火表演
-严肃点，谈正事
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let's get down to business.

746
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:08,350
我们在二区
We're at DEFCON 2.

747
01:46:08,551 --> 01:46:12,248
如果北韩南进
他们会大举入侵
And if the North goes south,
they're gonna go south big-time.

748
01:46:12,555 --> 01:46:15,319
但是中间有个雷区
You don't just stroll through
a minefield.

749
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,621
他们会另辟蹊径
You need some kind of an edge.

750
01:46:18,895 --> 01:46:21,056
-伊卡鲁斯
-我们已经注意到了…
- Icarus.
- We're taking care of that...

751
01:46:21,264 --> 01:46:24,062
反卫星武器会在一小时内发射
...with an ASAT launch in one hour.

752
01:46:24,267 --> 01:46:27,600
-葛拉夫在那里？
-在北韩的一个空军基地
- Where's Graves?
- In a North Korean air base.

753
01:46:27,804 --> 01:46:31,001
我们现在对他无可奈何
They're right where we can't touch him.

754
01:46:33,776 --> 01:46:35,243
那是你…
You can't...

755
01:46:36,179 --> 01:46:38,170
-不包括我
-听着…
...but I can.
- Look...

756
01:46:38,381 --> 01:46:42,613
我们在这里预防事情发生
不是来确定事情发生
...we're here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.

757
01:46:42,819 --> 01:46:46,550
不能入侵北韩
总统直接指示我的
No incursions into the North.
President gave me a direct order.

758
01:46:46,923 --> 01:46:49,357
别拿根鸡毛当令箭
And when did that ever stop you?

759
01:46:49,559 --> 01:46:52,392
你爱去不去拉倒
我会派007去
You make your own decision.
I'm sending in 007.

760
01:46:53,396 --> 01:46:57,092
那我这张老脸往哪搁？
You think I'd leave this
in the hands of the British?

761
01:46:58,301 --> 01:47:00,269
你和他一起去
You go with him.

762
01:47:01,537 --> 01:47:02,970
接近降落地带
Approaching drop zone.

763
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:09,703
好，走了！
Okay, let's go!

764
01:47:21,157 --> 01:47:24,593
-他们已经进入北韩空域
-别担心，罗宝逊
- They've entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.

765
01:47:24,794 --> 01:47:30,858
我们的雷达看不到的话
北韩人更看不到的
If our radar can't see those switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can't.

766
01:47:46,282 --> 01:47:50,981
平壤空军基地，北韩

767
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:54,321
老板，他们向伊卡鲁斯射击
Hey, boss, they launched
against Icarus.

768
01:47:55,291 --> 01:47:56,519
开启自动模式
Leave it on automatic.

769
01:48:07,336 --> 01:48:12,171
听说过高射炮打蚊子，
可没见过发射火箭去打镜子
I hope nobody here is superstitious.
That's one big mirror we're about to break.

770
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:22,844
我的天
Oh, my God.

771
01:48:23,052 --> 01:48:27,045
集结南韩部队，替我接总统
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And get me the president, now!

772
01:48:27,256 --> 01:48:29,588
还没有邦德的消息？
Still no news of Bond?

773
01:48:43,205 --> 01:48:44,900
有车过来了
Vehicles.

774
01:48:46,275 --> 01:48:47,503
还有一些大人物
Some big shots.

775
01:48:52,214 --> 01:48:53,545
是他
It's him.

776
01:48:55,918 --> 01:48:59,251
-300米
-偏差，1.5
- Three hundred meters.
- Windage, one and a half.

777
01:49:07,029 --> 01:49:08,621
我们必须登上那台飞机
We gotta get on that plane.

778
01:49:49,438 --> 01:49:53,340
你，请我父亲下来
You, have my father brought down.

779
01:50:42,157 --> 01:50:43,124
爸爸…
Father...

780
01:50:44,493 --> 01:50:47,792
很抱歉我们以这样的方式见面
...I regret our meeting had to be like this.

781
01:50:48,763 --> 01:50:52,756
你认不出是我？
You can't tell it's me?

782
01:50:53,101 --> 01:50:54,898
我不认识你
I don't know you.

783
01:50:56,805 --> 01:51:00,002
你一直很难接受我
You've always found it difficult
to accept me.

784
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:03,666
这样可能让你更容易忘却…
That made my exile easier to bear...

785
01:51:03,879 --> 01:51:06,279
但我从没忘记你教过我的
...but I never forgot
what you taught me.

786
01:51:06,481 --> 01:51:10,884
战争讲究谋略，
In war, the victorious strategist
only seeks battle...

787
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,020
然后才是战备
...after the victory has been won.

788
01:51:15,556 --> 01:51:19,993
你看，爸爸
我的功课没落下…
You see, Father, I remember
my Art of War...

789
01:51:20,194 --> 01:51:23,652
这就是致胜的法宝
...and this is what guarantees
that victory.

790
01:52:06,373 --> 01:52:08,534
儿子啊…
My son...

791
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:13,036
你到底怎么了？
What have you done to yourself?

792
01:52:14,114 --> 01:52:14,637
来，爸爸
Come, Father.

793
01:52:17,017 --> 01:52:20,248
看看你儿子多了不起
Watch the rising of your son.

794
01:52:48,848 --> 01:52:51,078
他要是敢动三八线…
The second that hits
the 38th parallel...

795
01:52:51,284 --> 01:52:53,309
老子就跟他玩命
...hit them with
everything we got.

796
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,954
你玩他不过
That may not be enough.

797
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:13,465
看到了吗，爸爸？
Do you see, Father?

798
01:53:13,539 --> 01:53:15,336
伊卡鲁斯还可以扫雷…
Icarus is clearing the minefield...

799
01:53:15,541 --> 01:53:18,476
从此我们踏上了康庄大道
...creating a highway for our troops.

800
01:53:18,811 --> 01:53:23,180
美国佬再不滚蛋，就等着收尸吧
If the Americans don't run,
Icarus will destroy them.

801
01:53:46,906 --> 01:53:50,706
日本鬼子我把它当球玩…
Japan is a bug waiting
to be squashed...

802
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:53,970
西方世界就等着尿裤子吧
...and the West will shake with fear.

803
01:53:57,917 --> 01:54:00,181
但美国人会发射核弹
But the Americans will
send nuclear warheads.

804
01:54:00,386 --> 01:54:03,446
伊卡鲁斯会给它们迎头痛击
Icarus will swat them from the sky.

805
01:54:47,867 --> 01:54:50,631
你会害死我们
You will destroy us.

806
01:54:56,275 --> 01:54:58,072
你会杀你亲生儿子？
You would kill your own son?

807
01:54:58,277 --> 01:55:01,110
我的乖儿子早就死了
The son I knew died long ago.

808
01:55:19,064 --> 01:55:23,160
爸爸…你让我失望
Father... you disappoint me.

809
01:56:16,155 --> 01:56:18,316
警告，警告
Caution. Caution.

810
01:56:18,524 --> 01:56:19,491
-手动驾驶
-爬高！
- Manual.
- Up!

811
01:56:19,692 --> 01:56:21,717
手动驾驶
Manual.

812
01:56:27,066 --> 01:56:28,328
-给我起来！
-警告
- Up! Up!
- Caution.

813
01:56:28,868 --> 01:56:30,802
-手动驾驶
-求你了！
- Manual.
- Come on!

814
01:56:50,723 --> 01:56:52,623
好了
Okay, guys.

815
01:56:53,025 --> 01:56:55,118
好了
Okay.

816
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:59,720
搞掂
I got it.

817
01:56:59,932 --> 01:57:04,767
啧啧，找你还真不容易
把枪拿出来
My, my. You get around.
Let's see your gun.

818
01:57:05,871 --> 01:57:07,998
用左手
Left hand.

819
01:57:08,974 --> 01:57:10,737
是了
That's it.

820
01:57:11,744 --> 01:57:12,938
是了
That's it.

821
01:57:13,145 --> 01:57:15,511
丢下
Now drop it.

822
01:57:16,415 --> 01:57:20,044
你已经是众叛亲离了
Looks like your friends have bailed.

823
01:57:27,393 --> 01:57:29,759
打开自动驾驶
Push on autopilot.

824
01:57:29,962 --> 01:57:31,520
快啊
Come on.

825
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:34,290
就这样，小朋友乖
That's it. Good girl.

826
01:57:55,254 --> 01:57:57,449
嗯，水性不错嘛
Well, drowning you
didn't seem to work.

827
01:57:57,656 --> 01:57:59,920
看来我得费点功夫
I'll have to try something
more to the point.

828
01:58:03,896 --> 01:58:05,659
还有1000米远，越来越近了
One thousand meters and closing.

829
01:58:53,177 --> 01:58:54,166
战争的艺术

830
02:00:10,087 --> 02:00:12,749
你这是班门弄斧
I can read your every move.

831
02:00:16,727 --> 02:00:18,957
看刀
Read this.

832
02:00:19,296 --> 02:00:21,321
猪头
Bitch.

833
02:00:56,732 --> 02:01:00,964
看，我们的降落伞
Look, parachutes
for the both of us.

834
02:01:03,606 --> 02:01:05,767
我的降落伞
Not anymore.

835
02:01:11,314 --> 02:01:15,512
要知道，邦德先生
你玩不死我
You see, Mr. Bond,
you can't kill my dreams.

836
02:01:17,753 --> 02:01:21,120
我就玩死你
But my dreams can kill you.

837
02:01:21,624 --> 02:01:24,024
面对命运吧
Time to face destiny.

838
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:42,806
面对地心引力吧
Time to face gravity.

839
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:25,583
我想我伤透了她的心
I think I broke her heart.

840
02:02:28,456 --> 02:02:31,220
看来我们要结伴去天堂了
Looks like we're
going down together.

841
02:02:32,393 --> 02:02:33,360
没那么快
Not yet.

842
02:02:37,332 --> 02:02:39,857
-打开后舱门
-好
- Get the back open.
- Okay.

843
02:02:57,318 --> 02:02:58,615
快！
Come on!

844
02:04:08,856 --> 02:04:11,256
-快
-我说了我是w夫的命
- Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.

845
02:04:11,893 --> 02:04:13,656
其实...
I should have warned you...

846
02:04:13,861 --> 02:04:16,489
大家彼此彼此
...my relationships don't last either.

847
02:04:21,636 --> 02:04:24,230
至少我们有个风光大葬
At least we're gonna die rich.

848
02:04:27,909 --> 02:04:31,106
快，快，快
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on.

849
02:04:31,479 --> 02:04:33,037
快
Come on.

850
02:04:52,767 --> 02:04:54,735
现在…
Now...

851
02:04:54,936 --> 02:04:59,373
还想去天堂吗？
...you said something about
going down together?

852
02:05:18,526 --> 02:05:20,585
机密档案
米兰达弗洛斯特

853
02:05:20,795 --> 02:05:23,059
销案

854
02:05:38,179 --> 02:05:40,070
詹姆士
James.

855
02:05:40,278 --> 02:05:42,109
蒙尼潘妮
Moneypenny.

856
02:06:26,524 --> 02:06:28,651
噢，詹姆士
Oh, James.

857
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:41,395
蒙尼潘妮？
Moneypenny?

858
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,106
我在测试
I was just testing it out.

859
02:06:48,379 --> 02:06:50,404
“硬”件还不完善，是不是？
It's rather hard, isn't it?

860
02:06:50,615 --> 02:06:54,381
不，“硬”就一个字！
Yes. Very.

861
02:07:28,653 --> 02:07:31,679
不要，不要拿出来嘛
我还没玩够呢
Wait, don't pull it out.
I'm not finished with it yet.

862
02:07:31,889 --> 02:07:35,848
瞧？大小正好合适
See? It's a perfect fit.

863
02:07:36,928 --> 02:07:40,159
-留在里面
-早晚都要出来的
- Leave it in.
- It's gotta come out sooner or later.

864
02:07:40,364 --> 02:07:45,267
不要，留在里面，求你了
再多几分钟好不好？
No, leave it in, please.
Few more minutes?

865
02:07:47,204 --> 02:07:50,298
国有财产要缴公
We really have to get these back.

866
02:07:50,841 --> 02:07:53,241
学雷锋拾金不昧，啊？
Still the good guys, huh?

867
02:07:57,481 --> 02:08:02,180
那你告诉雷锋叔叔你乖不乖
I'm still not quite sure
how good you are.

868
02:08:04,755 --> 02:08:07,246
我会象兔子一样乖
I am so good.

869
02:08:09,393 --> 02:08:12,590
我看你象只发情的母猫一样骚
Especially when you're bad.

870
02:12:15,906 --> 02:12:20,741
詹姆士邦德重出江湖

871
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:26,448
谁与争锋
