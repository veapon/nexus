瑞士工业银行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

3
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,625
庞德先生 谢谢你百忙之中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.{\r}

4
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,265
还能抽空赶来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Particularly on such short notice.{\r}

5
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,359
如果信不过瑞士银行家 这世界会变成什么样子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}lf you can't trust a Swiss banker, what's the world come to?{\r}

6
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:01,804
既然大家都准备好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now that we're all comfortable...{\r}

7
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,803
请坐好吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...why don't you sit down?{\r}

8
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:06,905
我费了点工夫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was not easy...{\r}

9
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:09,206
终于拿回钱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but I have retrieved the money.{\r}

10
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:13,307
罗伯爵士一定会很高兴的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again.{\r}

11
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,683
以目前的汇率来计算 扣掉手续费
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}At the current rate of exchange, minus the fees and certain...{\r}

12
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,687
和一些额外费用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...unforeseeable expenses.{\r}

13
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,793
这就是收据
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Voila, the receipt.{\r}

14
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,155
你要过目吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you like to check my figures?{\r}

15
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,595
我确定数字是正确的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.{\r}

16
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,758
全都在这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all there.{\r}

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,528
我不是为钱来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't come for the money.{\r}

18
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,834
罗伯爵士买的报告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The report Sir Robert bought was stolen...{\r}

19
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,101
是从一个为它而死的 情报员手中偷来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.{\r}

20
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,147
我要知道凶手是谁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to know who killed him.{\r}

21
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,113
-真惨 -我只要名字
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Terrible tragedy. -I just want a name.{\r}

22
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:49,879
我只是中间人 把钱归还原主
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am merely the middleman. I'm trying to do the honorable thing...{\r}

23
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,556
算是很有良心了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...returning the money to its rightful owner.{\r}

24
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,194
这对瑞士银行家来说 是多不简单的事啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We know how difficult that can be for a Swiss banker.{\r}

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,866
我给你机会把钱带走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am offering you the opportunity to walk out with the money.{\r}

26
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,796
我给你机会把命留下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I'm giving you the opportunity to walk out with your life.{\r}

27
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,566
照目前的情况看来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Looking at our present situation...{\r}

28
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,437
身为一个银行家,我得说你没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as a banker, I'd have to say...{\r}

29
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,205
说这种狠话的本钱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that the numbers are not on your side.{\r}

30
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,580
也许你没有看到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps you failed to take into account...{\r}

31
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:20,752
我潜在的资本
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...my hidden assets.{\r}

32
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,129
现在是我占上风
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've had a small reversal of fortune.{\r}

33
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,160
-把名字说出来 -办不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Give me the name. -I can't tell you.{\r}

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,031
咱们数到三
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's count to three.{\r}

35
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,568
你一定办得到,对吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can do that, can't you?{\r}

36
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:42,830
一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One.{\r}

37
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:45,432
二
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Two.{\r}

38
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:46,936
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,075
不过你得保护我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you'll have to protect me--{\r}

40
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,279
MI6情报总局 伦敦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

42
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,769
你有没有带礼物送我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you brought me a souvenir from your trip?{\r}

43
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,030
巧克力？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Chocolates?{\r}

44
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,832
订婚戒？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}An engagement ring?{\r}

45
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,674
你一定喜欢这玩意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought you'd enjoy one of these.{\r}

46
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,068
真浪漫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How romantic.{\r}

47
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,610
我知道该放哪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know exactly where to put that.{\r}

48
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,647
梦妮
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Moneypenny.{\r}

49
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,916
就像我俩的关系
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The story of our relationship:{\r}

50
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,253
食之无味,弃之可惜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Close, but no cigar.{\r}

51
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:21,023
抱歉打扰了,007 请你进来一下？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hate to tear you away from affairs of state. Would you mind coming in?{\r}

52
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,627
马上来,M夫人

55
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,941
你要小心,M夫人 我可能会把他挖走的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Be careful, M. I might steal him from you.{\r}

56
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,543
建筑不是我的专长
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Construction's not exactly my specialty.{\r}

57
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,514
事实上,他是专门搞破坏的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Quite the opposite, in fact.{\r}

58
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:43,818
帮我问候你家人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Best to the family.{\r}

59
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,195
老朋友吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Old friend?{\r}

60
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,065
我们在牛津一起念法律
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We read law at Oxford together.{\r}

61
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,160
我早就知道他会称霸天下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I always knew he'd conquer the world.{\r}

62
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,193
要喝一杯吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Care for a drink?{\r}

63
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,371
好,谢谢

64
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,831
他的为人很有原则
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a man of great integrity.{\r}

65
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,505
却花三百万英镑 买失窃报告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who buys stolen reports for 3 million pounds.{\r}

66
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,137
谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

67
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,509
有狙击手的线索吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Any leads on the sniper?{\r}

68
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,040
没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not one.{\r}

69
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,510
是职业高手做的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Professional job.{\r}

70
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,977
一定受人指使
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She must be working for someone.{\r}

71
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,616
-这就是失窃报告？ -对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Is this the stolen report? -Yes. Classified.{\r}

72
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,723
从苏俄原子能源部来的 机密文件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.{\r}

73
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,518
金恩要这个干什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What would King want this for?{\r}

74
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,154
他以为这项秘密报告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was led to believe the document was a secret report...{\r}

75
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:30,563
指认了个一直在破坏 他新的输油管的恐怖份子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...identifying the terrorists who'd attacked his new oil pipeline.{\r}

76
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:32,563
有意思
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Interesting.{\r}

77
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,032
但这没解释为什么有人救我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It doesn't explain why someone would want me out of their office alive.{\r}

78
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,783
金恩！那笔钱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}King! The money.{\r}

79
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,411
梦妮,拦住金恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Moneypenny, stop King.{\r}

80
00:06:58,631 --> 00:06:59,757
让开！让开！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move! Move, move!{\r}

81
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,665
快让开！

82
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,135

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move!{\r}

84
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,972
快让开！

85
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,254
住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop, stop!{\r}

86
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:59,321
那还没完成呢！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It isn't finished!{\r}

87
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:06,323
放开！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let go!{\r}

88
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,500
-你在干--？ -放开！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What do you think you're--? -Let go!{\r}

89
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:38,756
听我说！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen to me!{\r}

90
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,524
你逃不了的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't get away.{\r}

91
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,126
跟我合作 说出背后主使
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can make a deal. Tell me who's behind this...{\r}

92
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:44,324
你替谁工作？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who you work for.{\r}

93
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:45,825
住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't do it!{\r}

94
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,403
别把我们炸死！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't blow us up!{\r}

95
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:48,503
我能保护你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can protect you.{\r}

96
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,865
明白吗？ 谁也不能伤害你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you understand? I can protect you.{\r}

97
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,742

00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,031
谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

104
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,503
钞票浸过尿素
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The money was dipped in urea.{\r}

105
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:50,307
-MI6情报局总部苏格兰 -威力强大的肥料炸药
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A highly compacted fertilizer bomb.{\r}

106
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,847
007的手碰过钞票 又摸到冰块
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Having handled the money, the water on 007's hands...{\r}

107
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,747
于是引起化学反应
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...when he touched the ice, started a chemical reaction.{\r}

108
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:00,015
有一张钞票的反伪造金属线 被换成镁制引信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In one note, the anti-counterfeiting strip was replaced with magnesium...{\r}

109
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:03,455
金恩的胸针
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which acted as a detonator. And King's lapel pin...{\r}

110
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,152
也被换成
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...was switched for a copy...{\r}

111
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:09,095
引爆炸药的无线电发送器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which contained a radio transmitter to trigger the blast.{\r}

112
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,498
换句话说 他引爆炸弹炸死自己的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In other words, he set off the bomb that killed him.{\r}

113
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,636
我们知道凶手是金恩的亲信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We know it was someone close to King...{\r}

114
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,004
唯一的线索却 在气球上自杀身亡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and our only lead committed suicide on that balloon.{\r}

115
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,672
金恩企业规模如此庞大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But given the size of King's organization...{\r}

116
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,212
想找出凶手 简直就是海底捞针
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...it could be anyone, anywhere.{\r}

117
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,952
绝不能饶过他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This will not stand.{\r}

118
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:35,222
不能让一个懦夫 利用我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We won't be terrorized by cowards who'd murder an innocent man...{\r}

119
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,860
残杀无辜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and use us as the tool.{\r}

120
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,120
我们一定要找出凶手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll find those who committed this atrocity.{\r}

121
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,892
就算追到天涯海角
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll follow them to the farthest ends of the earth, if needs be.{\r}

122
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,135
也要将他们绳之以法
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And we will bring them to justice.{\r}

123
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:00,315
谭纳！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tanner!{\r}

124
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:04,716
M夫人说你不能参与行动 除非得到医生批准
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}M says you're off the active-duty list until you're cleared by medical.{\r}

125
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,989
锁骨脱臼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dislocated collarbone.{\r}

126
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:16,190
要是扯断韧带 你就得休养好几星期
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid you'll be out of action for weeks.{\r}

127
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,530
茉莉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Molly...{\r}

128
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,500
我需要一张健康证明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I need a clean bill of health.{\r}

129
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,033
你得给我出健康证明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to clear me for duty.{\r}

130
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,078
-那是很不… -道德？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-That wouldn't really be-- -Ethical?{\r}

131
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,343
实际
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Practical.{\r}

132
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:34,844
真聪明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Smart.{\r}

133
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:37,482
咱们不能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, let's just...{\r}

134
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:39,857
拉点裙带关系吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...skirt the issue, shall we?{\r}

135
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,952
这次你一定要打电话给我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'd have to promise to call me...{\r}

136
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,688
一定要
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...this time.{\r}

137
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,256
大夫命令,不敢不从
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whatever the doctor orders.{\r}

138
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,266
只要你有持久的耐力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I suppose if you stayed in constant contact--{\r}

139
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,598
当然有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course.{\r}

140
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:57,807
如果你有足够的体力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you showed sufficient stamina...{\r}

141
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:02,072
-不要做任何… -剧烈运动？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-...cut out all kinds of-- -Strenuous activity?{\r}

142
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:27,234
这种音乐真的很霹雳 对吧,Q先生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I suppose we all have to pay the piper sometime, right, Q?{\r}

143
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,930
007,少罗唆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, pipe down, 007.{\r}

144
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,000
我得罪你了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Was it something I said?{\r}

145
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,610
没有 只是你毁了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. Something you destroyed.{\r}

146
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,570
我的船
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My fishing boat.{\r}

147
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,472
我打算退休以后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For my retirement...{\r}

148
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,275
离你远点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...away from you.{\r}

149
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,386
介绍你个小伙子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I want to introduce you to the young fellow...{\r}

150
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,491
当我的接班人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I'm grooming to follow me.{\r}

151
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:01,299
门打开会比较好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Helps to open the door.{\r}

152
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,136
你是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you might be...?{\r}

153
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,242
他是007
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is 007.{\r}

154
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:09,174
如果你是Q先生 他一定是R先生了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you're Q, does that make him R?{\r}

155
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:13,012
007情报员果然机智过人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, the legendary 007 wit.{\r}

156
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,318
只是英雄无用武之地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or at least half of it.{\r}

157
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,751
我敢保证你一定会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I dare say, 007, that you've met...{\r}

158
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,855
对这辆车很满意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...your match with this machine.{\r}

159
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,727
全新车款？ 更健全的配备？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}New model? Improved specs?{\r}

160
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,524
你不是受伤休养吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought you were on the inactive roster. Some injury?{\r}

161
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,398
等着瞧吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll see about that.{\r}

162
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,831
这辆车有最先进的反制武器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As I was saying, the very latest in interception countermeasures.{\r}

163
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,668
钛合金车体 多功能显示荧幕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Titanium armor, a multitasking heads-up display...{\r}

164
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,902
六个饮料杯座
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and six beverage cup holders.{\r}

165
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,512
可以说是应有尽有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All in all, rather stocked.{\r}

166
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:46,406
应该是“配备齐全”
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}''Fully loaded,'' I think is the term.{\r}

167
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:49,279
-我想… -你在这不能想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I think-- -You're not here to think.{\r}

168
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,318
你在这只能听我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're here to do what I tell you.{\r}

169
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:52,956
去把外套穿上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, go put on the coat...{\r}

170
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,486
为007示范一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and demonstrate it for 007.{\r}

171
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,093
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But of course.{\r}

172
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,287
007,你要仔细看了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now watch closely, please, 007.{\r}

173
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,800
右手伸入右袖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The right arm goes in the right sleeve, thus...{\r}

174
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:07,460
左手伸入左袖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.{\r}

175
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:11,608
仔细看,上面有口袋、拉链
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Note closely, please: pockets, poppers and zipper.{\r}

176
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,040
把拉链的下方
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take the lower part of the zipper...{\r}

177
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:15,645
插入正确的位置…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and insert it into--{\r}

178
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,109
你就扯吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pull the tag.{\r}

179
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:19,914
你不是说…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You said--{\r}

180
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,920
他已经整装待发了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He seems well-suited for the job.{\r}

181
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:32,089
你不会这么早退休
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not retiring anytime soon...{\r}

182
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,657
对不对？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...are you?{\r}

183
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,767
007,仔细听好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, pay attention, 007.{\r}

184
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:40,199
我一直想教你两件事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've always tried to teach you two things:{\r}

185
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:43,568
第一,别向敌人露出弱点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}First, never let them see you bleed.{\r}

186
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,133
第二呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And the second?{\r}

187
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,402
一定要知道如何逃命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Always have an escape plan.{\r}

188
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,787
罗伯金恩爵士接手伊苏密
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

189
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:05,120
晚安,伊莉翠绑案已结束
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good evening. The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.{\r}

190
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:08,097
警方说她射杀两名匪徒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Cyprus authorities say she has escaped...{\r}

191
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,531
成功逃出歹徒手中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...after shooting dead two of her captors and is--{\r}

192
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:16,537
他对我大叫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He shouted.{\r}

193
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,308
一直大吼大叫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shouted all the time.{\r}

194
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,357
五百万美金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

195
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,632
兑换三百万英镑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

196
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:56,676
汇率
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

197
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:04,321
三百万英镑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

198
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,921
兑换五百万美金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

199
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,265
-禁止进入 -需要一级特准
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Level one clearance required.{\r}

200
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,526
需要一级特准
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Level one clearance required.{\r}

201
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,003
有什么事,007？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, 007?{\r}

202
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,044
跟我谈谈伊莉翠的绑案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King.{\r}

203
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:29,645
我不知道你参与此案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I wasn't aware you had an assignment on this case.{\r}

204
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,316
我带回来的那些钱杀了金恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I brought the money in that killed King.{\r}

205
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:35,384
-不要觉得太内疚 -我没有,你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Don't make this personal. -I'm not. Are you?{\r}

206
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,257
只有你能封锁她的档案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're the only one who could seal her file.{\r}

207
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,757
容我们失陪一下可以吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you excuse us?{\r}

208
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,100
我不能容许你抗命行事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.{\r}

209
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:04,406
发生什么事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What happened?{\r}

210
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,383
伊莉翠遭到绑架后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After Elektra King was kidnapped...{\r}

211
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:14,018
他父亲想私下解决
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...her father tried to deal with it on his own...{\r}

212
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,520
但徒劳无功
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...with no success.{\r}

213
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:18,995
于是他来找我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So he came to me.{\r}

214
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,939
你知道我们不向 恐怖份子妥协
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As you are aware, we do not negotiate with terrorists.{\r}

215
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:37,874
于是我不顾我的直觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And against every instinct in my heart...{\r}

216
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,908
还有我的母性
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...every emotion as a mother...{\r}

217
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,547
我叫他不要付赎金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I told him not to pay the ransom.{\r}

218
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,554
我以为时间很充裕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought we had time on our side.{\r}

219
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,424
你把她当诱饵
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You used the girl as bait.{\r}

220
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:59,168
那笔钱的金额
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The money in King's briefcase was the same amount...{\r}

221
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,368
跟莉莉翠的赎金等值
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as the ransom demand for his daughter.{\r}

222
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,036
这是个警告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a message.{\r}

223
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,216
那个恐怖份子又出现了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your terrorist is back.{\r}

224
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,615
维特苏卡斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Victor Zokas.{\r}

225
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,020
别号是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A.k.a....{\r}

226
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,320
雷纳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Renard.{\r}

227
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:25,688
无政府主义份子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The anarchist.{\r}

228
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:29,960
1996年他在莫斯科行动 之前在北韩平壤活动
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was operating in Moscow in 1 996. Pyongyang, North Korea before that.{\r}

229
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:31,533
他也曾出没在…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And he's been spotted...{\r}

230
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:35,729
阿富汗、伊拉克、伊朗 贝鲁特、高棉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut and Cambodia.{\r}

231
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:39,307
全都是浪漫的渡假胜地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All the romantic vacation spots.{\r}

232
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,536
他唯一的目的是天下大乱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His only goal is chaos.{\r}

233
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:45,011
罗伯来找我后 我派009去刺杀雷纳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After Robert came to me, I sent 009 to kill Renard.{\r}

234
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,546
但计划还没完成
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Before he completed the mission...{\r}

235
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,877
伊莉翠先逃出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Elektra escaped.{\r}

236
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:52,182
一星期后 我们的人找到雷纳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A week later, our man caught up with him.{\r}

237
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,319
向他脑袋开一枪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He put a bullet in his head.{\r}

238
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,420
子弹至今还留在里面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That bullet's still there.{\r}

239
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,659
他怎么能活下来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How did he survive?{\r}

240
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,755
救了他的医生无法取出子弹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The doctor who saved Renard couldn't get the bullet out...{\r}

241
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,797
雷纳就杀了他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...so Renard killed him.{\r}

242
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,003
子弹入脑髓 阻断他所有的感觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his senses.{\r}

243
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,640
包括触觉,嗅觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Touch, smell.{\r}

244
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,241
他也感觉不到痛楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He feels no pain.{\r}

245
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:15,844
他的体力和耐力比常人强
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.{\r}

246
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,742
子弹还是会致命的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The bullet will kill him...{\r}

247
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:21,180
但在死前 他会越来越强壮
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but he'll grow stronger every day until the day he dies.{\r}

248
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:26,190
罗伯死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Robert is dead.{\r}

249
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,783
MI6丢了面子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ml6 is humiliated.{\r}

250
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,661
他已经报了大仇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's had his revenge.{\r}

251
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,657
还没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not quite.{\r}

252
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:37,567
雷纳有三个仇人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.{\r}

253
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,533
还剩下一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And there's still one he hasn't touched.{\r}

254
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,003
伊莉翠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Elektra.{\r}

255
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:51,774
医生批准你出任务
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see the good doctor has cleared you.{\r}

256
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,349
说你有过人的体力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Notes you have exceptional stamina.{\r}

257
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,814
她一定是对这一点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure she was touched by his dedication...{\r}

258
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,488
有亲身的体验
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to the job in hand.{\r}

259
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:06,028
我要你去保护伊莉翠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}007, I want you to go to Elektra.{\r}

260
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:10,161
她继承父业 在架设输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's taken over the construction of her father's oil pipeline.{\r}

261
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,469
找出更换胸针的内贼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Find who switched that pin.{\r}

262
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:15,429
如果你的直觉是对的 雷纳会回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If your instincts are right, Renard will be back...{\r}

263
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:18,337
下个目标就是伊莉翠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and Elektra will be the next target.{\r}

264
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,175
她又要当诱饵了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The worm on the hook again.{\r}

265
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,176
她不需要知道 同一个人想杀她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She doesn't need to know the same man may be after her.{\r}

266
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:24,780
别把她吓坏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't frighten her.{\r}

267
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:26,745
这算是卧底行动？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A shadow operation?{\r}

268
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:27,975
记住
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Remember...{\r}

269
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,819
只能卧底查案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...shadows stay in front or behind.{\r}

270
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:32,812
不能卧到她床上去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never on top.{\r}

271
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:37,625
亚塞拜然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

272
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,883
你得回去 这地方被封锁了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.{\r}

273
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:39,987
我来见伊莉翠金恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm here to see Elektra King.{\r}

274
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:42,352
詹姆斯庞德 环球贸易公司
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}James Bond, Universal Exports.{\r}

275
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,926
我是安全主任大卫朵夫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I'm Davidov, chief of security.{\r}

276
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,393
你可以看到村民 正在示威抗议
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're having problems with the villagers.{\r}

277
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,958
我请金小姐留在巴库的公司
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've told Miss King to stay at the office in Baku.{\r}

278
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:54,332
可恶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, hell.{\r}

279
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:17,752
-金小姐,我请你别来的 -我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Miss King, I told you to-- -I know what you told me.{\r}

280
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,069
把油管得绕过这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Send the pipe around.{\r}

281
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,905
这会多花时间和多花几百万元
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's going to take weeks and cost millions.{\r}

282
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:13,049
-令尊同意这条路线 -他错了,去做吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Your father approved this route. -Then my father was wrong. Do it.{\r}

283
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,316
-大卫朵夫 -我去跟她说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Davidov-- -I'll talk to her.{\r}

284
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,719
我在先父的葬礼上见过你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw you at my father's funeral.{\r}

285
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,693
很遗憾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry.{\r}

286
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,198
M夫人说要派人来 你是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}M told me she was sending someone. Mr...?{\r}

287
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,024
庞德
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond.{\r}

288

289
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,000
你认识先父吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you know my father?{\r}

290
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:37,834
只有一面之缘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I met him once, briefly.{\r}

291
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:41,472
你遗传了他的外交手腕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You seem to have inherited his touch for diplomacy.{\r}

292
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,112
你是说保住教堂？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Saving the church?{\r}

293
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:45,305
也避免流血事件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And avoiding the bloodshed.{\r}

294
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,579
一百年前,先母的娘家 发现这儿的石油
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}1 00 years ago, my mother's family discovered the oil here.{\r}

295
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,153
当时苏联刚立国
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When the Soviet Union was formed...{\r}

296
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,584
共产党在接下来的70年内
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the Communists spent the next 70 years...{\r}

297
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,294
在此大肆破坏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...plundering our countryside for it.{\r}

298
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:59,627
我在来的路上看到 他们造成的破坏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw their mess on the drive in.{\r}

299
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:03,227
新的输油管能让我们致富
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The new pipeline will guarantee our future.{\r}

300
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:08,494
但不能毁掉我们宝贵的历史
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But it would be a crime to destroy what little is left of our past.{\r}

301
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:17,571
你不是来此谈石油的 对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you didn't come here to talk about oil, did you?{\r}

302
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,043
告诉我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me...{\r}

303
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,578
你曾失去过亲人吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?{\r}

304
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,594
M夫人让我来因为 你有生命危险
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}M sent me because your life might be in danger.{\r}

305
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:38,060
来,我给你看样东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, I want to show you something.{\r}

306
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:42,531
这条输油管长达八百英哩 经过土耳其
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm trying to build an 800-mile pipeline through Turkey...{\r}

307
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,768
有恐怖份子的伊拉克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...past the terrorists in Iraq...{\r}

308
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,342
伊朗和叙利亚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Iran and Syria.{\r}

309
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,139
上面这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Up here...{\r}

310
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,713
苏俄也有三条输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the Russians have three competing pipelines...{\r}

311
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,248
他们会不择手段阻止我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and they'll do anything to stop me.{\r}

312
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:57,952
先父被杀 村民暴动
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My father was murdered, the villagers are rioting...{\r}

313
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,523
你大老远来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and you have come all this way...{\r}

314
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,193
就告诉我说我可能会有危险
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to tell me that I ''might'' be in danger?{\r}

315
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,594
我们怀疑有内贼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We suspect there is an insider.{\r}

316
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,229
这是先父的胸针
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My father's pin.{\r}

317
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:14,426
不,这是复制品
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, a duplicate.{\r}

318
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:18,164
内藏的发送器 引爆炸药
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With a transmitter inside that set off the bomb.{\r}

319
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:21,777
先父曾向情报局求助两次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My family has relied on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.{\r}

320
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,379
我不会犯同样的错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't make that mistake a third time.{\r}

321
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:30,453
输油管一定会完成
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going to finish building this pipeline...{\r}

322
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,384
我不需要你的帮忙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and I don't need your help.{\r}

323
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:35,792
失陪了 我得去检查测量管线
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you'll excuse me, I have to check the survey lines.{\r}

324
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:38,427
我也很想检查测量管线
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've always wanted to check the survey lines.{\r}

325
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,093
你不肯轻易放弃,不是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't take no for an answer.{\r}

326
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,098
你最好会滑雪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you know how to ski, then.{\r}

327
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,464
我早知道你会冷若冰霜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I came prepared for a cold reception.{\r}

328
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:09,656
风太强
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can't land.{\r}

329
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,157
无法降落
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wind's too strong.{\r}

330
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:13,022
稳住直升机
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold her steady.{\r}

331
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,463
你滑得很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You ski very well, Mr. Bond.{\r}

332
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,794
你好像很爱被人追
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Seems you enjoy being chased.{\r}

333
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:26,595
大概经常发生吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Happens all the time.{\r}

334
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,165
没你想的这么经常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Less often than you might think.{\r}

335
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,870
那两条输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So this is where they meet...{\r}

336
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:33,666
就是在这儿交接的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the two ends of the pipeline.{\r}

337
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:35,542
这是令尊的遗志
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your father's legacy.{\r}

338
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,543
这是我的家族
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My family's legacy...{\r}

339
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,447
对世界的贡献
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to the world.{\r}

340
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,984
-在等人吗？ -没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Expecting visitors? -No.{\r}

341
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,695
这些人来者不善
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This isn't a social call.{\r}

342
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,072
你到谷底 我引他们到树林
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Head for the gully. I'll lead them into the trees.{\r}

343
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:06,174
快去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go, go!{\r}

344
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,264
山脚下见
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See you back at the lodge.{\r}

345
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,374
-没事 -我们被活埋！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-It's all right. -We're buried alive!{\r}

346
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:36,753
我不能留在这！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't stay here!{\r}

347
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,319
你不会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not going to.{\r}

348
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,792
我不能呼吸！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't breathe! I can't breathe!{\r}

349
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:48,055
看着我,伊莉翠,看着我！ 看着我的眼睛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at me. Elektra, look at me! Look at my eyes.{\r}

350
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,596
看着我的眼睛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at my eyes.{\r}

351
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,097
看我的眼睛！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at my eyes!{\r}

352
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,264
你没有事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're all right.{\r}

353
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,063
一切都没事了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything's all right.{\r}

354
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:57,800
相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Trust me.{\r}

355
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:24,033
巴库
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

356
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,235
她很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's fine.{\r}

357
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,669
只有一些瘀青 并无大碍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some bumps and bruises, but otherwise fine.{\r}

358
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:33,365
她想见你 不是你,是他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wants to see you. Not you, Davidov. Him.{\r}

359
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,823
你还好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you all right?{\r}

360
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:51,393
我得问你一件事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need to ask you something.{\r}

361
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,793
我要你说实话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I want you to tell me the truth.{\r}

362
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,091
是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who is it?{\r}

363
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,162
到底是谁想杀我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's trying to kill me?{\r}

364
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,000
我说过,我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I told you, I don't know.{\r}

365
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:03,237
不过我会找到他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I'm gonna find him.{\r}

366
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,402
这不够好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not good enough.{\r}

367
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,903
绑案后我很害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After the kidnapping, I was afraid.{\r}

368
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:13,382
我不敢出门 不敢独处
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid to go outside. I was afraid to be alone.{\r}

369
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,415
不敢靠近人群
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid to be in a crowd.{\r}

370
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,011
我什么都不敢做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid to do anything at all.{\r}

371
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,052
直到我惊觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Until I realized...{\r}

372
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:22,582
我不能躲在阴影下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I can't hide in the shadows.{\r}

373
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,851
我不能一辈子都害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't let fear run my life.{\r}

374
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:26,954
绝对不能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't.{\r}

375
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,863
我找到他以后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After I find him...{\r}

376
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:32,534
你就不需要再害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you won't have to.{\r}

377
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,665
别走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't go.{\r}

378
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:38,306
留下来陪我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay with me.{\r}

379
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:41,670
求求你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please?{\r}

380
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,782
不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't do that.{\r}

381
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:51,377
我以为你的职责是要 保护我的安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought it was your job to protect me.{\r}

382
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,782
你在这儿很安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll be safe here.{\r}

383
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,188
我不想要安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't want to be safe.{\r}

384
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:05,992
我很快就会回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll be back soon.{\r}

385
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:10,663
现在到底谁在害怕 庞德先生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?{\r}

386
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,945
我要见魏伦汀苏考斯基
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.{\r}

387
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,580
不可能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Impossible.{\r}

388
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,250
伏特加马丁尼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Vodka martini.{\r}

389
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,344
用摇的,别用搅的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shaken, not stirred.{\r}

390
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:35,448
就说詹姆斯庞德找他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell him James Bond is here.{\r}

391
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,020
快去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now.{\r}

392
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,860
我看你是没听清楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't think you heard me.{\r}

393
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:58,108
苏先生很乐意见你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted to see you.{\r}

394
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:03,917
你先请
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After you.{\r}

395
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:07,115
不,你先请
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After you.{\r}

396
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:09,090
我坚持
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I insist.{\r}

397
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:13,954
你也来一点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And a little for you.{\r}

398
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,031
庞德！詹姆斯庞德！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond! James Bond!{\r}

399
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,033
这是妮娜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Meet Nina.{\r}

400
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:22,971
和薇洛丝卡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And Verushka.{\r}

401
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:26,172
叫她们走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lose the girls, Valentin.{\r}

402
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,570
我们得谈谈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We need to talk.{\r}

403
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:32,447
我为什么突然觉得 我买的保险还不够？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why am I suddenly worried that I'm not carrying enough insurance?{\r}

404
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:34,048
别紧张,老詹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Chill out, James.{\r}

405
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:39,454
好吧,各位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine, ladies.{\r}

406
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:40,953
快滚！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on. Beat it. Scram.{\r}

407
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:43,092
蛮牛,把钱给她们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bull, give them an inch.{\r}

408
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:53,135
要确定她们在我赌场都输光
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And make sure they lose it in this casino.{\r}

409
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,205
后会有期,庞德先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.{\r}

410
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:59,671
你的钱都存在你的嘴巴里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see you put your money where your mouth is.{\r}

411
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:02,741
蛮牛信不过银行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.{\r}

412
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:05,107
你想聊什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what would you like to talk about?{\r}

413
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:07,340
我恐怕帮不上忙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not sure I can really help you.{\r}

414
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,576
我现在都做合法生意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm a legitimate businessman now.{\r}

415
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:15,087
来点我的苏氏极品鱼子酱？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you care for some caviar? My own brand: Zukovsky's Finest.{\r}

416
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:17,360
你看看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at this.{\r}

417
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,555
苏俄特种部队
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Russian Special Services.{\r}

00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:26,268
原子能源部的反恐怖份子单位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.{\r}

419
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,960
哪儿找到的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where did you find this?{\r}

420
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,937
我从一个今早想刺杀 伊莉翠金恩的人的身上拿到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I took it off a Parahawk which tried to kill Elektra King this morning.{\r}

421
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,604
幕后主使是雷纳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Renard is behind this.{\r}

422
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,477
咱们最好先喝一杯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think you and I had better have a drink.{\r}

423
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:51,085
阿富汗事件后 KGB认为
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And then after Afghanistan, the KGB decided...{\r}

424
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:54,458
雷纳太危险 于是把他开除
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Renard was a liability and just cut him loose.{\r}

425
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:56,428
他现在独立作业
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now he works freelance.{\r}

426
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,191
他替谁工作？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But for whom?{\r}

427
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:01,203
四条输油管互相竞争
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There are four competing pipelines.{\r}

428
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:04,670
我打赌这里有一半的赌客
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm willing to bet half the customers in this casino would be...{\r}

429
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,639
都想金恩输油管消失
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...very happy to see the King pipeline disappear.{\r}

430
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,607
-有什么好笑？ -没什么,只是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What's funny? -Nothing. It appears...{\r}

431
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:14,613
金小姐很大胆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Miss King does not share your concern.{\r}

432
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:23,919
你来这儿干嘛？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing here?{\r}

433
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:25,990
跟你一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The same thing you are.{\r}

434
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:28,596
找出想杀我的歹徒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Looking for the people who tried to kill me.{\r}

435
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:30,926
让我现在就带你回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me take you home. Now.{\r}

436
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:34,069
不,我要证明我不怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.{\r}

437
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:37,035
金小姐,很高兴见到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Miss King, how very nice to see you.{\r}

438
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,374
我免费为你保留了令尊的位子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've kept your father's chair free.{\r}

439
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:42,067
免费？ 拜托,这里什么都要钱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Free? Nothing comes free from you.{\r}

440
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:47,039
令尊有一百万美元的信用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your father had a credit line with us. One million U.S.{\r}

441
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,909
你也一样有这个特权
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.{\r}

442
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:55,319
你想玩点什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what's it to be?{\r}

443
00:46:57,494 --> 00:46:59,553
21点,令尊的最爱？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Blackjack, your father's favorite?{\r}

444
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:01,989
咱们干脆一点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's keep it simple.{\r}

445
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,330
一翻两瞪眼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One card.{\r}

446
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:05,728
赌大一点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}High draw.{\r}

447
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:10,237
一百万元
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A million dollars.{\r}

448
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:15,543
等等
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait.{\r}

449
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:18,505
前三张抽掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bury the top three cards.{\r}

450
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:22,810
你下定决心想保护我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're determined to protect me.{\r}

451
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,021
你太任性了 别这么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From yourself. You don't have to do this.{\r}

452
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:31,452
如果不能随心所欲 活着也没有意义
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.{\r}

453
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:44,605
红心皇后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Queen of hearts.{\r}

454
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:59,446
你碰上了克星
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It appears you've been beaten...{\r}

455
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,887
黑桃A
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...by the ace of clubs.{\r}

456
00:48:07,063 --> 00:48:08,553
别难过,亲爱的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No hard feelings, my dear.{\r}

457
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:10,289
下次再来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come again soon.{\r}

458
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:17,468
走了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shall we?{\r}

459
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:23,845
我玩不起这种游戏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is a game I can't afford to play.{\r}

460
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,276
我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know.{\r}

461
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,921
-大卫朵夫呢？ -我放他一晚的假
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What happened to Davidov? -I gave him the night off.{\r}

462
00:48:55,979 --> 00:48:57,947
欢迎光临魔鬼窟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Welcome to the Devil's Breath.{\r}

463
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,116
数千年来印度朝圣者 前来此地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims journeyed to this holy place...{\r}

464
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,616
见识永不熄灭的神迹之火
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to witness the wonder of the natural flames that never die...{\r}

465
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:11,918
他们为了证明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and to test their devotion...{\r}

466
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:14,020
对神的信仰
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to God...{\r}

467
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:18,524
一边握住滚烫的石块
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...by holding the scalding rocks in their hands...{\r}

468
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,233
一边向神祷告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as they said their prayers.{\r}

469
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,468
大卫朵夫,告诉我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me, Davidov...{\r}

470
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,106
今天下午出了什么事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...what happened this afternoon?{\r}

471
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:31,143
你保证过给我最顶尖的手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You promised me your best men.{\r}

472
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:33,407
艾考夫提供最新的武器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.{\r}

473
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,107
没错,可是庞德…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, but Bond--{\r}

474
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:36,842
庞德手无寸铁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond was unarmed.{\r}

475
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:42,549
你呢,艾考夫？ 都准备好了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you, Arkov? Is everything ready for tomorrow?{\r}

476
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,352
授权书和通行证在车上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have the authorization and passes in the car.{\r}

477
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:48,087
飞机今晚就到 不过…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have arranged for a plane tonight, but....{\r}

478
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:49,690
不过什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But what?{\r}

479
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,733
我们应该取消其它的任务
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We should scrub the rest of the mission.{\r}

480
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,962
攻击直升机应该回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Parahawks were meant to be returned.{\r}

481
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:58,299
别人会对我起疑心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People will ask questions, even of me.{\r}

482
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,874
都是因为他的无能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All because of his incompetence.{\r}

483
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:01,975
我明白了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see.{\r}

484
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:04,612
你说得对 应该惩罚他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see you're right. He should be punished.{\r}

485
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:07,914
大卫朵夫,拿着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Davidov, hold this for me.{\r}

486
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,752
我太高估你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was wrong of me to expect so much of you.{\r}

487
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,820
杀了他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kill him.{\r}

488
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:22,258
他不够忠心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He failed his test of devotion.{\r}

489
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:27,496
你可以坐他的位子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can take his place.{\r}

490
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:29,327
你可以取代他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take his I.D.{\r}

491
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:32,868
但一定要准时
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And do be on time.{\r}

492
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:54,229
你的肩膀受伤了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Poor shoulder.{\r}

493
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,964
一定很痛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It looks painful.{\r}

494
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:01,861
得多照顾点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It needs constant attention.{\r}

495
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:06,967
我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew....{\r}

496
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:09,669
我第一次见到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew when I first saw you.{\r}

497
00:51:10,747 --> 00:51:12,806
我就知道事情会这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew it would be like this.{\r}

498
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,259
这些冰块够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Enough ice for one day.{\r}

499
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:49,147
你怎么活下来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How did you survive?{\r}

500
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:58,523
我色诱守卫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I seduced the guards.{\r}

501
00:51:58,762 --> 00:51:59,694
用我的身体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Used my body.{\r}

502
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:02,692
把他制伏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It gave me control.{\r}

503
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:07,931
然后拿了枪就扫射
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And the rest, I got a gun and started shooting.{\r}

504
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:12,907
你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what about you?{\r}

505
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,974
你是怎么活下来的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you do to survive?{\r}

506
00:52:19,282 --> 00:52:20,749
我在美女身上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I take pleasure...{\r}

507
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:24,409
寻找乐趣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in great beauty.{\r}

508
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:05,614
走吧,时候不早了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's go. It's getting late.{\r}

509
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:12,848
大卫朵夫呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What happened to Davidov?{\r}

510
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:14,886
他不是要来吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was told to expect him.{\r}

511
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,093
他被埋在工作堆中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was buried with work.{\r}

512
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:21,463
走吧,把你的东西带着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's go. Get your stuff.{\r}

513
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,674
咱们出发吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, come on.{\r}

514
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,436
走吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's get out of here.{\r}

515
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:39,537
你迟到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're late.{\r}

516
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,316
带来了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you bring it?{\r}

517
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:42,785
礼物呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The grease.{\r}

518
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,256
当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course.{\r}

519
00:55:54,964 --> 00:55:55,862
太好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Excellent.{\r}

520
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:15,776
准备好,十分钟后开始
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get ready. We're 1 0 minutes out.{\r}

521
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,254
记得戴上通行证
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But make sure you wear the I.D.{\r}

522
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:38,467
哈萨克 中亚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

523
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,330
我出去透透气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna go get some air.{\r}

524
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:28,023
欢迎,艾考夫博士 我很景仰您的研究
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov. I'm a great admirer of your research.{\r}

525
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:31,393
这儿很少见到您这种大人物
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not often we see someone of your stature here.{\r}

526
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:33,459
这是我的职责
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I go where the work takes me.{\r}

527
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,855
你的运输证明呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By the way, you have the transport documents?{\r}

528
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:48,576
我从核弹里取出钸元素
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I pulled the plutonium out of the one inside.{\r}

529
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:50,746
可以引爆了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can detonate the triggers now.{\r}

530
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:57,219
她是拆除核弹专家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, our IDA physicist.{\r}

531
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,620
省点力气 她对男人没兴趣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't bother. Not interested in men.{\r}

532
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:01,255
相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take my word for it.{\r}

533
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,752
今年出四次任务 她都没闹绯闻
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This year we decommissioned four test sites. Not even a glimmer.{\r}

534
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:12,033
你来这儿有事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you here for a reason?{\r}

535
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:14,635
还是想闹绯闻？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?{\r}

536
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:15,935
你是哪位？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you are...?{\r}

537
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,365
米盖艾考夫 苏俄原子能源部
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mikhail Arkov. Russian Atomic Energy Department.{\r}

538
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:21,074
小姐是…？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Miss...?{\r}

539
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:22,905
琼斯博士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Doctor...{\r}

540
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:24,841
克莉莫丝琼斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Jones. Christmas Jones.{\r}

541
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:27,539
别拿我的名字开玩笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And don't make any jokes. I've heard them all.{\r}

542
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,251
我不知道任何 关于博士的玩笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know any doctor jokes.{\r}

543
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:35,120
没问题 搭电梯下去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is okay. Take the elevator down the hole.{\r}

544
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:37,292
你朋友已经在下面了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your friends are already down there.{\r}

545
00:58:37,827 --> 00:58:39,590
不必穿防护衣吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't I get some protection?{\r}

546
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,957
不必,艾考夫博士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, Dr. Arkov.{\r}

547
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:45,032
下面的钸元素很安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Down there it's weapons-grade plutonium. Reasonably safe.{\r}

548
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:48,198
上面有你们的俄制氢弹 漏出的氢元素
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Up here we have leaking hydrogen bombs that your lab built...{\r}

549
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,066
这半年来我一直都在处理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which I've spent the last six months cleaning up.{\r}

550
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:54,107
你要怕的应该是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So if you need any protection at all, it's from me.{\r}

551
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:58,474
你的同事在等你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your friends are waiting for you.{\r}

552
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:05,317
博士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Doctor.{\r}

553
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:09,582
你忘了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Aren't you forgetting?{\r}

554
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:12,855
离开时请归还辐射标签
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

555
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:14,591
没错,谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course. Thank you.{\r}

556
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:16,524
对了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By the way....{\r}

557
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:20,732
以苏俄人来说 你的英文说得不错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

558
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:24,629
我读过牛津大学
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

559
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,799
你在等大卫朵夫吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Expecting Davidov?{\r}

560
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:40,303
他吃了子弹,来不成
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He caught a bullet instead of the plane.{\r}

561
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:41,336
下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get off.{\r}

562
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,074
给我闭嘴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Keep your mouth shut.{\r}

563
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:46,338
我早就死了 你杀不了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't kill me. I'm already dead.{\r}

564
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:49,544
我看你还没死透
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not dead enough for me.{\r}

565
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:51,675
你应该感谢我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Show a little gratitude.{\r}

566
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:54,350
我在银行家的办公室救了你一命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I did spare your life at the banker's office.{\r}

567
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,348
没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's right.{\r}

568
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:59,414
我不能让你死 你那时候在替我工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I couldn't kill you. You were working for me.{\r}

569
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,717
你把钱带回去 炸死金恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You delivered the money, killed King.{\r}

570
01:01:02,427 --> 01:01:03,917
现在你又把飞机带来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now you brought me the plane.{\r}

571
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,320
你偷走核弹有什么计划？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your plan for the bomb?{\r}

572
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,566
你先说 还是你根本就没计划？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You first. Or could it be you don't have a plan?{\r}

573
01:01:10,903 --> 01:01:13,167
核弹得留下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That bomb will never leave this room.{\r}

574
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:15,163
你也一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Neither will you.{\r}

575
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,648
被一个搞不清楚状况的人威胁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How sad to be threatened by a man...{\r}

576
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,874
真可悲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who can't grasp what he's involved in.{\r}

577
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:29,411
什么都不信的人只会报仇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Revenge is not hard to fathom for a man who believes in nothing.{\r}

578
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,145
你相信什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what do you believe in?{\r}

579
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:32,823
贪婪的资本主义？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Preservation of capital?{\r}

580
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:34,754
尽管开枪吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go ahead, shoot me.{\r}

581
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:36,525
我才不怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I welcome it.{\r}

582
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:39,263
我的手下听见之后会杀了你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My men will hear the shot and kill you.{\r}

583
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:42,558
然后军队会赶来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And the firefight will bring down half the army from above.{\r}

584
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:45,760
我在二十分钟内没打电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But when a certain phone call isn't made in 20 minutes...{\r}

585
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:47,264
伊莉翠就没命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Elektra dies.{\r}

586
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:51,109
你在唬人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're bluffing.{\r}

587
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:54,311
她很美,对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's beautiful, isn't she?{\r}

588
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,580
可惜你不是她的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should have had her before...{\r}

589
01:01:57,149 --> 01:01:58,878
第一个男人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...when she was innocent.{\r}

590
01:01:59,284 --> 01:02:00,216
我替你开了她的苞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How does it feel...{\r}

591
01:02:01,153 --> 01:02:03,212
的感觉怎样？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to know I broke her in for you?{\r}

592
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,781
我通常不杀手无寸铁的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I usually hate killing an unarmed man.{\r}

593
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:09,756
冷血杀手不好当
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.{\r}

594
01:02:09,962 --> 01:02:12,294
我也厌倦了被处决
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A man tires of being executed.{\r}

595
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:15,595
不过我对你没感觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But in your case, I feel nothing...{\r}

596
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:16,992
就跟你一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...just like you.{\r}

597
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:20,933
如果不能随心所欲 活着也没有意义
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But then again, there's no point living if you can't feel alive.{\r}

598
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:28,439
-把枪放下！ -上校,走开！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Drop the gun! -Keep away, colonel.{\r}

599
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,444
他是冒牌货 艾考夫博士已经63岁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's an impostor. Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.{\r}

600
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,083
他和飞机上的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is your impostor.{\r}

601
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:35,616
才是冒牌货
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Along with the men outside on the plane.{\r}

602
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:36,845
他们想要偷走核弹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They'll steal the bomb.{\r}

603
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:40,649
我叫你把枪放下！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I said drop it!{\r}

604
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:52,628
跪下来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On your knees!{\r}

605
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:56,570
干得好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well done.{\r}

606
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:00,611
他一定会杀死我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He would've killed us all.{\r}

607
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:02,640
你跟他讲过话？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you speak to him?{\r}

608
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:05,441
对,他不是核能科学家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.{\r}

609
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:09,444
我想是你允许他下来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I suppose you were the one who allowed him down.{\r}

610
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,888
你逮到我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You had me...{\r}

611
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:23,090
不过我早知道你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but I knew you couldn't...{\r}

612
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:25,429
肩负不了重任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...shoulder the responsibility.{\r}

613
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:34,107
我们继续吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Without any interruptions, let's proceed.{\r}

614
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,774
生面孔太多 包括你的在内
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Too many new faces are here, including yours.{\r}

615
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,849
在我满意之前,核弹就留在这
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The bomb doesn't move until I am satisfied.{\r}

616
01:03:43,522 --> 01:03:45,683
全都给我上去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All of you, to the surface, now.{\r}

617
01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:09,011
快点,快走！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on! Go!{\r}

618
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,017
快走！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move!{\r}

619
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:21,423
我们被封住了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're sealing us in.{\r}

620
01:04:23,962 --> 01:04:25,122
你是什么人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are you?{\r}

621
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,096
我替英国政府工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I work for the British government.{\r}

622
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:33,835
保持冷静
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay calm.{\r}

623
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:40,127
别生气,庞德
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No hard feelings, Mr. Bond...{\r}

624
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:41,663
咱们扯平了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but we're even.{\r}

625
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:43,095
很快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon...{\r}

626
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:45,593
你就会没有感觉的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you'll feel nothing at all.{\r}

627
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:13,794
把门封住！快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Seal the door! Close it!{\r}

628
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:27,545
快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on!{\r}

629
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,860
继续跑,快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Keep going! Move! Hang on!{\r}

630
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:53,762
你这英国的间谍叫什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a British spy. Do you have a name?{\r}

631
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:55,132
庞德
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The name's Bond.{\r}

632
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:01,876
詹姆斯庞德
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}James Bond.{\r}

633
01:08:12,224 --> 01:08:14,351
别停下来！快跳！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!{\r}

634
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:36,937
他们跑不远
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They won't get very far.{\r}

635
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:38,843
核子弹头都有定位晶片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every warhead has a locator card.{\r}

636
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,881
我们可以追踪讯号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can track the signal.{\r}

637
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,981
你是说这个吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You mean one of these?{\r}

638
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,756
雷纳的飞机在哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do we have the range of Renard's plane?{\r}

639
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:56,763
可能在苏俄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Anywhere in this circle: Russia...{\r}

640
01:08:56,968 --> 01:08:59,300
亚美尼亚,伊朗 哈萨克…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan--{\r}

641
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,995
抱歉打搅了 伊莉翠从巴库打来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry to interrupt. Elektra is calling from Baku.{\r}

642
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:03,435
她用影像电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's on the video line.{\r}

643
01:09:03,675 --> 01:09:05,575
放到大荧幕上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put her on the wall screen.{\r}

644
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:13,076
对不起 我不想烦你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry. I would never call you except...{\r}

645
01:09:13,285 --> 01:09:14,582
不过詹姆斯失踪了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...James has disappeared.{\r}

646
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:18,447
他在半夜离开我的别墅
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He left my villa in the middle of the night...{\r}

647
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:23,123
我的安全主任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and my head of security has been found...{\r}

648
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:26,092
在机场附近遇害
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...near a local airstrip, murdered.{\r}

649
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:28,657
我派人过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll send someone out.{\r}

650
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:30,559
M夫人,你能来吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}M, could you come?{\r}

651
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:33,634
我很担心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't help thinking...{\r}

652
01:09:34,372 --> 01:09:35,703
下一个就是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I'm next.{\r}

653
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:41,137
马上送我过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get me out there.{\r}

654
01:09:41,379 --> 01:09:43,677
快送我过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just get me out there.{\r}

655
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,159
贾柏？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gabor?{\r}

656
01:10:14,913 --> 01:10:16,073
你很惊？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Surprised?{\r}

657
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:18,742
怎么了？ 你疯了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?{\r}

658
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:19,974
也许吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe.{\r}

659
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:21,777
也许我该问你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe I should ask you.{\r}

660
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:23,517
毕竟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After all...{\r}

661
01:10:24,322 --> 01:10:26,790
如果不能随心所欲 活着也没有意义
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...''There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.''{\r}

662
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:29,653
这不是你的座右铭吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Isn't that right, Elektra? Isn't that your motto?{\r}

663
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:30,891
你在讲什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you mean?{\r}

664
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,929
还是你老友雷纳教你的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?{\r}

665
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:38,260
我跟他聊了一下 他连我的肩伤在哪都知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He and I had a chat. Knew all about us. Knew about my shoulder.{\r}

666
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,028
知道怎么弄痛我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Knew exactly where to hurt me.{\r}

667
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,502
你是说雷纳想杀我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Renard's the man who's trying to kill me?{\r}

668
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:43,799
少装了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Drop the act.{\r}

669
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:46,432
别再演戏了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's over.{\r}

670
01:10:48,046 --> 01:10:49,240
我不知道你在说什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what you mean.{\r}

671
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:51,014
你清楚得很
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I think you do.{\r}

672
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:55,344
这叫做“斯德哥尔摩症候群”
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's called Stockholm syndrome.{\r}

673
01:10:56,554 --> 01:10:58,419
绑架受害人的通病
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Common in kidnappings.{\r}

674
01:10:58,923 --> 01:11:01,050
受害人通常年轻天真
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Young, impressionable victim.{\r}

675
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:02,888
平日受到百般呵护
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sheltered.{\r}

676
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:06,820
没有性经验
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sexually inexperienced.{\r}

677
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:11,199
手段高明的绑匪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, manipulation.{\r}

678
01:11:12,704 --> 01:11:15,036
受害人突然念头一闪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something snaps in the victim's mind.{\r}

679
01:11:15,673 --> 01:11:17,538
受害人爱上绑匪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The captive falls in love with her captor.{\r}

680
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:18,972
胡说八道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How dare you?{\r}

681
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:21,177
简直胡说八道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How dare you?{\r}

682
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:23,376
那个禽兽都不如的东西？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That animal. That monster?{\r}

683
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:25,746
他令我作呕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He disgusts me.{\r}

684
01:11:26,751 --> 01:11:28,446
你也一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You disgust me.{\r}

685
01:11:29,354 --> 01:11:32,221
他知道你的肩伤,是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?{\r}

686
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:34,890
你在丧礼上带着吊腕带
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You had a sling on your arm at the funeral.{\r}

687
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:38,223
我不需要跟你上床也知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I didn't have to sleep with you to find that out.{\r}

688
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,761
他也这么说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He used your exact words.{\r}

689
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,295
你早就知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you knew.{\r}

690
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,926
你也知道他一直想杀我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You knew all the time he was out there, coming for me...{\r}

691
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:46,103
你却欺骗我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and you lied.{\r}

692
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,605
你利用我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You used me.{\r}

693
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,140
你利用我当诱饵
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You used me as bait.{\r}

694
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:56,375
你还和我做爱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you made love to me.{\r}

695
01:11:58,283 --> 01:11:59,215
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

696
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:03,485
你是在等他下次行动之前 打发时间吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To pass the time as you waited for him to strike?{\r}

697
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:19,268
他在输油管附近杀了十个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's struck again. Ten men are dead at the pipeline.{\r}

698
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:20,335
我跟你去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm coming with you.{\r}

699
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:24,603
随你便 我已打给M夫人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You do what you want to do, but I've called M.{\r}

700
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,901
她会来指挥大局的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's coming to take charge.{\r}

701
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:00,075
目前情况如何？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want an update. Where do we stand?{\r}

702
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:04,106
雷纳的手下 把定位晶片抽掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One of Renard's men took the locator card from the bomb...{\r}

703
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:05,782
无法追踪,可是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...so we can't track it. But....{\r}

704
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,212
可是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But what?{\r}

705
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:09,251
恕我直言
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With all due respect...{\r}

706
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,985
你不应该来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I don't think you should be here.{\r}

707
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:16,457
我能提醒你我是因为你才来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May I remind you that you're the reason I'm here, 007.{\r}

708
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:19,228
你违反命令 把她丢下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You disobeyed an order and left that girl alone.{\r}

709
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,331
也许她没有你想像的那么无辜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent as you think.{\r}

710
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:25,196
-你说什么？ -假如偷换
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What are you saying? -Suppose the inside man...{\r}

711
01:13:25,403 --> 01:13:27,234
金恩胸针的内贼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the one who switched King's lapel pin...{\r}

712
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,036
是个女内贼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...turned out to be an inside woman?{\r}

713
01:13:32,944 --> 01:13:35,879
她杀死父亲,破坏自家的油管？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She kills her father and attacks her own pipeline?{\r}

714
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,480
-为什么？图的是什么？ -我还不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Why? To what end? -I don't know...yet.{\r}

715
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:47,551
你看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at that.{\r}

716
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:48,691
这里不太对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's not right.{\r}

717
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:51,058
那是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What is it?{\r}

718
01:13:51,262 --> 01:13:52,854
侦查车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}An observation rig.{\r}

719
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:55,123
在输油管内寻找裂缝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.{\r}

720
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,664
关掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shut it down.{\r}

721
01:13:59,337 --> 01:14:00,235
没办法
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't understand.{\r}

722
01:14:00,438 --> 01:14:02,030
没有反应
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It won't respond.{\r}

723
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,337
那地方没有炸弹,没有核弹的--
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The place is clean. No sign of--{\r}

724
01:14:04,576 --> 01:14:07,044
-核弹在输油管里 -我的天啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-The bomb is in the pipeline. -Oh, my God!{\r}

725
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:10,076
他们带核弹经过这里 这解释了之前的攻击
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They brought it through here. That'd explain the attack.{\r}

726
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:11,748
炸弹被送往主控室
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Heading for the oil terminal.{\r}

727
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,781
造成最大的破坏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where it would do the most damage.{\r}

728
01:14:13,985 --> 01:14:15,976
叫你的员工立刻疏散
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have your men evacuate that terminal.{\r}

729
01:14:17,889 --> 01:14:19,288
你相信我了吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So now do you believe me?{\r}

730
01:14:22,026 --> 01:14:24,392
这是紧急状况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is an emergency situation. So please...{\r}

731
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,693
请立刻疏散
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...clear the room. Do it.{\r}

732
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,229
他想要破坏输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's going for the oil.{\r}

733
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:33,229
这是西方未来唯一的输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The one pipeline the West is counting on to supply our reserves.{\r}

734
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:35,601
你有办法吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you have an idea?{\r}

735
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:36,865
也许吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe.{\r}

736
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:41,002
炸弹有多远？ 速度有多快？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How far is the rig from the terminal? How fast is it traveling?{\r}

737
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:45,949
它在106哩外 时速70哩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's 1 06 miles from the terminal, going 70 miles an hour.{\r}

738
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:48,185
有78分钟 还有侦查车吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have 78 minutes. Is there another rig?{\r}

739
01:14:48,386 --> 01:14:51,082
在炸弹前面有一辆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's one parked in the passageway ahead of it.{\r}

740
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:54,086
-你能带我去吗？ -当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Charles, can you get me out there? -Of course.{\r}

741
01:14:55,259 --> 01:14:57,955
慢着,你要去做的 是我想你要去做的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait. Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?{\r}

742
01:14:58,162 --> 01:15:01,359
-拆除核弹需要什么？ -我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What do I need to defuse a bomb? -Me.{\r}

743
01:15:14,112 --> 01:15:14,942
在这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There it is.{\r}

744
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,377
闸门在那儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hatch to the passageway.{\r}

745
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:25,016
你来操控 试着让炸弹赶上我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You keep the speed up so the other rig catches up with us.{\r}

746
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:26,850
-我会等你的消息 -好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I'll wait to hear from you. -Gotcha.{\r}

747
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,786
你会开这玩意吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know how to drive this thing?{\r}

748
01:15:29,994 --> 01:15:33,122
开这玩意不需要博士学位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Doesn't exactly take a degree in nuclear physics.{\r}

749
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:42,996
他们进了输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're in the pipeline.{\r}

750
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,131
他们出发了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're on the move.{\r}

751
01:16:01,392 --> 01:16:02,586
快一点！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Faster!{\r}

752
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,926
只要有丝毫的机会 庞德就会成功
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If there's the slightest chance, Bond will succeed.{\r}

753
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:15,296
他是最顶尖的情报员
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's the best we have...{\r}

754
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,467
不过我都没告诉过他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...though I'd never tell him.{\r}

755
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:20,505
希望你说得对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you're right.{\r}

756
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:25,413
它来了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here it comes!{\r}

757
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,681
赶上来了,快一点！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's closing up. Faster!{\r}

758
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:38,818
坐稳了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sit tight.{\r}

759
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:56,236
停不下来！刹车卡住了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No brakes! The controls are jammed!{\r}

760
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,663
这是战略性弹头
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a tactical fission device.{\r}

761
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,889
威力不大,稳住了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Low yield. Hold me steady.{\r}

762
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,634
你拆过几百个,对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've defused hundreds of these, right?{\r}

763
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:20,360
对,但不在这种情况下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, but they're usually standing still.{\r}

764
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:24,040
生命充满了挑战
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Life's full of small challenges.{\r}

765
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:26,210
你看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have a look at this.{\r}

766
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:28,044
螺丝头不见了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Someone stripped the screw heads.{\r}

767
01:17:29,947 --> 01:17:32,108
有人动过这枚核弹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Someone's tampered with the bomb.{\r}

768
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:54,798
一半的钸元素不见了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, half the plutonium's missing.{\r}

769
01:17:55,606 --> 01:17:58,200
你的意思是什么？ 它不能引起核爆吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what are you saying? It couldn't go nuclear?{\r}

770
01:17:58,442 --> 01:18:02,208
如果被引爆还是能炸死我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's still enough explosive to kill us both if the trigger goes off.{\r}

771
01:18:02,647 --> 01:18:04,342
-让它爆炸 -我可以拆除
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Let it blow. -But I can stop it.{\r}

772
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:05,538
让它爆炸！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let it blow!{\r}

773
01:18:11,889 --> 01:18:12,981
相信我,别管它
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Trust me. Leave it.{\r}

774
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:18,891
过去,过去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move down. Move down!{\r}

775
01:18:19,163 --> 01:18:20,323
快跳！跳！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jump! Go on, jump!{\r}

776
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:24,398
快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jump!{\r}

777
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:40,878
罗宾森报告说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Robinson's reporting.{\r}

778
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,353
这不是核弹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The bomb was a dud.{\r}

779
01:18:44,388 --> 01:18:47,789
不过引爆还是能毁坏 一段50英尺长的油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But the triggering charge blew out a 50-yard section of the pipe.{\r}

780
01:18:47,992 --> 01:18:49,084
庞德呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And Bond?{\r}

781
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:51,150
没消息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nothing.{\r}

782
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:54,521
很遗憾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm so sorry.{\r}

783
01:18:57,435 --> 01:18:59,164
不过我有礼物要送你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I have a gift for you.{\r}

784
01:18:59,971 --> 01:19:02,098
先父的遗物
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something that belonged to my father.{\r}

785
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,436
他会希望你收下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He would've wanted you to have it.{\r}

786
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:06,873
现在不是时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps this isn't the time.{\r}

787
01:19:07,879 --> 01:19:09,039
求求你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

788
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:13,511
他经常提到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He often spoke of how compassionately...{\r}

789
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:17,981
我被绑架时 你给他最真诚的建议
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping.{\r}

790
01:19:21,759 --> 01:19:23,420
这是非常宝贵的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's very valuable, you know.{\r}

791
01:19:24,262 --> 01:19:26,822
我不想把胸针也炸掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I couldn't let it explode with the rest of him.{\r}

792
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:35,366
很可惜那笔钱 没把你也给炸死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was very upset when the money didn't kill both of you.{\r}

793
01:19:36,107 --> 01:19:38,439
我以为没有机会了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't think I'd get another chance.{\r}

794
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:42,507
后来你却自己把机会送上门
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then you dropped the answer right in my lap.{\r}

795
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:44,079
庞德
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond.{\r}

796
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:47,482
你也说他是最顶尖的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And as you say, he's the best you have.{\r}

797
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:49,710
那是过去式了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or should I say, ''had''?{\r}

798
01:19:56,093 --> 01:19:57,617
把她带上直升机
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take her to the helicopter.{\r}

799
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:05,833
把手给我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, give me your hand.{\r}

800
01:20:06,037 --> 01:20:07,231
跳,跳！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jump, jump!{\r}

801
01:20:08,706 --> 01:20:10,640
你为什么这么做？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you wanna explain why you did that?{\r}

802
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:13,366
我能拆除的 你差点害死我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I could've stopped it. You almost killed us.{\r}

803
01:20:13,611 --> 01:20:15,010
我们是死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I did kill us.{\r}

804
01:20:15,646 --> 01:20:18,911
她以为我们死了 她的诡计就得逞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She thinks we're dead, and she thinks she got away with it.{\r}

805
01:20:19,116 --> 01:20:22,552
我不是间谍 请你白话一点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you wanna put that in English for those of us who don't speak ''spy''?{\r}

806
01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:23,845
你在说谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's ''she''?{\r}

807
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:25,215
伊莉翠金恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Elektra King.{\r}

808
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:27,550
她干嘛要炸掉自己的输油管？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why would she blow up her own pipeline?{\r}

809
01:20:27,758 --> 01:20:29,248
为了证明她的无辜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It makes her look innocent.{\r}

810
01:20:31,095 --> 01:20:34,087
爆炸掩饰钸元素遭窃的事实
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.{\r}

811
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:37,260
使人误为恐怖份子攻击
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It looks like a terrorist attack.{\r}

812
01:20:37,468 --> 01:20:39,698
但为什么留下这一半钸元素？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But why leave this half?{\r}

813
01:20:40,071 --> 01:20:43,700
留下这些钸元素 才能掩饰他们偷走的另一半
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So there's enough to spread around to cover up what they did take.{\r}

814
01:20:43,908 --> 01:20:45,933
他们拿另一半干嘛？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What will they do with the other half?{\r}

815
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:48,611
这分量做不出核弹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.{\r}

816
01:20:48,813 --> 01:20:51,577
-你是专家,你解释给我听 -我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-You're the scientist, you tell me. -I don't know.{\r}

817
01:20:52,683 --> 01:20:56,016
天下最凶狠的恐怖份子 偷走六公斤的钸元素
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But the world's greatest terrorist running around with 6 kilos...{\r}

818
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,847
不会干好事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...of plutonium can't be good.{\r}

819
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:00,523
我不拿回来 就会被打屁股
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to get it back, or somebody will have my ass.{\r}

820
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:04,693
那个以后再说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}First things first.{\r}

821
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:08,865
呼叫罗宾逊,收到吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?{\r}

822
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:11,899
对了 跟你合作之前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By the way, before we go any further...{\r}

823
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:13,827
我想先知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I just wanna know....{\r}

824
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:17,072
你跟伊莉翠有什么关系？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the story with you and Elektra?{\r}

825
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:19,936
现在只有敌对关系
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're strictly platonic. Now.{\r}

826
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:22,372
罗宾逊,收到吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond to Robinson. Copy?{\r}

827
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,148
你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your story?{\r}

828
01:21:26,717 --> 01:21:28,844
你怎么会跑到哈萨克？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?{\r}

829
01:21:29,053 --> 01:21:32,113
跟你一样 逃避这些问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Avoiding those kind of questions, just like you.{\r}

830
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:35,250
我收到了,紧急状况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I read you, 007. Red alert.{\r}

831
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:37,518
M夫人跟伊莉翠一起失踪了 还有三人挂彩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}M is missing with Elektra. Three men down.{\r}

832
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,628
等待指示
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Await instructions. Out.{\r}

833
01:21:41,298 --> 01:21:42,287
我们该怎么办？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do we do now?{\r}

834
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:49,170
我忘了一件很关键的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I may have overlooked one critical element.{\r}

835
01:21:49,473 --> 01:21:51,407
是什么？更多钸元素吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What? More plutonium?{\r}

836
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:53,367
不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Beluga.{\r}

837
01:21:54,145 --> 01:21:55,510
俄制鱼子酱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Caviar.{\r}

838
01:21:56,814 --> 01:22:00,648
伊斯坦堡,土耳其
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

839
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:26,507
你带什么给我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Brought me something?{\r}

840
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,814
改变世界的力量
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The power to reshape the world.{\r}

841
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:39,278
拿去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on.{\r}

842
01:22:40,024 --> 01:22:41,048
很安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's safe.{\r}

843
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:44,220
感觉一下你的未来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Touch your destiny.{\r}

844
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,400
我也带了礼物给你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have brought something for you as well.{\r}

845
01:23:06,884 --> 01:23:08,579
你的礼物
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your present.{\r}

846
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:11,413
都是死去的庞德的心意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.{\r}

847
01:23:12,156 --> 01:23:13,384
下令处死我的凶手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My executioner.{\r}

848
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,725
可惜没把你杀死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Overpraise, I'm afraid.{\r}

849
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:19,094
-我的手下会解决你的 -你的手下？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-But my people will finish the job. -Your people?{\r}

850
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:22,598
他们会让你在此自生自灭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your people will leave you here to rot...{\r}

851
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:25,426
就像你对我一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...just like you left me.{\r}

852
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:27,300
你还有我父亲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You and my father.{\r}

853
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:29,564
-你父亲… -他什么都不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Your father-- -My father was nothing.{\r}

854
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:32,698
他偷走我母亲的石油王国
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His kingdom he stole from my mother.{\r}

855
01:23:33,811 --> 01:23:36,712
我要夺回我的王国
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The kingdom I will rightly take back.{\r}

856
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:47,957
你把她变成这样很得意吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you're proud of what you did to her.{\r}

857
01:23:49,226 --> 01:23:51,694
这是你的功劳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.{\r}

858
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:54,763
当时的她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I took her...{\r}

859
01:23:55,299 --> 01:23:57,290
真是天真无邪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...she was promise itself.{\r}

860
01:23:57,968 --> 01:24:00,562
你却把她推入我这个火坑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You left her at the mercy of a man like me.{\r}

861
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:03,366
你毁了她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You ruined her.{\r}

862
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:04,904
为了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For what?{\r}

863
01:24:05,409 --> 01:24:06,740
只为了逮到我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To get to me?{\r}

864
01:24:07,344 --> 01:24:08,936
她比我好太多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's worth 50 of me.{\r}

865
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,114
这点我很同意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For once, I agree with you.{\r}

866
01:24:15,019 --> 01:24:17,544
现在我们的命运相同
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now we also share a common fate.{\r}

867
01:24:18,322 --> 01:24:19,152
你会跟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You will die...{\r}

868
01:24:19,857 --> 01:24:21,882
这城市的人一起丧命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...along with everyone in this city...{\r}

869
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,521
西方国家的未来 也会毁于一旦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and the bright, starry, oil-driven future of the West.{\r}

870
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:36,268
自从你派人刺杀我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Since you sent your man to kill me...{\r}

871
01:24:36,574 --> 01:24:39,099
我就一直看着时钟 分分秒秒在走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I've been watching time tick slowly away...{\r}

872
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:42,270
走向我的灭亡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...marching toward my own death.{\r}

873
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,009
现在你也一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now you can have the same pleasure.{\r}

874
01:24:52,156 --> 01:24:53,885
我要你看着时钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Watch these hands, M.{\r}

875
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:56,654
明天正午
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By noon tomorrow...{\r}

876
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:58,623
就是你的死期
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...your time is up.{\r}

877
01:25:00,364 --> 01:25:02,059
我向你保证
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I guarantee you...{\r}

878
01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:04,093
我绝不会错过
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I will not miss.{\r}

879
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:28,281
你好美
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So beautiful.{\r}

880
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:31,292
好光滑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So smooth.{\r}

881
01:25:32,696 --> 01:25:34,129
好温暖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So warm.{\r}

882
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:36,555
你怎么知道？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How would you know?{\r}

883
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:43,338
你为什么要这样？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are you like this?{\r}

884
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,505
因为庞德死了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because Bond is dead?{\r}

885
01:25:47,845 --> 01:25:49,369
你不是要他死吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's what you wanted.{\r}

886
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:52,515
当然了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course it's what I wanted.{\r}

887
01:25:57,655 --> 01:25:58,781
他…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was....{\r}

888
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:03,389
他是好情人吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was a good lover?{\r}

889
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:05,694
你说呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you think?{\r}

890
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:07,887
难道我没感觉吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I wouldn't feel anything?{\r}

891
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:23,980
我一点都没有感觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I feel nothing.{\r}

892
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:41,656
这样呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What about this?{\r}

893
01:26:52,476 --> 01:26:53,943
你一定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But surely...{\r}

894
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:58,106
会感觉到这吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you can feel this?{\r}

895
01:27:04,955 --> 01:27:06,252
记得
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Remember...{\r}

896
01:27:09,126 --> 01:27:10,388
那些欢愉吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...pleasure?{\r}

897
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:31,907
里海
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

898
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,033
在这儿等
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait here.{\r}

899
01:28:00,077 --> 01:28:01,305
真是多事之秋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Always something.{\r}

900
01:28:01,545 --> 01:28:02,705
先是赌场
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}First the casino.{\r}

901
01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:04,743
现在是鱼子酱工厂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now the caviar factory.{\r}

902
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:07,508
我是自由市场经济的奴隶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am a slave to the free-market economy.{\r}

903
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:24,964
庞德还活着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bond is alive.{\r}

904
01:28:30,908 --> 01:28:33,206
这地方真是一团乱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is nothing in this place straight?{\r}

905
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:39,512
你是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are you?{\r}

906
01:28:40,117 --> 01:28:41,482
你是怎么进来的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And how did you get in?{\r}

907
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:43,347
我要通知警卫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll call security...{\r}

908
01:28:44,154 --> 01:28:46,315
好好地谢谢他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and congratulate them.{\r}

909
01:28:46,657 --> 01:28:47,487
来一杯吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Drink?{\r}

910
01:28:50,928 --> 01:28:53,522
你不能像别人一样 打招呼吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can't you say hello like a normal person?{\r}

911
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,530
快走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get lost.{\r}

912
01:28:57,301 --> 01:28:59,895
不是啦,走后门
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no. Down the back.{\r}

913
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,900
你跟伊莉翠有什么来往？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your business with Elektra?{\r}

914
01:29:04,808 --> 01:29:08,300
我以为你跟她才来电
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought you were the one giving her the business.{\r}

915
01:29:08,512 --> 01:29:11,879
她输给你一百万 好像理所当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She drops $1 million in your casino, and you don't even blink.{\r}

916
01:29:12,115 --> 01:29:13,946
她为什么付钱给你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's she paying you off for?{\r}

917
01:29:15,018 --> 01:29:18,476
我劝你 跟这种男人在一起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, if I were you, a relationship with a man like that...{\r}

918
01:29:19,122 --> 01:29:20,384
不会有好下场
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I wouldn't bet on it.{\r}

919
01:29:24,394 --> 01:29:26,885
五千元的鱼子酱泡汤了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}$5000 of beluga. Ruined.{\r}

920
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:30,032
跟核弹比起来 这算不了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's nothing compared to what a nuclear bomb can do.{\r}

921
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:33,129
有一枚核弹遭窃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We had a nuclear bomb stolen this morning.{\r}

922
01:29:33,337 --> 01:29:35,669
雷纳跟伊莉翠是一伙的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Renard and Elektra King are working together.{\r}

923
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:38,137
-我不知道 -你到底知道什么？！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I didn't know. -Well, what do you know?!{\r}

924
01:32:01,752 --> 01:32:03,344
Q先生会被气炸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Q's not gonna like this.{\r}

925
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,340
出去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get out!{\r}

926
01:34:46,483 --> 01:34:47,279
救命啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Help!{\r}

927
01:34:47,517 --> 01:34:48,415
现在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now...{\r}

928
01:34:49,386 --> 01:34:50,318
我们讲到哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...where were we?{\r}

929
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,511
-丢条绳子吧！ -不行,先说实话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-A rope, please! -No. The truth.{\r}

930
01:34:52,756 --> 01:34:53,723
她把M夫人抓走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She has M.{\r}

931
01:34:53,924 --> 01:34:57,087
-我不知情 -她想杀你灭口
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I know nothing. -Those blades were meant for you.{\r}

932
01:34:57,294 --> 01:34:59,660
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What does Elektra King want you dead for?{\r}

933
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,296
是你毁了我的工厂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was you who destroyed my factory.{\r}

934
01:35:02,499 --> 01:35:04,433
是你把我的劳斯莱斯沉入湖底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then you drown my Rolls-Royce...{\r}

935
01:35:04,634 --> 01:35:08,126
你现在还想用鱼子酱把我淹死！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and now you're trying to drown me in my own caviar!{\r}

936
01:35:08,338 --> 01:35:09,737
救我上去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me out!{\r}

937
01:35:10,173 --> 01:35:13,336
可惜这儿没有香槟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Too bad we don't have any champagne.{\r}

938
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:14,805
或是酸奶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or sour cream.{\r}

939
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:19,011
偶尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Occasionally...{\r}

940
01:35:19,683 --> 01:35:22,982
我会替她弄到俄制的器材
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I get equipment for her. Machinery. Russian stuff.{\r}

941
01:35:23,854 --> 01:35:25,583
赌场的一百万呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And the payoff in the casino?{\r}

942
01:35:26,089 --> 01:35:27,317
那是特别差事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was a special job.{\r}

943
01:35:28,124 --> 01:35:30,115
我侄子是海军
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My nephew is in the navy.{\r}

944
01:35:31,194 --> 01:35:34,391
他替她走私一些机器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's smuggling some machinery for her.{\r}

945
01:35:34,598 --> 01:35:36,429
-在哪儿？ -我不能说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Where? -Absolutely not!{\r}

946
01:35:36,633 --> 01:35:37,657
哪儿？！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where?!{\r}

947
01:35:41,037 --> 01:35:43,198
-哪儿？ -伊斯坦堡！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Where? -Istanbul!{\r}

948
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:53,645
你！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You!{\r}

949
01:35:53,884 --> 01:35:56,250
这金牙猴王 跑哪儿去了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where have you been, you gold-encrusted buffoon?{\r}

950
01:35:56,453 --> 01:35:59,183
抱歉,我被撞昏了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.{\r}

951
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:02,881
把我救出来 我会让你知道什么是撞昏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get me out of here, I'll show you what a bumped head feels like.{\r}

952
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,752
瞧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look.{\r}

953
01:36:04,961 --> 01:36:08,397
屋顶没了至少墙壁还在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have no roof, but at least we have four good walls.{\r}

954
01:36:20,377 --> 01:36:24,336
保险公司一定会抓狂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The insurance company is never going to believe this.{\r}

955
01:37:25,709 --> 01:37:29,941
这里以前是KGB的分部
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This used to be the KGB's Istanbul safe house. Now it's FSB.{\r}

956
01:37:30,146 --> 01:37:31,909
现在是联邦安全局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Federal Security Bureau.{\r}

957
01:37:32,115 --> 01:37:34,743
其实是换汤不换药
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Same old friendly service with a new name.{\r}

958
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:37,252
-找到尼可莱吗？ -没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Did you raise Nikoli? -Nothing.{\r}

959
01:37:37,454 --> 01:37:39,979
试着扫描紧急讯号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Try scanning the emergency frequencies.{\r}

960
01:37:41,725 --> 01:37:42,783
可怜哪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tragedy.{\r}

961
01:37:43,293 --> 01:37:45,693
以前至少有一百个地方
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In the old days, there were 1 00 places...{\r}

962
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:48,329
能让潜艇偷偷升到水面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...where a submarine could surface undetected.{\r}

963
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:49,361
潜艇？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Submarine?{\r}

964
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:52,301
你侄子的潜艇是什么型号？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What class is your nephew running?{\r}

965
01:37:53,203 --> 01:37:55,364
你们称之为维特3型
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Victor 3, you call it.{\r}

966
01:37:55,572 --> 01:37:59,030
核能潜艇 他们要用潜艇的核子反应炉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nuclear. He's not loading cargo. They want the sub to use the reactor.{\r}

967
01:37:59,242 --> 01:38:00,072
没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's it.{\r}

968
01:38:00,276 --> 01:38:03,211
把钸元素放进核子反应炉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put weapons-grade plutonium in that sub's reactor...{\r}

969
01:38:03,413 --> 01:38:05,779
就会造成严重的核爆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...instant, catastrophic meltdown.{\r}

970
01:38:05,982 --> 01:38:08,746
看起来像是场意外
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Making it all look just like an accident.{\r}

971
01:38:08,985 --> 01:38:10,179
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But why?{\r}

972
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:14,123
里海的输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because the existing pipelines from the Caspian Sea...{\r}

973
01:38:14,357 --> 01:38:16,882
把石油运到北部
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...go to the north. Here.{\r}

974
01:38:17,093 --> 01:38:21,291
这里,再用油轮从黑海 运到伊斯坦堡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The oil is put on the tankers, shipped across the Black Sea to Istanbul.{\r}

975
01:38:21,798 --> 01:38:24,130
核爆会摧毁伊斯坦堡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The explosion would destroy Istanbul...{\r}

976
01:38:24,834 --> 01:38:27,462
污染整个博斯普鲁斯海峡几十年
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...contaminating the Bosporus for decades.{\r}

977
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:30,331
这样一来 只有一个方法能输出石油
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There'd be one way to get the oil out.{\r}

978
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,940
从南边到地中海
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Down south to the Med.{\r}

979
01:38:33,143 --> 01:38:34,474
金恩输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The King pipeline.{\r}

980
01:38:35,078 --> 01:38:36,170
伊莉翠的输油管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Elektra's pipeline.{\r}

981
01:38:36,379 --> 01:38:38,142
一定要找到尼克莱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We must find Nikoli.{\r}

982
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:41,382
尼克莱舰长？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Nikoli?{\r}

983
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:44,384
你好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir.{\r}

984
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:47,046
准备装货了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ready to load your cargo.{\r}

985
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:50,453
-我们只有几个小时 -你用最少的人员？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-We have only a few hours. -You came with skeleton crew?{\r}

986
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,685
-我们付不起太多人 -当然了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-That's all we can afford. -Of course.{\r}

987
01:38:53,096 --> 01:38:55,394
给弟兄们的白兰地和点心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some brandy and refreshments for your men.{\r}

988
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,492
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

989
01:39:03,773 --> 01:39:04,705
早安
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good morning.{\r}

990
01:39:09,546 --> 01:39:10,877
什么时候了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the time?{\r}

991
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:26,428
你的死期到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's time for you to die.{\r}

992
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:00,428
我收到讯号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've got something.{\r}

993
01:40:01,364 --> 01:40:03,127
在紧急频道上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On the emergency frequency.{\r}

994
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:05,927
每十五秒发出两组六位数号码
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Two six-digit numbers cycled every 1 5 seconds.{\r}

995
01:40:06,136 --> 01:40:08,001
GPS定位讯号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A GPS signal. Position coordinates.{\r}

996
01:40:08,204 --> 01:40:10,069
核弹晶片,M夫人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Locator card. M.{\r}

997
01:40:13,476 --> 01:40:14,943
-这儿 -处女塔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Here. -Maiden's Tower.{\r}

998
01:40:15,445 --> 01:40:16,673
你去过吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you been there?{\r}

999
01:40:17,147 --> 01:40:18,136
没有,蛮牛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. Mr. Bullion.{\r}

1000
01:40:22,318 --> 01:40:23,376
有炸弹！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bomb!{\r}

1001
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:31,759
快走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, come on.{\r}

1002
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:46,872
你先请
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After you.{\r}

1003
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,043
我坚持
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I insist.{\r}

1004
01:41:05,995 --> 01:41:07,895
最后的晚餐好吃吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Enjoyed your meal, boys?{\r}

1005
01:41:15,772 --> 01:41:17,899
把他们丢进海里喂鱼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take them up and throw them in the sea.{\r}

1006
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:31,312
反应炉在里面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The extruder's in here.{\r}

1007
01:41:33,223 --> 01:41:37,182
我得花半小时做成钸元素棒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It'll take half an hour to set up the machine to make the plutonium rod.{\r}

1008
01:41:44,033 --> 01:41:45,432
把他们带进来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put them in here.{\r}

1009
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:56,740
反应炉没问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The reactor is secured.{\r}

1010
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,971
一切都照计划进行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything is complete as planned.{\r}

1011
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:05,150
-直升机来了吗？ -半小时后会来接我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Is your helicopter ready? -It'll pick me up in half an hour.{\r}

1012
01:42:08,658 --> 01:42:10,182
这就是结局了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then this is the end.{\r}

1013
01:42:12,228 --> 01:42:13,786
不,这是开始
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is the beginning.{\r}

1014
01:42:14,864 --> 01:42:17,264
世界将全面改观
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The world will never be the same.{\r}

1015
01:42:30,246 --> 01:42:31,736
未来在你手中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The future is yours.{\r}

1016
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:34,914
好好地玩吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have fun with it.{\r}

1017
01:42:51,868 --> 01:42:53,096
要是你不来搅局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you'd kept away...{\r}

1018
01:42:53,303 --> 01:42:56,704
也许哪天我们真的能相爱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we might've met in a few years and become lovers once more.{\r}

1019
01:43:06,282 --> 01:43:07,214
把她押去雷纳那儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take her to Renard.{\r}

1020
01:43:10,586 --> 01:43:12,019
她好漂亮
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pretty thing.{\r}

1021
01:43:12,989 --> 01:43:14,479
你也上过她？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You had her too?{\r}

1022
01:43:19,262 --> 01:43:21,127
我能让你称霸天下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I could've given you the world.{\r}

1023
01:43:22,598 --> 01:43:24,190
我绝不贪得无厌
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The world is not enough.{\r}

1024
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:26,500
你真傻
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Foolish sentiment.{\r}

1025
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,694
这是我家族的座右铭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Family motto.{\r}

1026
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:35,843
考古学家在这里 挖出很多古董花瓶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They were digging near here, and they found some very pretty vases.{\r}

1027
01:43:37,113 --> 01:43:39,240
还找到这张椅子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They also found this chair.{\r}

1028
01:43:49,959 --> 01:43:52,894
现代人都不会念旧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think we ignore the old ways at our peril...{\r}

1029
01:43:53,096 --> 01:43:54,358
对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...don't you?{\r}

1030
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:56,125
M夫人呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where's M?{\r}

1031
01:43:56,632 --> 01:43:58,497
她就快粉身碎骨了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon she'll be everywhere.{\r}

1032
01:44:00,136 --> 01:44:01,034
你这么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All this...{\r}

1033
01:44:02,805 --> 01:44:05,069
因为你爱上雷纳？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...because you fell for Renard?{\r}

1034
01:44:08,044 --> 01:44:11,013
再转五下你的脖子 就会被绞断
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Five more turns and your neck will break.{\r}

1035
01:44:14,684 --> 01:44:17,152
我一向都很会玩弄男人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've always had a power over men.{\r}

1036
01:44:19,188 --> 01:44:23,522
当我知道我父亲不付赎金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers...{\r}

1037
01:44:23,926 --> 01:44:26,588
我就得跟绑匪结盟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I knew I had to form another alliance.{\r}

1038
01:44:28,064 --> 01:44:29,156
你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You...{\r}

1039
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:31,895
把雷纳玩弄于股掌
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...turned Renard.{\r}

1040
01:44:33,169 --> 01:44:34,761
我也玩弄了你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just like you...{\r}

1041
01:44:35,004 --> 01:44:37,905
只是你更容易玩弄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...only you were even easier.{\r}

1042
01:44:41,477 --> 01:44:43,138
我叫他真的动手伤我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I told him he had to hurt me.{\r}

1043
01:44:43,913 --> 01:44:46,006
看起来一定要像真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He had to make it look real.{\r}

1044
01:44:46,849 --> 01:44:47,747
他不肯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When he refused...{\r}

1045
01:44:49,218 --> 01:44:52,415
我就说我自己来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I told him I would do it myself.{\r}

1046
01:44:58,027 --> 01:44:59,892
你杀死了你父亲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you killed your father.{\r}

1047
01:45:00,863 --> 01:45:02,091
是他先杀了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He killed me.{\r}

1048
01:45:03,933 --> 01:45:06,265
他不肯付赎金就是杀了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.{\r}

1049
01:45:06,469 --> 01:45:08,733
你全是为了石油吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Was this all about the oil?{\r}

1050
01:45:10,306 --> 01:45:12,103
那是我的石油
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It is my oil.{\r}

1051
01:45:12,942 --> 01:45:13,909
我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mine...{\r}

1052
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,475
和我家族的石油
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and my family's.{\r}

1053
01:45:15,678 --> 01:45:18,806
流在我的血液里 比血还浓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.{\r}

1054
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:22,483
我要重新整合天下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going to redraw the map.{\r}

1055
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,018
当我完成后 整个世界都会知道我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And when I'm through, the whole world will know my name...{\r}

1056
01:45:26,222 --> 01:45:29,487
和我外公的名字 我的族人的荣耀！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...my grandfather's name, the glory of my people!{\r}

1057
01:45:29,692 --> 01:45:33,219
没有人会相信核爆是场意外
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one will believe this meltdown was an accident.{\r}

1058
01:45:33,429 --> 01:45:35,158
他们一定会相信的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They will all believe.{\r}

1059
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,293
你明白吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You understand?{\r}

1060
01:45:38,735 --> 01:45:40,635
没有人能抗拒我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nobody can resist me.{\r}

1061
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:48,467
你知道被绞死的感觉吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what happens when a man is strangled?{\r}

1062
01:45:50,613 --> 01:45:52,478
现在还不迟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not too late.{\r}

1063
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,580
不必害死八百万人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Eight million people need not die.{\r}

1064
01:45:58,421 --> 01:46:01,083
你有机会时应该杀了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should've killed me when you had the chance.{\r}

1065
01:46:02,191 --> 01:46:03,852
但你下不了手 无法对我下手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you couldn't. Not me.{\r}

1066
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,891
无法对你心爱的女人下手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not a woman you've loved.{\r}

1067
01:46:15,972 --> 01:46:18,463
我对你毫无感情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You meant nothing to me.{\r}

1068
01:46:23,746 --> 01:46:24,576
再
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One...{\r}

1069
01:46:26,015 --> 01:46:27,141
转
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...last...{\r}

1070
01:46:29,152 --> 01:46:30,551
最后一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...screw.{\r}

1071
01:46:54,911 --> 01:46:55,741
老板
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Boss...{\r}

1072
01:46:56,813 --> 01:46:57,905
你没死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you're alive.{\r}

1073
01:46:58,114 --> 01:46:59,376
见到你真好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So glad to see you.{\r}

1074
01:47:00,416 --> 01:47:01,508
我也一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Me too.{\r}

1075
01:47:07,557 --> 01:47:08,819
我在找一艘潜艇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm looking for a sub.{\r}

1076
01:47:09,025 --> 01:47:12,256
一艘大大黑黑的 舰长是我老朋友
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's big and black, and the driver is a good friend of mine.{\r}

1077
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,434
带我去找他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bring it to me.{\r}

1078
01:47:20,737 --> 01:47:21,863
可惜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What a shame.{\r}

1079
01:47:22,372 --> 01:47:23,634
他刚走不久
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's just gone.{\r}

1080
01:48:11,521 --> 01:48:13,580
他真的痛恨你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Zukovsky really hated you.{\r}

1081
01:48:15,858 --> 01:48:18,554
没问题了 你好了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything's under control up here. Are you ready?{\r}

1082
01:48:25,468 --> 01:48:27,095
好了,该说晚安了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Time to say good night.{\r}

1083
01:48:56,666 --> 01:48:57,997
你不会冷血地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't kill me.{\r}

1084
01:48:58,201 --> 01:48:59,725
杀我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not in cold blood.{\r}

1085
01:49:29,298 --> 01:49:30,390
阻止他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Call him off.{\r}

1086
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,098
我不想再说一次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't ask again.{\r}

1087
01:49:40,443 --> 01:49:41,808
阻止他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Call him off.{\r}

1088
01:49:43,312 --> 01:49:44,574
快阻止他！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Call him off!{\r}

1089
01:49:54,857 --> 01:49:56,449
你下不了手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You wouldn't kill me.{\r}

1090
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:58,490
你没这么狠心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'd miss me.{\r}

1091
01:50:02,665 --> 01:50:03,757
快下潜！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dive! Bond--{\r}

1092
01:50:10,172 --> 01:50:11,503
我绝不心软
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I never miss.{\r}

1093
01:51:19,742 --> 01:51:21,004
她人呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where is she?{\r}

1094
01:51:40,796 --> 01:51:42,024
以为我忘了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thought I'd forgotten?{\r}

1095
01:52:15,264 --> 01:52:17,198
下潜一百英尺后直航
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Level at 1 00 feet.{\r}

1096
01:52:17,633 --> 01:52:19,100
稳住了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold her steady.{\r}

1097
01:52:29,445 --> 01:52:30,742
一百英尺
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Level at 1 00 feet.{\r}

1098
01:52:36,185 --> 01:52:38,619
只要逼他们浮出水面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we can force them up to the surface...{\r}

1099
01:52:38,821 --> 01:52:40,686
潜艇会被间谍卫星发现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...they'll show up on the spy satellite...{\r}

1100
01:52:41,057 --> 01:52:42,524
海军就会赶来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...bring out the navy.{\r}

1101
01:52:53,169 --> 01:52:54,636
快,起来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Get up!{\r}

1102
01:52:54,837 --> 01:52:55,929
快走！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Over there. Move!{\r}

1103
01:52:56,372 --> 01:52:57,600
给我过去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move! Go, go!{\r}

1104
01:52:57,807 --> 01:52:58,865
过去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get over there!{\r}

1105
01:52:59,075 --> 01:53:00,337
别乱动！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay!{\r}

1106
01:53:00,543 --> 01:53:01,373
手举起来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Up!{\r}

1107
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:34,008
拉平！拉平了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get us level! Level!{\r}

1108
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:35,837
全被打烂了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all smashed!{\r}

1109
01:53:36,045 --> 01:53:37,103
克莉莫丝？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christmas?{\r}

1110
01:53:38,581 --> 01:53:40,048
我们应该笔直上升？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So we're going up then?{\r}

1111
01:53:40,549 --> 01:53:42,278
我稍微算错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Slight miscalculation.{\r}

1112
01:53:54,396 --> 01:53:55,488
抓紧了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold on!{\r}

1113
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:59,567
千万要抓紧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold on, hold on.{\r}

1114
01:54:14,884 --> 01:54:16,249
小心了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Brace yourself.{\r}

1115
01:54:45,481 --> 01:54:46,675
进水了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's flooding!{\r}

1116
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:49,043
快爬到上面去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get up to the hatch.{\r}

1117
01:54:56,625 --> 01:54:58,354
快点！快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Damn! Come on!{\r}

1118
01:54:59,161 --> 01:55:00,389
快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go, go!{\r}

1119
01:55:25,521 --> 01:55:27,785
他启动反应炉！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's opened up the reactor!{\r}

1120
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:29,682
把自己锁在里面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And locked himself in!{\r}

1121
01:55:29,892 --> 01:55:31,757
我得去找他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to get up there to him.{\r}

1122
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:33,286
我们只有一次机会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have one chance.{\r}

1123
01:55:33,762 --> 01:55:38,358
我要游到外面 再从逃生舱口进入反应炉室
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll get out and back in through the reactor room escape hatch.{\r}

1124
01:55:41,971 --> 01:55:45,930
红灯一亮 就按下去让我进去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When the light goes red, press this button so I can get back in.{\r}

1125
01:55:46,609 --> 01:55:48,076
这太危险了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}James, it's too risky.{\r}

1126
01:55:48,277 --> 01:55:49,539
要是我失败
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I don't make it...{\r}

1127
01:55:49,745 --> 01:55:52,236
你就从这里逃生 关上舱门
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...use this chamber to get out. Close the hatch.{\r}

1128
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,177
一路要吐气 关起来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Exhale all the way up. Close it.{\r}

1129
01:58:27,403 --> 01:58:28,392
救命啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Help!{\r}

1130
01:58:39,515 --> 01:58:40,709
快点！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, come on!{\r}

1131
01:58:44,019 --> 01:58:45,884
只要反应炉不爆炸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're safe from the radiation...{\r}

1132
01:58:46,088 --> 01:58:48,318
我们就没有辐射线的危险
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if the reactor coolant doesn't burst.{\r}

1133
01:58:49,058 --> 01:58:51,754
要是他把钸元素插进去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If he had gotten the plutonium rod in the reactor...{\r}

1134
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,326
伊斯坦堡就完了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we could've written off the whole city.{\r}

1135
01:58:58,567 --> 01:59:00,501
欢迎加入我的核子家族
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Welcome to my nuclear family.{\r}

1136
01:59:27,162 --> 01:59:29,630
你真的愿意为她死吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you really gonna commit suicide for her?{\r}

1137
01:59:29,832 --> 01:59:32,232
你忘了,我早就死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You forget, I'm already dead.{\r}

1138
01:59:32,534 --> 01:59:33,466
你没听说吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Haven't you heard?{\r}

1139
01:59:34,603 --> 01:59:36,036
她也死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So is she.{\r}

1140
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:40,573
你在说谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're lying.{\r}

1141
01:59:42,244 --> 01:59:43,768
骗子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Liar!{\r}

1142
01:59:45,481 --> 01:59:46,607
骗子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Liar!{\r}

1143
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:10,229
她在地狱等你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's waiting for you.{\r}

1144
02:01:28,684 --> 02:01:30,584
氢气指数过高
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The hydrogen gas level's too high.{\r}

1145
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,481
只要稍微有一点火花 反应炉就会爆炸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One spark and the reactor'll blow.{\r}

1146
02:01:33,722 --> 02:01:35,280
我得想办法阻止
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to stop it.{\r}

1147
02:01:38,961 --> 02:01:41,759
到上面的鱼雷发射孔等我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go to the top of the sub. Meet me in the torpedo bay.{\r}

1148
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:49,594
反应炉进水了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The reactor is flooded.{\r}

1149
02:01:51,473 --> 02:01:54,135
就算爆炸也不会有危险
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So it's safe even if this place blows.{\r}

1150
02:02:38,287 --> 02:02:40,016
不,这样不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, it's simply not the case.{\r}

1151
02:02:41,723 --> 02:02:42,621
在那之前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Before that.{\r}

1152
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,624
有消息吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Any word?{\r}

1153
02:02:50,265 --> 02:02:51,755
还没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Still no contact.{\r}

1154
02:02:56,238 --> 02:02:58,604
我一直想在土耳其过圣诞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.{\r}

1155
02:03:01,143 --> 02:03:02,667
你在笑我吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Was that a Christmas joke?{\r}

1156
02:03:02,878 --> 02:03:04,539
我笑你？不会的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From me? No.{\r}

1157
02:03:05,314 --> 02:03:06,372
绝对不会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never.{\r}

1158
02:03:07,149 --> 02:03:09,549
该是你拆礼物的时候了吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So isn't it time you unwrapped your present?{\r}

1159
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:11,184
是啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I think so.{\r}

1160
02:03:16,024 --> 02:03:17,548
瞧,那是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look. What's that?{\r}

1161
02:03:18,493 --> 02:03:20,120
-定位晶片 -他一定在附近
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-The card. -He must be nearby.{\r}

1162
02:03:20,329 --> 02:03:21,227
哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where?{\r}

1163
02:03:24,566 --> 02:03:25,794
-在哪儿？ -这侦测到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Where? -It picks up...{\r}

1164
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:28,231
体温,人体是橘色的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...body heat, so humans come out orange.{\r}

1165
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:31,406
那儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There.{\r}

1166
02:03:34,609 --> 02:03:37,169
我以为你说他跟 琼斯博士在一起？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?{\r}

1167
02:03:42,184 --> 02:03:43,173
越来越红了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's getting redder.{\r}

1168
02:03:57,366 --> 02:04:00,494
一定是千禧虫在作祟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Must be a premature form of the millennium bug.{\r}

1169
02:04:03,405 --> 02:04:04,929
我搞错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was wrong about you.{\r}

1170
02:04:07,075 --> 02:04:08,269
什么意思？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How so?{\r}

1171
02:04:09,945 --> 02:04:12,812
我以为圣诞节一年只有一次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1172
02:04:16,918 --> 02:04:21,855
007情报员会回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}
