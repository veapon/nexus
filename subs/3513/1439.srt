1
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:54,906
A Terrorist Arms Bazaar on the Russian Border

2
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:23,691
Our man's in position on the center camera.

3
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,852
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

4
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:30,373
Chinese Long March Scud, Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...

5
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,463
a pair of Russian mortars, and the crates look like American rifles.

6
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,704
Chilean mines, German explosives. Fun for the whole family.

7
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,615
I.D.s.

8
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:43,246
White Rook to White Knight. Show us the pawns.

9
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:47,086
You see, he did get through, Admiral. Start with that chap in the middle.

10
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,347
Load the I.D. Program, please.

11
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:51,357
Data base I.D. Search.

12
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:53,358
Checking the databases.

13
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,398
We've got out first match. Satoshi Isagura.

14
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,099
Chemical expert. Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.

15
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,139
Currently working for the insurgent force in Zaire.

16
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,330
Henry Gupta. American.

17
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:09,181
Practically invented techno-terrorism.

18
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:12,122
Started out as a student radical at Berkeley in the '60s.

19
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,122
Now he sells his politics for cash.

20
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:17,593
- Zoom in on that, can you? - That looks like an American encoder.

21
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:20,923
They use it to control their navigation satellites: The G.P.S. System.

22
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:22,879
I wonder, will the C.I.A. Be more upset

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,764
that they lost it or that we found it?

24
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:27,735
Excuse me. Admiral?

25
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:32,577
Thank you, M, we've seen enough. This is now a military operation.

26
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:34,477
You saw the Gatling gun?

27
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,917
Are your troops prepared for that kind of firepower?

28
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,277
We have election in Moscow next week.

29
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:44,188
The president said any loss of life is unacceptable.

30
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,919
We'll take the naval option.

31
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,159
In one strike, we take out half the world's terrorists.

32
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,760
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest. - Get me the Chester.

33
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,331
- Best not waste time. - My man isn't finished.

34
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:58,841
Black King to White Bishop. Authorization to fire.

35
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:02,512
Get your man out of there. His job is over.

36
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,813
Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire.

37
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,184
On my count. Five, four, three, two, one.

38
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,195
Missile away.

39
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,896
Time to target: Four minutes, eight seconds.

40
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,737
White Knight, four minutes to impact. Get out of there.

41
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,538
Yes, damn it, I know what it is! It's on the screen in front of me.

42
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,338
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

43
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,409
Now, get the hell out of there!

44
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,149
- What the hell's going on? - You will not wait!

45
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,880
- That's an order! - What is your man waiting for?

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,930
White Knight? Oh, my God!

47
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,391
Those are Soviet SB-5 nuclear torpedoes.

48
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:49,562
- If the Cruise hits them... - Order them to abort the missile.

49
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,673
- H.M.S. Chester urgent. - White Knight, come in.

50
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:56,904
Abort missile. Abort missile.

51
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:59,074
- Abort missile. - Abort missile.

52
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,915
Captain, sir, missile out of range.

53
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,756
Unable to destroy.

54
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,757
- White Knight... - Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

55
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,398
- Will it trigger the torpedoes? - It might.

56
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,268
But even if it does not, there's enough plutonium...

57
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:22,279
to make Chernobyl look like picnic.

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,580
Bloody hell! Can't you people keep anything locked up?

59
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,310
Evacuate your troops, and get him out of there, now!

60
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,611
White Knight, come in. White Knight, come in!

61
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,092
- Keep trying, damn it! - White Knight, come in.

62
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,493
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

63
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:52,866
Filthy habit.

64
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,999
I've got the encoder.

65
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,641
- What the hell is he doing? - His job.

66
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:28,183
He's going for the bombs.

67
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,007
Get that jeep!

68
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,619
Get out of it, James.

69
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,726
One minute to impact.

70
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,517
Thirty seconds to impact.

71
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:18,101
Backseat driver.

72
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,902
White Knight to White Rook.

73
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,473
I've evacuated the area.

74
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,413
Ask the admiral where he'd like his bombs delivered.

75
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,190


76
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:01,149
# Darling, I'm killed

77
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:06,554
# I'm in a puddle on the floor

78
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,530
# Waiting for you

79
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,565
# To return

80
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,599
# Oh, what a thrill

81
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:19,495
# Fascinations galore

82
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,435
# How you tease

83
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,801
# How you leave me to burn

84
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,903
# It's so deadly, my dear

85
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:38,679
# The power of having you near

86
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:42,807
# Until that day

87
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:50,320
# Until the world falls away

88
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:54,883
# Until you say

89
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,755
# There'll be no more good-byes

90
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,091
# I see it in your eyes

91
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,825
# Tomorrow never dies

92
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:19,870
# Darling, you've won It's no fun

93
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:23,269
# Martinis, girls and guns

94
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:28,002
# It's murder on our love affair

95
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:33,438
# But you bet your life every night

96
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:36,878
# While you're chasing the morning light

97
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,144
# You're not the only spy

98
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,514
# Out there

99
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,715
# It's so deadly, my dear

100
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,581
# The power of wanting you near

101
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,219
# Until that day

102
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,297
# Until the world falls away

103
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:15,866
# Until you say there'll be no more good-byes

104
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:22,035
# I see it in your eyes

105
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:27,042
# Tomorrow never dies

106
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:44,315


107
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:46,875
Sound the general alarm.

108
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:55,897
The ship has been overflown by two Chinese MiGs.

109
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,897
We believe they have hostile intent.

110
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:01,728
Hands to action stations.

111
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:09,239
H.M.S. Devonshire. This is your last warning.

112
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,270
You are in Chinese territorial waters.

113
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:19,052
Officer of the Watch, maximum speed. Come left 40 degrees.

114
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:23,032
Aye, aye, sir. Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

115
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,723
Are they insane?

116
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:31,904
The Chinese pilot insists that we are only 11 miles off their coast...

117
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:35,505
and he will fire if we don't turn around and go to a Chinese port.

118
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,246
Send this: "We are in international waters...

119
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,246
and will defend ourselves if attacked. "

120
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,717
Copy all this to the Admiralty, urgent.

121
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,858
Are we absolutely sure of our position?

122
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,019
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.

123
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:56,759
Carver Media Group Network - Hamburg

124
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:26,536
Captain, we are ready to launch.

125
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,547
Shut down the engines.

126
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,767
Maintain full silence.

127
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:34,307
A stealth ship may be invisible to radar but the Seadrill isn't.

128
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,719
We'll launch next time the MiGs fly by...

129
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,960
and the British will think it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

130
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,160
I should report in.

131
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:55,542
Stamper to Hamburg. Phase one is in progress.

132
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:58,443
I'll report back to you with an update.

133
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:08,385
- The MiGs are making another pass. - Let's start the show.

134
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,395
Seadrill in position.

135
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,968
Start the drill.

136
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,720
- Release it. - Seadrill away.

137
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,622
Green 3-0, torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

138
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,633
Center bearing 1-1-4.

139
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,633
Officer of the Watch, come hard right, 1-4-1.

140
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,364
There's been no sonar contact, sir. The MiGs must have dropped it.

141
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,505
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

142
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,775
Brace, brace, brace.

143
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:09,057
- Target: 1200. - Knock knock.

144
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,312
Let's go upstairs.

145
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,464
- Turn left. - Rotating 90 degrees.

146
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,118
Now they're wondering why the torpedo hasn't exploded.

147
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,488
PWO, Captain. Full damage report.

148
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,090
Backup power, immediately!

149
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,070
Switch to alternate supply.

150
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:12,611
Three generators are down, sir. Flooding on four deck aft.

151
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,742
Sir, we're now down 14 degrees by the stern.

152
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:21,252
Yeoman, send to Admiralty: "Have been torpedoed by Chinese MiGs. Sinking. "

153
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:25,583
Give them our position. Right. Abandon ship.

154
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:28,214
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

155
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,055


156
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,896
Everyone on deck! Come on!

157
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,848
One missile at the MiGs.

158
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,562
Maintaining radio silence.

159
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,584
Their last broadcast, sir.

160
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,254
Mr. Gupta's little trick with the encoder worked.

161
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:20,415
They gave their final position 70 miles from here.

162
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,926
The British Navy will never find them.

163
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,987
Survivors in the water.

164
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,638


165
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,909


166
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,820
Mr. Stamper, I'm having fun with my headlines.

167
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,721
I need to know the exact number of survivors.

168
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:53,622
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure you use the right kind of ammunition.

169
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,253
Yes, sir.

170
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,163
Delicious.

171
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,070
Start the recovery operation.

172
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
Send our divers down to the Devonshire.

173
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:46,763


174
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,536
Mr. Gupta? Phase one is complete.

175
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,679
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

176
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,089
What kind of havoc shall the Carver Media Group create in the world today?

177
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,290
- News. - Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris.

178
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:23,601
- And a plane crash in California. - Excellent.

179
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:27,702
Mr. Jones, are we ready to release our new software?

180
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:31,242
Yes, sir. As requested, it's full of bugs...

181
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,803
which means people will be forced to upgrade for years.

182
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,044
Outstanding.

183
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:38,284
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

184
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:41,755
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill lowering the cable rates...

185
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,795
we'll release a video of him with the cheerleader...

186
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,796
- in the Chicago motel room. - Inspired, sir.

187
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,296
After he signs the bill, release the tape anyway.

188
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,997
Consider him slimed.

189
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,737
Excuse me.

190
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,908
- He's on transponder seven. - Mr. Stamper?

191
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:02,249
Phase two is underway. I have the videotape.

192
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,290
I haven't seen it myself, but I'm told the footage is excellent.

193
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,220
Plus, there were 17 survivors for your headlines.

194
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,021
Good work, Stamper.

195
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,202
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

196
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,133
Make sure you keep it in a safe place.

197
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,373
Gentlemen and ladies...

198
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:25,004
hold the presses.

199
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,014
This just in.

200
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,515
By a curious quirk of fate, we have the perfect story...

201
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:35,286
with which to launch our Satellite News Network tonight.

202
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:40,828
It seems a small crisis is brewing in the South China Sea.

203
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:44,528
I want full newspaper coverage. I want magazine stories.

204
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,469
I want books. I want films. I want TV. I want radio.

205
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,379
I want us on the air 24 hours a day.

206
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,380
This is our moment!

207
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,341
And a billion people around this planet...

208
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,981
will watch it, hear it...

209
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,852
and read about it from the Carver Media Group.

210
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:10,223
There's no news like bad news.

211
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:24,217
I am pleased with your progress, Mr. Bond.

212
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:30,658
I've always enjoyed studying a new tongue, Professor.

213
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:35,689
One might say you have a natural ability.

214
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:39,629
But practice makes perfect.

215
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,142
How do you say "I'm not here" in Danish?

216
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,773
Just ignore it.

217
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:58,053
Those are words they just don't have in their vocabulary.

218
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:03,895
- Bond here. - Go to a secure line, 007.

219
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,425
Going to a scrambler, channel four.

220
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,866
That's ridiculous. That ship was in international waters.

221
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:15,277
- We can't be certain. - James? Where are you?

222
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,318
Oh, Moneypenny.

223
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:22,818
I'm just up here at Oxford brushing up on a little Danish.

224
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:24,289
Little?

225
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,949
I'm afraid you're going to have to kiss off your lesson, James.

226
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,660
We've got a situation here at the Ministry of Defense.

227
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:31,761
We're sending the fleet to China.

228
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:36,831
I'll be there in an hour.

229
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:38,532
Make that 30 minutes.

230
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:42,003
Good-bye, my sweet.

231
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,313
You always were a cunning linguist, James.

232
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,245
- Don't ask. - Don't tell.

233
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,268
That's preposterous. We know exactly where that ship was positioned.

234
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:10,708
The G.P.S. System... Global Positioning Satellites... do not lie.

235
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,719
Yes, but our Singapore station picked up a mysterious signal...

236
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,840
on the G.P.S. Frequency at the time of the attack.

237
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,851
It could've sent that ship off course.

238
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,911
- I have a missing British frigate... - I'm aware of that!

239
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:24,392
And instead of decisive action, all you want to do is investigate.

240
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,832
My goal is to prevent World War Three, Admiral, and I don't think...

241
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:29,893
sending an armada into the recovery area is the best way to do it.

242
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:33,273
Where, exactly, did this mysterious G.P.S. Signal come from?

243
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:36,274
- We're still investigating. - "Investigating. "

244
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:40,045
M, sometimes I don't think you have the balls for this job.

245
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,485
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

246
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:44,676
I don't have to think with them all the time.

247
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,527
That's enough. Now, where do we stand?

248
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:53,687
It was an unprovoked attack on a ship in international waters.

249
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:57,398
We send in the fleet for recovery and prepare for full retaliation.

250
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,869
Moderation. We investigate...

251
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,170
and stop short of sending the entire British Navy...

252
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,440
within ten minutes of the world's largest air force.

253
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,570
- When will our ships be in position? - Forty-eight hours.

254
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,781
Christ!

255
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:11,782
The press are already screaming for blood.

256
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:14,912
The last thing we want to do is escalate the situation.

257
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:16,923
I'm afraid it may be too late to worry about that.

258
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:22,754
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

259
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,395
"According to Vietnamese officials who recovered the bodies...

260
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,205
the victims were riddled with the same ammunition...

261
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:30,536
used by the Chinese Air Force. "

262
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,276
- Did you leak this? - No.

263
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:37,977
- It's the first I've heard of it. - Well, this settles it.

264
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:41,448
We send in the fleet.

265
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,928
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

266
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,141
There is one strange thing.

267
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:57,801
When I called our contact in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

268
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,102
only found our sailors three hours ago.

269
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,802
How'd they get the paper out so fast?

270
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:05,513
Somebody at Tomorrow knew before the Vietnamese government did.

271
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:09,383
How much do you know about Elliot Carver, 007?

272
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:10,854
Worldwide media baron.

273
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,694
Able to topple governments with a single broadcast.

274
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,495
Carver owns that newspaper Tomorrow.

275
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,796
I didn't want to discuss it in front of the minister...

276
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:21,836
but that mysterious signal came from one of Carver's satellites.

277
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:26,897
The P.M. Would have my head if he knew you were investigating him.

278
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:29,948
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007. We've arranged for you to be invited...

279
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:32,108
to a party at Carver's Media Center.

280
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,589
They're celebrating the launch of a new satellite...

281
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:38,349
because now he has the ability to reach every human being on the Earth.

282
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
Except the Chinese, who have refused broadcast rights.

283
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:47,661
Your ticket, cover story and rental car reservation.

284
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,402
Sign here, please.

285
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:53,243
I believe you once had a relationship with Carver's wife, Paris.

286
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:56,514
That was a long time ago, M...

287
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,514
before she was married.

288
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:02,875
I didn't realize it was public knowledge.

289
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,975
Queen and country, James.

290
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,926
Your job is to find out whether Carver or someone in his organization...

291
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,156
sent that ship off course and why.

292
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:13,237
Use your relationship with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

293
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,628
I doubt if she'll remember me.

294
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,568
Remind her.

295
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,139
Then pump her for information.

296
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,609
You'll just have to decide how much pumping is needed, James.

297
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,050
If only that were true of you and I, Moneypenny.

298
00:27:43,234 --> 00:28:07,469


299
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,629
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

300
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,300
It's the insurance damage waiver...

301
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:19,371
for your beautiful new car.

302
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:23,081
- Will you need collision coverage? - Yes.

303
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:24,622
Fire?

304
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,883
Probably.

305
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:29,683
- Property destruction? - Definitely.

306
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:31,454
Personal injury?

307
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,864
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

308
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,054
They frequently do with you.

309
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:41,335
Well, that takes care of the normal wear and tear.

310
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,306
Do I need any other protection?

311
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:48,617
Only from me, 007, unless you bring that car back in pristine order.

312
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:51,018
- Shall we? - Shall we?

313
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:57,059
Your new BMW 750.

314
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,929
All the usual refinements... machine guns, rockets...

315
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,230
the G.P.S. Tracking system.

316
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,741
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt and obey all instructions for a safe trip.

317
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,572
I thought you'd pay more attention to a female voice.

318
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,873
- I think we've met. - I am not interested...

319
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,913
in your sordid escapades.

320
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:18,884
Let's get on with it, shall we?

321
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:20,884
Your new telephone.

322
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,724
Talk here, listen here.

323
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,315
So that's what I've been doing wrong all these years.

324
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,396
It also includes a fingerprint scanner...

325
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,437
and a 20,000-volt security system.

326
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,527
And this I'm particularly proud of...

327
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,478
the remote control for your car.

328
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,238
Tap twice.

329
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,979
One, two.

330
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,790
Now, draw your finger...

331
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,380
very slowly across the pad...

332
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,461
to drive the car.

333
00:29:58,302 --> 00:30:01,892
It's surprisingly difficult to drive, but with practice...

334
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:05,443
Well, let's see how she responds to my touch, eh, Q?

335
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:32,009
I think we understand each other.

336
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,939
Grow up, 007.

337
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:54,623
Attention. Engine running. Please shut door now.

338
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:56,604
Don't let her push you around.

339
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:11,417
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth in this malicious rumor...

340
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:14,018
that I started running Mad Cow Disease stories...

341
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:17,998
simply because Sir Angus Black, the great British beef baron...

342
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,689
lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game of poker and refused to pay up.

343
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,500
Moreover, there's even less truth in the rumor...

344
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,541
that I took 100 million francs from the French...

345
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,841
to keep the stories running for another year.

346
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:32,671
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver. - Yes.

347
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:35,612
This is the new banker, Mr...

348
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:38,583
Bond. James Bond.

349
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:41,713
Another new banker. I seem to collect them.

350
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:45,024
Tell me, Mr. Bond.

351
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,565
How's the market reacting to the crisis?

352
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:50,725
Well, currencies are off. Your stock is soaring.

353
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:54,076
I don't believe we have met.

354
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,237
- Elliot Carver. - Wai Lin.

355
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:59,437
I'm from the New China News Agency.

356
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,608
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.

357
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:03,278
I have a confession.

358
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:06,748
It's not. I snuck in.

359
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,379
Why would you do that, my dear?

360
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,390
I wanted to meet you.

361
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,430
Outstanding.

362
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,401
I admire a woman who takes the initiative.

363
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,901
- You should work in my Beijing bureau. - Mr. Carver.

364
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:23,632
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing. - Call me Elliot.

365
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:38,245
I always wondered how I'd feel if I ever saw you again.

366
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,598
Now I know.

367
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,368
Was it something I said?

368
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:55,009
How about the words, "I'll be right back?"

369
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,450
- Something came up. - Something always came up.

370
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,551
- And how are you, Paris? - Much better now. We're even.

371
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:07,562
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

372
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:11,462
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

373
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,833
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila, straight shot.

374
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:19,604
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass of Mr. Carver's champagne.

375
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:23,405
I see you've moved up in the world, Paris.

376
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,455
And tonight, you're a banker. I saw the guest list.

377
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:31,076
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

378
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,769
- To you. - No, to the gun.

379
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:54,911
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

380
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:57,012
Your husband may be in trouble.

381
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,552
The emperor of the air.

382
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,183
If you think you're going after him, you're the one who's in trouble.

383
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:05,993
Perhaps, but it's either him or someone in his organization.

384
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:09,404
I see. And you figured you could charm the dirt out of me.

385
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:12,265
No. That wasn't my plan.

386
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:14,776
Good. Because if it comes to a choice...

387
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,206
between you and Elliot, I've made my bed.

388
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:19,547
You don't sleep in it anymore.

389
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:21,207
There you are.

390
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,208
Darling.

391
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,899
I've been looking everywhere for you.

392
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:33,289
I want you to meet Wai Lin, New China News Agency.

393
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,130
- Hello, Mrs. Carver. - It's a pleasure.

394
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,671
And this is James Bond.

395
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:41,331
I didn't realize you knew each other.

396
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,312
- We're old friends. - Casual acquaintances.

397
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,742
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

398
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:51,083
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin behind a news desk.

399
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,584
That's wonderful. I'm sure she won't resist...

400
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,614
too much.

401
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:00,565
Tell me, Elliot, I was just wondering about your satellites...

402
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,136
the way you've positioned yourself globally.

403
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:06,226
They're merely tools for information, Mr. Bond.

404
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,897
Or disinformation.

405
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:12,377
Say, if you wanted to manipulate the course of governments or people.

406
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:14,438
Or even a ship.

407
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:19,349
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

408
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,090
You have a vivid imagination for a banker.

409
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,630
Perhaps I should commission you to write a novel.

410
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,631
Oh, heavens, no. I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

411
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:40,273
It's time to begin the festivities.

412
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,874
Excuse me. Darling?

413
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,045
So, how do you really know him?

414
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:52,146
I told you, he's a banker. I met him in Zurich.

415
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:54,357
You're a terrible liar, dear.

416
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:00,468
I have a problem with a banker.

417
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:03,268
Could I see you a moment?

418
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,939
Ladies and gentlemen.

419
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,170
Mr. Carver's broadcast will be starting in ten minutes in the main studio.

420
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:18,261
Exactly what kind of banking do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

421
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:23,852
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

422
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:36,645
Carver must feel at home in a room like this.

423
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,186
It's nice to talk to the world.

424
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,587
Looks like there's someone who wants to talk to you.

425
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,758
Mr. Bond, you have an urgent phone call.

426
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,500
Ladies and gentlemen, we are live in five...

427
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,111
four, three, two...

428
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,111
Good evening.

429
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,912
Tonight's broadcast was supposed to be a celebration...

430
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,753
marking the completion of the Carver Global Satellite Network.

431
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:15,353
But, as you're well aware...

432
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:18,524
a terrible conflict looms tonight in the South China Sea...

433
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,325
which, unchecked...

434
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:26,136
has the potential to destroy every human being on Earth.

435
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:29,806
- I want to assure my viewers that I... - This way, please.

436
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:33,247
Elliot Carver, have spoken with the prime minister in London...

437
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,248
and the chairman in Beijing...

438
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:37,948
and have offered my services as an impartial...

439
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,459
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond. Nobody hears you scream.

440
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,691
Herr Stamper, we have made contact.

441
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,302
Make him uncomfortable.

442
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:57,712
I'll be there in a few moments.

443
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:01,183
...with its printing presses that run 24 hours a day...

444
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:04,484
and its satellite facilities linking every last...

445
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:11,555
You seem very concerned about Mr. Carver's business.

446
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:16,066
He wants to know why.

447
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,467
Why did I do it, you ask.

448
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,838
The answer is simple: Power.

449
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:25,738
The power to illuminate the far corners of the globe.

450
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,749
Not for higher profits...

451
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:32,279
but for higher understanding between the people of this great planet.

452
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,120
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play a little number on his head.

453
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:44,892
And what do I expect in return?

454
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,663
Worldwide domination.

455
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:51,903
Complete, utter, total worldwide domination.

456
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:55,214
But not over governments or ideology.

457
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:59,755
Over tyranny and isolation and ignorance.

458
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:04,046
The Carver Media Group Network has the ability...

459
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:08,227
to reach every person in every village in every nation.

460
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,288
But do not fear me...

461
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,928
for tonight I offer you my declaration of principles:

462
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:16,239
A promise to the men and women of this planet...

463
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:19,609
my brothers and sisters whom I so humbly serve.

464
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,981
I promise to report the news without fear or favor.

465
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:28,581
I promise to be a force for good in this world...

466
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:32,252
fighting injustice, crushing intolerance...

467
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,623
battling inhumanity.

468
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:36,463
It's time for...

469
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:40,664
a station break.

470
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,045
- What's happening? - We've lost power.

471
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,306
- We're off the air. - What?

472
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:59,178
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm. There's no need to go for the exit.

473
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,628
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

474
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:05,259
What do you mean, you don't know? You're fired! Get out of my sight!

475
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,229
And, in a rather embarrassing note...

476
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,920
scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver was cut off the air tonight...

477
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,431
in mid-speech during the inaugural broadcast...

478
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,401
of his Worldwide Satellite Network.

479
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:06,102
Sorry, Elliot, but we didn't do it.

480
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,813
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

481
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:13,143
Come on, Elliot. Ignore those people.

482
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:15,914
- Sometimes these things happen. - Not to me.

483
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,925
Not to me!

484
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:31,898
When I was 16, I went to work for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

485
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:37,809
It was a rag, but the editor taught me one important lesson.

486
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:41,009
The key to a great story is not who...

487
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,350
or what or when...

488
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:46,491
but why.

489
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:52,021
Your friend, Mr. Bond, made a mess tonight.

490
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:57,192
- I want to know why. - I told you, I barely know him.

491
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:00,694
Barely?

492
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,340
I was curious who Carver would send.

493
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:33,971
He's on to you.

494
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,481
Well, we know where you stand.

495
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:41,352
You made your bed.

496
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,723
I'm standing in your doorway.

497
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,004
Then turn around and go home.

498
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:55,195
You can tell him you didn't get anything out of me.

499
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:01,036
That's it? Go home?

500
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:05,417
I didn't ask you to get involved in this.

501
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:07,888
It's too late for that.

502
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,170
Why did you marry him?

503
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,170
He told me he loved me.

504
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,741
That always sounds good.

505
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:29,042
Do you know I used to look in the papers every day for your obituary?

506
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:33,083
Well, I'm sorry I keep disappointing you.

507
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,425
What was it, James?

508
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,336
Did I get too close?

509
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,477
Did I get too close for comfort?

510
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,320
Yes.

511
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,921
I missed you.

512
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,393
What did you find?

513
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:10,763
I hacked into the mainframe at the bank. They're using an SSL2 encryption...

514
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:14,174
Spare me the technobabble, please.

515
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,835
Bond's got a perfect employment record. Ten years.

516
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,375
He's crossed every "T," he's dotted every "I."

517
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:21,606
- Which means? - Government agent.

518
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,586
I call it Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

519
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:27,587
If it sounds too good to be true, it always is.

520
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,218
Do you think my wife knows?

521
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,999
There's a lot of garbage, but if you dial down the ambient noise...

522
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,410
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

523
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:47,481
Play it again.

524
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:51,382
Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?

525
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:56,883
I think we should set an appointment for my wife with the doctor.

526
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:18,078
- I have to go. - No, you don't.

527
00:46:18,148 --> 00:46:20,378
I can get you out of the country in four hours.

528
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:22,319
I have no choice.

529
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:25,829
No one can protect me from him, not even you.

530
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,730
- You do have a choice. - Only if you let him go.

531
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,730
I can't do that.

532
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:38,202
He has a secret lab on the top floor even I'm not supposed to know about.

533
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:40,212
There's an emergency hatch on the roof.

534
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:42,513
- You don't have to do this. - It's the easiest way to get in.

535
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,553
Don't argue with me, James.

536
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:48,454
You know...

537
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:51,825
this job of yours...

538
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:57,166
it's murder on relationships.

539
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,793
Until I get back next week, I want two guards...

540
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:23,234
outside this office 24 hours a day.

541
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,164
Nobody gets in. Got it?

542
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:27,365
We'll take care of it.

543
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,566
What do we do with the satellite?

544
00:48:34,717 --> 00:48:37,517
Send this thing off to the launch site. And be careful.

545
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:41,817
It's worth 300 million dollars. You break it, you bought it. Understand?

546
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:44,448
I hate travelling. I never know what to pack.

547
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,340
Looking for a news story?

548
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:38,897
They'll print anything these days.

549
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,781
Yes?

550
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:46,791
Good morning, Mr. Bond. Elliot Carver.

551
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:50,162
I believe you've got two items that belong to me.

552
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,253
What are you talking about?

553
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,303
The red box, Mr. Bond...

554
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:58,204
and my wife in your hotel room.

555
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:12,587
He's coming.

556
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:19,899
Fingerprint I.D. Accepted.

557
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:29,471
Please select security system level.

558
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:55,006
Tell me if you find the encoder.

559
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,137
- Call me immediately. - Yeah.

560
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,720
And in breaking news...

561
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,831
it is with great sadness that we announce the death of Paris Carver...

562
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,531
who has become an international figure since she became the wife...

563
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,872
of Elliot Carver, chairman of this network.

564
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:27,113
According to police officials in Hamburg, Germany...

565
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:29,113
Mrs. Carver was found dead this morning...

566
00:55:29,184 --> 00:55:33,644
in a hotel suite in that city in unusual circumstances...

567
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:36,315
on which police have refused to elaborate.

568
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:39,125
A coroner has been called for and is expected to deliver...

569
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:42,636
his full report within the next three days.

570
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:46,437
Her body was discovered along with the body of an unidentified man...

571
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:49,667
who appeared to be the victim of a self-inflicted gun wound.

572
00:55:49,738 --> 00:55:52,038
Reached aboard his private jet en route...

573
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,139
I have a clear shot at your head, Mr. Bond.

574
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:59,119
Stand up, slowly.

575
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,680
Drop your gun and kick it toward me, ja?

576
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:04,191
At present, police have refused to speculate...

577
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,591
on a motive in this murder/suicide.

578
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:08,492
Good. Now...

579
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:11,262
lie down on the bed next to Mrs. Carver.

580
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:14,273
We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Carver.

581
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:19,834
This story will be on the news in an hour.

582
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:24,045
- Tomorrow's news today. - Just so.

583
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:33,157
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

584
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:36,627
I am an outstanding pistol marksman.

585
00:56:36,698 --> 00:56:38,858
Take my word for it, ja?

586
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:45,909
Get the sledgehammers.

587
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:01,123
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

588
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:04,723
It's a pity you got her involved in all this.

589
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,994
It won't look like a suicide if you shoot me from over there.

590
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:12,765
I am a professor of forensic medicine.

591
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,406
Believe me, Mr. Bond, I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

592
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:18,076
and still create the proper effect.

593
00:57:26,158 --> 00:57:29,148
My art is in great demand, Mr. Bond.

594
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:31,219
I go all over the world.

595
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:35,739
I am especially good at the celebrity overdose.

596
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,300
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond, that our little...

597
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:45,472
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, ja?

598
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:48,042
Sir, they can't get into the car.

599
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:50,613
You can't be serious.

600
00:57:50,724 --> 00:57:54,384
- Did you call the Auto Club? - Do you want to call them?

601
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,424
Make him tell you how to open it.

602
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:58,435
Okay, I ask.

603
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,336
This is very embarrassing.

604
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:04,636
It seems there is a red box in your car.

605
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,566
They can't get to it.

606
00:58:06,637 --> 00:58:10,577
They want me to make you unlock the car.

607
00:58:10,648 --> 00:58:13,448
I feel like an idiot. I don't know what to say.

608
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:18,149
I am to torture you if you don't do it.

609
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:21,489
- You've a doctorate in that too? - No, no, no.

610
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,460
This is more like a hobby. But I'm very gifted.

611
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,861
Oh, I believe you.

612
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:30,732
- My cell phone opens the car. - No, Mr. Bond.

613
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,872
I do it, ja?

614
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:40,043
Recall, three, send.

615
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,426
Wait.

616
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:55,436
I'm just a professional doing a job.

617
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,797
Me too.

618
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,064
Dr. Kaufman.

619
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:02,211
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt.

620
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,583
Reduce speed.

621
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:11,823
Pedestrians in roadway.

622
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:18,767
Driver alert.

623
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,277
Obstruction ahead. Reduce speed now.

624
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:46,305
Reminder: Unsafe driving will void warranty.

625
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:33,935
Congratulations on a safe journey.

626
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:44,608
U.S. Air Base, South China Sea

627
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,231
Yo! Jimbo!

628
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,331
Wade, what are you doing here?

629
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:06,412
You know the world's my office. Let's go this way.

630
01:04:06,512 --> 01:04:08,442
Did Q bring you up to speed?

631
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:11,483
Yeah. I brought along the G.P.S. Calibration unit.

632
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:16,315
By the way, officially Uncle Sam is completely neutral in this turkey shoot.

633
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,785
And unofficially?

634
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,985
We have no interest in seeing World War Three, unless we start it.

635
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,426
Dr. Greenwalt. He's the Air Force G.P.S. Expert.

636
01:04:24,496 --> 01:04:26,436
Sorry about all this security...

637
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:29,767
but the G.P.S. Encoder is one of the most closely guarded secrets...

638
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:31,267
in the U.S. Military.

639
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:33,208
Show him what you got.

640
01:04:37,549 --> 01:04:40,479
Jesus, it's the missing encoder. How the hell did you get that?

641
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:43,150
Picked it up in Hamburg yesterday morning.

642
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,590
Could somebody use this to send a ship off course?

643
01:04:46,661 --> 01:04:48,181
- Like the Devonshire? - Whoa!

644
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:50,451
I didn't you hear anybody mention the Devonshire. Did you?

645
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:54,492
- No. - Good. So just answer his question.

646
01:04:54,573 --> 01:04:57,063
In theory, if you could alter the timing chip...

647
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,573
you could slowly send a ship off course.

648
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:03,634
- Like putting a magnet near a compass. - Yeah, exactly.

649
01:05:03,714 --> 01:05:06,074
- Then check this out. - Oh, yeah.

650
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:21,557
Those two circles should be lining up on top of each other.

651
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:23,538
Somebody's tampered with your encoder.

652
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:28,639
If we knew the last time and position the Devonshire thought she was...

653
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,470
could you figure out exactly where she sank?

654
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,040
Sure.

655
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,681
Wade...

656
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,781
I have a small favor to ask.

657
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:48,333
The high-altitude, low opening jump... the HALO jump...

658
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:51,594
is where we get the most fatalities, so listen up.

659
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:55,975
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

660
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,595
Sounds like my first marriage.

661
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,706
After the free-fall...

662
01:05:59,776 --> 01:06:02,446
pop the chute at 200 feet, below the Chinese radar.

663
01:06:02,517 --> 01:06:04,447
You'll be traveling at over 200 miles an hour.

664
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:06,457
This snaps your head back like a cantaloupe.

665
01:06:06,518 --> 01:06:09,078
Don't crack your skull open on the tanks.

666
01:06:09,158 --> 01:06:10,748
I'll keep that in mind.

667
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:14,529
One last thing: When you hit the water don't forget to cut away your chute.

668
01:06:14,629 --> 01:06:19,189
90% of people killed in the HALO jump got tangled in their chutes and drowned.

669
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,530
Got it?

670
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,801
Seems like a lot just to save the world.

671
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:24,471
I've got no choice.

672
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:27,641
I have to prove that ship was deliberately set off course.

673
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:28,942
One minute!

674
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:30,912
- Is the pickup set? - You bet.

675
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:35,083
After your mission, turn on your beacon. The extraction team will pick you up.

676
01:06:37,054 --> 01:06:39,394
Buddha bless!

677
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:41,755
- I just noticed something. - Yeah?

678
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,455
This is where the ship thought it was.

679
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:46,936
This is where it really is. But see that island?

680
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:50,406
- Yeah. - That means where he's jumping...

681
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:53,137
between the British and Chinese fleets...

682
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:55,507
Technically they're not in Chinese territorial waters.

683
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,208
- They belong to Vietnam. - Vietnam?

684
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,489
Does he have any U.S. Government markings on him?

685
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,649
The parachute, the wet suit, the fins.

686
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,960
If the Vietnamese catch him, they're gonna go crazy.

687
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:14,391
He didn't even say good-bye.

688
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:36,146
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

689
01:11:36,987 --> 01:11:40,357
It's the opportunities for travel that I like best about banking.

690
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,258
Bring the boat.

691
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:47,889
What are you waiting for?

692
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:01,842
Get them out of the water.

693
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:20,765
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were following me around, Mr. Bond.

694
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:22,846
You'll have to admit, though...

695
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:26,007
we seem to have developed a certain attachment to each other.

696
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:29,178
Hopefully not for long.

697
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:35,579
Another Carver building.

698
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:39,289
If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd developed an edifice complex.

699
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:03,124
General Chang? Friend of yours?

700
01:13:05,396 --> 01:13:07,866
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

701
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:11,227
Welcome to Saigon.

702
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:13,237
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

703
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:16,837
I hadn't intended opening this center until tomorrow...

704
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:20,778
but as you're here you can help me to write the inaugural story...

705
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:22,469
your obituaries.

706
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:25,349
I hope you extended the same courtesy to Paris.

707
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:31,550
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one who wrote my late wife's obituary...

708
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:33,521
when you asked her to betray me.

709
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:36,622
Still, let's see...

710
01:13:36,732 --> 01:13:39,822
"British secret service agent James Bond...

711
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:41,993
and his collaborator Wai Lin...

712
01:13:42,073 --> 01:13:45,003
of the Chinese People's External Security Force...

713
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:46,604
were found...

714
01:13:47,444 --> 01:13:49,714
dead this morning...

715
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:51,715
in Vietnam. "

716
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:56,516
Lacks punch, don't you think?

717
01:13:56,586 --> 01:14:00,546
It's old news, Elliot. We've been working together for months.

718
01:14:00,657 --> 01:14:03,627
Both our governments know what you and General Chang are up to.

719
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:07,498
I don't think so.

720
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,839
You may have seen the general in the hallway just now...

721
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:12,069
but perhaps, with all your jetting around...

722
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,270
you've not had chance to peruse today's headlines.

723
01:14:20,451 --> 01:14:24,221
I rather like the last one. It isn't even mine.

724
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:26,382
I never believe what I read in the press anyway.

725
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:29,583
Ah. Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

726
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:34,103
We're both men of action, but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

727
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:38,634
Words are the new weapons, satellites the new artillery.

728
01:14:38,705 --> 01:14:41,935
And you become the new supreme allied commander?

729
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,376
Exactly!

730
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:46,386
Caesar had his legions, Napoleon had his armies...

731
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:50,417
I have my divisions... TV, news, magazines.

732
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,618
And by midnight I'll have reached and influenced more people...

733
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:58,389
than anyone in the history of this planet, save God Himself.

734
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,130
And the best He ever managed was the Sermon on the Mount.

735
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,730
You really are quite insane.

736
01:15:05,311 --> 01:15:08,041
The distance between insanity and genius...

737
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,081
is measured only by success.

738
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:11,472
Excuse me.

739
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:14,802
General Chang is waiting.

740
01:15:14,923 --> 01:15:15,923
If you'll forgive me,

741
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:17,543
your appearance here has forced me...

742
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:19,693
to move up my timetable slightly.

743
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:23,424
I'll leave you in the capable hands of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

744
01:15:23,495 --> 01:15:25,085
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

745
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,725
Sir. The helicopter.

746
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:29,096
Thanks, Gupta.

747
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:32,226
Mr. Stamper is a protege of the late Dr. Kaufman...

748
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:35,467
who was schooling him in the ancient art of chakra torture.

749
01:15:36,547 --> 01:15:38,477
He was like a father to me.

750
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:41,678
Really? Interesting role model.

751
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:44,849
According to Eastern philosophy, the body has seven chakra points.

752
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:48,189
Energy centers, like the heart or genitals.

753
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,590
The purpose of these implements is to probe those organs...

754
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:53,861
inflicting the maximum amount of pain...

755
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:57,091
whilst keeping the victim alive for as long as possible.

756
01:15:57,172 --> 01:15:59,662
Dr. Kaufman's record was 52 hours.

757
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:02,532
I'm hoping to break it.

758
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:06,303
Hmm. I would've thought watching your TV shows was torture enough.

759
01:16:07,714 --> 01:16:09,144
Save this one till last.

760
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:12,274
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

761
01:16:12,355 --> 01:16:16,515
there should be just enough time for him to watch it stop beating.

762
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:18,056
Excuse me.

763
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:48,382
Go! Go! Go! Go!

764
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:58,034
We can use the banner.

765
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:02,545
Hope it holds.

766
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:07,106
- Get after them! - Ready? Go!

767
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:33,852
Next time I'll take the elevator.

768
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,623
Push! Push!

769
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:02,048
- Get a car! - No, no!

770
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:04,488
- Yes, a car! - A bike is quicker.

771
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,889
The keys. Someone always forgets them.

772
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:10,619
What are you doing? I'm driving. Get off.

773
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,590
Get on the back.

774
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:18,201
I'm slipping.

775
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,172
Stop fidgeting back there.

776
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:26,913
What are you...

777
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:28,473
Give me that.

778
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:30,614
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

779
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:32,244
- Turn right. - No, left.

780
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:34,324
Who's driving? Come on!

781
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,221
Clutch!

782
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,893
Left! Left!

783
01:19:17,974 --> 01:19:19,604
How many back there?

784
01:19:19,684 --> 01:19:21,674
I can't see. Hold on.

785
01:19:24,455 --> 01:19:26,115
What are you... What?

786
01:19:28,256 --> 01:19:31,696
- Don't get any ideas. - I'd never dream of it.

787
01:19:33,627 --> 01:19:34,427
One... No, two.

788
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:43,009
- Go for the barrels. - What?

789
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,280
Very good.

790
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,794
Hold on!

791
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,676
Let's take the highway.

792
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,441
- Helicopter! - All right, keep your shirt on.

793
01:21:29,372 --> 01:21:32,432
- Get on the back of the bike. - Are you trying to protect me?

794
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:35,002
No. I need to balance the bike. Get on the back.

795
01:21:43,655 --> 01:21:45,455
- You ready? - Yeah.

796
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,715
Go!

797
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:01,838
Pop the clutch.

798
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:33,005
It's behind us.

799
01:22:33,085 --> 01:22:34,545
Move!

800
01:22:36,716 --> 01:22:39,086
Get out of the way!

801
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:11,493
You see the chopper?

802
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,663
I can't see. Hold on.

803
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:21,165
What are you...

804
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:35,588
Trapped.

805
01:23:38,429 --> 01:23:39,689
Never.

806
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,619
Would you pass the soap?

807
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,960
Over there.

808
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:40,761
You were pretty good with that hook.

809
01:24:40,872 --> 01:24:44,102
It comes from growing up in a rough neighborhood.

810
01:24:44,172 --> 01:24:46,432
You were pretty good on the bike.

811
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:50,413
Well, that comes from not growing up at all.

812
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:52,474
Here. Allow me.

813
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:56,425
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

814
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,425
Just off the cuff, I thought we might link up.

815
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:02,696
Work hand in hand?

816
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:06,166
Stick closer to each other.

817
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:08,167
Maybe we go after General Chang together.

818
01:25:10,268 --> 01:25:11,928
Your turn.

819
01:25:12,038 --> 01:25:14,008
Thanks for washing my hair.

820
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,249
I work alone.

821
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:49,981
Lucky for you I stopped by.

822
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:52,932
I could've taken care of him.

823
01:27:54,732 --> 01:27:56,862
But you didn't.

824
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:58,873
Give me the earring.

825
01:28:00,714 --> 01:28:04,734
Copy of a Makarov 59. Standard issue, Chinese Army.

826
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,905
Looks like General Chang wants you dead.

827
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:10,175
You still think you can do this alone?

828
01:28:10,256 --> 01:28:13,716
It depends whether your mission is peace or revenge.

829
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:16,226
This is about stopping a war.

830
01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:24,328
Last year we found stealth material was missing...

831
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:26,669
from one of General Chang's bases.

832
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:29,209
I followed a lead to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

833
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,870
Stealth material?

834
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:32,910
We thought he was building a stealth plane.

835
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:37,041
No. Stealth boat.

836
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:39,141
That's the only way they could get close to the Devonshire...

837
01:28:39,262 --> 01:28:41,592
so they could drill inside the missile room.

838
01:28:41,662 --> 01:28:45,462
Remember? They stole a cruise missile from that ship.

839
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:48,433
He said he was moving the timetable forward to midnight.

840
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:50,564
Yes, of course he did.

841
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:52,904
Under cover of darkness he'll position the stealth boat...

842
01:28:52,975 --> 01:28:54,705
near the British fleet...

843
01:28:54,775 --> 01:28:57,405
fire the missile into China.

844
01:28:57,476 --> 01:29:01,386
- And we will retaliate. - And Carver will provide the pictures.

845
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:04,087
- I have to warn Beijing. - No.

846
01:29:04,157 --> 01:29:06,647
Let's warn both our governments, get them talking.

847
01:29:06,728 --> 01:29:08,558
It'll give us time to find the boat.

848
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:09,618
Stand up.

849
01:29:31,223 --> 01:29:33,243
Hmm. It's just like home.

850
01:29:33,323 --> 01:29:35,753
You get the equipment, I'll send the messages.

851
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:42,965
On second thought...

852
01:29:43,035 --> 01:29:44,295
you type.

853
01:29:45,366 --> 01:29:47,066
First we find the boat.

854
01:29:48,706 --> 01:29:51,436
Of all the harbors and inlets controlled by General Chang...

855
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:55,347
22 are in highly populated areas.

856
01:29:55,418 --> 01:29:58,048
That leaves 14 where he could hide a stealth boat.

857
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:00,048
You can see it during the day.

858
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:02,559
It's invisible to radar, but not the human eye.

859
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:06,890
Very novel.

860
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,990
He'd have to hide it someplace...

861
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,401
where he could sail to the Devonshire and back in one night.

862
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:15,332
This looks familiar.

863
01:30:15,442 --> 01:30:17,342
We've made some improvements.

864
01:30:18,143 --> 01:30:19,203
Have you, indeed?

865
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:23,513
Okay. Four hours out and four hours back.

866
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:27,644
Let's assume the boat is traveling at a speed of 30 knots.

867
01:30:29,895 --> 01:30:33,055
I've always been a fan of Chinese technology.

868
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:35,896
According to this...

869
01:30:35,966 --> 01:30:38,656
there are four places where he could harbor the boat.

870
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:40,597
Up on your left.

871
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:45,768
Run a cross check on those areas for anything suspicious.

872
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,880
Ah, the new Walther.

873
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,050
I asked Q for one of these.

874
01:31:09,903 --> 01:31:12,303
I've got it. Look.

875
01:31:13,544 --> 01:31:16,274
Four missing boats. Three unexplained drownings.

876
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:17,605
That has to be it.

877
01:31:19,686 --> 01:31:21,616
Ha Long Bay.

878
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:39,909
He knows the island.

879
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:43,840
He says that it's dangerous for boats to be around there at sunset...

880
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:47,011
but for 5,000 American dollars...

881
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:48,521
he'll take us.

882
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:49,782
Good.

883
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:51,792
Maybe he'll take a check.

884
01:32:06,775 --> 01:32:09,205
It's mostly dull routine, of course...

885
01:32:09,276 --> 01:32:13,216
but every now and then you get to sail on a beautiful evening like this...

886
01:32:13,287 --> 01:32:17,687
and sometimes work with a decadent agent of a corrupt Western power.

887
01:32:17,758 --> 01:32:20,318
And they say Communists don't know how to have fun.

888
01:32:21,188 --> 01:32:23,178
I hate to disappoint you...

889
01:32:23,259 --> 01:32:25,729
but I don't even have a little red book.

890
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:31,200
If anything happens to me...

891
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,741
the fuses for the mines are in here.

892
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,972
We're gonna finish this together.

893
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:42,012
And if I may say so, you found the right...

894
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:45,543
decadent, corrupt Western agent...

895
01:32:45,624 --> 01:32:47,554
as a partner.

896
01:33:07,618 --> 01:33:09,738
- See the stealth? - No.

897
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:13,449
It's getting late and this is the last cove in the bay.

898
01:33:21,801 --> 01:33:23,731
Yeah, that's it.

899
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:54,568
Set the timers for ten minutes.

900
01:33:54,638 --> 01:33:57,628
That'll give us time to get out of here before the ship explodes.

901
01:33:57,709 --> 01:34:00,409
Even if it doesn't sink, it'll show up on radar.

902
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:03,409
- Our fleets will finish the job. - If they got our message.

903
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,420
- Okay, you, up and over. - Okay.

904
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:24,274
We're in position between the fleets.

905
01:34:24,344 --> 01:34:28,474
Fire one missile at the flagship of each fleet.

906
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:32,445
The Chinese will think the British are rattling the saber...

907
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:36,216
the British will think the Chinese are being belligerent...

908
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:40,227
and the media will provide cool, objective coverage.

909
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:44,528
Let the mayhem begin.

910
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:54,510


911
01:34:54,711 --> 01:34:56,011
Missile lock-on.

912
01:34:56,081 --> 01:35:00,411
Send a signal to the Admiralty: "Task group under missile attack. "

913
01:35:02,122 --> 01:35:05,422
Sir, AWACS reports two waves of land-based MIG 21s inbound.

914
01:35:05,493 --> 01:35:08,183
The first group should be on our screens in two minutes.

915
01:35:08,264 --> 01:35:12,494
How long before the MiGs are within firing range of the British fleet?

916
01:35:12,564 --> 01:35:13,654
Twelve minutes.

917
01:35:15,205 --> 01:35:17,695
What the hell do I pay you for?

918
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:23,606
If she's there, Bond is there.

919
01:35:23,677 --> 01:35:25,237
Stamper, find them.

920
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:33,848
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

921
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:45,041
If she blinks, kill her.

922
01:35:45,101 --> 01:35:46,971
You come with me.

923
01:36:32,891 --> 01:36:36,191
Stamper to Bridge. Bond is dead.

924
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:37,662
Delicious.

925
01:36:37,732 --> 01:36:41,132
Make sure you clear all the mines, and bring the girl up to me.

926
01:36:46,544 --> 01:36:48,674
Are you sure you want her up here?

927
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:51,485
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

928
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:53,385
I like an audience.

929
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:01,797
Ah, Miss Lin.

930
01:37:01,897 --> 01:37:04,627
Your countrymen are being so cooperative...

931
01:37:04,698 --> 01:37:07,138
so predictably eager to save face.

932
01:37:07,209 --> 01:37:10,499
My government knows you're out here. They're looking for you.

933
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,379
Not according to our radar...

934
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:17,850
where it seems your MiGs are about to attack the British fleet...

935
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:19,581
in how many minutes?

936
01:37:19,651 --> 01:37:20,911
Nine minutes to firing range.

937
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:24,421
And even if they were looking for me...

938
01:37:24,492 --> 01:37:26,052
we're on a stealth boat.

939
01:37:27,493 --> 01:37:30,723
They can't see me, or you...

940
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:32,233
or even your friend...

941
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:33,764
the late Commander Bond...

942
01:37:33,834 --> 01:37:38,464
who is at this moment on his way to the bottom of the South China Sea.

943
01:37:39,545 --> 01:37:41,515
He's my new anchorman.

944
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:55,518
Pathetic.

945
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:02,030
What on earth's going on?

946
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,540
A message from 007...

947
01:38:04,611 --> 01:38:07,541
just confirmed by my opposite number in China.

948
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:11,911
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship that's almost invisible to radar. "

949
01:38:12,782 --> 01:38:14,412
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

950
01:38:14,483 --> 01:38:17,923
Carver's been playing both sides for fools.

951
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:22,964
Admiral, sir, urgent message from the Admiralty.

952
01:38:25,295 --> 01:38:26,625
Look at this.

953
01:38:28,706 --> 01:38:32,536
Anything on radar that looks very small? Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

954
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:36,076
- No, sir. - Stealth boat, sir? They have gone mad.

955
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,019
What you're about to witness, Miss Lin, is not so much a missile attack...

956
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,080
but the launch of a new world order.

957
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,430
In five minutes, after your countrymen have attacked the British fleet...

958
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:58,201
I shall retaliate for dear old England...

959
01:38:58,272 --> 01:39:01,102
by sending this missile into Beijing...

960
01:39:01,172 --> 01:39:04,612
where General Chang has just called an emergency meeting...

961
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:06,843
of the Chinese high command.

962
01:39:06,914 --> 01:39:08,504
Unfortunately...

963
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:13,144
General Chang will be delayed in traffic...

964
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:18,026
arriving just after the missile has killed your leaders...

965
01:39:18,096 --> 01:39:22,496
and too late to stop the air force from sinking the entire British fleet.

966
01:39:24,237 --> 01:39:28,367
But he will be just in time to take over the government, negotiate a truce...

967
01:39:28,438 --> 01:39:31,168
and emerge as a world leader...

968
01:39:31,249 --> 01:39:33,809
with a Nobel Peace Prize.

969
01:39:33,879 --> 01:39:36,079
- And what do you get? - Me?

970
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,890
Oh, nothing.

971
01:39:40,521 --> 01:39:44,581
Just exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next hundred years.

972
01:39:47,032 --> 01:39:48,962
Ready to rock and ruin.

973
01:39:50,003 --> 01:39:53,533
If you'll excuse me, my dear, I have something of a deadline to meet.

974
01:39:53,603 --> 01:39:55,163
Prepare for the missile launch.

975
01:39:58,845 --> 01:40:00,105
Mr. Gupta.

976
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:02,545
Hello, Elliot.

977
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:04,915
Interesting plan.

978
01:40:04,986 --> 01:40:07,456
But I think I have something of yours.

979
01:40:07,526 --> 01:40:10,756
So much for German efficiency. Mr. Stamper.

980
01:40:19,969 --> 01:40:22,339
- Don't shoot him yet. - Hold your fire.

981
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,710
Welcome to my world crisis, Mr. Bond.

982
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:28,471
Even trade, Elliot.

983
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:30,411
Gupta for Wai Lin.

984
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:33,111
You can't fire the missile without him.

985
01:40:33,182 --> 01:40:36,812
And it seems you can't resist any woman in my possession.

986
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:40,423
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

987
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,663
I told you we're going to finish this together.

988
01:40:43,734 --> 01:40:45,724
Oh, how romantic.

989
01:40:47,235 --> 01:40:49,895
Do you realize how absurd your position is?

990
01:40:50,005 --> 01:40:52,665
No more absurd than starting a war for ratings.

991
01:40:52,776 --> 01:40:57,717
Great men have always manipulated the media to save the world.

992
01:40:57,817 --> 01:41:00,447
Look at William Randolph Hearst, who told his photographers...

993
01:41:00,518 --> 01:41:04,618
"You provide the pictures, I'll provide the war. "

994
01:41:04,688 --> 01:41:06,918
I've just taken it one step further.

995
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:11,960
Sorry about that.

996
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:15,490
I tuned out there for a moment, Elliot.

997
01:41:15,571 --> 01:41:17,371
Touch?

998
01:41:18,371 --> 01:41:19,601
Mr. Gupta...

999
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:21,442
is the missile ready to fire?

1000
01:41:21,512 --> 01:41:23,942
Press the magic button, Beijing disappears.

1001
01:41:25,153 --> 01:41:28,143
Then it seems you've outlived your contract.

1002
01:41:30,594 --> 01:41:33,554
You see, Mr. Bond, I have a backup plan.

1003
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:35,454
Uh-huh. So do I.

1004
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:02,520
He's breached the hull. They'll see us on radar.

1005
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:06,191
Sir, we have a small, intermittent contact on the surface.

1006
01:42:06,261 --> 01:42:09,101
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

1007
01:42:09,172 --> 01:42:13,332
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

1008
01:42:13,403 --> 01:42:17,573
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

1009
01:42:17,644 --> 01:42:20,344
Send the message to the Chinese fleet commander:

1010
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:21,904
"Have sighted unknown ship... "

1011
01:42:21,985 --> 01:42:24,855
Get those fires out!

1012
01:42:24,925 --> 01:42:27,015
Get down there and protect the missile.

1013
01:42:27,096 --> 01:42:31,616
Oh, and Mr. Stamper, would you please kill those bastards?

1014
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,310
Nice work.

1015
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:55,711
They're speeding up.

1016
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:58,952
- We have to stop the boat. - Can you take care of the engine room?

1017
01:42:59,032 --> 01:43:01,552
- Of course. - Good. Do it and get off the ship.

1018
01:43:03,433 --> 01:43:05,373
I'm going to stop the missile.

1019
01:43:15,486 --> 01:43:17,416
Signal from the Chinese fleet commander.

1020
01:43:19,087 --> 01:43:21,017
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

1021
01:43:21,087 --> 01:43:23,987
We also have the unknown ship on our screens.

1022
01:43:24,058 --> 01:43:27,158
We will not fire unless it turns toward China.

1023
01:43:27,228 --> 01:43:29,028
Until then, she's yours. "

1024
01:43:29,099 --> 01:43:32,429
Now, Captain, whatever the hell that thing is, sink it.

1025
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:35,959
Right, sir. Is that echo too weak for missile lock?

1026
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:37,370
- Yes, sir. - Right.

1027
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,500
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

1028
01:43:46,622 --> 01:43:49,182
Bond turned us into the target.

1029
01:43:49,253 --> 01:43:51,223
Along with himself.

1030
01:43:51,293 --> 01:43:53,923
Take evasive action.

1031
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:56,324
Prepare the missile countdown immediately.

1032
01:43:56,394 --> 01:44:00,964
Initializing launch sequence. "T" minus five minutes and counting.

1033
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:04,525
"T" minus five minutes and counting.

1034
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,736
Uh, sir, they're making 48 knots.

1035
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:09,367
They'll be out of range in two minutes.

1036
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:11,507
Keep firing. Slow them down.

1037
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,451
The engines are out. We're sitting ducks here. Engine room.

1038
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,680
Follow me!

1039
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:51,330
"T" minus four minutes and counting.

1040
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,760
Well done. Officer Watch, increase max.

1041
01:47:38,531 --> 01:47:39,731
Keep firing!

1042
01:47:41,902 --> 01:47:43,562
All hands, abandon ship.

1043
01:47:43,642 --> 01:47:45,302
Abandon ship.

1044
01:48:09,568 --> 01:48:12,978
Mr. Stamper, what are you doing about the girl?

1045
01:48:13,038 --> 01:48:16,478
Perhaps you'd consider looking in the engine room.

1046
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:23,480
"T" minus three minutes and counting.

1047
01:49:16,152 --> 01:49:19,052
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

1048
01:49:19,952 --> 01:49:22,512
It's a bad habit of yours.

1049
01:49:22,593 --> 01:49:24,463
There's nothing you can do.

1050
01:49:32,475 --> 01:49:36,375
"T" minus two minutes and counting.

1051
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:38,606
The missile's fully programmed.

1052
01:49:38,676 --> 01:49:40,806
It can't be stopped.

1053
01:49:40,887 --> 01:49:43,047
In minutes my plan will succeed.

1054
01:49:44,988 --> 01:49:47,048
Thanks largely to your efforts...

1055
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:49,518
the British Navy will destroy the evidence...

1056
01:49:49,589 --> 01:49:52,929
and I'll be out of here in a Carver news helicopter...

1057
01:49:52,999 --> 01:49:54,619
covering the event.

1058
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,960
It's going to be a fantastic show.

1059
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:00,970
I may have some breaking news for you, Elliot.

1060
01:50:06,712 --> 01:50:10,272
You forgot the first rule of mass media, Elliot...

1061
01:50:13,084 --> 01:50:15,024
Give the people what they want.

1062
01:50:29,607 --> 01:50:32,547
"T" minus one minute and counting.

1063
01:50:46,831 --> 01:50:48,451
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

1064
01:50:48,531 --> 01:50:50,161
or I drop your friend.

1065
01:50:51,332 --> 01:50:53,562
It's over, Stamper.

1066
01:50:53,672 --> 01:50:55,292
Let her go.

1067
01:50:55,402 --> 01:50:56,932
Not between you and me.

1068
01:50:58,913 --> 01:51:02,573
James, try the detonators. The missile will set them off.

1069
01:51:02,644 --> 01:51:05,814
Never argue with a woman. They're always right.

1070
01:51:20,568 --> 01:51:23,668
"T" minus 40 seconds.

1071
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,670
For Carver!

1072
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:36,451
And Kaufman!

1073
01:51:46,663 --> 01:51:49,293
I owe you an unpleasant death, Mr. Bond.

1074
01:52:33,023 --> 01:52:35,993
"T" minus 20 seconds.

1075
01:52:38,934 --> 01:52:41,124
We die together, Mr. Bond.

1076
01:52:55,288 --> 01:52:58,308
"T" minus ten seconds.

1077
01:53:19,143 --> 01:53:20,703
Three...

1078
01:53:20,783 --> 01:53:23,343
two... one...

1079
01:54:16,915 --> 01:54:19,855
M, Bedford reports Carver went down with the ship.

1080
01:54:19,915 --> 01:54:21,855
Seems that Bond made it.

1081
01:54:24,056 --> 01:54:26,086
Moneypenny, take this release.

1082
01:54:26,157 --> 01:54:28,597
Elliot Carver is missing, presumed drowned...

1083
01:54:28,667 --> 01:54:33,428
while on a cruise aboard his luxury yacht in the South China Sea.

1084
01:54:34,609 --> 01:54:37,539
At present the local authorities believe...

1085
01:54:37,609 --> 01:54:40,039
the media mogul committed suicide.

1086
01:54:50,152 --> 01:54:52,092
Commander Bond...

1087
01:54:53,022 --> 01:54:54,892
Colonel Lin...

1088
01:54:54,963 --> 01:54:57,363
this is the H.M.S. Bedford.

1089
01:54:59,104 --> 01:55:01,034
Are you there?

1090
01:55:03,675 --> 01:55:06,105
They're looking for us, James.

1091
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:10,366
Let's stay under cover.

1092
01:55:22,585 --> 01:55:26,545
