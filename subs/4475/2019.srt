00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,141
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I never have the guts to tell my mom.{\r}

445
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:44,061
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Come on boss. Let the girls get some sleep. You and I keep watching.{\r}

446
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:47,200
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Both of us?{\r}

447
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:51,174
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}If they're trying that light stuff, We got each other back.{\r}

448
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,061
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I hate LA.{\r}

449
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:48,097
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I haven't seen a soul all night.{\r}

450
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:53,033
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Maybe the worse is over.{\r}

451
00:52:54,707 --> 00:52:56,265
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Maybe not.{\r}

452
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:01,411
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What do you think these things really are?{\r}

453
00:53:01,747 --> 00:53:03,612
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I don't know.{\r}

454
00:53:04,717 --> 00:53:06,844
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Is that even matter?{\r}

455
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:13,817
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}It's just doesn't seem real.{\r}

456
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:19,565
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Well it is real.{\r}

457
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:21,533
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}You better wake up.{\r}

458
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:25,805
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What's that suppose to mean?{\r}

459
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:28,474
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}This city hasn't a blink of life.{\r}

460
00:53:28,474 --> 00:53:30,806
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We need to survive.{\r}

461
00:53:32,912 --> 00:53:35,244
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}There is gonna be not many of us live.{\r}

462
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:57,796
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What do you see?{\r}

463
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:04,408
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Somebody is fighting back.{\r}

464
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:10,111
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}- What are you doing? - I want to see what's out there.{\r}

465
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:24,330
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Turn that off!{\r}

466
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,456
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}It's too bright!{\r}

467
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:27,658
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}No! - We can't risk it!{\r}

468
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:31,699
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Oh my god.{\r}

469
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,599


470
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:29,292
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Did you sleep at all?{\r}

471
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:36,335
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Was it getting worst?{\r}

472
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:38,032
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What?{\r}

473
00:55:38,137 --> 00:55:39,604
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}The marks on your skin.{\r}

474
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:45,944
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}You know when I looked to the light, I couldn't stand for 10 minutes.{\r}

475
00:55:46,078 --> 00:55:48,046
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Who knows what it did to us.{\r}

476
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:54,652
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}To our bodies.{\r}

477
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:06,657
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}You remember the first moment when you saw it?{\r}

478
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,791
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}When it completely took over.{\r}

479
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:12,500
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}It's kind of uh, use to feel...{\r}

480
00:56:17,343 --> 00:56:18,970
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}...down to the floor.{\r}

481
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:27,283
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}And I still do.{\r}

482
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:46,389
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Why don't you take a seat, relax.{\r}

483
00:57:57,977 --> 00:58:00,241
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Alright, I'll bite.{\r}

484
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:04,883
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What's your plan boss? Because I know you're dying to tell me.{\r}

485
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:09,650
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Nothing to say?{\r}

486
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:11,957
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We are sitting on the marina, for Christ sake.{\r}

487
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:13,325
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Yes, I notice that.{\r}

488
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:15,327
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}And there are hundreds of boats right across the street.{\r}

489
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:16,962
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We've been through all this.{\r}

490
00:58:16,962 --> 00:58:19,487
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Remind us how we've failed that last time.{\r}

491
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:27,239
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We go quietly this time.{\r}

492
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,037
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}And search every boat until we find the key?{\r}

493
00:58:30,242 --> 00:58:31,903
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}If we have to...{\r}

494
00:58:31,977 --> 00:58:33,913
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Great plan, Jarrod.{\r}

495
00:58:33,913 --> 00:58:37,616
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I can't believe you even suggested that after what happened.{\r}

496
00:58:37,616 --> 00:58:39,584
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}It wasn't my fault.{\r}

497
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:42,643
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I was frenetically begging...{\r}

498
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:45,386
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}...but you wouldn't listen.{\r}

499
00:58:45,558 --> 00:58:49,221
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}And you think Terry would've listened to me?{\r}

500
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:52,391
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}All right...{\r}

501
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:58,370
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Let say we make it out of the building.{\r}

502
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:00,971
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Accros the marina, down the dock{\r}

503
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:03,705
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}we even find a boat, and everything never mind...{\r}

504
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:07,213
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}- And then we get out the hell of here. - Where to?{\r}

505
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:08,914
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Carolina, down the Coast?{\r}

506
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:11,517
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}- Anywhere is better than here! - How do you know?{\r}

507
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:13,485
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We are here!{\r}

508
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,351
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We are alive!{\r}

509
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:19,988
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What was that?{\r}

510
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:23,419
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What do you see?{\r}

511
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:31,661

515
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:39,420

516
01:02:45,264 --> 01:02:48,062
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}I can not believe it! Is it over?{\r}

517
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:50,231
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}It worked.{\r}

518
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:52,063
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}May I?{\r}

519
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:54,572

520
01:03:03,215 --> 01:03:05,706
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}You think there are more planes where they came from?{\r}

521
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:07,343
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Yes.{\r}

522
01:03:08,153 --> 01:03:09,586
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Now they know what to do.{\r}

523
01:03:10,255 --> 01:03:12,018
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}They will be sending help at no time.{\r}

524

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What?{\r}

529
01:04:14,753 --> 01:04:17,017
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We have to cover these windows.{\r}

535
01:04:42,014 --> 01:04:43,641
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Something you can't!{\r}

536

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}What's this really about huh??{\r}

537
01:04:54,126 --> 01:04:56,856
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}These things are coming for us.{\r}

538
01:04:57,529 --> 01:05:00,623
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}You think that I haven't notice that mess under your shirt.{\r}

539
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,592
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We will stay here, and hold up, for good!{\r}

540

542
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,700
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}We have no water. No power.{\r}

543
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,405
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Yeah, but you saw what's out there.{\r}

544
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:15,314
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Yeah.{\r}

545
01:05:15,314 --> 01:05:17,516
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}And I will rather make a run for it...{\r}

546
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:19,151
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}...than stay in a 20 storey building.{\r}

547
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:21,520
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}Between those things and the radiation{\r}

550
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,508

551
01:05:43,508 --> 01:05:46,478
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&HFF8000&}- To hell everything you know! - You've been saying to wait for help.{\r}
