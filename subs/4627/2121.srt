60
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:30,212
朋友们,今晚的雨真是大

61
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,832
<i>it really is that wet.</i>

62
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:34,117
虽然雄马队以十比十七落后
Vern, even though the stallions traii 17-10...

63
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:38,574
有个人的脚步仍很轻松
there walks a happy man, Sheldon marcone, owner of the I.A. stallions.

64
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,348

<i>- Let's go to them. - 29,256.</i>

69
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,364
4万九千余人…

70
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:50,386
以今晚的重要性而言 球迷进场人数似乎蛮少的
That's pretty poor attendance, wouldn't you say?

71
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,543
你怎么说? 我不予置评,休恩
I wouldn't say.

72
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,382
你能解释下,球迷减少 及收视率降低的原因?
Explain the attendance and TV ratings drop-off.

73
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,854
是否职业橄榄球面临绝境?
Is pro football dying?

74
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:01,354
不,我认为是 好的橄榄球报导正面临绝境
No, it's good journalism that's dying, Lynn.

75
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,659
马康先生 这场球赛有任何英雄吗?

似乎是洛杉矶队的最后机会

84
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,971
雄马队要赢七分 靠踢球绝得不到
I.A. needs 7. A field goai will not do.

85
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:21,087
迪克一定在想：
<i>You've got to be thinking: "Get the ball to Billy Cole. ".</i>

86
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,780
要如何把球传给柯尔

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,056
丢

88
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:46,968

Ain't life a bitch?

91
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,567
这人醉死了
Dude's trashed.

00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:35,042

96
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,566
来,拿走他的表
Go on. Take his watch.

97
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:42,816
他有枪
He's got a gun!

98
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:19,385

I think I fucked a squirrei to death.

108
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,080
听着,乔 你仍靠救济金过活吗?
You still taking charity?

109
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:43,555
你有什么工作? 是个舞女,不对
<i>- What do you got? - Stripper. Excuse me, exotic dancer.</i>

110
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:47,703
该说是个脱衣舞娘 某个怪胎缠住她了
<i>Some weirdo's hassling her and I'm booked solid. She's hot.</i>

111
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,252
她想找人监护她 但我早已排满

112
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,124
她很火热哦,乔 我给她三颗星…

Rates 3 on my finger scale.

114
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:54,061
如果我能跟她上床…
<i>I'd cut off 3 fingers if God would let me fuck her.</i>

115
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,428
砍下我三支指头,我都愿意

116
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:58,106
单凭你那个爱闻骚味的鼻子 我想她会满意吗?
Make her a one on your nose scale. Improve your looks.

117
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,330

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,157
嘿,乔

149
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,477
我以为你还在拉斯维加斯
I thought you were in Las Vegas.

150
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,391
本来是
I was.

151
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,439
你昨晚睡那?
Where'd you sleep?

152
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,136
办公室
The office.

153
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:50,634
嘿,毛茸茸
Furry tom.

154
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,698
你输了多少钱?
How much you lose?

155
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
我没有去赌钱
I wasn't there to gamble.

156
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,095
多少?
How much?

157
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:00,378
我只是打发跟踪时光
I was doing a skip trace.

158
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,431
五十元
50 bucks.

159
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,551
这是什么?
What is this?

160
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,403
圣诞老人,黛莲画的
Darian drew a holiday picture.

161
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,893
很显然地,她的老师想见我们
Obviously, her teacher wants to see us.

162
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,239
她在那里?
Where is she?

163
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,289
在朋友家
Slept at a friend's.

164
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,965
孩子们仍在笑她的牙套吗?
Boys giving her a hard time about the braces?

165
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:29,339
你在说笑吗?
Are you kidding? "Metai mouth" is the latest.

166
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,371
她的最新绰号是“钢牙”
Little bastards.

167
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,380
小杂种

168
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,537
她14岁时 就会让他们销魂了
She'll be screwing them when she's 14.

169
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,164
小心你的狗嘴,乔
Watch your mouth.

170
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:40,474
别来了 你让她化那么漂亮的妆…
You let her wear so much makeup she looks...

171
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,628
她简直像支沅熊

172
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,366
like a goddamn raccoon.

173
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:45,924
我回到家里 还以为有贼儿上门
I thought she was a burglar. I almost shot her twice.

174
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,277
差点两度射杀她

175
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,343
你的话并不好笑 每个女孩子都化妆上学
You're not funny. Girls wear makeup.

176
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:54,335
我知道,但不是个个都用喷漆啊
I'm sure they don't put it on with a paint sprayer.

177
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:58,421
告诉你吧…
For your information, a lot of people think I'm very funny.

178
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,932
很多人都认为我很风趣

179
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,225
那你去跟他们住吧
Go live with them.

180
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,312
别考验我
Don't tempt me.

181
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,938
衣柜内的男人是谁?
Who's the guy in the closet?

182
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:29,242
什么?
Excuse me?

183
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:31,946
有时,你忘了我是名侦探
You forget I'm a detective.

184
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:36,848
浴室内有蒸汽
There's all this steam in the shower.

185
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:41,542
但你的头发是干的 所以当然别有他人
Only your hair is dry. So it must be somebody else.

186
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,040
且是男的 因为马桶盖掀起来了
A male. The toilet seat's up.

187
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:47,008
床底没人 你一定把他藏在衣柜内
Since he's not under the bed...

188
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,262
因为你听到我的熄火声
I figure you must have stuck him in the closet.

189
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,472
那么…

190
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,752
究竟衣柜里的男人是谁?
Who's in the closet?

191
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,989
老天啊,一切没变
Jesus Christ, nothing changes.

192
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,086
你仍然像个疯子
You're still a lunatic.

193
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,346
要告诉我他是谁吗?
Will you tell me who?

194
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,134
你要我打开衣柜吗?乔
Shall I open the closet?

195
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,568
我会的
I'll do it. Then we'll both know you're psycho!

196
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:08,456
然后我们彼此知道

197
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:12,353
你是个大疯子 这就是你要的吗?

198
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,753
Is that what you want?

199
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,500
不是
Thank you.

200
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,296
谢谢

201
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,569
衣柜门仍是关上的
That door stays shut.

202
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,022
我要做的是数到三
What I'm going to do...

203
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,099
is count to 3.

204
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:26,369
然后我要向那扇门开枪
Then I'll put a bullet in that door.

205
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:30,072
只要你说出真相 随时我都可罢手
You can stop me by telling the truth.

206
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,750
1… 打电话给你心理医生
Call your shrink and tell him you're losing it.

207
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,855
告诉他你疯了

208
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,271
真相是件很美好的事
The truth is a beautifui thing.

209
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,086
2… 你怎敢在这里放肆
How dare you come into this house and-

210
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:44,884
并且开枪…不要 3…

211
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
听着,乔 替我暖床吗?麦可
- look, Joe- - Keeping her warm for me?

212
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,162
别紧张,别做傻事
Easy. Don't do nothing dumb.

213
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,074
她表现如何?
How was she?

214
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,257
你给我的老婆几分?
On your scale, how was my wife?

215
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:04,392
它就自然发生了,乔
It just happened.

216
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,404
当然,当然,我了解 它就自然发生了
Sure, I know.

217
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:08,882
It just happened.

218
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:12,068
它还可能发生在任何人身上
It could happen to anybody.

219
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:13,732
是个意外,对吗? 你在地板上翻来滚去
An accident.

220
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:18,279
然后不小心地把你的宝贝送上
You tripped and accidentally stuck your dick in my wife.

221
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
我真是抱歉,奸夫淫妇
"I'm so sorry, Mrs. h. I guess this just isn't my week."

222
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:25,787
我想本周不是我的幸运周

223
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,495
乔,请放下枪
Put the gun down.

224
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,577
哦,对了,枪
The gun.

225
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,170
是的,莎拉, 我想你说的没错
You're right.

226
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,861
我是疯了
I think I am losing it.

227
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,451
滚开
Get out of here.

228
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,926
头还是肚子,麦可?
Head or gut, Mike?

229
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,666
乔, 我们做朋友多久了?
Joe, how long we been friends?

230
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,793
我会说,在你姘上我老婆前
Roughly till you started banging my wife.

231
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:01,443
头还是肚子?
Head or gut?

232
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:05,718
肚子吧
Gut.

233
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,692
有地址要给我吗?
Got that address for me?

234
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:13,709
那份监护工作
The surveillance job.

235
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:16,837
你仍要…那份工作?
You still want the job?

236
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,921
五百元就五百元吧,麦可
500 bucks is 500 bucks, Mike.

237
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:25,761
是啊…
I guess you're right.

238
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,844
你说的没错

239
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,140
柯莉…?
Throw a shot into her?

240
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,805
你跟她也有一手,对吧?

241
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:49,414
滚开,去你的地盘拉屎
Get the fuck out of here. Go shit in your own yard.

242
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,255
乔?
Joe!

243
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:20,789
我在这里
Over here.

244
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,612
有人在车上装了炸弹
Somebody wired the car.

245
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,639
哪个家伙干的, 乔?
Who the fuck did this?

246
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:56,149
罗杰斯先生,我怎会知道?
Mr. Rogers.

247
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,567
How the hell should I know?

248
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,090
你告诉警察…
You told the cops?

249
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,829
我告诉他们 麦可今早刚好经过
I told them Mike came by to farm out a surveillance job.

250
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,507
想找个人接手那件监护案
That's all?

251
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,804
就这样?

252
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,577
你没有提…
You didn't mention...

253
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,227
没有,我没有提
No. I didn't mention it.

254
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,087
你早知道,对不对?
You knew, didn't you?

255
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,116
我曾怀疑过 该死,你就不能说点什么吗
I suspected.

256
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,091
Why didn't you say something?

257
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,616
你要我说什么,莎拉?
Say what?

258
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,975
“你去死,莎拉”?
"Fuck you, Sarah"?

259
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,277
是的,或者任何能让你怒火上升的话
Anything to get a rise out of you.

260
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:35,191
你何不说：你这说谎的婊子
"You're a iying bitch, Sarah," or "I'll spit in your face."

261
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,527
或者说：如果没有条子在这 我早就在你脸上吐口水了

262
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,956
你想这样吗?
Want me to spit on you?

263
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:40,425
那表示你还有一点自尊
- It would show you had pride. - Fresh out, honey.

264
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,807
这倒鲜,甜心

265
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,570
干,乔,你从不在身旁
Fuck you, Joe. You're never around. I was lonely!

266
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:47,558
我很寂寞 买只狗呀!

267
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,383
Buy a dog.

268
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:51,253
我并不恨你,乔
I'm not the one who hates you. You're the one who hates you.

269
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:50,726
但你却恨你自己

270
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,696
而我得和自己一起24小时
And I get to live with myself 24 hours a day.

271
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,300
脱光衣服

272
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,240
一夜之欢,变换22种姿势

273
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,140
脱光衣服…

274
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:05,261
敬亚历士这位太空人
Alex, the astronaut.

275
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:06,667
脱光衣服  敬亚历士
The astronaut.

276
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:12,212
上一次看到你 灌下一瓶伏特加酒
Last time I saw you drink straight vodka was because you cheated on Cory.

277
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,941
是你欺骗柯莉时

278
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,719
是啊,再帮我倒一杯
Why don't you pour me another?

279
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:16,052
老兄…

280
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,255
你以前不是这样的
You didn't.

281
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:20,262
你一定疯了, 伙计,敢欺骗她
You got to be crazy, cheating on her.

282
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:24,787
我一定得弄点名堂
I got to be something, harp. Because all I do is lose friends...

283
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,169
因为我现在所做的 就是失去朋友,喝酒

284
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:27,754
并捕获任何有心跳的东西
drink and naii anything with a heartbeat.

285
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
就如坐在酒吧旁这种事, 是吗?
Just stay on that side of the bar.

286
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,439
哦,说出来吧 脱光衣服

287
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,100
让女人成为女人

288
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:37,375
让男人成为男人

289
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,468
脱光衣服…

290
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:46,835
我现在付你钱吗? 不用
Should I pay now?

291
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:49,537
你不用现在付钱, 把钱收起来
No, you should not. Put the money away.

292
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,733
坐下
Sit down.

293
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,220
所以…

294
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:01,597
你认为警方帮不了你
The cops can't help?

295
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,954
没错,我死了
Sure. After I'm dead, they'll do the autopsy.

296
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,354
他们只会帮我验尸

297
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,050
我想你不能等那么久
Guess you can't wait that long.

298
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,123
没错
Guess not.

299
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:14,817
这地方只奏这种音乐?
This the only music they play here?

300
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:16,974
我讨厌这种狗屎音乐
I hate this funk shit.

301
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,207
或许我该额外收费
I may charge extra.

302
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:20,756
你期望会放什么音乐?
What'd you expect?

303
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:23,335
“四个新鲜人”,“白潘”
The four freshmen.

304
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:24,772
你是谁呀?我老爸呀! 是啊,我是你爸
Pat Boone.

305
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,417
Are you my father?

306
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,047
多穿点衣服上去 你真有趣
I'm your father. Put some clothes on.

307
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,956
You're hilarious.

308
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,147
这种气氛下, 把你的头放在喇叭旁
Stand by that speaker. You'll scream...

309
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:38,408
当奏起“播放你的放克音乐” 你会尖叫的白男孩
"...play that funky music, white boy!"

310
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,262
我相信我会尖叫
The screaming I believe.

311
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:44,666
嗨,帅哥
Hello, handsome.

312
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:51,601
嗯…
Who's the stiff over there?

313
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,436
那边那个死鬼是谁?

314
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,279
无名小卒
That's nobody.

315
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,645
轮到我跳了,妈的
It's my turn to dance. Shit.

316
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,978
我很抱歉

317
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,483
好的,好的, 让我们来介绍一位女人
Let's bring out a woman who's always in the mood.

318
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,362
她永远心情绝佳

319
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:16,663
把你的双掌放在一起
Put your hands together for the lovely and talented miss Cory!

320
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,693
为这位可爱,才华扬溢的

321
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:17,093
柯莉小姐鼓掌吧

322
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,046
骑在牧场上

323
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,350
我戴着帽子

324
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,417
穿着靴子

325
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,408
满身尘土

326
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,400
我骑着马鞍…

327
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:46,366
你是无名小卒
You're nobody.

328
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,421
别告诉别人
Don't tell anyone.

329
00:22:48,907 --> 00:22:50,787
那是柯莉说的 柯莉说你是无名小卒
Cory says you're nobody.

330
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,930
放轻松点,小子 没人要扫你的兴
Nobody's raining on your parade. I'm keeping an eye on her.

331
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,371
我只是在监视柯莉

332
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,692
你是保镖之类的人物吗?
Are you some kind of bodyguard?

333
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,778
类似吧
Something like that.

334
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,605
有火吗?没有
Got a match?

335
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,338
柯莉有麻烦吗?
Is Cory in trouble?

336
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,407
我不知道,你说呢?
I don't know. You tell me.

337
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,285
她什么也没对我说
She didn't tell me.

338
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,863
所以你生气?
Does that piss you off?

339
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,960
也许吧
Maybe.

340
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,959
别担心
Don't sweat it.

341
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,512
女人都有秘密
Women have secrets.

342
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:22,202
就像水是湿的,天空是蓝的 女人有秘密是正常的
Water's wet, the sky's blue, women have secrets.

343
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:24,234
谁在乎?
Who gives a fuck?

344
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,980
要啤酒吗?
Want a beer?

345
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:33,452
她是查电话簿找到你的?
So she just hired you? What, you're in the book or something?

346
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:33,908
什么,你有列名在电话簿上

347
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,492
她请我的老友麦可帮她… 我只是来顶替他的
She hired my buddy, Mike. I'm filling in.

348
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:37,997
麦可人在哪?
Where's Mike?

349
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,217
他死了
He died.

350
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,074
我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

351
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,641
他是个浑蛋
He was an asshole.

352
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:48,089
听着,我不管你是谁 或是发生什么事
I don't know who you are or what's going on, but Cory's my giri.

353
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,153
但柯莉是我的女友

354
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,758
假如她惹上麻烦,我想知道
If she's in trouble, I want to know.

355
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:53,509
机密,大个子
Confidentiai, big boy.

356
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,815
不管怎样,告诉我
Why don't you tell me anyway?

357
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:58,448
不行
Nope.

358
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,374
你连一杯尿也保不住,老兄
Man, you couldn't protect a cup of warm piss.

359
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:09,252
你为何不上前打我?
Why don't you just hit me?

360
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:10,552
什么?
Excuse me?

361
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:16,054
来吧,胆小鬼
Chickenshit. Bust me in the chops. An old guy like me can't hurt you.

362
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,019
把我打的支离破碎呀!

363
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:18,019
像我这样的老头 伤不了你的,不是吗?吉米

364
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,621
看来你知我是谁了 吉米亚历山大迪克斯
You know who I am?

365
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,898

367
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:27,201
因赌博被逐出球队
Banned from the league for gambling.

368
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:29,764
又被控吸毒

369
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,910
又是一个 浪费青春的悲惨例子
Another tragic tale of wasted youth.

370
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,478
现在你可惹毛我了 是时候了

371

我是乔贺伦堡
It's about time.

372
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,080
Joe hallenbeck...

我是私家侦探 你是个下等人
private detective.

374
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,107
You're a lowlife.

375
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,017
至少我没去吸毒自毁前途
At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke.

376
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:01,828
我把我的尿弄倒了
Spilled my warm cup of piss.

377
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:05,548
柯莉,快来,我们走

378
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:05,319

379
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,823
吉米,闭嘴,别多管闲事
Shut up! Get in the cage.

380

388

就是他,他跟她一道

把他弄走,干掉他

合约中没载明他

391
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,390
那就免费做吧,到别处干

392

敬亚历士,小儿科医生

你来的不是时候 地点也不对
Wrong place, wrong time. Nothing personai.

405
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:39,942
又没有私人恩怨

406
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,993
那是你的想法
So you think. Last night I fucked your wife.

407
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,935
昨晚,我和你老婆上床

408
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,899
哦,真的吗?
You did? How did you know it was my wife?

409
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:47,040
你怎知道是我老婆

410
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:50,618
她说她老公一副老娼像 戴顶帽子
She said her husband looked like a pimp with a hat.

411
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:53,973
你真酷,一个吃子弹的人
You're cooi, for a guy about to take a bullet.

412
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,429
在干了你老婆后 我吃2颗子弹
After fucking your wife, I'll take 2.

413
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:02,726
来,告诉我
What's this about you getting me my old job back?

414
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:03,148
你要如何让我重回老本行?

415
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:04,882
他去哪里了?
Where the hell is he?

416
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:06,274
那侦探?
The detective?

417
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:08,701
你究竟有什么麻烦?
What kind of trouble you in?

418
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:12,453
麻烦?我没有惹任何麻烦
I'm not in trouble. Some creep's threatening me.

419
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,355
只是有人想恐吓我罢了

420
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,719
现在我们进去等乔贺伦伯吧
- Let's wait inside for hallenbeck. - What am I chopped liver?

421
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:16,268
我的心肝,你把我置于何处

422
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:20,044
贺伯伦是个游手好闲的人 他能做什么?
What's that bum going to do? Breathe on them?

423
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:20,796
点烟? 然后把烟吐在他们身上?

424
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:23,367
如果那个人出现, 我就打死他
If the creep shows up, I'll bitch-slap him.

425
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,133
来,我跟在你后面回家, 上车吧
I'll follow you home. Get in your car.

426
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,119
你会“打死他”?
You'ii "bitch-slap" him?

427
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:31,117
对,打死他

428
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:32,664

429
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,069
啊,讨厌

430
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:48,523
你想在那开个洞? 胸口?
Where you want it? In the chest? Or the head?

431
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,550
还是头?

432
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:50,201
你老婆也是这么说的
So said your wife.

433
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,098
嘿,别再提我老婆
Stop with the wife shit!

434
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:54,524
问问我,她有多肥
Ask me how fat she is.

435
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:55,756
狗杂种
Fuck you!

436
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:00,758
她有多胖?
How fat is she?

437
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,614
胖到我要她在面粉堆滚才找得到阴部
So fat I had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot.

438
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,976
你想和她做爱 还得打她的大腿,才能进去
To fuck her, you slap her thigh and ride the wave in.

439
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:10,341
说她胖吗?
I'm not saying she's fat.

440
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,728
她的高中毕业照 像是空中摄影
Her high schooi picture was an aeriai photograph.

441
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:23,113
你这狗杂种
You bastard!

442
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:24,573
And then some.

443
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,133
干!
Fuck!

444
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,650
柯莉,别下车
Don't get out.

445
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:06,614
你不懂驾车吗?
Can't you drive?

446
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:11,619
柯莉

447
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,080
柯莉

448
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,411
狗屎

449
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,756
快滚开这里
Let's get the fuck out of here!

450
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,060
狗屎

451
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:14,957
倒车…
Back up!

452
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,161
Back up.

453
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:03,818
皮裤?
Leather pants.

454
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,643
是啊

455
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:11,103
这种东西要多少钱?
What's something like that run?

456
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:12,951
六百五
650.

457
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:16,261
六百五十元?是的
650 dollars?

458
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:18,287
一条裤子?是的
They're pants?

459
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,358
你穿这么贵的裤子? 是的
You wear them?

460
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,927
裹面有电视吗?
They don't have a TV in them?

461
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,350
没有

462
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:30,643
我太落伍了
I am very old.

463
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,412
真臭
Something stinks in here.

464
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,915
我的天啊,是这份笔录
It's this statement. Hallenbeck's hiding something.

465
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,720
这份口供全是狗屎 贺伦伯一定在隐瞒什么

466
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:46,515
你怎知道?
How do you know?

467
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,020
我知这鬼家伙心里想什么
I know how his mind works! Every lie has 80%...

468
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:50,841
有个谎言总有八成真

469
00:32:50,532 --> 00:32:51,972
这才是令我害怕之处
truth to it. It's scary.

470
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:54,095
我们看到的是同一个人吗?
We looking at the same guy?

471
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,690
对呀 要不然你看到的是什么人
What are you looking at?

472
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:58,117
我看到的是个 穿衣服睡觉的人
I see a guy who slept in his clothes.

473
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,980
不,这只是外表
That's what everybody sees.

474
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:04,074
还有别的吗? 是呀,还有不少呢
- There's more? - A lot more.

475
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:07,583
很久前,这浑蛋救了总统
A long time ago, he saved the president's life.

476
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:15,715
柯莉说她被人骚扰
Her story about a weirdo hassling her was bullshit?

477
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:17,428
全是一派胡言吗?是吧

478
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:22,147
我不晓得她惹上什么麻烦
I don't know what she was into, but that was a professionai hit.

479
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:22,132
但今晚的一切确是职业手法

480
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:24,398
一副黑帮风格
Gangland style.

481
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:25,556
我想麦可为她工作

482
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:27,657
就像我现在一样 他被吓到了
I figure Mike was working for her, same as me.

483
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:29,152
非常怕
He got scared.

484
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,574
所以他立即脱身,拖我下水
Very scared.

485
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:32,952
我猜他脱身太迟了
Bails out, dumps it in my lap.

486
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,731
他被炸得粉身碎骨
He bailed too late.

487
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:38,045
They're scraping him off my stucco.

488
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:44,897
如果麦可明知危险
If Mike knew this was dangerous, why didn't he say anything to you?

489
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,484
为何他不明说 把这件事转交给你

490
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,201
他和我的太太有染
He was fucking my wife.

491
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:51,628
如果我死了 他就可接手我妻了
I die. He gets the wife.

492
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:01,101
可以走了
Free to go. Pick up your gun at the property desk.

493
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:01,232
到取物处取回你的枪

494
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,169
你花了一天时间
You took all day.

495
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,088
乔,我接到贝艾警署打来的电话

496
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:07,032
I got a call from the bei air p.D.

497
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:11,051
参议员一直接下流电话
Senator baynard has been getting obscene phone calls.

498
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,980
最好不是你
It better not be you.

499
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,715
还有什么事吗?警官 有的
Anything else, lieutenant?

500
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,734
有个新发明叫剃刀
There's a new invention out: The razor.

501
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:24,094
太危险了
Too risky. I might start thinking about you and slash my wrists.

502
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:25,182
一想到你 我可能会剃伤手腕

503
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:29,402
他和班纳有过节?
- He got a beef with baynard? - The senator got him fired.

504
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:29,150
他炒他鱿鱼

505
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:31,137
他曾是警探?
What was he, a cop?

506
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,624
秘密保镖?
Secret service?

507
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,044
而班纳曾炒你鱿鱼?
And baynard had you fired?

508
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,411
为什么?
How come?

509
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,431
不关你的事
None of your business.

510
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,236
你进来这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

511
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,781
我打掉他四颗牙齿
I knocked out 4 of his teeth.

512
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:16,477
你打球吗?你有好身材
Ever play ball? You got a good build.

513
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,030
你是同性恋?
You a fag?

514
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,092
不是, 我只是想把气氛弄好点
Just trying to break the ice.

515
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:23,017
我不喜欢,别烦我
I like ice. Leave it the fuck alone.

516
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:24,779
你应该很好相处的
You're fun to be with.

517
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,129
去你的
Fuck you.

518
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,230
下一步该怎么办?
So what's the next move, ace?

519
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:31,125
我要回家
I'm going home.

520
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,688
似乎我的工作已告一段落
It would seem my job is done.

521
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,293
干!你的工作已完成? 我们看着柯莉被杀
Fuck that. We saw Cory get murdered.

522
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,361
你要找死,请自便
You want your ass shot off, be my guest.

523
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,010
当你死后 我会接收你600元的裤子
You die, I take your $600 pants.

524
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:45,088
是650元
650.

525
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:51,112
你很面熟,我认识你吗?
You look familiar. Do I know you?

526
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,660
也许吧,很多人认识我
You might. People recognize me.

527
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:56,837
我想到了 你是打撞球的摩顿
"Cue ball" Morton! Sold hash in boyle heights.

528
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,292
而在鲍育高地卖过马铃薯

529
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,762
不对,我打橄榄球 名叫吉米,打过洛城雄马队
I played football. Jimmy dix, I.A. stallions.

530
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,930
什么位置?算了
- What position? - Forget it.

531
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,498
橄榄球,自由身球员 把这项好运动毁了
Football. Free agents ruined the goddamn game!

532
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:10,171
我们可能碰到更多你的球迷 想借我的墨镜吗?
We may run into more fans. Want my sunglasses?

533
00:36:10,558 --> 00:36:12,838
你去死吧 你也去死
- Fuck you. - Snappy comeback.

534
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:15,574
柯莉住哪儿?
Where did Cory live?

535
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:18,338
梅洛的哈伯公寓 怎么了?
Harper apartments, on Melrose. Why?

536
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,813
想去那四处看看
Think I'ii look around there.

537
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:22,553
很好,我跟你一道去
I'll come with you.

538
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:26,024
干
The fuck, you are. Have a nice night, junior.

539
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,929
去玩乐吧,小子

540
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:29,811
我知道她后备钥匙在那
- I know where the extra key is. - I won't need a key.

541
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,518
我用不着钥匙

542
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,646
我猜你不担心警戒系统吧
And you're not worried about the alarm.

543
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,721
最先进的,我自己装的
It's pretty high-tech. I put it in myself.

544
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:39,071
你可能知道 如何用计胜它,对吧
But you probably know how to circumvent.

545
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:40,847
用计胜它?  这字是生字
Circumvent?

546
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:42,375
你看书吗?
It's called vocabulary.

547
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:46,358
“流莺”志才刚登过这个
- Read much? - My subscription to "jugs" just ran out.

548
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,630
上车吧
Get in the car.

549
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,980
她怎能负担起这儿的房租
How did she afford this? It must run a fortune.

550
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,497
这儿很贵的

551
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,727
告诉你,是我付房租的
- Tell me about it. I pay the rent. - Isn't that charming.

552
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:03,350
多迷人的房子

553
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,769
她听起来蛮特别的
She sounds like a reai speciai giri.

554
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,446
你还付些什么钱?
What else you pay for? Clothes? Car?

555
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:08,827
衣服?车子

556
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:13,755
并不是你想的那样
It wasn't like that. Cory could've had rich guys. Me, she loved.

557
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,274
柯莉本可以和更多的 有钱人交往,但她爱我

558
00:37:14,176 --> 00:37:16,296
爱情,算了
Love? Forget about it then.

559
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:20,156
你不相信爱情?
- You don't believe in love. - I believe in love. And cancer.

560
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,920
不,我相信爱情 就像我相信癌症般

561
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:22,558
怎么?它们全是致命疾病
- Both diseases? - Something like that.

562
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,984
差不多

563
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:27,245
我想见见那位婊子 看看那是如何惹你发火
I want to meet the bitch that fucked you up.

564
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,536
你来现一下
Your show, ace.

565
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:41,744
警戒系统?
- Security system? - I circumvented it.

566
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,606
是的,我发明它
Don't touch anything. Don't leave a mess for the cops.

567
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:48,832
别碰任何东西 别给条子留下任何麻烦

568
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,610
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

569
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:53,878
你用吸尘器来吸 我会弄脏它
- You vacuum, I'll dust. - Stay put.

570
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,319
保持原样吧

571
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:57,146
去吧,泰山
Go, Tarzan.

572
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,955
吉米…和柯莉在一起的这个人是谁
Who's this guy with Cory?

573
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,543
谢利马康
Shelly marcone. Owns the I.A. stallions.

574
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,448
他是“雄马”队的老板

575
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,566
她和他交往一阵子
They dated. Treated her like shit. And she left.

576
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:49,281
但他待她极坏 她于是离开他

577
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:49,666
你去哪里? 浴室,你也要一起来
Where you going?

578
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,315
Bathroom. Want to come? Doc said I shouldn't lift anything heavy.

579
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:54,908
医生说 我不能举任何重的东西
I'll pass.

580
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:56,664
我不去

581
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,410
赌十比一, 他们一定是在找这东西
10 to 1, they were looking for this.

582
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:44,085
那是马康 我知道
- That's marcone. - Yeah, I know.

583
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:47,234
我不知道这是谁 班纳参议员
- I don't know who this is. - Senator baynard.

584
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,096
这两个浑蛋呢? 他的保镖
And the assholes with him?

585
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,199
他到那,都要人保护
His bodyguards. He always has protection.

586
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,329
电话帐单的影印本
Copy of a phone bill.

587
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,655
这是谁的电话
What's this number?

588
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,950
班纳家的
Baynard's home number.

589
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:00,964
你知道他家的电话?
You know his number?

590
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:05,133
是的,我打过几次电话给他
So I called him a couple times. Shut the fuck up.

591
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:07,444
别说出去

592
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,202
这一切有什么意义,乔?
What's all this?

593
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,344
我不晓得,小子
I don't know, junior. If we're lucky...

594
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:16,692
如果我们幸运的话
maybe enough blackmaii evidence to put two very powerfui men away.

595
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:13,696
或许手上足够的证据

596
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:17,555
可以把 加州二号大人物送进监牢

597
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:19,832
柯莉为什么要勒索他们?
Why would Cory blackmaii them?

598
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,984
你说她和马康上过床… 我说约会,没说他们上过床
- She was fucking marcone- - Dating, not fucking.

599
00:40:23,356 --> 00:40:26,356
不管怎样, 她听到或者到什么
Whatever. She heard or saw something. The point is-

600
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,094
想勒索他们 她雇用麦可…
- she was blackmailing them. - She hires Mike.

601
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:32,764
去抓他的小辫子,对吗?
She got evidence to use on them. Now we have the evidence.

602
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,507
没错, 如今我们握有证据

603
00:40:33,116 --> 00:40:36,396
小子,我们要对付的是 没人敢动他们的马康及班纳
We got marcone and baynard by the nuts.

604
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:39,628
这也是我之所以爱美国的原因
And that is why I love America.

605
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:43,977
喂?嗨,盖文
<i>- Hello? - Hey, Calvin?</i>

606
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:47,215
我是谢利马康
<i>Shelly marcone. How you doing this evening?</i>

607
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:49,912
是马康的声音,今晚如何?
<i>I'd prefer you didn't use my name.</i>

608
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:50,551
我希望你别提我的名字

609
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:53,195
神经过敏
<i>A trifle skittish. If I didn't know better...</i>

610
00:40:53,558 --> 00:40:56,758
盖文,假如我不了解你的话
<i>I'd say you were contemplating something shady.</i>

611
00:40:53,974 --> 00:40:57,591
我会以为你在耍什么阴谋

612
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:58,625
快点,快说重点吧
Get to the good stuff.

613
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,300
除非你让法案通过 我按快转
I'll fast-forward it.

614
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,529
别按快转,这会卡带子
Don't!

615
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,676
It eats the tape!

616
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,309
我那晓得? 它会卡带子
I'm supposed to know?

617
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:09,494
我们唯一的证据, 而你的烂车吃了它?
Your car ate our only evidence?

618
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:11,628
烂车 你最好闭嘴
- This car sucks. - Shut up!

619
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,380
如果它毁了,我就你揍死 这部烂车
If this is ruined, I'll crush your nuts.

620
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,331
看看这个
If this is ruined, I swear-

621
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:20,150
毁了

622
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,092
快转吃了带子
fast-forward eats the tape.

623
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:32,534
看来这就是我的生日礼物
My birthday present.

624
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:40,812
什么?
Cory was blackmailing marcone. But not for cash.

625
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
柯莉并不是为钱勒索马康

626
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:43,677
她只是想让我重回老本行
She was trying to get my job back.

627
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,914
她因我而丧命
She's dead because of me.

628
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:47,914
你去哪里
Where you going?

629
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,383
回家,我不舒服
Home. I don't feei too hot.

630
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,747
来,我送你
I'll take you.

631
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:54,743
我载你一程 不用
I'll give you a ride.

632
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,620
我开柯莉的车,我有钥匙
I'll take Cory's car. I got the key.

633
00:41:58,176 --> 00:42:00,656
她的车子不是在酒吧吗?
I thought that was Cory's car at the bar!

634
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,706
吉米?

635
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:15,165
她有两辆车
Cory had two cars.

636
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,866
快下车… 什么?
Get out of the car!

637
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,806
你搞什么鬼?你怎么了?
What's your trip?

638
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,939
这是什么?  C-4
- What is it? - C-4.

639
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,438
塑胶炸弹
Plastic explosive.

640
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,487
他们在麦可车上 装了个相同的
They wired the ignition to Mike's car. They'd do the same with hers.

641
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:47,738
幸好他们装错车
Lucky for you they wired the wrong car.

642
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,507
把这留给警察?
Leave this for the cops to analyze.

643
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,909
让他们去分析
You're putting that in the trunk?

644
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,467
你把它们放在行李箱?

645
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,839
难不成 要留给附近的孩子玩?
No, let's leave it for the neighborhood kids to play with.

646
00:42:56,452 --> 00:42:57,572
晚安,先生们
Good evening.

647
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,217
枪给我,贺伦伯
Where's the gun?

648
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:16,859
这么晚还出来晃?
- Bit late for a stroll. - You girls should get home.

649
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,427
你们这些女的早该回家了
Streetlights are on.

650
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:19,849
是啊,街灯还亮着呢
Shut up, fuckface.

651
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:21,465
闭嘴,丑八怪
I'm fuckface. He's asshole.

652
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:22,926
我是丑八怪,他是浑球

653
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:24,359
杰克

654
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,279
告诉他自以为风趣的下场
Apprise Rodney dangerfield here of his situation.

655
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:32,836
也许我们该正经点
We can dispense with the fun and games now.

656
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:36,243
你想要信封,对吗?
- You want the envelope, right? - Very smart.

657
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:39,744
信封,没错,你很聪明
Here's a man who knows when a situation is untenable.

658
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:40,536
这个人知道自己占不到便宜

659
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:40,927
说得好
Good word.

660
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:42,716
你喜欢?
You like it?

661
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,778
那你是有那信封了,对吧?
You do have that envelope?

662
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:50,141
我们最好放弃, 吉米
We better give up. We're dealing with geniuses.

663
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,031
这些人是天才

664
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:54,773
拜托,老兄,放过他
Leave him the fuck alone.

665
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:58,038
放过他?你算那根葱?
Leave him alone? Whatever you say.

666
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,160
杰克很努力地攻击
Jake attacks his job with a certain exuberance.

667
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:04,174
该死,我们被一些恶霸揍
We're beat up by the inventor of scrabble.

668
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,419
他仍不开心,再踢他
He's still happy, kick him again.

669
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:07,981
好了
All right!

670
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,441
你要那妓女的信封
You want the hooker's envelope?

671
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:12,671
她不是妓女 闭嘴
She wasn't a hooker.

672
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,119
Shut the fuck up!

673
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:15,587
在哪里?
Where is it?

674
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:18,591
在行李箱中
In the trunk.

675
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:20,754
给我钥匙
Give me the keys.

676
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,520
慢慢来
Slow and easy.

677
00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:25,933
把钥匙给杰克拿来
Give them to Jake.

678
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:34,003
笨蛋,你将会吃到苦头的
Dumb bastard, you'll pay for that.

679
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:36,624
杰克,打开行李箱
Open the trunk.

680
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:49,149
该死 快跑,快跑
Son of a bitch!

681
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:57,728
你还活着?
You alive?

682
00:44:58,138 --> 00:44:59,698
还不确定
I don't know yet.

683
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:02,295
是那炸弹?
Was that c-4?

684
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,555
难不成还是回收车的问题
That, or a hell of a factory recall.

685
00:45:05,897 --> 00:45:07,297
死人不会开这种笨玩笑的
Dead guys don't make bad jokes.

686
00:45:08,077 --> 00:45:09,510
没错

687
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,013
妈的,我们都没死
Shit, we're alive.

688
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:13,811
没错

689
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:16,293
你说的没错

690
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:19,932
快离开这,快走
Get out of here.

691
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:23,863
你确定?我来应付
I'll take the heat for this.

692
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,407
你确定吗?
You positive?

693
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,263
这是警方的事
This is a police matter!

694
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:36,912
你这笨蛋
And I'm sick and tired of sweeping up your dead bodies!

695
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:37,911
我已厌倦帮你收尸

696
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:39,364
下次我再见到你这张丑脸时
Next time I see your ugly mug...

697
00:45:39,727 --> 00:45:42,367
我会给你一枪
I'll put a bullet in it! You got it?

698
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:44,341
明白吗?

699
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:01,812
我只想和你握握手
I just wanted to shake your hand.

700
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:08,165
什么?
Ben told me what you did for the president. I respect that.

701
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,486
班告诉我你为总统所做的事

702
00:46:07,486 --> 00:46:10,815
我深感敬佩

703
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,089
谢了

704
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:25,729
嘿,丑八怪
Hey, ugly.

705
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,561
看来我们的证据毁了
Looks like our evidence got blown up.

706
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:31,323
我们得再找一些
We might have to get more.

707
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,761
你还不死心
Just won't let go.

708
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,565
你像支死缠不放的狗
You're like a dog with a frisbee.

709
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,489
女友死了
My girt's dead.

710
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:43,278
凶手逍遥法外 在高级餐馆进餐
Her killers are at spago's eating chicken marsala.

711
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,916
还在吃鹿乳酪披萨
And their goat cheese pizza.

712
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:48,048
这不公平
It ain't right.

713
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,310
是的,这说不过去
No, it ain't right.

714
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:03,025
这可不是在玩游戏
This ain't no game, flash.

715
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,440
真枪…
Reai guns.

716
00:47:05,746 --> 00:47:07,346
实弹…
Reai bullets.

717
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:10,054
很危险
It's dangerous.

718
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:12,439
我的绰号就叫危险
Danger's my middle name.

719
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:15,346
我叫死不放弃
Mine's Cornelius.

720
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:17,929
别告诉任何人, 否则我宰了你
Tell anybody, I'll kill you.

721
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,220
你看“灵魂车”节目? 闭嘴
Ever watch "soul train"?

722
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:20,708
Shut the fuck up.

723
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,909

726
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:41,012

727
00:47:41,454 --> 00:47:43,334
小女孩  她爱你吗?

728
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,165
不怎么爱

729
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:49,223
她喜欢“王子”

00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,808
我也喜欢“王子”

732
00:48:02,896 --> 00:48:04,216
好房子
An actuai house.

733
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:08,164
我还以为是粪便满地的洞穴
I was thinking of a cave with skulls and shit.

734
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:14,667
我觉得自己满身大汗
Feei like I been rode hard and put away wet.

735
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:17,015
什么意思?
What does that mean?

736
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,610
是说马的,老兄
It's horse talk.

737
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,543
现在也骑马啦
Brothers ride horses now?

738
00:48:21,877 --> 00:48:23,837
车子太难偷了啊
Cars are too hard to steai.

739
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:26,576
你还载了顶小牛仔帽?
Do you wear a little cowboy hat?

740
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,114
我是优秀骑师
I'm really good.

741
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,150
也许我还可约会你女儿 她什么样子?
Maybe I could take your daughter.

742
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:33,191
她才13岁 如果你动歪念,你就死定了
Even look at her funny...

743
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:35,434
I'll stick an umbrella up your ass.

744
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:43,772
怎么还没睡?
Why aren't you in bed?

745
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:45,428
黛莲在看电视
Darian's watching TV.

746
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:50,989
我看到了
- I can see that. - She's pissed at you bigtime.

747
00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:53,259
她很生你的气

748
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:55,617
你的脸怎么了?
What happened to your face?

749
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,282
老天,她终于说话了
My God! It speaks.

750
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:02,055
我的脸没事,一直是如此
Nothing happened to my face. It always looks like this.

751
00:49:02,425 --> 00:49:03,665
他的脸怎么了?
What's wrong with his face?

752
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:06,648
他的鼻太尖
His nose is too pointy. His eyes are beady.

753
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:10,051
眼太亮,耳太大
His ears are too big. He needs a shave.

754
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:09,419
需要刮胡子

755
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:13,332
拜托,我快尿裤子了
I am peeing in my pants, you're so funny.

756
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:14,136
你太会耍宝了

757
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:15,836
这是我女儿黛莲
This is my daughter, Darian.

758
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,900
我叫吉米
I'm Jimmy.

759
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:20,285
为什么把号号挂在头上?
Why's that number on your head?

760
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:22,651
是汽车牌照怕被偷吗?
Is it a license plate in case it's stolen?

761
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:27,657
不对,是有关橄榄球的
It's a football thing. It's my high schooi number.

762
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,659
这是我高中时的打球号号
When's graduation?

763
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:32,094
你什么时候毕业的?

764
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,146
你喜欢独自一人,是吗?
You want to be alone.

765
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,560
我会在厨房,这边
I'll be in the kitchen.

766
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,040
Over here.

767
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:46,854
乔,她遗传到你好胜的个性
She has your winning personality.

768
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,664
你会习惯的
You get used to it.

769
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:51,475
黛莲,我在做冰淇淋, 想来点吗
I got some ice cream. Want some?

770
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:54,055
别管我,我讨厌你
Leave me alone! I hate you!

771
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:59,104
因我不准她和汤母出去约会, 她在生气
She's pissed because I wouldn't let her date Tommy.

772
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:01,851
我错过了全年度最好的舞会
I only missed the best party of the year.

773
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:03,163
为什么不答应呢?
Why'd you say no?

774
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:07,486
因为她只有13岁,白痴
Because she's 13 years old, jerk-off.

775
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:12,418
要来点冰淇淋吗? 我不和你说
- Want some ice cream? - I'm not talking to you.

776
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:16,567
哦,真可惜
That's a shame. I'll miss all the pleasant things you say.

777
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:17,442
我会怀念你曾对我说过的好话

778
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:18,369
爸,我讨厌你
"Dad, I hate you."

779
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:21,354
巧克力口味,你最喜欢的
It's chocolate chip, your favorite.

780
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:22,924
我才不在乎呢
I don't care.

781
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:24,467
你是浑蛋
You're an asshole.

782
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,063
你知道我讨厌浪费食物
You know how I hate to waste food.

783
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,835
还要辱骂我吗?
Want to abuse me some more? Shock me.

784
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,645
吓我吧
I hardly ever hear the word "asshole."

785
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:42,414
我很少听人说“混蛋” 狗屎

786
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,320
你铁定常听人说 够了
- Bet you get it all the time! - That's enough!

787
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,550
你又要把我禁足?
- Will you ground me some more? - You got it.

788
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:49,324
你知道了 是的,混蛋
Yes, sir, asshole.

789
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:51,195
你得禁足好几个礼拜 别管我
- You're grounded. - Leave me alone!

790
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:54,071
他以为他是残暴的守护神啊 你要我打烂你的嘴吗?
He thinks he's ward cleaver.

791
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,590
你想和你妈一样吗? 尽管做吧
You want to talk like a trash-mouth? Sound like your mother?

792
00:50:57,977 --> 00:51:01,697
我在外忙了一天
I have to hear this shit all day, do I have to get it from you?

793
00:50:58,734 --> 00:51:01,646
回来还得受你指责?

794
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,074
乔,对你女儿别动怒
Go easy on the giri.

795
00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:06,002
别告诉该如何教训我的孩子
Don't tell me how to talk to my kid.

796
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,440
来呀,来呀, 让我听听你所有的脏话
Let me hear all the really juicy dirty words.

797
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:11,344
来呀,天呀,你是个混球
You're such a fuckup.

798
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:18,145
黛莲,你是我女儿
You're my daughter and you're in my home. You will respect me.

799
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:18,528
住在我的房子里,你得尊敬我,懂吗?

800
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:20,586
别再叫我混球
- Don't call me a fuckup. - Why not?

801
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,518
为什么我不该?
Mom calls you that!

802
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:24,442
妈一直这么叫你

803
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:25,764
你妈叫我浑球
She called me a fuckup?

804
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:27,184
何时?和杰叔通电话时
When?

805
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:29,314
On the phone with Uncle Jay.

806
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:31,994
杰叔?

807
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:36,245
我是浑球
I'm a fuckup, but Uncle Jay? There's a reai standup guy!

808
00:51:33,338 --> 00:51:36,858
而杰叔是非常优秀出色的家伙

809
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,330
这杂种逃税
He cheats on his taxes.

810
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:42,972
去问你妈 他为什么没在监牢服刑
Ask your mother why Mr. wonderfui's not in jaii for tax evasion.

811
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:44,605
因为他不是混球
He doesn't fuck up.

812
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:48,470
黛莲

813
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:48,824
上床睡觉
Go to bed.

814
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:04,368
For $50 you could pay a guy to pull her fingernails out.

815
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,886
只要50元,你可以请到人

816
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:08,386
把她的指甲一个一个拔下来
Anything that much fun I'd rather do myself.

817
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:10,587
如果真那么有趣我宁可自己来

818
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:13,072
我不了解你,但我想喝一杯
I don't know about you, but I need a drink.

819
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:17,194
请便

820
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:19,417
哦,妈的,这是你吗?
Shit! That's you?

821
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,380
你曾是模范老爹
You were ward cleaver.

822
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:24,789
是啊,我曾是模范童子军
I was a regular boy scout.

823
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,760
你和总统!
You and the president.

824
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:31,284
干,和大人物一起
Damn, hanging with the man!

825
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:35,149
看起来就像在威尼斯海岸所立起来的大看板般
It looks like one of those cardboard cutout things.

826
00:52:35,592 --> 00:52:37,912
我曾和唐强森合照过
I once had my picture taken with don Johnson.

827
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:40,902
还有那照片吗? 早丢掉了
- Still got the picture? - I threw it away.

828
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,639
你会离婚吗,老兄?
You going to get a divorce?

829
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:47,844
I don't know.

830
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:50,994
妈的,我不知道

831
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,820
你不太喜欢女人,是吧?乔
You don't like women much.

832
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,991
I liked the guy she was fucking.

833
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,732
至少我喜欢她的姘夫

834
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,332
他曾是我的好友
He was my best friend.

835
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:00,821
才不是呢,他是烂和家侦探
He was a scumbag private detective.

836
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:04,523
所有私家侦探都是浑蛋
All private detectives are scumbags.

837
00:53:04,918 --> 00:53:07,318
但他想害你被杀
But he tried to get you killed.

838
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:10,884
没有完美的朋友
Friends can't be perfect.

839
00:53:13,846 --> 00:53:15,846
我但愿苍天不是蓝色
I wish the sky wasn't blue.

840
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,142
水不是湿的
I wish water wasn't wet.

841
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,434
我也希望我不再爱我的老婆
I wish I didn't still love my wife.

842
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:31,468
Life sucks.

843
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:34,385
生命就是这样
To Alex, the accountant.

844
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,525
敬会计师亚历士一杯
Your accountant's name is Alex?

845
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:38,444
你的会计师名叫亚历士?

846
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:41,880
不是

847
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:43,633
但他本来应该是
But he could have been.

848
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:46,761
亚历士是我的儿子
Alex was my son.

849
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:51,987
我曾结过婚
I used to be married.

850
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:58,296
某个周日,我去趟迈阿密
One Sunday, I'm away in Miami.

851
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,290
她不能同行因有八个月身孕
She couldn't go. She was 8 months pregnant.

852
00:54:03,821 --> 00:54:06,341
她向拉柏瑞大道上走去
Walking down la brea boulevard...

853
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:09,101
突然有辆货车撞上路栏
out of nowhere a truck jumped a curb.

854
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,716
不知道怎么撞倒她
Never knew what hit her.

855
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,817
她死了
She died.

856
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:26,351
婴儿在保温箱中活了十七分钟
But Alex lived for 17 minutes in an Incubator.

857
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,789
他睡着了
He fell asleep.

858
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,187
只够时间做一个梦
Had time for one dream.

859
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:36,049
然后他也死了
Then he died.

860
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,859
我常想到他
I think about him all the time.

861
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:58,402
你知道吗?妻儿垂死挣扎时
I threw for 300 yards that day.

862
00:54:59,471 --> 00:55:01,831
我去了三百号
While my wife and kid were dying...

863
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:05,314
打出一生最好的一场球
I had the game of my life.

864
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:12,345
生命就是如此
Life sucks.

865
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:15,953
Can I use your shower?

866
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:17,544
可以用你的浴室吗?

867
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:20,748
可以 谢谢

868
00:55:19,785 --> 00:55:22,265
在大厅左边的第一个门边
Bathroom's down the hall on the right.

869
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:32,247
嘿,我帮你拿毛巾来了
Here's a towei.

870
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:48,923
这就是你在柯莉住处要找的?
This what you looked for at Cory's?

871
00:55:50,904 --> 00:55:52,584
你就是你要找的? 你干什么?
This what you were looking for?

872
00:55:52,906 --> 00:55:55,306
那值一千美金啊! 闭嘴
- That's $ 1000 worth of shit! - Shut up!

873
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:58,831
在我扭断你的脖子前 快滚出我的房子
Get the fuck out of my house before I break your neck.

874
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,740
我用那东西解愁
I use it to get by.

875
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:08,946
我不用那东西
I don't use it. I get by.

876
00:56:08,784 --> 00:56:11,535
仍能克服痛苦

877
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:12,036
穿上衣服快滚
Get dressed and get out.

878
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,030
好的,算了
All right. I forgot.

879
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:16,629
我和正人君子说话
Talking to Dudley-fucking-do-right!

880
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,420
那东西很容易上瘾的
That shit happens reai easy.

881
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:22,749
刚开始时…
It starts out...

882
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
止痛剂
painkillers.

883
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:29,184
为了膝头痛服用镇痛剂
Using demeroi because your knees are shot!

884
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:34,989
在你查觉前,把毒品和煎饼一起吃
Before you know it, you're chewing codeine with breakfast.

885
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:38,707
然后一辆货车突然驶来
Then a truck comes out of nowhere...

886
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:43,365
我对神说
and you're talking to God, saying, "help me out, big guy."

887
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:42,866
你说：

888
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,161
帮助我,主啊
I pay taxes and go to church.

889
00:56:44,348 --> 00:56:46,839
我缴税,上教堂

890
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,230
为何我的妻死子丧?
"What's with this dead wife and kid shit?"

891
00:56:49,975 --> 00:56:51,735
但他不回答我
But he ain't answering.

892
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:54,385
那天,他根本不听我的祷告
He ain't taking calls that day.

893
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:57,771
相反地,我接到球队的电话
Instead, I get a call from the fucking league.

894
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:01,709
他们说：嘿,小子
They're saying, "kid, your career's over."

895
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,682
你的事业结束了

896
00:57:02,698 --> 00:57:04,058
我说：“为什么?”
I say, "why?"

897
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:06,206
因为我赌博
Because I gambled.

898
00:57:06,786 --> 00:57:10,106
为什么职业橄榄球界要看受伤报告?
Why is there an injury report in pro football?

899
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:12,145
没有人有这种待遇
Nobody else has one.

900
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:14,299
但职业橄榄球界就要这样
But pro football does.

901
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:16,073
你知道为什么吗?
You know why?

902
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:19,481
因为如此,赌徒才能正确地传播消息
That's so gamblers will have an accurate spread!

903
00:57:20,218 --> 00:57:23,778
现在讲的都是钱
It's all business. They push untii you blow your brains out.

904
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:25,012
他们不断厌榨你, 直到你被榨干为止

905
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:25,221
就像他们对比利柯尔所做的
Like Billy Cole!

906
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:29,348
那些伪君子夺走我的生命
Can't you see the hypocrites took away my life!

907
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,688
当你不再难过时
When you're done pitying yourself, the door's that way.

908
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:37,200
前门是那个方向

909
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:44,436
你这杂种
You bastard.

910
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:49,608
我不只如此
And then some.

911
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,221
吉米 迪克斯

912
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:00,761
能帮我签名吗?
Sign my card?

913
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:05,532
对不起,刚才我很失礼
Sorry I was so bitchy before.

914
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,758
没错
- Your dad's pretty pissed. - He'll get over it.

915
00:58:08,477 --> 00:58:10,270
你老爹必定很生气

916
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,118
是的,但他很快就会平复的

917
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:13,754
你是他的英雄
You were his biggest hero.

918
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,609
是吗?何时开始? 自我小时候
Since when?

919
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,029
Since I was little. You should've heard him.

920
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:21,214
你真该听听他当时的口气 吉米这个,吉米那个
"Jimmy this, Jimmy that. Best quarterback in the game."

921
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,028
最佳四分卫
When you got busted, he quit watching.

922
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:25,460
自你被扔出球队后, 他就不看橄榄球了

923
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:29,669
他揍他所有的偶像吗?
Does he punch all his heroes?

924
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:36,463
（优良童军之女  吉米迪克斯赠)

925
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,607
早安,吉米
Who are you?

926
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,958
你们是谁?怎知道我的名字?
- This is the guy? You sure? - It's him.

927
00:58:57,605 --> 00:58:58,970
是这家伙吗?

928
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:02,294
你确定是这家伙吗? 就是他
The kid with the million-dollar arm?

929
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:03,877
那个有支百万金臂的家伙?

930
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,830
我猜不到你们谁像我老二
Don't look like much.

931
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:06,373
Which of you looks more like my dick?

932
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:09,559
有话就说,别挡着我
Say what you got to say, or get out of my way.

933
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,511
Grab him.

934
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:32,795
没事,没事
It's okay, folks!

935
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,730
怎么了?
It's okay. It's okay.

936
00:59:36,044 --> 00:59:37,924
没事,没事
Thank you. Thank you.

937
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,520
谢谢,谢谢

938
00:59:38,422 --> 00:59:39,902
危险是我的绰号
Danger is my middle name.

939
00:59:40,508 --> 00:59:43,308
别在家尝试这个
Don't try this at home. I'm a trained professionai.

940
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:44,919
我受过职业训练的
There's me...

941
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:47,393
这是我…
and there's super Dave.

942
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,483
而那是奇人戴夫

943
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:55,721
我有坏消息及更坏的消息
- I got bad news and bad news. - Give me the bad news first.

944
00:59:56,068 --> 00:59:58,788
先给我坏消息
Someone bounced Jimmy dix off a car.

945
00:59:57,405 --> 01:00:00,029
坏消息是有人把迪克斯扔去撞车

946
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:00,566
现在给我更坏的消息
Now give me the bad news.

947
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:03,385
我自贺伦伯邻居那取得口供
I got a statement from hallenbeck's neighbor.

948
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:07,503
麦可死的那天
The day he died, Mike Matthews came to hallenbeck's house...

949
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:10,652
他清早去找贺伦伯谈事,对吗?

950
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:09,355
to discuss a case.

951
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:10,789
贺伦伯是这样说的,好的
So hallenbeck says.

952
01:00:11,086 --> 01:00:13,526
但贺伦伯的邻居却声称
How come hallenbeck's neighbor claims...

953
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,440
麦可的车整夜都停在同一处
Matthews' car was in the same spot all night?

954
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,150
他为什么要说谎?
Why did he lie?

955
01:00:26,813 --> 01:00:29,333
麦可姘上他的老婆
Matthews is fucking his wife.

956
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:34,003
怪不得车子会在那
That's why the car was there. Matthews was fucking his wife.

957
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:34,900
麦可姘上贺伯伦的老婆

958
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:36,325
贺伯伦当时刚进城不是吗?
Hallenbeck just got back to town.

959
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:37,625
老天,乔杀了那浑蛋
Christ!

960
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,508
Joe wasted the bastard himself.

961
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:46,602
他竟从容地自我办公室走出去
He waltzed right out of my office.

962
01:00:46,961 --> 01:00:48,841
我让那杂种走了
I let the son of a bitch go.

963
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:51,052
给我一个机会, 班,我去逮他
Give me a chance. I'll get him.

964
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:27,123
汤米
Tommy.

965
01:01:30,212 --> 01:01:33,375
老天啊

966
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:39,353
你17岁时, 我必定让你参加宴会
You can go to a party when you're 17.

967
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:43,694
早安,乔
Morning, Joseph.

968
01:02:05,095 --> 01:02:06,775
看来我们有点麻烦,麦洛
We got trouble, milo.

969
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:09,319
拿起贺伯伦的枪,把扳机扣起
Pick up his gun by the trigger guard.

970
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,602
把它给我
Give it to me.

971
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,793
早安,先生们, 有什么问题吗?
Is there a problem?

972
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:22,429
是的,警官,的确有问题
Yes, there is. Apparently, there are too many bullets in this gun.

973
01:02:20,393 --> 01:02:22,657
显然地,这枪的子弹太多了

974
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:27,804
指纹
Fingerprints.

975
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,855
乔,你真顽皮
Naughty boy, Joseph.

976
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,850
你刚杀了位条子
You just shot a policeman.

977
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:52,966
卧倒

978
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:04,205
是你,爹地
It's you, daddy.

979
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:09,645
是你…

980
01:03:13,217 --> 01:03:14,177
我想他醒了
He's awake.

981
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:15,797
确定一下
Make sure.

982
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,470
妈的
I'm awake.

983
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:29,315
我醒了

984
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:30,628
你几乎扭伤我的手
You nearly broke my wrist.

985
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:33,609
麦洛警告过我们,小心这家伙的
Milo warned us to watch out for him.

986
01:03:34,074 --> 01:03:35,434
干
Fuck that! Fuck you.

987
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:38,741
妈的
Look at him. He's nothing. Guy's a piece of shit.

988
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,606
看看他这样子,简直是人渣

989
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:40,584
有烟吗?
Got a cigarette?

990
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,117
烟?当然有
Cigarette? Sure.

991
01:03:44,294 --> 01:03:45,614
我有烟
I got a cigarette.

992
01:03:48,593 --> 01:03:49,553
有火吗?
Got a light?

993
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:51,899
有,我有火
Yeah, I got a light.

994
01:04:00,982 --> 01:04:03,382
嘿,宝贝
Hey, I thought you were tough.

995
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:05,642
我还以为你是硬汉呢
He's not so bad.

996
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:07,372
派柏,看吧, 他哼都不敢哼一声

997
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:13,228
我把烟弄掉了
I dropped my cigarette.

998
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,154
可以再给我一根吗?
May I have another?

999
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:24,998
当然
Sure.

1000
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:27,284
没问题,老皮
Sure thing, buddy.

1001
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:35,822
我要火
I'm going to need a light.

1002
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:39,159
再碰我,我会杀了你
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

1003
01:04:46,786 --> 01:04:48,946
成功了,宝贝
Bamba! Baby!

1004
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:54,081
两战两胜
Oh, baby! Two for two!

1005
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:55,984
我们两战…
We got a two for two!

1006
01:05:01,386 --> 01:05:02,226
早告诉过你了
Told you!

1007
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:05,441
天呀
Jesus Christ!

1008
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:10,975
你杀了他,你他妈的杀了他
You fucking killed him!

1009
01:05:11,313 --> 01:05:12,553
He's dead!

1010
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:16,304
有什么问题吗?
Is there a problem?

1011
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:20,979
他刚杀了查特,麦洛
He just killed him! He put his fucking nose through his brain!

1012
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:22,149
他打的他脑出血

1013
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,570
我要火
I needed a light.

1014
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:27,733
你让我失望,乔
Joseph, you don't disappoint me.

1015
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:32,696
但你冒了个大险, 派柏可以开枪打死你的
You took an awfui risk. Pablo could have shot you dead.

1016
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:35,646
如果要我死,我早就没命了
If you wanted me dead, you'd have killed me already.

1017
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,780
那倒是真的
That's true.

1018
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,740
我们能来个正式介绍吗?
- Can we do a format introduction? - Who gives a fuck?

1019
01:05:44,267 --> 01:05:45,427
谁在乎呀?
You're the bad guy.

1020
01:05:45,979 --> 01:05:47,179
你是坏蛋,对吧?
I am the bad guy.

1021
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:49,841
我是坏人
And I'm supposed to tremble with fear?

1022
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:51,778
我想我是该吓的发抖?

1023
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:51,312
Something like that.

1024
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,990
差不多是这样
Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute.

1025
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:54,640
很好

1026
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:57,686
我在一分钟内会开始发抖
In the meantime, could I have a drink?

1027
01:05:58,034 --> 01:05:59,714
现在,能给我杯酒吗?
I don't see why not.

1028
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:03,485
我看不出有何不可?
Take the corpse away, and fix Mr. hallenbeck a drink.

1029
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,722
派柏,先把查特尸体弄走

1030
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:04,993
再给贺伦伯先生倒一杯酒
Make that two.

1031
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:07,898
两杯吧

1032
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,190
这不是马康吗?
If it isn't Shelly marcone himself.

1033
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,159
小心点,孩子
Carefui, son.

1034
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,028
只有朋友叫我马康
Just my friends call me Shelly.

1035
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:18,128
你有朋友?
You got friends? When did this happen?

1036
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:19,532
什么时候开始的?

1037
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:24,050
小子,我告诉你
You sure are feisty for a fellow in your position.

1038
01:06:21,362 --> 01:06:25,715
像你现在的处境,你该禁若寒蝉

1039
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:26,255
麦洛,教他点规矩
Teach him some manners.

1040
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,009
再碰我,我就宰了你
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

1041
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:43,652
你在说什么阴谋?
What fucking conspiracy are you talking about?

1042
01:06:43,964 --> 01:06:45,444
贺伦伯是笨蛋,对吧?
Hallenbeck's a fruit loop.

1043
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:47,996
他追随班纳参议员数年
He's been after senator baynard for years.

1044
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:51,343
你要我相信
You want me to believe the senator's mixed up in this?

1045
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:52,942
参议是也涉入这件阴谋中?

1046
01:06:52,265 --> 01:06:55,425
我再说一遍,警官
I'll say it again for the cheap seats, lieutenant.

1047
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,578
我不晓得贺伦伯人在何处
I don't know where Joe is! That's my fucking statement!

1048
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:02,261
这就是我的口供
Write it down and shove it up your ass.

1049
01:07:00,462 --> 01:07:03,310
写下来,放在你屁眼中吧

1050
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:04,381
我可以以不合作罪名抓你
I could naii you for obstruction.

1051
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:09,066
你却抓不住一名 索价2元的妓女
You couldn't naii a $2 whore. Charge me with something or let me out!

1052
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,560
要不用莫须有罪名指控我 要不就放我出去

1053
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:11,458
我先生并没有杀警
My husband did not kill a cop!

1054
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:15,398
除此之外,我帮不上任何忙 我们可以走了吗?
Aside from that, I can't help you. May we go now?

1055
01:07:16,502 --> 01:07:19,062
我可以和你妈 私下谈一分钟吗?
Can I have a minute with your mom in private?

1056
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:20,541
请便
Pleasure.

1057
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:26,773
你不否认在麦可死前 你和他上过床吧
Do you deny being sexually involved...

1058
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:29,258
with Matthews prior to his death?

1059
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,620
我打电话来
Why am I calling? I had to hear your sweet voice.

1060
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:34,338
只是想听你甜美的声音
And I need a favor.

1061
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:36,209
并请你帮个忙
No, it ain't like that.

1062
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:39,164
不,不是这样的
No, it wasn't no liquor talking.

1063
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:40,094
不,我并没在说醉话

1064
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:42,207
你不胖,只是丰满
You're not fat. You're just a whole lot of woman.

1065
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:43,812
帮个忙吧,好妈妈
Do me a favor, big mama.

1066
01:07:44,077 --> 01:07:47,197
班纳参议员
Senator Calvin baynard. He's a season ticket holder.

1067
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:51,105
他买一季的球票,对吧?
Punch up the address where you send the tickets.

1068
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:53,555
我要你找出寄票的地址

1069
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:58,919
很好,好的
Good giri.

1070
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:05,026
拜拜

1071
01:08:05,026 --> 01:08:08,034
很好

1072
01:08:07,104 --> 01:08:08,464
别担心,我会找到你老爸的
Don't worry. I'll find him.

1073
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:09,535
怎么找?
How?

1074
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:13,447
找最近的坏蛋问
When in doubt, try the nearest bad guy.

1075
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:19,945
橄榄球业已奄奄一息,乔
Football is a dying beast, Joe.

1076
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:23,889
不再有英雄
No heroes left.

1077
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,408
再也没了
Not anymore.

1078
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:30,687
自66年,伟伯林付了四十万给纳曼斯后
Since old Sonny werblin paid $400,000 to Joe namath in '66...

1079
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,416
那些混蛋愈来愈贪心
the bastards have gotten greedier.

1080
01:08:34,052 --> 01:08:36,492
天啊,何时他们才会满足?
God almighty, when's it enough?

1081
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:38,579
自由身球员只会说 付钱,付钱,付钱
Jesus! Free agents!

1082
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,650
"Give me, give me, give me!"

1083
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:45,341
现在球员们都在吸毒吃药
Now you got guys on pcp, shooting themselves on the field.

1084
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:45,882
并在场上射杀自己

1085
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:49,933
美国民众已生气,厌倦
The American public's tired of it, and they're changing the channei.

1086
01:08:50,655 --> 01:08:52,415
他们更换频道
The ratings are down.

1087
01:08:50,144 --> 01:08:53,312
收视率下降

1088
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:56,246
所以你收买参议员
So you'll bribe senators to legalize gambling.

1089
01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:59,222
让赌博合法化?
Legalize sports gambling.

1090
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,235
是运动赌博合法化

1091
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,361
你知道 当所有英雄全都没着落
You see, with all the heroes gone...

1092
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:05,751
只有合法赌博能挽救橄榄球业
only legalized gambling will save the beast.

1093
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:08,238
你同意吗?乔
You follow me?

1094
01:09:08,717 --> 01:09:10,677
我们在谈大笔金钱
We're talking about big bucks.

1095
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:12,731
数以亿计
We're talking billions.

1096
01:09:13,056 --> 01:09:15,136
有九个零,孩子
That's nine zeroes, son.

1097
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:16,839
我不是你的孩子
I'm not your fucking son.

1098
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,319
乔,你有听说过议会…
Have you ever heard of the senate's commission...

1099
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:26,333
调查职业橄榄球的赌博吗?
to investigate gambling in pro sports?

1100
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:27,979
那是你收买的对象吗?
Is that who you're paying off?

1101
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:30,621
议会三月进行投票
The commission votes in march.

1102
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:34,833
我收买了每位议员
I got them all in my hip pocket, except senator Calvin baynard.

1103
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:35,238
除了班纳参议员外

1104
01:09:35,249 --> 01:09:37,649
我试过收买那浑蛋,乔
I tried to bribe that son of a bitch.

1105
01:09:38,586 --> 01:09:40,346
他退钱回来,因他嫌钱不够
He gave it back because it wasn't enough.

1106
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:45,206
他要多少?六百万
- What's he want? - 6 million.

1107
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,955
不然他就告发我
Or he'll go straight to the police.

1108
01:09:49,056 --> 01:09:51,776
你知道吗?我认为干掉他花费还便宜点
It'll just be cheaper to kill that son of a bitch.

1109
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:56,679
干掉参参员不是小事 即使对你种混蛋而言
Taking off a senator is ballsy, even for an asshole like you.

1110
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:58,913
你说的没错,孩子
You said it, Joe-boy.

1111
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:02,599
这也是我们要找你当替罪羔羊的原因
That's why we'll frame you for the senator's murder.

1112
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:09,027
身为运动赌博委员会的主席
<i>As chairman of the commission, I'll simply say this:</i>

1113
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,579
我只能说
I'm reviewing both sides of the issue with utmost care...

1114
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,324
我会就此事件的正反两面

1115
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,325
做仔细的研究
and scrutiny.

1116
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:16,869
我会以个人一员的坚定立场
I will adopt a position...

1117
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:19,573
based on what is best for the sport.

1118
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:20,748
选最有利的方案

1119
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,450
现在…
In the meantime...

1120
01:10:23,097 --> 01:10:27,017
我迫不及待地想至体育馆
I can't wait to get to the coliseum to watch my favorite team...

1121
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:29,716
去观赏我最欢的洛城队 痛宰谭巴湾队
kick hell out of Tampa bay.

1122
01:10:30,274 --> 01:10:31,673
卡!

1123
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:33,582
谢谢你,参议员
Thank you, senator.

1124
01:10:33,902 --> 01:10:35,902
我的荣幸
Always a pleasure.

1125
01:10:39,116 --> 01:10:42,276
吉米,想想,乔会怎么做
Come on, Jimmy, think, think, think! What would Joe do?

1126
01:10:42,662 --> 01:10:44,982
他会杀了人还吸口烟
He'd shoot everybody and smoke cigarettes.

1127
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:46,332
我可没有枪
But I have no gun.

1128
01:10:50,796 --> 01:10:53,236
你怎么来的?搭便车
- How'd you get here? - I hitched.

1129
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:57,408
那不是我的意思 我是说,你是怎么找到我的
I meant, how did you find me?

1130
01:10:59,973 --> 01:11:02,253
我爸是侦探, 我还能说什么?
My dad's a detective. What can I say?

1131
01:11:04,144 --> 01:11:06,584
你没掩饰行踪
You didn't cover your tracks. You're easy to trace.

1132
01:11:07,149 --> 01:11:09,149
很容易就找到
Just what I need: Nancy-fucking-drew!

1133
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:09,809
很好,正是我要的

1134
01:11:09,485 --> 01:11:10,885
我把这带给你,或许你会需要
I brought you this.

1135
01:11:11,195 --> 01:11:12,635
你怎么会有枪?
Where did you get that?!

1136
01:11:12,947 --> 01:11:14,307
从爸的衣柜偷的
Stole it from dad's closet.

1137
01:11:14,616 --> 01:11:16,056
他知道会杀了我
He'd kill me if he knew.

1138
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:18,288
你可能会先杀了自己, 小混蛋
You'll kill yourself first, you jerk.

1139
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:21,513
快拿着那支丑猴子滚开这里
Take this ugly monkey and get out of here.

1140
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:24,154
走开走开
I want to know what's going on.

1141
01:11:22,218 --> 01:11:24,170
等一下,我要知道怎么了?

1142
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:25,979
看CNN吧 走吧
Watch CNN. Go!

1143
01:11:27,966 --> 01:11:30,446
妈的,是照片中的保镖
Those are the bodyguards from the picture.

1144
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,040
那又怎样? 他们没等参议员就走
They're leaving without the senator. Now go!

1145
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:33,580
我得跟踪他们,快走

1146
01:11:34,473 --> 01:11:35,673
我要跟你去
I'm coming too.

1147
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:37,812
不行,回家,黛莲
You can't come. Go home.

1148
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:39,063
去死吧…黛莲
Kiss my ass.

1149
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:40,776
我说的够清楚了吧?
Kiss my ass!

1150
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:42,584
很好,你这小富家子
Is that clear enough?

1151
01:11:43,483 --> 01:11:44,283
Fine!

1152
01:11:44,526 --> 01:11:46,126
我们只跟踪 能有什么危险了?
You little brat.

1153
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:49,231
We'll only follow. How dangerous can that be?

1154
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:58,282
我们到了
We're in position.

1155
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:02,262
参议员的人在路上
The senator's men are en route. Eta, five minutes.

1156
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:04,183
约五分钟到

1157
01:12:17,523 --> 01:12:19,443
该死,现在他们又往哪去?
Now where you going?

1158
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:21,113
我们去看看,这儿有枪
Let's find out.

1159
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:22,081
我说过不带枪,我讨厌枪
Here.

1160
01:12:22,945 --> 01:12:25,385
I told you no guns, right? I hate guns.

1161
01:12:26,116 --> 01:12:28,876
留在这儿,我去看看
Stay here. I'll go look around. Stay!

1162
01:12:28,718 --> 01:12:30,777
留在原地

1163
01:12:44,179 --> 01:12:45,099
六百万,对不起
Six mii.

1164
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:46,469
Excuse me.

1165
01:12:46,808 --> 01:12:50,528
你们这些白痴
Did any of you stupid shits bother to frisk this fuck?!

1166
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:52,078
可有人要搜他身

1167
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:54,908
他有可能是条子,搜他的身
He could be a goddamn cop. Will you frisk him?

1168
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:01,427
别紧张
Take it easy.

1169
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:07,962
满意了吗?
Hand him the briefcase, Joseph.

1170
01:13:06,563 --> 01:13:10,829
把箱子给他,乔

1171
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,520
西装蛮漂亮的
Nice suit.

1172
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:34,877
那箱子装了炸药,对吧?
Was that briefcase loaded with explosives?

1173
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:38,637
十磅的炸药
10 pounds of c-4, going to the coliseum now.

1174
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:40,270
现在送去体育馆

1175
01:13:39,453 --> 01:13:41,413
多讽刺,不是吗?
It's ironic, don't you think?

1176
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:45,948
这些炸药由班内贴身保镖亲自交给他
This bomb will be delivered to baynard by his own bodyguards.

1177
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:49,898
他死后
After his death, the police will receive a photograph of you...

1178
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:52,082
警方会收到你送上箱子的照片

1179
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:52,453
你将要为这件犯罪事件顶罪
handing over the case.

1180
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:55,009
他们将深信不疑
You'll be blamed for the crime.

1181
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,627
因为他们都知道,你多恨班纳
They'll believe it.

1182
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,651
- They know you're a fan of baynard's. - Go fuck yourself.

1183
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,589
你去死吧

1184
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:04,561
好的,可真不礼貌
That's not polite.

1185
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:08,139
听起来非常具侮辱性
It's very abusive sounding.

1186
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,123
你要怎么样,乔?
What would you do...

1187
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,580
假如有人叫你去死
if somebody told you to go fuck yourself?

1188
01:14:17,622 --> 01:14:20,222
你会挖了他们的眼睛?
Would you cut one of their eyes out?

1189
01:14:21,008 --> 01:14:23,601
不会

1190
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,118
那你要怎么做?
What would you do?

1191
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:35,966
你以为自己很酷吗?
You think you're so fucking cooi.

1192
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:38,888
你以为自己很酷
You think you're so fucking cooi!

1193
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,528
再一次…
This once...

1194
01:14:41,902 --> 01:14:43,862
我会要你痛苦地尖叫
I'd like to hear you scream...

1195
01:14:44,197 --> 01:14:45,717

嘿,小子
Hey, flash.

01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,550
想救人?
Rescue attempt?

1199
01:15:07,973 --> 01:15:08,973
别臭美了
Blow me.

1200
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:10,637
你一定是吉米 吉米?
You must be James.

1201
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,824
他每个人都这么叫
He does that with everybody.

1202
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:15,228
叫我乔
Calls me Joseph.

1203
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:16,484
我相信你是一个人来
You're alone?

1204
01:15:16,776 --> 01:15:19,376
不,整个维也纳合唱团 都跟来了
No, I got the vienna boys choir with me.

1205
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:21,175
这儿的人个个是笨蛋吗?
Is everybody stupid here?

1206
01:15:23,658 --> 01:15:24,698
只有你是,小子 杀了他们,并埋起来
Just you.

1207
01:15:24,993 --> 01:15:26,073
Shoot them, bury them.

1208
01:15:28,998 --> 01:15:29,918
怕吗?是的
Scared?

1209
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:31,728
你呢?有一点点
Shitless. You?

1210
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:32,801
嘿,麦洛
More or less.

1211
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:41,729
先生,喜欢我的布偶吗?
Hey, mister!

1212
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,430
Like my puppet?

1213
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:45,301
把她带走
Get her out of here.

1214

猜谜语时间
It's riddle time.

1222

为什么麦洛先生横过路边?
Why did Mr. milo cross the road?

1223
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:19,081
我不知道,为什么?
I don't know. Why?

1224
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:22,031
因为他的“宝贝”被卡住了
Because his dick was stuck in a chicken.

1225
01:16:30,905 --> 01:16:32,145
毛球?是的
Fur ball?

1226
01:16:32,906 --> 01:16:37,066
毛茸阿汤认为这是小穴 你们一定看过很多次了
This is the first pussy you guys have seen in a long time.

特别是那的肥猪
Especially this fat fuck.

1228
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:42,861
你那弄来的外套,祖父?
Where'd you get the suit? Gangsters "r" us?

1229
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,950
我们是黑帮吗?

1230
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:48,253
走,离开这

1231
01:16:48,325 --> 01:16:49,349
快点

1232
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:59,053
妈…!

1233
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,436
她怎么会来这?
Why is she here?!

1234
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,060
我跟踪他来的,不是他的错
It's not his fault!

1235
01:17:12,704 --> 01:17:13,904
该死,我会杀了你们俩个

瞄准,然后开枪
What do I do with it?

1239
01:17:25,427 --> 01:17:26,707
Point it and shoot!

1240
01:17:31,225 --> 01:17:32,225
伏倒
Keep down!

1241
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,971

1246
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,659
坐隐

把安全带系上
Put your seat belts on!

1248
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,680
乔,情况很糟

1249
01:18:13,817 --> 01:18:14,577
坐稳,情况非常,非常糟

1250
01:18:30,212 --> 01:18:31,292

告诉他们,体育馆有炸弹
Say there's a bomb at the coliseum!

1258
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:12,246

1265
01:19:26,486 --> 01:19:28,486
Give me the keys or I shoot the kid.

1271
01:19:41,745 --> 01:19:44,336
因你救毁你一生的人

1272
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,631
为偷你老婆的人报仇
and avenge the guy that fucked your wife.

1273
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:49,978
女孩说他爸叫乔何兰白
The giri said her dad's name is Joe hollen-

1274
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:54,052

Bulletproof glass. He won't hear you.

1286
01:20:42,117 --> 01:20:44,117
你干什么? 画张图给他们看
- What're you doing? - Drawing a picture.

1287
01:20:44,454 --> 01:20:45,534
这是什么?炸弹
- Of what? - A bomb.

1288
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:47,830
它不像炸弹,倒像苹果
It looks like an apple with lines.

1289
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,453
他们会以为 打开箱子会有苹果
"Don't open the briefcase, it's full of fruit."

1290
01:20:50,793 --> 01:20:52,233

01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:18,959
我忘了告诉你
I forgot.

1296
01:21:19,578 --> 01:21:21,218
BOM在波兰语中意指“干”
"Bom" is "fuck you" in Polish.

1297
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:23,019
这并不好笑 我差点被射杀了
It's not funny. I almost bought it.

1298
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,420
对艺术界真是一大损失
Tragic loss to the art world.

1299
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:27,824
你快追丢了,老兄
You'ii lose them.

1300
01:21:28,088 --> 01:21:29,368
系紧你的安全带
Buckle your seat belt.

1301
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:30,592
它不能用
It's broken!

1302
01:21:38,364 --> 01:21:40,229
哦,妈的

1303
01:21:45,608 --> 01:21:48,808
我发誓,如果我能活过这次
I swear, if I survive this case, I'll dance a jig.

1304
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:49,420
我会狂舞一番

1305
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:51,763
什么?
I'll dance a jig.

1306
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,847
我发誓,狂舞一番

1307
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,472
那儿,那儿
There! There!

1308
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,703
我们刚过了出口
The off-ramp we just passed!

1309
01:22:03,129 --> 01:22:05,369
嘿,你去哪儿?
Where you going? What are you doing?

1310
01:22:04,652 --> 01:22:06,677
你要干什么?

1311
01:22:47,431 --> 01:22:48,471
老天
Ain't I a bitch?

1312
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,670
我脾气太差了
Now do we go to the cops?

1313
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,970
我们去找警察吗?

1314
01:22:50,976 --> 01:22:52,056
我考虑看看
I'll think about it.

1315
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:02,819
你在等电话吗?
Expecting a call?

1316
01:23:07,162 --> 01:23:08,802
嘿,干你娘的
Hey, motherfucker.

1317
01:23:09,874 --> 01:23:11,714
你从那打来 麦洛,游泳池底
Where are you, bottom of the pooi?

1318
01:23:12,001 --> 01:23:13,401
我正前往球赛
<i>On my way to the ball game.</i>

1319
01:23:14,086 --> 01:23:16,486
嘿,这儿有人要跟你谈谈
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1320
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:18,952
嘿,爹地
Hi, daddy.

1321
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,840
我没事,我没受伤
<i>I'm okay. I'm not hurt.</i>

1322
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:26,049
爹地?
You back off...

1323
01:23:26,352 --> 01:23:28,912
你最好抽身,乔
or I'll show your daughter what a hot date I am.

1324
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:30,942
否则就让你女儿好看

1325
01:23:33,193 --> 01:23:35,633
怎么了?
- What happened? - He has Darian.

1326
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,930
他捉了黛莲

1327
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:37,788
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?

1328
01:23:39,075 --> 01:23:41,635
我们去逮马康,这是唯一的方法
We take marcone. It's the only way.

1329
01:23:41,954 --> 01:23:43,594
我们什么都不做 他们也会杀她
We do nothing, they'll kill her anyway.

1330
01:23:44,249 --> 01:23:46,609
小心那箱子,会爆炸的
Carefui with that case. It goes "bang."

1331
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:49,623
看看这些好家伙
Look at all this.

1332
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:52,457
拿着

1333
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:52,807
粉碎弹…
Shredders.

1334
01:23:53,843 --> 01:23:56,043
警方和反毒组用以爆破
Police and the DEA use it to blow locks.

1335
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:58,028
一触即炸
They explode on impact.

1336
01:23:58,347 --> 01:24:00,467
十尺内无人生还
Kill everything within 10 feet.

1337
01:24:02,311 --> 01:24:05,191
粉碎弹
Put this on. Get in. You in or out?

1338
01:24:02,132 --> 01:24:03,326
穿上它,上来

1339
01:24:03,348 --> 01:24:07,028
你来吗? 我来,我还能有什么损失?

1340
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:07,245
孩子,我们去看球赛
I'm in. What can I lose?

1341
01:24:08,193 --> 01:24:09,713
We're going to a ball game.

1342
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:29,005
嘿,马康的车,来吧
That's marcone's car.

1343
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:30,144
Come on.

1344
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:33,221
我一直很想这么做
- Always wanted to do that. - Should've shit on it.

1345
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,091
该死

1346
01:24:48,072 --> 01:24:50,512
该死 什么?
I forgot to tell you, you're wanted for murder.

1347
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:51,163
忘了告诉你,你已被通缉了

1348
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:57,248
嗨,迪先生,好久没见
Mr. dix. Long time no see!

1349
01:24:57,584 --> 01:24:58,904
对,好久了
Yeah, too long.

1350
01:24:59,252 --> 01:25:02,332
我们要见马康
- We're going to see Mr. marcone. - Sure, go ahead.

1351
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,354
去呀

1352
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:16,070
吉米,你这混蛋
Jimmy, you bastard! You broke my nose!

1353
01:25:16,398 --> 01:25:20,038
你来这干嘛? 你打断我的鼻子
What are you doing here? You were kicked off the team!

1354
01:25:18,402 --> 01:25:21,346
你被赶出这支队伍了

1355
01:25:20,402 --> 01:25:23,402
你想被赶出这星球吗?
How'd you like to be kicked off the planet?

1356
01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:25,659
祝你玩的愉快
Have a nice game.

1357
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,664
嘿,乔

1358
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:48,884
好吗?
How you doing?

1359
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,377
你是大笨蛋
You are one dumb bastard.

1360
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:54,270
你知道吗?
You know that?

1361
01:25:54,568 --> 01:25:56,648
我猜我们不能跳劲舞了
I guess we won't dance that jig.

1362
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:00,741
你没事吧?黛莲
You okay?

1363
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:04,393
当然,她没事
Of course she is. She's been with Uncle Shelly.

1364
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:05,909
她和马康叔叔玩的很高兴
I'm okay.

1365
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:07,947
是的,我没事,爹地
Lose the guns.

1366
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:09,892
来,把枪丢掉
Take off your coats. Relax.

1367
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,790
脱掉你的外套,放轻松点

1368
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:12,258
投降吧,马康
What do you think baynard'll do...

1369
01:26:12,548 --> 01:26:14,628
你以为班纳知道你要杀他后 还会放过你吗?
when he learns you tried to kill him?

1370
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,527
他没机会了
He doesn't have a chance.

1371
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:18,813
要不了多久,我的老朋友麦洛
Shortly, milo will have him...

1372
01:26:19,097 --> 01:26:22,217
将用来福枪瞄准他
in the sights of a high-powered rifle.

1373
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:24,284
他从哪开枪?
Where's he shooting from?

1374
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,607
你是不是永远有问不完的问题?
You never run out of questions.

1375
01:26:28,942 --> 01:26:30,262
这么说吧
Let's just say...

1376
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:33,729
麦洛选了一个绝佳位置
milo's in a highly enlightened position.

1377
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,559
为什么要杀柯莉?
Why'd you kill Cory?

1378
01:26:37,577 --> 01:26:40,257
她想勒索我,我不吃这套
She took to blackmaii. I have no truck with that.

1379
01:26:40,914 --> 01:26:43,514
她是我“用”过的妓女中
She's one of the sweetest whores I ever tasted.

1380
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,628
最捧的一个

1381
01:26:44,418 --> 01:26:46,818
我们之间,距离大理石地只有五尺
There's 5 feet of marble between me and you.

1382
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:49,171
也许我能成功达阵得分
Maybe I make it, maybe I don't.

1383
01:26:49,549 --> 01:26:52,429
如果你再叫她妓女
You call her "whore" again, I'll find out.

1384
01:26:52,028 --> 01:26:54,204
不妨试试

1385
01:26:54,805 --> 01:26:57,165
吉米,吉米
Jimmy, do what you got to do.

1386
01:26:57,517 --> 01:26:58,957
做你想做的
Take it easy.

1387
01:26:57,915 --> 01:27:00,508
放轻松点,吉米

1388
01:26:59,769 --> 01:27:01,129
他当然知道
He should know.

1389
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:03,476
他终究要付出代价
With a face like that, he must pay for it.

1390
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:06,305
如果你还喜欢这小女孩
If you're fond of this little giri...

1391
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,368
那就闭上狗嘴
keep your goddamn mouth shut!

1392
01:27:09,697 --> 01:27:11,337
去偷吃屎吧,你这肥老
Eat shit, you redneck!

1393
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:13,152
过来,黛莲
Come here.

1394
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,789
吉米,看到你真开心
Goddamn, I'm really glad to see you, Jimmy.

1395
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,680
你知道吗?
I still have that autographed ball...

1396
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:23,483
我仍保有那些签名的球 那是你给我的收藏品

1397
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,040
you gave me for my collection.

1398
01:27:23,483 --> 01:27:24,973
是的

1399
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:26,450
有件事很可惜
It's a shame about you.

1400
01:27:26,802 --> 01:27:29,202
你的臂值百万
You had the million-dollar arm, kiddo.

1401
01:27:29,512 --> 01:27:32,472
你却迷上…
You got hooked on the-what was it?

1402
01:27:32,976 --> 01:27:33,976
那是什么…
Demeroi!

1403
01:27:34,269 --> 01:27:37,429
毒品
Because you couldn't stand the pain.

1404
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:36,809
你会上瘾, 表示你忍受不了痛

1405
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:40,004
你讨厌苦痛

1406
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:42,989
他忍受不了痛,乔
Couldn't take the pain.

1407
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:45,813
生命就是一场苦痛,吉米
Life is pain.

1408
01:27:51,164 --> 01:27:52,684
走开,年轻人
Walk it off, son.

1409
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
纪律
Discipline.

1410
01:27:56,712 --> 01:28:00,472
噢,天哪
Kids nowadays just don't have no discipline.

1411
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:02,630
现在的孩子毫无纪律

1412
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:03,815
你不感到难过吗?
Don't you cry, honey.

1413
01:28:04,582 --> 01:28:06,374
不,你不难过

1414
01:28:06,265 --> 01:28:07,185
来,去坐在马康叔叔的椅子上
Come on.

1415
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:09,155
Come sit in my chair.

1416
01:28:10,603 --> 01:28:11,363
你将会是…  放她走
Let her go.

1417
01:28:18,488 --> 01:28:20,008
解除他们的痛苦吧
Put them out of my misery.

1418
01:28:21,032 --> 01:28:23,512
这事牵扯了六百万元
There is the matter of the $6 million.

1419
01:28:24,662 --> 01:28:26,182
也就说,除非你不感兴趣
Unless you're not interested.

1420
01:28:27,207 --> 01:28:28,727
让我们来逗逗这浑球
Let's humor this asshole.

1421
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,408
告诉我
Tell me.

1422
01:28:32,546 --> 01:28:34,506
只有我俩知道它在哪儿
Just me and flash know where it is.

1423
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:39,653
它在一轮白色的BMW汽车后 我们可以带你去
It's in the back of a white BMW.

1424
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:42,326
We can take you to it.

1425
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,479
麦洛说,钱被毁了
Milo said the money was destroyed.

1426
01:28:46,394 --> 01:28:47,834
你在吹牛
You're bluffing.

1427
01:28:48,314 --> 01:28:50,114
你以为我在吹牛?
Think I'm bluffing?

1428
01:28:50,607 --> 01:28:52,967
我还有一卷录音带
I also have in my possession a tape.

1429
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:55,119
是你和班纳勾结的谈话
You and baynard.

1430
01:28:55,779 --> 01:28:56,979
很有少的证据
Very juicy stuff.

1431
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,400
让我猜猜
Well, now, let me guess.

1432
01:29:00,077 --> 01:29:02,197
假如你出了事…
If something happens to you...

1433
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:05,472
那东西会寄给警方,对吗?
that thing will be mailed to the cops.

1434
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:08,354
很接近,其实会到黑道那
Close. Actually, it goes to the mob.

1435
01:29:09,963 --> 01:29:13,403
他们会很有兴趣知道
They'd be interested to know what you're up to.

1436
01:29:13,802 --> 01:29:15,562
你想做什么,合法赌博?
Legalized gambling.

1437
01:29:16,346 --> 01:29:18,346
他们会损失多少?
They stand to lose what?

1438
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,080
2至3亿美金?
Two and a half billion dollars?

1439
01:29:21,393 --> 01:29:23,513
他们不会生气
They won't be upset about that.

1440
01:29:23,813 --> 01:29:26,493
只是损失全年的收益
Just their entire bookmaking income.

1441
01:29:26,817 --> 01:29:28,417
来吧,开枪吧
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

1442
01:29:28,903 --> 01:29:30,223
请便吧
Be my guest.

1443
01:29:30,529 --> 01:29:35,129
只是别惊讶明早醒来
Don't be surprised if you wake up next to a stallion head.

1444
01:29:32,144 --> 01:29:37,172
身边有个马头…宝贝

1445
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:45,841
如果你有那卷录音带
If you had that goddamn tape you'd have already told me.

1446
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:48,390
你早告诉我了

1447
01:29:48,009 --> 01:29:49,249
没用的,老兄
This ain't working.

1448
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,111
用尽你的力量吧
Take your best shot.

1449
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,243
干,乔,我不想就这样死了
I ain't going out like that! He's iying!

1450
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,920
马康先生,他在说谎
- The money's not in the car. - Shut up!

1451
01:29:56,051 --> 01:29:59,091
钱在我们身上 闭嘴

1452
01:29:59,271 --> 01:30:01,311
在储物柜里
It's in a locker. And I got the key.

1453
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:01,596
我有钥匙

1454
01:30:02,276 --> 01:30:03,476
钥匙在哪
Where is it?

1455
01:30:04,778 --> 01:30:05,938
藏在我内裤内
Stashed in my shorts.

1456
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:09,125
别紧张,慢慢来
Easy. Just easy.

1457
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:12,730
别给他,他会杀你的…
Don't. He'll kill you!

1458
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:14,958
反正他都会杀我们,浑球
He'll kill us anyway!

1459
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,160
你得答应放我走
Promise to let me go.

1460
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:22,108
鬼扯淡
Bullshit.

1461
01:30:22,634 --> 01:30:24,554
给他钥匙, 否则打烂你的膝盖
Give him the key or I'll kneecap you.

1462
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:32,255
看来没人会拿到钱
Nobody gets the money. It's one of those new plastic keys.

1463
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,354
那是塑胶钥匙

1464
01:30:32,644 --> 01:30:33,644
把钥匙拿出来
Get the key!

1465
01:30:33,938 --> 01:30:35,578
会爆炸的那种
The kind that shreds.

1466
01:30:35,899 --> 01:30:36,939
伏下…黛莲
Get down!

1467
01:30:42,614 --> 01:30:43,814
带她出去,带她出去
Get her out!

1468
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,613
快走

1469
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:58,488
走,走

1470
01:31:05,516 --> 01:31:06,636
我走不动
I can't walk.

1471
01:31:06,934 --> 01:31:08,614
还好吧,快不行了吗?
You going to pass out?

1472
01:31:08,938 --> 01:31:10,418
我会没事的
I'll make it.

1473
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,790
来,用这把你的手包里起来 塑胶钥匙?会爆炸的那种
Plastic keys? The kind that shred?

1474
01:31:16,112 --> 01:31:17,952
当时没法可想 那是最好的了
Short notice. Best I could do.

1475
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:19,921
你做得很好 小子,真的很好
You did reai good.

1476
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,921
是的,我从专家那学来的
Learned from a pro.

1477
01:31:25,832 --> 01:31:27,792
妈的,乔,你没吹牛
Shit! You wasn't bluffing.

1478
01:31:43,602 --> 01:31:46,282
参议员的包厢在哪?吉米
- Where's the senator's box? - Section c. I'll show you.

1479
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,801
在C区 来,我带你去

1480
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:51,589
参议员的包厢在哪?
Where's the senator's box?

1481
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,113
那边

1482
01:31:55,533 --> 01:31:56,253
麦洛人呢?
Where's milo?

1483
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:06,752
一个高而光亮的位置
"A highly enlightened position."

1484
01:32:08,132 --> 01:32:10,092
他一定在那些探照灯上面 听着小乖
He must be on those lights.

1485
01:32:10,802 --> 01:32:13,082
找个警察, 和他在一起,好吗?
Find a cop and stay put.

1486
01:32:13,638 --> 01:32:16,518
不要   听爸的话,好吗?
You hear me? Listen to daddy, all right?

1487
01:32:16,892 --> 01:32:18,452
我会没事的,我会没事的
I'll be all right.

1488
01:32:18,768 --> 01:32:20,688
照我的话做,给我一个吻
Do what I say. Give me a kiss.

1489
01:32:21,022 --> 01:32:22,702
去…去找个警察
Go find a cop.

1490
01:32:23,024 --> 01:32:24,584
我呢?  你去找班纳
- What about me? - Find baynard.

1491
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,940
然后呢?
Then what?

1492
01:32:26,402 --> 01:32:28,002
吸引他的注意力
Get his attention.

1493
01:32:35,732 --> 01:32:38,708
来,快上,你这肥鬼

1494
01:32:38,541 --> 01:32:39,541
别动,贺伦伯 听着,有个杀手…
Freeze!

1495
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:43,394
你被捕了 …要射杀班纳
A sniper's on that light! He'll shoot baynard!

1496
01:32:43,799 --> 01:32:44,639
少来
Come on!

1497
01:33:12,498 --> 01:33:14,498
他在那,吉米 迪克斯在那
There he is! Jimmy dix!

1498
01:33:14,834 --> 01:33:16,994
逮住这浑球, 他刚用枪指着我
He pulled a gun on me.

1499
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:18,378
你这浑蛋
You scum!

1500
01:33:21,051 --> 01:33:22,371
他有猎枪
He's got a gun!

1501
01:33:22,678 --> 01:33:24,638
你这浑球,干
You bastard! You fuck!

1502
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,072
坐下,你这浑蛋
Sit down!

1503
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,545
请留在原位

1504
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:49,011
我再重覆一次…

1505
01:33:49,089 --> 01:33:51,265
请留在原位

1506
01:33:52,212 --> 01:33:53,612
别走上球场 把球给我
Give me the ball!

1507
01:33:53,922 --> 01:33:55,642
吉米,给我球
Give me the fucking ball!

1508
01:33:56,176 --> 01:33:56,896
谢了
Thanks.

1509
01:34:09,901 --> 01:34:10,821
我说,坐下
I said, "sit down!"

1510
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,540
干

1511
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:46,971
你这…浑球

1512
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:00,691
放下武器,你已被包围
<i>Put down your weapon!</i>

1513
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:14,255
妈的

1514
01:35:16,435 --> 01:35:17,515
找这个?
Looking for this?

1515
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:22,523
你这浑球
Asshole!

1516
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:36,677
我告诉过你…
I told you:

1517
01:35:37,544 --> 01:35:40,064
你再碰我
You ever touch me again, I'll kill you!

1518
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:40,019
我就杀了你

1519
01:35:42,081 --> 01:35:45,517
不是我,不是我

1520
01:36:15,714 --> 01:36:17,234
他在干什么?
What the hell is he doing?

1521
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:19,710
不知道,像在跳舞
I don't know. Is he dancing?

1522
01:36:22,514 --> 01:36:24,434
看起来像在跳舞
Looks like he's dancing.

1523
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:31,589
以舞姿而言 他是跳舞最差的侦探
For a dancer, he's one hell of a detective.

1524
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,860
告诉我
What's this I hear about Satan claus?

1525
01:36:43,326 --> 01:36:46,654
圣诞老人是怎么回事?

1526
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:48,529
哦,你也知道他呀?
You know about him too?

1527
01:36:48,961 --> 01:36:50,441
在那里,就是他
There! That's the man!

1528
01:36:50,755 --> 01:36:54,595
这浑球一直打电话骚扰我
This bastard's been making phone calls and harassing me!

1529
01:36:55,386 --> 01:36:58,066
他主使这一切
I bet he stage-managed the whole damn thing!

1530
01:36:58,431 --> 01:36:59,871
逮捕他
Arrest him!

1531
01:37:06,316 --> 01:37:07,516
头还是肚子
Head or gut?

1532
01:37:07,818 --> 01:37:08,978
什么?
Excuse me?

1533
01:37:17,203 --> 01:37:18,203
妈咪来了
Mom's here.

1534
01:37:20,374 --> 01:37:21,854
妈咪
I missed you so much.

1535
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,682
我好想你

1536
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:28,009
你真是个浑蛋, 你知道吗,乔
You know you're a reai bastard?

1537
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,282
我不仅如此
And then some.

1538
01:37:54,498 --> 01:37:56,018
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1539
01:38:01,172 --> 01:38:03,332
非常非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1540
01:38:07,346 --> 01:38:09,066
请原谅我
Please forgive me.

1541
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:20,606
我会买只狗
I'll buy a dog.

1542
01:38:33,209 --> 01:38:34,649
干,莎拉
Fuck you, Sarah.

1543
01:38:51,981 --> 01:38:54,061
干,莎拉, 你是说谎的婊子
Fuck you, Sarah.

1544
01:38:54,943 --> 01:38:58,703
假如不是警察在这, 我会吐你口水
If the cops weren't here, I'd spit in your face.

1545
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:12,457
乔,他们说的那箱子在哪?
Where's the briefcase they were telling me about?

1546
01:39:13,674 --> 01:39:15,994
白色BMW汽车后座
White BMW. Back seat.

1547
01:39:22,893 --> 01:39:24,333
什么也没有呀
Ain't a thing here.

1548
01:39:33,321 --> 01:39:34,121
有了
Bingo!

1549
01:39:41,748 --> 01:39:43,868
马康拿错了
Marcone's got the wrong one!

1550
01:40:05,026 --> 01:40:06,186
怎么回事?
What?

1551
01:40:13,245 --> 01:40:15,005
我们下一步会是什么?
What's next for us?

1552
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:18,596
明天吧,我想
Tomorrow, I guess.

1553
01:40:19,418 --> 01:40:21,698
逐步来
Take it one step at a time.

1554
01:40:23,799 --> 01:40:26,439
爸,我可以带吉米去见我朋友吗
Daddy, can I go show Jimmy to my friends?

1555
01:40:27,178 --> 01:40:29,818
他不是宠物,亲爱的
- He's not a puppy. - He's fucking famous.

1556
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:30,182
少来了,爸,他…他妈的是名人呢

1557
01:40:31,347 --> 01:40:32,707
嘿,注意你的嘴巴
You want to watch your mouth?

1558
01:40:33,099 --> 01:40:34,459
少来了,爸 黛莲,你爸说注竟你的嘴巴
Come on, dad.

1559
01:40:34,768 --> 01:40:37,608
你就照办
Your father said, "watch your mouth." Do it.

1560
01:40:41,778 --> 01:40:42,778
是的,长官
Yes, sir.

1561
01:40:44,573 --> 01:40:46,013
我喜欢这样
I like that.

1562
01:40:50,121 --> 01:40:52,681
我在想,我可以用一名拍档
I'm thinking I could use a partner.

1563
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:54,691
你肯吗?
You up for that?

1564
01:40:55,001 --> 01:40:57,361
我不知道 我对侦探之事一无所知
I don't know anything about being a detective.

1565
01:40:57,755 --> 01:40:59,195
没什么大不了的
There's nothing to it.

1566
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:03,109
现在是九十年代,你不能走上前要打一个人
Since it's the 90s, you don't just smack a guy in the face.

1567
01:41:03,512 --> 01:41:05,032
你必须先说点漂亮的话 懂我的意思吗?
You say something cooi first.

1568
01:41:05,347 --> 01:41:06,987
懂的,像…“我将回来”
Like, "I'll be back."

1569
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:08,787
是的,只是要比这好一点
Only better than that.

1570
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:12,141
看到溜滑板,你会说…
Like, you hit him with a surfboard and say, "surf's up!"

1571
01:41:10,808 --> 01:41:12,696
滑板正流行,老兄

1572
01:41:12,522 --> 01:41:14,482
是的,差不多就是这样
Something like that.

1573
01:41:14,817 --> 01:41:16,057
还有什么吗?
What else?

1574
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,920
目前没有什么好说的
That's about it.

1575
01:41:18,321 --> 01:41:20,321
水湿,天蓝
Water's wet, the sky is blue...

1576
01:41:20,656 --> 01:41:24,536
而圣诞老人就在那儿,吉米
and old Satan claus is out there, just getting stronger.

1577
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:24,681
他愈来愈强壮

1578
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:26,514
我们对此,能怎么办?
What do we do about that?

1579
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:28,310
准备好,孩子, 这是我的座右铭
Be prepared, son.

1580
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:31,146
That's my motto. Be prepared.

1581

上个周末夜

1587

来到老橡树旁

1588
01:41:54,904 --> 01:41:57,848
它就在河边

上面有你给我的小纸条

1592
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:16,150
写着：吾爱,我误解你了

1593
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:18,675
现在我必须放你自由

这样的罪恶

1597
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:31,590
我无法告诉你

1598
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:35,754
那男生只是一位朋友
