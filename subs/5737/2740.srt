1
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,962
Seven gone, six returned!

2
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:52,746
Mother, it looks like
the battle of Jinsha was...

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,822
...utterly to our disadvantage

4
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:58,480
According to this prediction...

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,989
we might lose a brother

6
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,359
Yes

7
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:08,138
But it's worthwhile to sacrifice one son

8
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,341
...for the sake of Sung Dynasty

9
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:17,723
As for my seven sons

10
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,667
I wonder which one will be a martyr

11
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:33,156
The queen's father is here

12
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,669
Daughter, I've bad news.
Your brother...

13
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,308
Your highness

14
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:47,323
Arise

15
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,831
Thank you, my queen

16
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,465
What is it, father?

17
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,185
Your brother Pan Bao

18
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:57,098
...was beaten to death in a tournament

19
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,221
My brother's dead? Who killed him?

20
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:04,056
Yang Ye's seventh son, Yang Si

21
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:06,614
Yang Si? Father, I must...

22
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:07,841
My queen

23
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:09,458
Leave now

24
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,791
Yes, my lady

25
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:21,357
I'll plead with the emperor
to condemn him

26
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,949
No, that's not the way to do it

27
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,957
Yang Ye has a secured position
in the court

28
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,940
We must get rid of the Yang family

29
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,689
What's your suggestion, father?

30
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:34,942
We'll kill them all at the Jinsha battle

31
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,597
Kill

32
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:26,597
Forge ahead

33
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,554
Charge

34
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,609
Impressive spear-wielding
of the Yang family

35
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,809
It has lived up to its reputation

36
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,053
Today is your doom day

37
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:01,579
Traitor

38
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:22,135
5th brother...

39
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:23,988
6th brother...

40
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:07,902
Eldest brother

41
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:18,910
Kill

42
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,063
Tartars

43
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,518
3rd brother

44
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,898
Let's go

45
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,592
Kill

46
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,554
3rd brother

47
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,486
Wait, catch him alive

48
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,881
Bring him back

49
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,222
2nd brother

50
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:45,868
2nd brother

51
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:20,981
Yang Ye

52
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,876
Pan Mei

53
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:29,371
Arrows

54
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,601
7th son

55
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,990
Traitor!

56
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,454
Shoot

57
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:58,271
Loyalty... kill

58
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:02,933
Charge

59
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:10,343
7th brother, father...

60
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,268
Father, we're a family of loyalty

61
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,818
Why would the emperor
listen to the traitors

62
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:24,047
...and sent us into the trap?

63
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,278
This is the end for us

64
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,894
Traitor, Tartars

65
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:39,299
Come out, all of you...

66
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,210
I've found them...

67
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,427
6th brother...

68
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,452
6th brother...

69
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,344
Stop it

70
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,000
No, not them

71
00:10:58,577 --> 00:10:59,838
Kill

72
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,593
6th brother...

73
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,555
Mother...

74
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,863
Good day, mother

75
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,786
Good day, mother

76
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,849
Don't worry too much, mother

77
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:51,581
Father and our seven brothers will

78
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,325
...certainly win the Jinsha battle

79
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,061
That's right, mother

80
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,799
With our spear-wielding second to none

81
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,445
Stop it, 9th sister

82
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:00,920
The Tartars

83
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:02,942
...would be terror-stricken

84
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:06,392
But there's no news up to now

85
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,789
Pan Mei's sudden plea to the emperor

86
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:15,514
and he assigned our family to the north

87
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,527
There must be something going on

88
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:28,096
The prediction says
seven gone, six returned

89
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:32,001
Could there be another interpretation?

90
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,802
- 6th brother
- Son

91
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,546
Come out here, Tartars

92
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:45,937
They've come back from a victory

93
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,416
Son, where's your father?

94
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:06,435
Pan Mei...

95
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,700
Where are your brothers?

96
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:13,795
Traitor

97
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,924
Son, where're your brothers?

98
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,291
Tell us

99
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,550
Go on

100
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,716
Sixth brother

101
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,400
What are you doing?

102
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,755
Sixth brother

103
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,112
Sixth son...

104
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:48,205
Focus, my child

105
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,081
Tell me

106
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,406
what happened?

107
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,915
Right, tell our mother

108
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,897
Why are you here alone?

109
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:08,197
I'm home?

110
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,770
Yes, you're home

111
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,802
How many Tartars have you killed,
brother?

112
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:17,714
Tell me

113
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:24,808
Kill

114
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:28,713
How many? Not one

115
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,910
Jinsha Battle was a trap

116
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:41,181
Pan Mei... you wanted to kill us all

117
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:49,296
My eldest brother was stabbed to death

118
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:58,393
Second brother got cut into half

119
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:02,173
Third brother died even more tragically

120
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:10,235
He was trampled to death
by men and horses

121
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,004
Fourth brother was captured

122
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:21,278
Fifth brother is missing

123
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:32,979
And my baby brother was killed by arrows

124
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:38,904
Mother

125
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,810
What about your father?

126
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:55,886
Killed at Liling Tomb. Father...

127
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,782
Yang Ye

128
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:10,884
Why are you kneeling? I will too

129
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,732
Pan Mei

130
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:19,565
Sixth son...

131
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:26,777
Seven gone, six returned!

132
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,018
The battle of Jinsha

133
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:40,982
only my sixth son returns; it's fate

134
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,375
Prince, what can I do for you?

135
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:20,739
Pan Mei, according to our plan

136
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,414
We've wiped out the Yangs at Jinsha

137
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:26,488
Why haven't you kept your promise...

138
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,408
of withdrawing the Sung army
at the border?

139
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,959
So that my Liao troops
can march straight in?

140
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,960
You have my absolute loyalty

141
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:36,542
But I've one concern

142
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,621
Yangs' fifth and sixth sons
are still alive

143
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,320
Men

144
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:49,309
Prince

145
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:52,238
Our plan was perfect

146
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,325
Our weapons were made to counter
the Yang spears

147
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,107
How could they manage to escape?

148
00:17:58,295 --> 00:17:59,852
You should give them a second chance

149
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:01,328
...to make it up

150
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,888
We must deal with this soon

151
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,577
If they make a comeback...

152
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,597
it will affect our invasive strategy

153
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,216
We'll try to intercept them
from different directions

154
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,150
We've got to uproot the Yangs

155
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,961
Tartar

156
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:00,283
You robber

157
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:13,316
Are you a deserter from the Yang family?

158
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:14,907
No, I'm not a deserter

159
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:17,040
No? What are you doing here?

160
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:17,817
What are you doing here?

161
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:20,550
None of your business. Who are you?

162
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:24,175
Who am I? I live here

163
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,284
I'm a hunter

164
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,806
Sorry about it

165
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,641
Warrior, I mistook you for the enemy

166
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,287
So you're fighting the Tartars

167
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,337
That's right, after the battle of Jinsha

168
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:45,831
We got ambushed

169
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,345
No wonder you're hiding here

170
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,794
No, I'm not afraid to die

171
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,518
If not...

172
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,543
then what are you doing here?

173
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:00,603
The Queen's father
set up a trap to kill us

174
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,170
Pan Mei used to be in the same camp
as Yang Ye

175
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:09,941
Yes, we'd never have thought that

176
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,039
...he would try to kill us all at Jinsha

177
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:14,831
Yang warrior, let me tell you

178
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,598
I was a general working for Pan Mei

179
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,626
I know him well

180
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,134
He has always been jealous of your family

181
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,391
...for the outstanding service
to the country

182
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:26,820
He's afraid that
his status will be threatened

183
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:30,754
Then he worked with the Tartars
to ruin your family

184
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,789
Pan Mei, you traitor!

185
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,386
I'll risk my life to testify against him

186
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:38,677
I want him torn to pieces

187
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:40,167
You won't have the chance to do that now

188
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,387
Right

189
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,707
He and the Tartars are on my trail

190
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,075
He wants to kill you all

191
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:47,463
Yes

192
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:52,658
My brothers are dead

193
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:56,603
My father Yang Ye died at the Liling Tomb

194
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:00,063
I'm the only survivor

195
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:01,759
General Yang

196
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,100
Yes, I hope you can give me a hand

197
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,970
...and testify against Pan Mei

198
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,675
There's no use, General Yang

199
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,385
Pan Mei is now in power

200
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,996
The Emperor won't listen to me

201
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:17,000
He will, after the disaster at Jinsha

202
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,419
I witnessed that

203
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:19,740
You're the only survivor

204
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:20,628
But what proof have you got?

205
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:24,534
Our family is loyal to the emperor,
he'll trust me

206
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,768
You're over confident, General Yang

207
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:30,190
Say even if Pan Mei
doesn't capture you...

208
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:32,121
he will surely accuse you

209
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,828
He'll accuse you of being a traitor
and a deserter

210
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:36,480
You have a point

211
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,636
The emperor has issued out decree
stating that...

212
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:41,894
I'm a traitor

213
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,426
If the emperor says so

214
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,750
What's the point of going back?

215
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,876
I can’t just sit here
and see my country...

216
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:52,489
Your country doesn't appreciate
your loyalty

217
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:53,458
Then to avenge for my family...

218
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,727
You must, but this isn't the time yet

219
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,311
Wait for your time

220
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,699
Learn from me. Forget about it for now

221
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:06,796
I can't

222
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,231
Surround it

223
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,393
Go through the tunnel

224
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,337
I must fight my way out

225
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,708
He ran into the tunnel...

226
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,192
Where's Yang's fifth son?

227
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,347
Don't know

228
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:23,875
Search

229
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,056
Yes

230
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,778
Give him up if you want to live

231
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:00,351
He's gone

232
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:01,778
Go

233
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,064
After him

234
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,313
Sixth brother

235
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,823
Leave him alone

236
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,464
Let him have his peace

237
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,705
...and hope that he'll recover soon

238
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:04,645
Knock

239
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,842
Yes

240
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:13,071
Open up, open...

241
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,913
Who is it?

242
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,156
Who dares to knock so rudely?

243
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,083
Who?

244
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,713
An imperial edict

245
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,519
Who's the envoy?

246
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,531
General Pan Mei, the Queen's father

247
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:29,983
Pan Mei

248
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:35,125
Traitor

249
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,585
Sixth brother

250
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:41,285
Pull him inside, hurry

251
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,169
I'll kill you

252
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,641
I'll kill Pan Mei

253
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,242
Open the door

254
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,287
Search

255
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,672
Yes

256
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,120
How dare you?

257
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:23,988
General Pan

258
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,161
Our family is in mourning!

259
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,062
How could you disturb us now?

260
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:31,978
I'm here to arrest the traitors

261
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,692
Who?

262
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:39,209
I've led the Yang family troops to Jinsha

263
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:43,289
and discovered that
your family haven't fought

264
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,488
...their best.
They're in conspiracy with Tartars

265
00:28:45,884 --> 00:28:49,444
The emperor has ordered for their arrests

266
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,177
Ordered for the arrests?

267
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,871
Ours is a family of patriots.
The Emperor...

268
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:59,464
has bestowed on us
"Family of Loyalty" and has...

269
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:05,906
given me this dragon-head staff
to rid the wicked

270
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,706
Mrs. Yang, you...

271
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:16,540
General Pan, just do your job

272
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:20,704
My husband and my seven sons
were ambushed

273
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,802
...in Jinsha battle. They're all dead!

274
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,977
You should have checked first as to...

275
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:27,337
who is it that
you are trying to arrest here!

276
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:32,252
This is our family's hall of fame

277
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:34,030
We take no intrusion

278
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:36,403
According to my sources,
two are still at large

279
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:37,299
Who?

280
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,499
Your fifth and sixth sons

281
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,981
If they're still alive

282
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:47,052
and upon their return home...

283
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,966
I'll personally escort them to the court

284
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,249
Please let the emperor know that

285
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:56,114
I will be just. See the guest out

286
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,431
Yes

287
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,819
Please, General Pan

288
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:05,232
Fine, Mrs. Yang. Goodbye

289
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:13,653
Mother

290
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,016
My fifth son, where could you be now?

291
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,245
Kill

292
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:36,705
Warrior, you laid down your life for me

293
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:38,851
I understand you are hoping
I'll stay alive

294
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:40,731
So that I can avenge for our country

295
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,057
You are right

296
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,141
The country won't appreciate my loyalty.

297
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:50,673
I'd rather live as a hermit
and wait for the right time

298
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:46,208
Kill

299
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,067
Kill

300
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:58,183
Master... please don't...

301
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,445
Kill

302
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,494
Sixth son...

303
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:04,874
You Tartars

304
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:09,921
Sixth brother

305
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,787
Back off, you both

306
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,294
Let him vent his anger

307
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:25,471
Kill

308
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,879
Kill

309
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,756
Kill

310
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,293
Sixth brother

311
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,508
You...

312
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,796
I'm devoting myself to Buddha

313
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,057
You are...

314
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:08,920
I'll shave my head to become a monk

315
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:36,288
Our temple is in the middle of nowhere

316
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:39,192
You came a long way to our temple

317
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:42,008
What could we do for you?

318
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:05,590
Master, I've decided to become a monk

319
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:07,548
I am ready for it

320
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,601
Amitabha Buddha

321
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,907
You have anger and sadness in your eyes

322
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:17,175
I think this is an impulsive decision

323
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:18,582
Please wait, master

324
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,350
Why don't you ask who I am?

325
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:23,147
Amitabha Buddha

326
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:27,491
I'm a monk.
Worldly affairs don't concern me

327
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,801
There's no need to ask

328
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:31,734
Mister

329
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,399
I'm Yang fifth, an accused traitor

330
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:45,283
Please don't lie before the Buddha

331
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:48,430
Master, I'm indeed Yang fifth

332
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:49,382
No, you're not

333
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:50,888
I am

334
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,894
A bladeless spear?

335
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,474
This can't be the Yang's spear

336
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:01,479
Please don't again falsely claim
to be a Yang General

337
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,173
I truly am Yang fifth

338
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,821
Yang fifth?

339
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:25,130
Mr. Yang, please forgive my rudeness

340
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:31,083
Master

341
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:36,102
I can't go home
and I can't avenge my country

342
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:39,723
I broke the blade,
and decided to become a monk

343
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:47,061
You have your heart
set in the worldly matters

344
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,769
You can't proceed with
the tonsure ceremony

345
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,134
Master

346
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,384
I want to shave my head

347
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:59,328
Please don't stop me

348
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,246
Master

349
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:28,860
Please don't stop me

350
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:35,043
I want to be a monk

351
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:38,544
Promise me you'll shave my head

352
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:40,186
Don't be rude

353
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,003
Our temple is a place of sanctuary

354
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,776
You should be on the battlefield

355
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:55,102
A victor can live a glorious life

356
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:59,831
But what if he loses his battle?

357
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,330
The dead is unkind, the living disloyal

358
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,472
Amitabha Buddha

359
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:12,252
We are free
from the mundane world's matters

360
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:16,616
I hope to start afresh here

361
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:21,096
You have hatred; and are very depressed

362
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,541
Perhaps you shouldn't be here

363
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,714
You're too barbaric

364
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,801
Very impressive

365
00:40:51,397 --> 00:40:52,761
I want my head shaved

366
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:56,800
The hair is on HIS head

367
00:40:57,061 --> 00:41:00,393
If he doesn't want them,
no one could stop him

368
00:41:01,716 --> 00:41:03,080
Yes, abbot

369
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:11,627
Thank you, abbot

370
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,958
Buddha of immeasurable Life

371
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,119
Amitabha Buddha

372
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:44,398
Revered abbot, you lied

373
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,419
Why don't you shave my head?

374
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:47,938
If you don't...

375
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,393
Then I'll burn down your temple

376
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,326
5th brother

377
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:15,036
Mother, the sixth brother
is still deranged

378
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,662
He's in no state
to testify against Pan Mei

379
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:20,170
Under the circumstances...

380
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:22,302
Our family name is being smeared

381
00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:23,560
9th sister

382
00:45:23,948 --> 00:45:25,141
6th brother, pull yourself together

383
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:27,099
We must testify against Pan Mei

384
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:28,966
Let's go

385
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,114
6th brother, we're in mourning now

386
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,007
We can't go to meet the emperor

387
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:34,786
6th son

388
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:36,290
I must go

389
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:37,719
6th son

390
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:40,383
Kill...

391
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:25,776
General Yang, you're awake?

392
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:29,988
Is this the Qingliang Temple?

393
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:32,896
Yes, this is the backyard

394
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,792
Then I've become a monk

395
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:40,884
I've become a monk!

396
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,669
General Yang, please stay put

397
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:46,015
You haven't eaten in days

398
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:48,362
I've been in a coma for that long?

399
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:49,771
Bring in some food

400
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,753
General Yang,
the abbot has ordered that...

401
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,395
after you get better,
you've to leave the temple

402
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,251
Tell your abbot

403
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,225
I'm now a monk

404
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,966
And I ain't gonna leave this place

405
00:47:09,147 --> 00:47:11,137
Got it?

406
00:47:11,336 --> 00:47:13,599
No wonder the abbot says...

407
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,324
What?

408
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:18,082
He said you can't be a monk

409
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:23,454
I can't, huh?

410
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:14,222
What are you doing here?

411
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:18,019
Agreed, I don't have
a peaceful mind needed for...

412
00:49:18,282 --> 00:49:19,942
chanting scriptures,
but I could be a guard here

413
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,612
and practice with the others?

414
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:25,556
This exercise room is a place
for the monks

415
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:27,287
You have no Buddha in your heart

416
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:29,477
How could you practice with us?

417
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:31,507
Don't worry

418
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:35,024
Although I'm not in peace

419
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:37,363
But I'm an experienced soldier

420
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:39,724
I'm not afraid of the wolves

421
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:53,036
Yang fifth

422
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,030
When you are hitting these wolves

423
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:58,119
...you've got to attack their limbs

424
00:49:58,304 --> 00:50:00,430
So that the others can smell the blood

425
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:02,258
And know about the danger

426
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:04,030
Then they wouldn't dare to come back

427
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,073
You're wrong

428
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:07,947
Even the wolves
are trespassing our garden

429
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,900
But as monks we mustn't kill

430
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:29,503
We would only de-fang them

431
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,372
No matter how fierce the wolves are...

432
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:33,247
without their teeth they are nothing

433
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,988
And we'd have taught them a lesson

434
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:39,438
Then they wouldn't dare to come back

435
00:50:39,857 --> 00:50:41,221
Here we practice the poles

436
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:43,079
Hence we're skilled to de-fang them

437
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,658
Hence the name:
The "Club to de-fang the wolves"

438
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:47,690
That's wrong

439
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,474
If you knock off their teeth

440
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:51,018
...and not kill them;

441
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,877
They'd gather their strength
after they recover

442
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,794
...return to strike again

443
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:57,306
How many monks

444
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:59,800
...can face them then?

445
00:51:00,006 --> 00:51:02,872
I can see that you're still blood thirsty

446
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:04,758
Master, I simply

447
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:06,803
wish to be a monk guarding the temple

448
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:08,922
I don't aspire to be a student like you

449
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,167
Since you've taken me in

450
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,000
Why don't you let me practice with you?

451
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,112
Are you challenging me?

452
00:51:15,258 --> 00:51:17,316
You're right

453
00:51:17,898 --> 00:51:20,297
But he has got his point

454
00:51:20,504 --> 00:51:21,231
All he has in mind is for...

455
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,567
the best interest of the temple

456
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,964
With the way he thinks...

457
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,067
He has already broken our rule of
'no killing'

458
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:33,319
Masters, I'm reckless because

459
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:35,398
...I'm unacquainted with the rules

460
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:38,243
Please allow me to learn from scratch

461
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:40,899
Your Yang's Spears style

462
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:44,006
Every move is fatal

463
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:48,566
You must first cultivate your mind...

464
00:51:48,853 --> 00:51:51,582
before you practice in the exercise room

465
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,506
Yang fifth

466
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:02,932
Yes master

467
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,783
I assure you that
I'll be as calm as still waters

468
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:14,429
You've turned
the Yang's Spear-wielding into...

469
00:54:14,646 --> 00:54:16,738
poles style. You've mastered it very well

470
00:54:16,937 --> 00:54:19,268
Master, then is this the time...

471
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:21,335
for me to join the others
in the exercise room?

472
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:24,491
No matter what

473
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,076
Our temple is not a place for you

474
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:28,283
What you're saying is...

475
00:54:28,425 --> 00:54:30,119
Leave this temple soon

476
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:34,860
No, I've given up everything

477
00:54:35,158 --> 00:54:37,455
...to become a monk

478
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:39,713
I'll never leave the temple

479
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,118
What happened?

480
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:03,762
Master Zhihong has left the mountain

481
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:14,439
Who's trespassing?

482
00:55:14,964 --> 00:55:17,022
Amitabha Buddha

483
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,743
What are you doing here, master?

484
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,377
To perform rites for the dead
of the Yang family

485
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:24,066
Religious rites?

486
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:32,687
You're here all alone, is it?

487
00:55:32,906 --> 00:55:35,271
Yes, it's just me

488
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:36,809
Where's your robe?

489
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:40,731
I've to travel far. It's not convenient

490
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,201
Where are you from?

491
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,335
From the borders

492
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,467
Catch him

493
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,835
Yes

494
00:55:49,218 --> 00:55:49,706
Let him in

495
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:50,671
Yes

496
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,337
The general has ordered to let him in

497
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,845
Yes

498
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:01,422
Master, you can't go in...

499
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,232
What's going on?

500
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,495
Master

501
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:07,805
Miss 8th, the monk is here
to collect alms

502
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:10,359
...and now he wants food.
He has pushed his way in

503
00:56:10,562 --> 00:56:11,050
Pushed his way in?

504
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:12,048
Yes

505
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:13,832
He wants vegetarian dishes?

506
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,794
If it's food that you seek...

507
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:18,813
you should have waited outside

508
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:22,430
Amitabha Buddha...
I want vegetarian dishes

509
00:56:22,673 --> 00:56:24,663
...cooked by Mrs. Yang

510
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:26,850
You're way out of line

511
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,707
If you're not a member of the family

512
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:32,291
...you can't step inside. Get out

513
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:34,154
Amitabha Buddha

514
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:36,326
Who are you?

515
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,752
Miss 8th, I am...

516
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,644
Did Pan Mei send you?

517
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:50,150
Stop it, 8th daughter

518
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:53,049
Mother, the monk is rude

519
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:54,806
He barged in...

520
00:56:54,983 --> 00:56:57,177
and asks for vegetarian dish
cooked by you

521
00:56:57,378 --> 00:56:58,401
Simply outrageous!

522
00:56:58,558 --> 00:56:59,717
9th daughter

523
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:08,111
Amitabha Buddha

524
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:11,684
Miss 8th, please invite the master in

525
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:17,005
Mother, he is sent by Pan Mei

526
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:20,458
Don't be rude. Invite the master in

527
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:21,722
Yes mother

528
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:23,902
Please, master

529
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:30,915
Mrs. Yang

530
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:33,737
I came here to solicit alms

531
00:57:33,957 --> 00:57:36,288
and to get some vegetarian food

532
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:39,821
How would I know General Pan Mei?

533
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:44,348
6th Brother

534
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:46,603
6th Brother

535
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:50,488
Young master

536
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,473
6th Brother

537
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:57,813
Sorry about my son

538
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:00,337
You aren't hurt, are you?

539
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,600
Mrs. Yang

540
00:58:03,837 --> 00:58:05,997
I didn't mean to upset anyone here

541
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:09,222
Master, since the battle of Jinsha...

542
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,860
my son has been acting sort of demented

543
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:14,535
Amitabha Buddha!

544
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,073
6th son

545
00:58:17,511 --> 00:58:21,344
Mrs. Yang, your son is valiant

546
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:23,978
What a shame

547
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:26,231
Had it not been for the shock...

548
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,865
he'd be as good as Yang fifth

549
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:31,544
Fifth son

550
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:33,420
Master

551
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:34,032
6th Brother

552
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,602
How come you mentioned my 5th brother?

553
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,798
Where is he? Tell us

554
00:58:38,993 --> 00:58:39,720
Stop it

555
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:42,761
Master Yang

556
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:45,850
A cue can enlighten the one concerned

557
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:50,251
Mrs. Yang, I must leave now

558
00:58:50,516 --> 00:58:50,879
Master

559
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:51,329
6th brother

560
00:58:51,452 --> 00:58:53,544
Stop it

561
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:56,476
Master, as for my vegetarian dish

562
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,250
Where shall I send it to?

563
00:58:58,846 --> 00:59:01,678
Qingliang Temple at Wutai Mountain

564
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:03,026
Master

565
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:04,444
Stop it, 6th brother

566
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,438
So 5th son
at Mount Wutai's Qingliang Temple

567
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:08,784
Why hasn't he come back?

568
00:59:08,943 --> 00:59:09,738
I'll go look for him

569
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,643
You haven't yet recovered

570
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:14,889
Pan Mei has spies everywhere

571
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:16,712
God forbid if something happens to you...

572
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:18,050
we won't be able to testify...

573
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,904
in front of the court against him

574
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:21,414
Let me go, mother

575
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:23,045
I have a plan

576
00:59:23,485 --> 00:59:25,782
The monk is here. Get ready

577
00:59:43,926 --> 00:59:45,586
Please, I got ambushed

578
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:47,376
Help me

579
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:52,787
Tartars have infiltrated the town

580
01:00:01,277 --> 01:00:03,301
You Tartars

581
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:12,999
Tartars have infiltrated the town

582
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,029
What were you doing
at the Yang residence?

583
01:00:16,202 --> 01:00:17,190
Tell me

584
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,411
Where's Yang fifth?

585
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,127
Tartars

586
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,799
Tell me if you want to live

587
01:00:34,977 --> 01:00:37,103
I don't know who's Yang fifth

588
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:38,496
Come on, tell me

589
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:41,373
It's not safe here, take him back

590
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,366
Yes

591
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:48,713
Where could Yang fifth be?

592
01:00:49,553 --> 01:00:51,281
Tell me

593
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:56,503
You are all useless

594
01:00:56,701 --> 01:00:59,191
You couldn't handle one monk

595
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:01,932
When will we take over
the Sung territory?

596
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:06,125
Fine, I'll raid the Yang's residence

597
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,717
Let's see what Mrs. Yang
has got up her sleeves

598
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:10,748
Yang Fifth might be home

599
01:01:12,493 --> 01:01:14,551
Calm down, your highness

600
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:16,612
It's just a matter of time...

601
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:18,353
before you reign over the Sung territory

602
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,707
If you raid
the Yang's residence hastily...

603
01:01:20,891 --> 01:01:23,324
that will only gather
the officials' strength

604
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:26,292
That won't do us any good

605
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:29,644
Then what's your suggestion, Pan Mei?

606
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,116
Since the monk visited the Yangs

607
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:35,545
They'd have movements tonight

608
01:01:35,745 --> 01:01:37,974
And we'll follow whoever leaves the house

609
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,421
Then we can catch all the fishes

610
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:44,306
8th daughter, 9th daughter

611
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:47,494
Pan Mei has been trying to hurt us
all these years

612
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:50,312
We must find your fifth brother
no matter what

613
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:51,687
...so that we could absolve
our reputation

614
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:53,575
Mother, I'm a good fighter

615
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:55,587
Let me go

616
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,863
Don't interrupt,
mother will tell us what to do

617
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,684
9th daughter, you are too impulsive

618
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,120
It's a long way to Wutai Mountain

619
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,185
Pan Mei has spies everywhere

620
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:11,899
You'll only wreck this

621
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:16,173
Wang

622
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:17,321
Here, madam

623
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:20,020
Get everything ready, 8th miss will leave

624
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,793
Yes, madam

625
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:34,316
9th daughter,
you're responsible for 6th brother

626
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:36,092
He can't step out of this house

627
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,703
Yes, mother

628
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,405
Mother, 5th brother is headstrong

629
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:41,973
I'm afraid that...

630
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,522
Take this jade pendant off my staff

631
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:46,829
He wouldn't dare forget his dear ones,
I guess

632
01:03:00,216 --> 01:03:01,147
Wait

633
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:04,709
It stinks!

634
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:07,292
Where are you heading to at this hour?

635
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,334
We're going to dump the leftovers

636
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,574
Leftovers?

637
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,040
If we don't dump these

638
01:03:14,203 --> 01:03:15,760
...the whole residence will stink

639
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,183
Put it down

640
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:24,102
We had the order not to give them
a hard time

641
01:03:24,302 --> 01:03:25,495
Yes

642
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,436
Go

643
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,413
Check for people

644
01:03:51,614 --> 01:03:53,137
No, over here

645
01:03:57,757 --> 01:03:58,984
Put it down

646
01:04:03,067 --> 01:04:03,464
Miss

647
01:04:03,587 --> 01:04:04,712
Get the horse

648
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:26,628
A young kid

649
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,066
Follow him

650
01:04:48,496 --> 01:04:49,723
You can't go in

651
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:51,611
I've already
observed the religious disciplines

652
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:53,453
I want to see the master tonight

653
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:54,119
Please, Brother Fifth

654
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,247
Wait for a few more days

655
01:04:56,444 --> 01:04:57,910
A few more days

656
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:01,053
A few more days?

657
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,424
Yes

658
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:14,278
Brothers

659
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:17,153
Why aren't you practicing the poles?

660
01:05:18,342 --> 01:05:20,468
Why are you meditating here?

661
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:23,994
What are you doing?

662
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,817
Where's the master?

663
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,287
Brother Fifth

664
01:05:49,923 --> 01:05:51,787
The master's dead

665
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:02,004
Killed by the wolves?

666
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,156
Tell me

667
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,271
Was he killed by the wolves?

668
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:13,467
Abbot, how did he die?

669
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:15,062
Amitabha Buddha

670
01:06:15,224 --> 01:06:16,520
Brother Zhihong knew that...

671
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,147
you're not focused on being a monk

672
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:23,483
He traveled to your home

673
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:25,282
My home? He...

674
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,586
He did it to help you

675
01:06:27,786 --> 01:06:30,481
Hoping you could rebuild
your family's reputation

676
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:33,661
Such good intention! So righteous!

677
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:39,802
He got killed on the road

678
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:43,046
Pan Mei the traitor

679
01:06:44,097 --> 01:06:45,324
Yang Fifth

680
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:49,148
Go and fulfill
Master Zhihong's dying wish

681
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:52,307
Abbot, I'm responsible

682
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,622
He died because of me

683
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:58,722
I'll fulfill his last wish

684
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:03,182
Good

685
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,884
But do you think you're up to it?

686
01:07:07,836 --> 01:07:09,735
With all the practice that
I've been doing...

687
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:11,612
...I think I can handle it

688
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,142
Well done

689
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:20,380
Thank you, abbot

690
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:24,320
Have a good day

691
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,752
We have a guest

692
01:08:39,735 --> 01:08:42,601
Are you staying in our inn, sir?

693
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,117
You rat, how dare you...

694
01:08:57,296 --> 01:08:58,626
rob me in broad daylight?

695
01:08:58,963 --> 01:09:00,020
Mister

696
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,425
Mister

697
01:09:05,937 --> 01:09:07,233
Mister

698
01:09:27,315 --> 01:09:30,044
The jade pendant on your waist

699
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,608
What about it?

700
01:09:34,812 --> 01:09:36,039
It is...

701
01:09:36,408 --> 01:09:38,534
Where did you get it?

702
01:09:39,184 --> 01:09:41,310
None of your business

703
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:44,276
You stole it

704
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:45,551
Nonsense

705
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:48,884
Then where did you get it?

706
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,029
It is...

707
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,262
Who are you? Tell me

708
01:10:29,194 --> 01:10:30,251
The golden knife

709
01:10:51,544 --> 01:10:52,976
Yang's golden knife

710
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,163
You are...

711
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:09,545
Where did you get this from?

712
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:10,558
Don't know

713
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:11,724
Speak up

714
01:11:12,783 --> 01:11:14,113
Jinsha Beach

715
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:16,563
You traitor

716
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:17,728
Who are you?

717
01:11:18,995 --> 01:11:20,359
I'm the 8th child of the family

718
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,857
Miss 8th

719
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:24,278
I was seriously injured
defending this knife

720
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,878
Fortunately the inn owner

721
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,174
...took me in

722
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:30,531
Thank you, old sir

723
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:32,089
Don't mention it

724
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:34,584
The Yangs are a family of martyrs

725
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:37,379
All the citizens respect and admire them

726
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:41,958
Miss Yang, in this time of chaos

727
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:43,907
You're here on your own

728
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:46,281
Are you on a mission?

729
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:47,777
I'm here to look for my 5th brother

730
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,304
He's still alive?

731
01:11:49,467 --> 01:11:50,228
Yes

732
01:11:50,369 --> 01:11:52,768
But I haven't seen him anywhere around

733
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:56,371
A monk from Wutai mountain visited us

734
01:11:56,615 --> 01:12:00,072
Going by his hint,
brother could be at the mountain

735
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,296
Is General Yang a monk now?

736
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:04,446
That's possible

737
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:07,566
After the heavy blow to our family...

738
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,349
my brother could've been
fed up of earthly life

739
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:13,330
That's why my mother gave me this pendant

740
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:16,018
Hoping to order him home
to testify against Pan Mei

741
01:12:16,224 --> 01:12:17,850
So that we could clear our reputation

742
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:20,087
Great, let's head to Wutai mountain

743
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:22,743
A large party is coming this way

744
01:12:30,765 --> 01:12:33,164
Call everyone out from the inn

745
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:35,670
Pan Mei the traitor

746
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,389
We are outnumbered

747
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,116
If we fight our way out

748
01:12:37,256 --> 01:12:38,950
We can never make it to the mountain

749
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:41,167
Miss Yang, don't act on an impulse

750
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:42,907
We've got to lay low for now

751
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:44,813
Bring the lady to hide in the kitchen

752
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:46,291
I'll think of a plan by tonight

753
01:12:46,452 --> 01:12:47,509
Yes

754
01:12:55,128 --> 01:12:56,822
What is it, sir?

755
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:01,554
Are you harboring
the court's prisoner Yang 5th?

756
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,786
Yang Fifth? No

757
01:13:06,025 --> 01:13:06,649
No?

758
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:07,253
That's right

759
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:07,934
We tracked a girl
from the Yang's residence

760
01:13:08,072 --> 01:13:09,936
...all the way here

761
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,609
You must be connected to her

762
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,653
No way, I have never met her

763
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,745
No problem

764
01:13:19,908 --> 01:13:21,670
Burn the inn down

765
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,372
Yes

766
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,739
Wait, your highness

767
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:26,235
Yang Fifth might not be here

768
01:13:26,397 --> 01:13:28,387
But his 8th sister must be around

769
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:29,810
If we burn this place down...

770
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,270
then we won't be able to catch her

771
01:13:33,512 --> 01:13:35,911
They'll probably meet up here

772
01:13:37,676 --> 01:13:39,700
Your highness, General Pan has a point

773
01:13:39,897 --> 01:13:43,024
Lock this place up, no one can leave

774
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:44,160
Good idea

775
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:47,902
Proprietor, this applies to you
and your staff

776
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:48,780
No one can leave

777
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,477
Yes

778
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:32,888
Where are you going?

779
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:34,434
Some refreshments for the boss

780
01:14:34,593 --> 01:14:38,323
Come on, Xiaosan, where's my food?

781
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:41,547
Snacking at this hour?

782
01:14:41,706 --> 01:14:43,536
Yes, for the boss

783
01:14:43,997 --> 01:14:44,928
Sirs

784
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:48,097
I have a snack at this hour every night

785
01:14:48,509 --> 01:14:49,338
Let him go

786
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,973
Thank you

787
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:57,504
Thank you, sirs

788
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,229
Hurry, Xiaosan

789
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:01,609
What are you doing?

790
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:04,688
Tying up the coffin

791
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:06,420
At this hour?

792
01:16:06,601 --> 01:16:07,225
Yes, sir

793
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:08,955
We must deliver the coffin
for burial before dawn

794
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:12,160
Otherwise it might turn into a vampire

795
01:16:12,396 --> 01:16:12,952
Turns into a vampire?

796
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:13,681
Yes

797
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,513
Don't try to trick me

798
01:16:14,652 --> 01:16:15,515
Take it away...

799
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:16,750
Yes

800
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:23,619
Wait

801
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:27,835
Open it

802
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:31,951
I can't...

803
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:33,097
Why not? Just do it

804
01:16:33,254 --> 01:16:35,483
I can't. The corpse stinks

805
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,088
Open it

806
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,323
You believe me now? Close it

807
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:58,517
What's this?

808
01:16:58,658 --> 01:16:59,954
A mortuary object

809
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,175
The golden knife?

810
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:08,878
The Yangs!

811
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:14,272
Yang 8th, you aren't going anywhere

812
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:46,899
Xiaosi

813
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:30,070
Yang 8th,
where do you think you're going?

814
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:32,101
Traitor, you're in no position
to talk to me

815
01:18:32,283 --> 01:18:33,306
Were you looking for Yang Fifth?

816
01:18:33,464 --> 01:18:34,725
Just tell me everything

817
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:36,547
Then I'll let you live

818
01:18:36,725 --> 01:18:40,023
Otherwise I'll make sure
you die a terrible death

819
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:45,904
Go

820
01:18:49,949 --> 01:18:51,108
Stop it

821
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,543
There's no need to run after him

822
01:18:56,438 --> 01:18:57,734
General Pan, he...

823
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:01,442
Your highness, let him go

824
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,874
Yang Fifth will show up before dawn

825
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:05,335
Men

826
01:19:05,497 --> 01:19:06,087
Yes

827
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:07,282
Lock her up

828
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:08,429
Yes

829
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,689
Yang Fifth

830
01:19:17,852 --> 01:19:19,011
Hurry... what's going on?

831
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,102
Someone's lying there

832
01:19:20,245 --> 01:19:21,370
Bleeding badly

833
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:24,815
What? Bleeding badly

834
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,819
Mister

835
01:19:27,778 --> 01:19:30,507
Yang Fifth

836
01:19:34,614 --> 01:19:38,242
Yang Fifth...

837
01:19:41,555 --> 01:19:42,851
What is it?

838
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,410
Abbot, this man

839
01:19:44,574 --> 01:19:46,336
He works at the inn
at the bottom of the hill

840
01:19:46,518 --> 01:19:48,678
He's looking for Yang Fifth

841
01:19:54,604 --> 01:19:56,503
Fifth...

842
01:19:56,686 --> 01:20:00,121
Mister, I'm Yang Fifth

843
01:20:00,782 --> 01:20:02,544
We've never met before

844
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:13,909
The Dragon Head Staff?

845
01:20:14,073 --> 01:20:16,973
Miss Yang

846
01:20:26,185 --> 01:20:27,583
My 8th sister

847
01:20:30,418 --> 01:20:32,078
She...

848
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:37,337
She got ambushed in the inn

849
01:20:44,857 --> 01:20:45,345
Fifth...

850
01:20:45,482 --> 01:20:52,353
Amitabha Buddha

851
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:34,825
I must go to her, abbot

852
01:21:35,734 --> 01:21:37,257
Amitabha Buddha

853
01:21:37,677 --> 01:21:41,203
My sister is a woman, but she's brave

854
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,519
The worldly matters
have nothing to do with me

855
01:21:44,757 --> 01:21:46,781
The Buddha has a weapon
to fight the evils

856
01:21:46,978 --> 01:21:48,467
Then it's only normal that
I do what's right

857
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:50,941
Remember what you promised us

858
01:21:51,143 --> 01:21:56,580
I look at the Buddha,
and I think of my family

859
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:01,815
You can't break the rules
in front of Buddha

860
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:12,241
Abbot

861
01:22:12,382 --> 01:22:14,349
I treat everyone equally

862
01:22:14,533 --> 01:22:15,499
I'm sorry about this

863
01:22:34,384 --> 01:22:35,577
Very good

864
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:34,682
What are you doing here
with so many poles?

865
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:37,784
Are you here to stay
or asking for directions?

866
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:41,669
Neither. I'm here to deliver the poles

867
01:25:43,283 --> 01:25:44,249
What poles?

868
01:25:44,393 --> 01:25:48,726
The poles of righteousness

869
01:25:59,907 --> 01:26:02,875
You can break one,
but you can't break them all

870
01:26:03,377 --> 01:26:05,105
Where are you from?

871
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,934
Wutai Mountain

872
01:26:07,993 --> 01:26:09,823
You must be connected to the Yangs

873
01:26:10,006 --> 01:26:11,563
You barbarians

874
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,631
Catch him

875
01:26:34,577 --> 01:26:36,271
Go

876
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:45,950
Yang Fifth, you'll die as a monk

877
01:27:46,207 --> 01:27:48,071
I fear no death

878
01:27:48,255 --> 01:27:49,221
Where's my sister?

879
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:52,357
She's in the coffin below

880
01:27:52,906 --> 01:27:53,997
8th sister

881
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:22,810
Pan Mei, you'll pay for everything

882
01:28:24,798 --> 01:28:27,061
Yang Fifth, you won't get away today

883
01:28:27,262 --> 01:28:28,125
Come on

884
01:29:25,117 --> 01:29:26,242
8th sister

885
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,161
8th sister, you...

886
01:29:49,341 --> 01:29:50,398
5th brother

887
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,018
5th brother, come home

888
01:30:02,216 --> 01:30:03,204
Sister

889
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:05,764
Leave me. Go, quick

890
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:06,861
No

891
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:56,181
8th sister

892
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,479
5th brother

893
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,158
5th brother

894
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,527
Abbot

895
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:18,860
Kill

896
01:32:50,327 --> 01:32:50,917
Thank you

897
01:32:51,055 --> 01:32:53,022
You broke the rule, abbot

898
01:32:53,205 --> 01:32:55,502
I didn't, we're here
to chase away the wolves

899
01:32:57,926 --> 01:33:00,393
You've got your revenge

900
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:02,899
Let's beat the wolves

901
01:33:03,062 --> 01:33:03,993
Yes

902
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:35,325
Traitor

903
01:35:47,355 --> 01:35:49,254
You traitor

904
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:00,360
Amitabha Buddha

905
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,474
8th sister

906
01:36:06,616 --> 01:36:07,809
5th brother

907
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,166
Take his body with you back to the court

908
01:36:13,453 --> 01:36:15,477
5th brother,
please don't go back to the temple

909
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:17,335
He won't return

910
01:36:18,208 --> 01:36:23,144
5th brother...

911
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:30,175
8th sister, the world is my home

912
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:31,925
5th brother
