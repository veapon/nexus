罗马帝国在全盛时期的版图

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,360
由非洲沙漠延伸至

英格兰北部边境

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,270
罗马皇帝更掌控了全世界

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,470
三分之一以上人口的生杀大权

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,370
在西元180年的冬天 马可・奥勒留皇帝(著名的哲学皇帝)

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,750
12年征战讨伐日耳曼野蛮部落的行动

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,220
即将宣告结束

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,550
只要扫平最后一处据点 罗马大军便可获得胜利

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,050
而帝国从此可以永享太平

33

我们很快就会知道了

34
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,270
士兵 把投石车往前挪点
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.

35
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,660
- 射程不够远 - 射程没问题
- They're out of range. - Range is good.

36
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,790
- 可能会误伤轻骑兵的... - 不用担心 同意吧?

37
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,550
他们拒绝投降
They say no.

38
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,040
他们应该认命了 他们已被征服了
People should know when they're conquered.

39
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,300
你会吗 昆塔斯?
Would you, Quintus?

40
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,510
我会吗?
Would I?

50
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,440

保持队形 跟我冲啊
Hold the line! Stay with me!

52
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,220
如果你发现自己落单了
If you find yourself alone,

53
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,330
迎着阳光 独自驰骋在草原上时
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,

54
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,700
不用迷惑
do not be troubled.

55
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,170
那是因为你已在天堂了 你已经阵亡了
For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!

56
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,000
兄弟们...
Brothers,

57
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,220
我们生平的事迹
what we do in life

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,930
将永远流传
echoes in eternity.

拉!
Pull!

60
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,370
投石车准备就绪 长官!

62
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,260
- 点火! - 点火!

63
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,810
弓箭手 拉满弓!

71
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,490
跟着我冲!
Stay with me!

72
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,000
罗马必胜!
Roma victor!

73
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,070
普利托里亚十四

74
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,040
你认为他真的快死了吗?
Do you think he's really dying?

75
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,460
十年来 他一直过都是这样子
He's been dying for 10 years.

76
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,940
如果他不是快不行了 就不会派人来召见我们了
If he werert really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.

77
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,820
也许他只是想念我们呢
Maybe he just misses us.

78
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,490
那元老会的议员们呢? 没事他不会传唤他们的 除非
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if...

79
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,870
安静点 康莫德斯
Peace, Commodus.

80
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,240
在路上两星期里
After two weeks on the road,

81
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,010
你老是疑神疑鬼的 烦死我了
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

82
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,860
他已作了决定 他将会宣布
He's made his decision. He's going to announce it.

83
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,400
传位给我
He will name me.

84
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,910
我将要做的第一件事...
The first thing I shall do when...

85
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,980
就是举行大型的竞技比赛来荣耀他
Is honor him with games won'thy of His Majesty.

86
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,920
现在 我最想做的第一件事 就是淋个热水浴
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.

87
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,420
殿下?
Your Highness?

88
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,220
看来我们就快到了
We seem to be almost there, sir.

89
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,590
- 殿下 - 皇帝在哪里?
- Sire. - Where's the Emperor?

90
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,340
殿下 他在前线 已经去了19天了
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.

91
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,640
伤员还在不断的运回来
The wounded are still coming in.

92
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,350
备马
My horse.

93
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,120
殿下
My lord.

94
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,740
给我一个吻?
Kiss?

95
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
你再次证明了你的勇猛 马西墨斯
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.

96
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,080
希望这是最后一次了
Let us hope, for the last time.

97
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,730
我们已经没有敌人了 陛下
There's no one left to fight, sire.

98
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,490
永远不能掉以轻心 敌人无处不在
There is always someone left to fight.

99
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,510
我该怎样奖赏罗马最伟大的将军呢?
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

100
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,510
恩准我回家
Let me go home.

101
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,310
家
Home.

102
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,650
凯撒 他们向你致敬
They honor you, Caesar.

103
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,540
是向你致敬 马西墨斯 他们尊敬你
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

104
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,230
我错过了这次的战役了吗?
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

105
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
你错过了整场战争
You have missed the war.

106
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,990
父亲 恭喜你
Father, congratulations.

107
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,850
我会献上100头公牛来庆祝你的胜利
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph.

108
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,600
那到不必
Save the bulls.

109
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,160
向马西墨斯致敬吧 是他打赢了这场战役
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

110
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,910
- 将军 - 陛下
- General. - Highness.

111
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,490
罗马向你致敬 而我以兄弟的身份拥抱你
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.

112
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,360
很久没见了 老朋友
It has been too long, my old friend.

113
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,910
陛下
Highness.

114
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,590
来 父亲 让我来扶你
Here, Father. Take my arm.

115
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,390
我想我是时候离开了
I think it is time for me to leave.

116
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,870
这就是罗马的荣耀
So much for the glory of Rome.

117
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,710
宏伟的战役
Magnificent battle.

118
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,340
将军 还活着?
General. Still alive?

119
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,720
还活着
Still alive.

120
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,430
天上的诸神也有幽默感的
The gods must have a sense of humor.

121
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,180
- 他们一定特别照顾你 - 维勒瑞斯
- The gods must love you. - Valerius.

122
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,140
将军 你是要回军营呢? 还是回罗马?
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

123
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,330
回家 我妻子孩子还有庄稼都在等着我
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

124
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,270
农夫马西墨斯 我还是无法想象你当农夫的样子
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.

125
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,980
你知道的 泥垢要比血迹容易洗掉 昆塔斯
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

126
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,150
- 他在这里 - 陛下
- Here he is. - Highness.

127
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,410
议员盖尔斯 议员佛克
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

128
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,370
当心盖尔斯 他会替你洗脑
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,

129
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,040
接着某天你醒来 就只会高喊"共和万岁 共和万岁"
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

130
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,790
有何不可? 毕竟罗马创建时是共和制的
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.

131
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,750
在共和制下 共和国是由元老会来执政的
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.

132
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,050
当然 议员盖尔斯绝不是因此才从政的
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.

133
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,130
你支持谁呢? 将军? 皇帝还是元老院?
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?

134
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,470
军人的职责就是
A soldier has the advantage

135
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,970
保家卫国上阵杀敌 议员
of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

136
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,060
有军队支持 你要从政易如反掌
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.

137
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,290
我警告了你 二位 失陪一下
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.

138
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,550
马西墨斯
Maximus.

139
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,130
我将会需要你的帮助
I'm going to need good men like you.

140
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,790
有什么我可以效劳的 殿下?
How may I be of service, Highness?

141
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,920
只有你才知道该如何指挥军队
You're a man who knows what it is to command.

142
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,340
在你的领导下 无人不服 战无不胜
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.

143
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,230
但那些议员们只会争吵算计阿谀奉承还有欺骗
But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive.

144
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,760
马西墨斯 我们必须从政客们的手中拯救罗马
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.

145
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,990
到时候我能期待你的帮助吗?
Can I count on you when the time comes?

146
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,730
殿下 只要你父亲恩准我离开 我打算立刻回家去
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.

147
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,000
回家? 你是应该回家看看
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

148
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,340
可别耽于安逸 也许我很快就会需要你的
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.

149
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,010
露西拉来了 你知道吗?
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

150
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,430
她还没有忘记你
She's not forgotten you.

151
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,060
而现在 你是个英雄了
And now, you're the great man.

152
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,870
如果你生为男人的话
If only you had been born a man,

153
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,200
你会成为一位伟大的凯撒
what a Caesar you would have made.

154
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,330
父亲
Father.

155
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,320
你会很强壮
You would have been strong.

156
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,680
我想知道 你会很公正吗?
I wonder, would you have been just?

157
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,100
我不会辜负你对我的教导和期望
I would have been what you taught me to be.

158
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,620
旅途怎样?
How was yourjourney?

159
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,480
漫长 不舒服 为什么要我来?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

160
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,650
我需要你的帮忙 和你弟弟有关
I need your help. With your brother.

161
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
当然
Of course.

162
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,990
他爱你 他一向都很爱你
He loves you. He always has.

163
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,240
另外
And

164
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,280
他现在比往常更需要你
he will need you now, more than ever.

165
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,250
不谈政治了
Enough of politics.

166
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,460
我们何不假装你是一个可爱的女儿
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter,

167
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,420
而我则是个好父亲
and I am a good father.

168
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,720
令人愉快的假设 不是吗?
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

169
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,200
早上好
Good morning to you.

170
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,880
再给我三匹马
I need three more horses.

171
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,930
一! 二! 三!
One! Two! Three!

172
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,920
四!
Four!

173
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,270
一! 二!
One! Two!

174
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,410
你召见我吗 凯撒?
You sent for me, Caesar?

175
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,040
- 凯撒? - 再告诉我一遍 马西墨斯
- Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus.

176
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,840
我们为什么会在这里?
Why are we here?

177
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,680
为了罗马的荣耀 陛下
For the glory of the empire, sire.

178
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,180
没错
Yes.

179
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,180
对 我记起来了
Yes, I remember.

180
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,520
看到那地图了吗 马西墨斯?
Do you see that map, Maximus?

181
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,860
那就是我所创建的世界
That is the world which I created.

182
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,360
25年来...
For 25 years,

183
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,780
我四处征战 半生戎马 才有今天的局面
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.

184
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,940
自从我成为凯撒后 据我所知只有四年没有战争
Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war.

185
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,540
在20年里 只有四年的和平
Four years of peace in 20.

186
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,330
这一切究竟是为了什么?
And for what?

187
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,550
我只给大家带来了战争 仅此而已
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

188
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,120
凯撒 你的一生...
Caesar, your life...

189
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,810
求你 不要那么叫我了
Please. Please don't call me that.

190
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,350
过来
Come. Please.

191
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,520
过来坐下
Come sit.

192
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,060
让我们好好谈谈
Let us talk together now,

193
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,070
纯粹是男人之间的闲聊
very simply, as men.

194
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,570
说吧 马西墨斯
Well, Maximus,

195
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,120
说吧
talk.

196
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,060
我有5000个人在外面的泥浆中挨冻
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.

197
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,940
其中3000人浑身是伤
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.

198
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,480
另外有2000人再也无法离开这里 他们都已经死了
Two thousand will never leave this place.

199
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,780
我绝不相信他们的牺牲毫无意义
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.

200
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,490
那你相信什么 马西墨斯?
And what would you believe?

201
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,410
他们为了你和罗马而战
They fought for you and for Rome.

202
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,300
罗马是什么 马西墨斯?
And what is Rome, Maximus?

203
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,870
我到过世界上别的许多地方
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

204
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,960
那里既冷酷又阴暗 罗马象征着光明
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.

205
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
但你从没去过那里
Yet you have never been there.

206
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,510
你没看见罗马已经变成什么样了
You have not seen what it has become.

207
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,650
我快要死了 马西墨斯
I am dying, Maximus.

208
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,550
当一个快死的时候
When a man sees his end,

209
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,700
他会想知道自己的一生是否有价值
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.

210
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,980
人们将来会怎么评价我呢?
How will the world speak my name in years to come?

211
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,360
会推崇我是个哲学家?
Will I be known as the philosopher?

212
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
一名勇士?
The warrior?

213
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,670
还是位暴君?
The tyrant?

214
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,800
或是让罗马回归自我的皇帝?
Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self?

215
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
恢复共和制的罗马是个梦想
There was once a dream that was Rome.

216
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,040
你只能悄悄地说
You could only whisper it.

217
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,210
再大声一点的话 它将会消失
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish,

218
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,140
它是如此的脆弱
it was so fragile.

219
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,150
我担心在残酷的现实环境中 他根本无法存活下去
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

220
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,150
马西墨斯
Maximus,

221
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,990
让我们说点悄悄话
let us whisper now,

222
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,950
只有我和你
together, you and I.

223
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
你有个儿子
You have a son.

224
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,540
说说你讲你的家庭
Tell me about your home.

225
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,670
我家在提基洛附近的山丘上
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

226
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,800
一个非常简单的地方
A very simple place.

227
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,120
在阳光下的暖和的红砖屋
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

228
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,720
白天 菜园里飘着药草的香味
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,

229
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,390
到了晚上则是茉莉花的味道
jasmine in the evening.

230
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,650
门外有一棵高大的白杨树
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

231
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,760
无花果树 苹果树和梨树
Figs, apples, pears.

232
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,690
土壤是黑色的 比我妻子的头发还黑
The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair.

233
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,890
南坡上种葡萄 北坡种着橄榄
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.

234
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,220
野生的小马在我家附近玩耍 他们常逗我的儿子玩
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son.

235
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,940
他也想变成一匹小马
He wants to be one of them.

236
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,810
你上一次回家是什么时候?
When was the last time you were home?

237
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,040
2年又264天 还要算上今天早上
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

238
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,960
我羡慕你 马西墨斯 你有个幸福的家庭
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

239
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,380
值得你为它如此奋斗
Worth fighting for

240
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,340
在你回家之前
There is one more duty

241
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,640
我希望你帮我做最后一件事
that I ask of you before you go home.

242
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,670
你要我做什么 凯撒?
What would you have me do, Caesar?

243
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,400
我要你在我死后成为罗马的保护者
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.

244
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,570
我会把政权交给你
I will empower you to one end alone,

245
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,570
将权力还给罗马的人民
to give power back to the people of Rome,

246
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,990
结束危害罗马的贪污腐败
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

247
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,920
你愿意接受这光荣的使命吗?
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?

248
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,210
我打心眼里...不愿意
With all my heart, no.

249
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,510
马西墨斯
Maximus,

250
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
这就是我一定要授权给你的原因
that is why it must be you.

251
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,170
但这应该是行政官或者议员的职责
But surely a prefect, a senator,

252
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,960
一个了解罗马 熟悉政治的人
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.

253
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,020
但你还没被罗马的政治腐蚀
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.

254
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,660
- 康莫德斯呢? - 康莫德斯不是正人君子
- And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man.

255
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,230
你比谁都要清楚这一点
You have known that since you were young.

256
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,270
康莫德斯不能统治罗马
Commodus cannot rule.

257
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,750
绝对不可以
He must not rule.

258
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,080
我要是有你这样的儿子就好了
You are the son that I should have had.

259
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,630
康莫德斯会接受我的决定的
Commodus will accept my decision.

260
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,680
他知道军队只对你效忠
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.

261
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,130
我需要时间考虑
I need some time, sire.

262
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,670
好吧
Yes.

263
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,320
我希望在日落之前你能答应我的请求
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

264
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,570
现在 象儿子般拥抱我吧
Now embrace me as my son.

265
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,700
顺便再帮我拿条毯子来
And bring an old man another blanket.

266
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,430
- 我父亲现在只宠爱你 - 夫人
- My father favors you now. - My lady.

267
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,020
- 以前不是这样 - 很多东西都改变了
- It was not always so. - Many things change.

268
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,520
话是没错 但不是所有的事情
Many things. Not everything.

269
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,060
马西墨斯 站住
Maximus, stop.

270
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,530
让我看看你的脸
Let me see your face.

271
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,780
- 你看起来很沮丧 - 我失去了很多部下
- You seem upset. - I lost many men.

272
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,040
我父亲找你有什么事?
What did my father want with you?

273
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,080
在我回家前祝我一路顺风
To wish me well before I leave for home.

274
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,210
你在撒谎
You're lying.

275
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,860
我总能看穿你在撒谎 因为你不精于此道
I could always tell when you were lying, because you were never any good at it.

276
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,450
我一直都不习惯你的安慰
I never acquired your comfort with it.

277
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,570
没错
True.

278
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,760
反正你也不需要
But then you never had to.

279
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,970
对军人来说 生活要简单的多
Life is more simple for a soldier.

280
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,980
或许你觉得我很无情?
Or do you think me heartless?

281
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,730
我觉得你具备生存的天分
I think you have a talent for survival.

282
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,280
马西墨斯 停下
Maximus, stop.

283
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,350
再次见到我真的这么可怕吗?
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

284
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,950
不 我只是厌倦了战争
No. I'm tired from battle.

285
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,370
看到我父亲是那么脆弱 你很心痛
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

286
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,920
康莫德斯期望父亲会很快宣布他是断任者
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.

287
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,470
你会像追随我父亲那样对我弟弟效忠吗?
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?

288
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,810
我会永远对罗马效忠
I will always serve Rome.

289
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,500
你知道吗
Do you know,

290
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,100
我还是不忘替你祈祷
I still remember you in my prayers.

291
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,070
是的 我有祈祷
Oh, yes. I pray.

292
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,950
听到你丈夫去世的消息我很难过 我替他追悼
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.

293
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,660
- 谢谢你 - 我听说你有个儿子
- Thank you. - And I hear you have a son.

294
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,750
是 他叫卢修斯
Yes. Lucius.

295
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,320
他快八岁了
He'll be nearly eight years old.

296
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,670
我儿子也快八岁
My son is also nearly eight.

297
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,640
谢谢你的祈祷
I thank you for your prayers.

298
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,940
祖先们 我祈求你们指引我
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

299
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,820
天上的母亲 求你指示我未来的方向
Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.

300
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,240
天上的父亲 求您保佑我的妻儿
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.

301
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,330
请转告他们 我只是为再次拥抱他们而活
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

302
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,660
祖先们 我荣耀你们
Ancestors, I honor you,

303
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,130
并将谨遵祖训 有尊严的活下去
and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

304
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,230
西斯洛
Cicero.

305
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,950
主人
Sir.

306
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,950
我不觉得履行义务很困难吗?
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

307
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,250
有时我做我想做事
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

308
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,550
其余的时间我做我应该做的事
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

309
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,430
也许我们还是不能回家去
We may not be able to go home, after all.

310
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,360
你准备好对罗马履行你的职责了吗?
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

311
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,940
是的 父亲
Yes, Father.

312
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,110
你不会成为皇帝
You will not be emperor.

313
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,770
哪位年长的智者会取代我的地位?
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

314
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,410
我会将政权移交给马西墨斯
My powers will pass to Maximus,

315
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
直到确认
to hold in trust,

316
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,170
元老院准备好再次治理罗马
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

317
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,180
罗马会再度成为共和国
Rome is to be a republic again.

318
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,720
- 马西墨斯 - 对
- Maximus. - Yes.

319
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,060
我的决定使你失望了吗?
My decision disappoints you?

320
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,650
你曾写信给我
You wrote to me once,

321
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,950
上面列举了四种主要的美德
listing the four chief virtues.

322
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,060
智慧...
Wisdom,

323
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,600
公正...
justice,

324
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,160
坚毅...
fortitude,

325
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,370
和自律
and temperance.

326
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,670
读完信后我就明白自己一种都不具备
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

327
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,090
但我有其他的美德 父亲
But I have other virtues, Father.

328
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,640
野心
Ambition.

329
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,850
当它驱使我们做的更优秀的时候 这也是一种美德
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.

330
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,270
智谋 勇气
Resourcefulness, courage.

331
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,650
也许和行军打仗无关 但...勇气也有很多种的
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage.

332
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,530
对家庭的全心全意的奉献...
Devotion to my family,

333
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,030
还有对你的爱
to you.

334
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,330
但你完全不欣赏我所有的优点
But none of my virtues were on your list.

335
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,900
就像你根本不希望有我这样的儿子
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.

336
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,380
康莫德斯
Commodus,

337
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,920
你想的太多了
you go too far.

338
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,720
我向天上的诸神祈求...
I searched the faces of the gods

339
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,850
让我能够讨你欢心 让你能够以我为荣
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

340
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,720
只要一句赞美
One kind word,

341
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,060
或是一个拥抱...
one full hug,

342
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,900
把我紧紧的抱在你怀里
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,

343
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,570
都会象慈蔼的阳光温暖我的心
would have been like the sun on my heart for 1, 000 years.

344
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,810
为什么你如此讨厌我?
What is it in me you hate so much?

345
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,120
康莫德斯
Commodus.

346
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,290
我不敢有任何奢求...
All I've ever wanted

347
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,830
只求能符合你的期望 凯撒
was to live up to you, Caesar.

348
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,750
- 父亲 - 康莫德斯...
- Father. - Commodus,

349
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,260
养子不教...
your faults as a son

350
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,600
实为我作为父亲的过错啊
is my failure as a father.

351
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,780
过来
Come.

352
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,780
父亲
Father.

353
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,420
为了让你能爱我...
I would butcher the whole world,

354
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,800
即使血洗天下我也在所不惜!
if you would only have loved me!

355
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,550
马西墨斯 皇帝有急事要找你
Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent.

356
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,850
和我一起哀悼 兄弟
Lament with me, brother.

357
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,890
我们伟大的父亲去世了
Our great father is dead.

358
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,210
他怎样死的?
How did he die?

359
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,160
医生们说是呼吸衰竭
The surgeons say there was no pain.

360
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,390
他在睡梦中安详的走了
His breath gave out as he slept.

361
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,400
父亲
Father.

362
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,740
新皇帝需要你的忠诚 马西墨斯
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.

363
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,700
宣誓效忠于我
Take my hand.

364
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,240
我只给你一次机会
I only offer it once.

365
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,760
昆塔斯
Quintus.

366
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
凯撒万岁
Hail, Caesar.

367
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,050
我要去见议员们 我需要他们的意见
I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel.

368
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,720
- 去叫醒盖尔斯和佛克 - 盖尔斯和佛克
- Wake Gaius and Falco. - Gaius and Falco.

369
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,030
- 我的剑 - 剑
- Sword. - Sword.

370
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,430
马西墨斯 请三思而行 你的举动太过轻率
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.

371
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,330
轻率? 皇帝是被人谋杀的
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

372
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,290
皇帝是自然死亡
The emperor died of natural causes.

373
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,290
- 你为什么全副武装 昆塔斯? - 守卫!
- Why are you armed, Quintus? - Guards!

374
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,670
请不要反抗 马西墨斯请不要反抗 马西墨斯
Please don't fight, Maximus.

375
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,720
我很抱歉 是凯撒下的命令
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

376
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,970
骑马西行...
Ride until dawn,

377
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,750
在拂晓前处死他
and then execute him.

378
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,270
昆塔斯 看着我 看着我!
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

379
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,440
答应我 你会好好照顾我的家人
Promise me that you will look after my family.

380
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,190
你的家人会在黄泉路上与你相会的
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

381
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,300
跪下

382
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,210
天上的父亲 请保护我的妻子和儿子

383
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,390
转告他们我只为再次拥抱他们而活
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.

384
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,400
至少让我死的痛快点
At least give me a clean death.

385
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,900
一个军人式的死亡
A soldier's death.

386
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,390
有时候 霜会把刀刃粘住的
The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick.

387
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,450
禁卫兵!
Praetorian!

388
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
你上次回家是什么时候?
When was the last time you were home?

389

2年264天 再算上今天早晨
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.

00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,070
我会尝试像你教导一样有尊严地生活
I will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.

392
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,610
告诉他们 我生存是为了再次拥抱他们
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

393
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,110
世间名利 于我皆如粪土
...with a ready sword, for all else is dust and air.

394
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,370
告诉他们 我生存是为了再次拥抱他们
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.

395
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,760
世间名利 于我皆如粪土
For all else is dust and air.

396
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,030
爸爸!
Papa!

397
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,610

现在还不是时候
Not yet.

400
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,220
不! 他们能洁净你的伤口 等着瞧吧

402
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,200
他们会拿你喂狮子的
They'll feed you to the lions.

403
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,590
它们比我们更值钱
They are won'th more than we are.

404
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,060

Every day is a great day when you are here,

409
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,730
今天...是你最幸运的一天
but today is your most fortunate day.

410
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,070
你卖给我的那些长颈鹿...根本不会交配
Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate.

411
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,620
他们只会走来走去吃东西却不交配
Theyjust walk around eating and not mating.

412
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,830
你卖给我的长颈鹿是同性恋
You sold me queer giraffes.

413
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,420
- 快把钱退还给我 - 不可能
- I want my money back. - Not a chance.

414
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,840
- 我给你好价钱 - 什么货?
- I do special price for you. - On what?

415
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,850
你看过我的新货了吗? 去看看吧
Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.

416
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,560
他们有谁懂得搏斗吗? 我最近会有一场比赛
Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up.

417
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,430
有些人善于搏斗 其他人只会去送死
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.

418
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,850
我想两种人你都需要
You need both, I think.

419
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,160
站起来!
Get up.

420
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,800
你以前是干什么的?
What's your trade?

421
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,740
我是猎人
I was a hunter.

422
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,550
不 我是在迦太基附近的盐矿场把他买来的
No, I bought him from a salt mine in Can'thage.

423
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,720
坐下
Sit down.

424
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,930
军团的标记
Mark of the legion.

425
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,860
- 逃兵 - 也许是吧 有谁在乎呢?
- Deserter. - Maybe so, but who cares?

426
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,420
他是个西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

427
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,470
我要六个人... 给你1000
I'll take six. For 1, 000.

428
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:19,050
一千? 那个努米底亚人就值2000了
1, 000? The Numidian alone is won'th 2, 000.

429
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,220
这群奴隶根本不中用
These slaves are rotten.

430
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,490
人不可貌相 不 不 不 不 等等
It all adds to the flavor. No, no, no, wait! Wait!

431
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,700
等一下! 价钱好商量
I can negotiate.

432
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,980
我给你2000...另外给4000买那些野兽
I'll give you 2, 000, and 4, 000 for the beasts.

433
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,210
既然是老朋友 一共给你5000
That's 5, 000 for an old friend.

434
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,260
快一点! 还有多久才能回到家?
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?

435
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,280
我是普罗西莫!
I am Proximo.

436
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,510
接下来的几天 将是你们悲惨的日子...
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,

437
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,810
结束前的最后的几天 我会和你们异常的亲近
which will be the last of your miserable lives,

438
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:07,240
胜过把你们带到这世界来的该死的母亲!
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.

439
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,870
我不是花钱买你们来做伴的!
I did not pay good money for you for your company.

440
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,290
我出钱是为了从你们的死亡中获利
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.

441
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,800
你们的人生开始时 有母亲在旁边
And as your mother was there at your beginning,

442
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,390
结束时 我会在你们的身旁
so I shall be there at your end.

443
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:27,930
等到死亡的命运降临时
And when you die, and die you shall,

444
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,770
你们将因人们的欢呼而升华
your transition shall be to the sound of...

445
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,940
角斗士们
Gladiators,

446
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,610
我向你们致敬
I salute you.

447
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,410
红色
Red.

448
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,830
黄色
Yellow.

449
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,680
很好
Good.

450
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,850
红色
- Red. - Red.

451
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,060
西班牙人!
Spaniard.

452
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,760
到此为止!
That's enough for the moment!

453
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,720
他迟早得认命的
His time will come.

454
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,810
下一个!
Next.

455
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,490
西班牙佬
Spaniard,

456
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,790
你为什么不还手?
why don't you fight?

457
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,610
我们必须要搏斗
We all have to fight.

458
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,420
我决不搏斗
Well, I don't fight.

459
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,280
我不应在这里 我是书吏 我负责记录...
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words,

460
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,240
我会说七种语言
and speak seven languages.

461
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,380
那好
Good.

462
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,340
明天你可用七种语言尖叫
Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages.

463
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,980
或许书吏是例外 可以赢取自由
Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom.

464
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,270
自由?
Freedom?

465
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,190
我需要做什么?
What do I have to do?

466
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,890
你进竞技场 杀了我
You go in the arena and you kill me.

467
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,360
还有他...
And him,

468
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,060
和这努米底亚人...
and the Numidian,

469
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,740
和这逃兵
and the deserter.

470
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,770
再多100个人
And 100 more.

471
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,710
直到你杀了所有斗士 你便自由了
And when there's no more to fight, you're free.

472
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,130
我做不到
I can't do that.

473
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,380
做不到?
No?

474
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,050
但我做得到
But I can.

475
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,780
那是你信奉的神吗?
Is that the sign of your gods?

476
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,080
这样做他们不会生气吗?
Will that not anger them?

477
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,060
神眷顾你
The gods favor you.

478
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,600
红色是天神的颜色
Red is the gods' color.

479
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,150
今天你会需要他们帮助
You will need their help today.

480
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,150
普罗西莫!
Proximo!

481
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,640
一直是日耳曼领导的?
Still leading with the German?

482
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,820
观众喜欢野蛮人
The crowd love a barbarian.

483
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,190
而且他令我富有
Besides that, he's making me rich.

484
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,910
那努米底亚人搏斗过没有?
Has that Numidian fought before?

485
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,320
没有 第一次
No, first time.

486
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,380
那个 是奴隶 士兵?
And that one, laborer, soldier?

487
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,030
他是西班牙人
He's a Spaniard.

488
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,220
在场上像个废人一样
He might as well be a eunuch for what he brings to the ring.

489
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,370
五百元买努米底亚人 和西班牙人那队会过关
500 sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through.

490
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,180
一千元 如果努米底亚人独自过关
And 1, 000, that the Numidian makes it through alone.

491
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:25,810
你要我买自己的人输?
Are you asking me to bet against my own man?

492
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,130
那是不道德的
It's unethical.

493
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,110
如果我加到二千元呢?
What if I make it 2, 000?

494
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,460
你们当中有些人不愿意上场搏斗
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

495
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,050
有些觉得你不能搏斗
some that you can't fight.

496
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,880
他们都喜欢唱高调 除非真正轮到自己出场
They all say that until they're out there.

497
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,830
你们听
Listen.

498
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,850
- 杀! 杀! 杀! - 杀! 杀! 杀!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

499
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,690
把刀用力刺进别人的身体里
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

500
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,760
观众会为此而向你喝彩 崇拜你
and they will applaud and love you for that.

501
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,280
而你...
And you,

502
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,200
你也会开始为了喝彩声...
you may begin to love them

503
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,450
而爱上他们
for that.

504
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,040
最终 我们都会化为一堆枯骨
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

505
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,880
可悲的是 我们无权选择命运 但...
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

506
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,930
有权决定如何面对死亡...
but we can decide how we meet that end,

507
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,350
惟有如此 才能作为人
in order that we are remembered

508
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,500
被人们追忆
as men.

509
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,640
快!
Come on!

510
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,900
左边的 拿盾牌!
On the left, draw your shields!

511
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,320
右边的 拿剑!
On the right, draw your swords!

512
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,160
- 杀! 杀! - 杀! 杀!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill!

513
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,700
两人一组 红色和黄色一起
Pair them up, red with yellow.

514
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,960
下一个!
Next!

515
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,920
打!
Move!

516
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,270
夺权者!
Usurper!

517
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,690
- 滚开! - 我们不要你统治 康莫德斯!
- Go away! - You'll never rule us, Commodus!

518
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,810
他象个凯旋的英雄般回到罗马 但他到底征服了什么呢?
He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered?

519
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,500
给他点时间 格瑞克斯 他还年轻
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

520
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,890
我相信他可以做的很好
I think he could do very well.

521
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,190
为罗马还是为你?
For Rome, or for you?

522
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,570
卢修斯 去欢迎你的母亲 她会很高兴的
Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.

523
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,080
- 卢修斯! - 妈妈!
- Lucius! - Mother!

524
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,900
向你致敬 凯撒
Hail, Caesar.

525
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,500
议员们
Senators.

526
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,030
罗马欢迎她的新皇帝
Rome greets her new emperor.

527
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,660
你忠心的臣子们向你表示欢迎 陛下
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.

528
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,580
谢谢你 佛克
Thank you, Falco.

529
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,750
说到忠心的子民 我相信他们并不太昂贵
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they werert too expensive.

530
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,840
- 凯撒 - 格瑞克斯
- Caesar. - Gracchus.

531
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,420
罗马为你的归来而欢呼 凯撒
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

532
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,030
有许多政务等你来处理
But there are many matters that require your attention.

533
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,370
请肃静! 肃静!
To order, please. To order.

534
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,600
凯撒 为了请你指引
For your guidance, Caesar,

535
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,480
凯撒 元老院已经拟订一系列的议程 好方便陛下过目...
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols

536
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,650
开始解决城市里的众多问题
to begin addressing the many problems in the city,

537
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,840
首先是希腊区的基础卫生设备...
beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter,

538
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,950
设法消灭该区正在蔓延的瘟疫
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.

539
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,840
所以 如果凯撒...
So, if Caesar...

540
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,890
你难道还不明白 格瑞克斯?
Don't you see, Gracchus?

541
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,600
这才是问题的重点 不是吗?
That's the very problem, isn't it?

542
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,690
我父亲花费毕生的时间...
My father spent all his time at study,

543
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,820
研读书本中的知识和哲学
at books of learning and philosophy.

544
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,320
他的晚年尽在阅读元老院的卷轴中度过
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.

545
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,490
然而自始至终 他却忽略了人民...
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

546
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,270
但元老会就代表人民 陛下
But the senate is the people, sire,

547
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,920
由人民中选出议员 为人民说话
chosen from among the people to speak for the people.

548
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,210
我怀疑民众是否象你一样丰衣足食 格瑞克斯
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

549
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,410
或是像盖尔斯一样妻妾成群
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

550
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,580
我自认了解我的子民
I think I understand my own people.

551
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:38,180
那么 根据您个人的多方面的经验...
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us,

552
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,220
陛下或许会不吝赐教
out of his own extensive experience.

553
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,650
我认为是爱
I call it love.

554
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,360
我会爱民如子 因为他们都是我的子民
I am their father. The people are my children.

555
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,140
我会将他们紧紧的拥抱在我的胸前
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.

556
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,700
陛下 你曾拥抱过身染瘟疫的人吗?
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?

557
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,620
没有 但如果你再打断我的话
No, but if you interrupt me again,

558
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,440
我保证你一定会的
I assure you that you shall.

559
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,880
议员 我弟弟非常疲倦
Senator, my brother is very tired.

560
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:16,050
把议程给我 凯撒应该照人民的意愿行事
Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

561
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,560
夫人 你总是让人不能不服
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.

562
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,940
他们凭什么对我说教?
Who are they to lecture me?

563
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,760
康莫德斯 元老院自有它的用处
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

564
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,740
什么用处? 他们只会耍嘴皮子
What uses? All they do is talk.

565
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:42,480
根本就只需要...你和我...
It should be just you and me and Rome.

566
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,910
千万不可以这么想! 元老院自建国之初就存在着
Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate.

567
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,070
罗马已经变了
Rome has changed.

568
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,210
只要有一个皇帝...就可以治理帝国了
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

569
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,570
当然 让人民继续拥有...
Of course, but leave the people their...

570
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:55,050
幻想
Illusions?

571
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,090
传统
Traditions.

572
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,760
我父亲对野蛮人发动战争...
My father's war against the barbarians.

573
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:06,000
他自己也承认那毫无意义 但是人民敬爱他
He said it himself, it achieved nothing. But the people loved him.

574
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,960
人民总是喜欢胜利的感觉的
The people always love victories.

575
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,730
为什么? 他们并没有目睹战争的残酷
Why? They didn't see the battles.

576
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,010
日耳曼人和他们毫不相关
What do they care about Germania?

577
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,430
他们只关心罗马的富强
They care about the greatness of Rome.

578
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,450
"罗马的富强"
"The greatness of Rome."

579
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,200
那到底是什么呢?
Well, what is that?

580
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,120
是一种理念... 富强
It's an idea. Greatness.

581
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,300
- 富强是一种憧憬 - 没错 一个憧憬
- Greatness is a vision. - Exactly. A vision.

582
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,340
你还不明白吗 露西拉?
Do you not see, Lucilla?

583
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,680
我会给人民一个罗马的新憧憬 他们会为此而敬爱我
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

584
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,730
他们很快就会忘掉那几个爱说教的老头
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.

585
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,450
我会给罗马人民一个前所未有的憧憬
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.

586
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,790
斗士 - 暴力

587
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:59,590
酒 酒 酒! 红酒白酒任君畅饮!
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!

588
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,060
竞技
Games.

589
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,400
整整150天的竞技活动
One hundred and fifty days of games.

590
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,420
他比我想象中的要聪明
He's cleverer than I thought.

591
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,070
聪明 要不是因为害怕他的禁卫队...
Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him,

592
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,140
全罗马的人都会嘲笑他的
if they werert so afraid of his Praetorians.

593
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,030
害怕和好奇...强而有力的组合
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

594
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,560
你真的认为民众会被他的手段所欺骗?
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?

595
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,750
我觉得他了解罗马的本质 罗马是由一群乌合之众组成的
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.

596
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,580
变魔术给他们看 就可以转移他们的注意力
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.

597
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,420
夺去他们的自由 他们还是会继续哄堂大笑
Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar.

598
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:46,330
维系着罗马命脉的...并不是元老院里的大理石
The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate.

599
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,430
而是竞技场内的沙地
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

600
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,470
他会把死亡带给人民
He'll bring them death,

601
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,600
而人民会为此而敬爱他
and they will love him for it.

602
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,360
你只需杀杀杀
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

603
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,860
观众不是要屠夫 他们要英雄
The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero.

604
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,990
我们要他们不断回来看
We want them to keep coming back.

605
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:30,260
所以不要只顾把他们斩杀 记着你是要娱乐观众
So don't just hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer.

606
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,220
西班牙人
Spaniard.

607
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,570
快去娱乐他们!
So entertain!

608
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,800
你们还不满意吗? 你们还不满意吗?
Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?

609
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,350
你们不正是为此而来这里的吗?
Is this not why you're here?

610
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,980
西班牙人!
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

611
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:09,440
- 西班牙人! 西班牙人! 西班牙人! - 西班牙人! 西班牙人! 西班牙人!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! - Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

612
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:24,000
你想要些什么?
What do you want?

613
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,710
女孩?
Girl?

614
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,920
男孩?
Boy?

615
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,090
- 你找我有事? - 是的
- You sent for me. - Yes, I did.

616
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,250
西班牙人 你的确很棒 但你还不是最厉害的
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.

617
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,500
你可以变的更优秀
You could be magnificent.

618
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,100
我杀人是因为你要我这么做 这样就够了
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

619
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,020
也许在乡下小地方是够了 但在罗马却行不通
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.

620
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,310
那年轻皇帝安排了一系列表演...
The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles

621
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:57,580
来纪念他的父亲 马可・奥勒留
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.

622
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,080
我觉得很好笑...
I find that amusing,

623
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,480
因为正是马可・奥勒留...
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

624
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,040
博学 无所不知的马可・奥勒留...禁止了搏斗竞技活动
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down.

625
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:14,160
在这个跳蚤为患的村庄...
So finally, after five years of scratching a living

626
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,450
生活了五年以后
in flea-infested villages,

627
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:19,600
我们终于要回到属于我们的地方...
we're finally going back to where we belong.

628
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,890
罗马竞技场
The Colosseum.

629
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:26,940
你应该去看看竞技场 西班牙人
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

630
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,320
五万罗马观众...
Fifty thousand Romans,

631
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,110
注视着你斗剑时的一举一动
watching every movement of your sword,

632
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:39,030
期待你挥出致命的一击
willing you to make that killer blow.

633
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,830
在你挥剑之前的寂静...和那之后的骚动
The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards.

634
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,460
喧闹声不断的提高...
It rises. It rises up,

635
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:51,300
就象...一场暴风雨...
like a storm.

636
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,740
而你自己就是雷神
As if you were the thunder god himself.

637
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,800
- 你曾是个角斗士? - 对 我是
- You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was.

638
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:06,420
你赢得了你的自由?
You won your freedom?

639
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,860
很久以前 皇帝...
A long time ago, the Emperor

640
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,590
送给我一把剑
presented me with a rudius.

641
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,400
那只是一把木剑
It's just a wooden sword.

642
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,370
你得到自由的象征
The symbol of your freedom.

643
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,540
他用木剑点了点我的肩 我便获得了自由
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.

644
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,320
你认识马可・奥勒留?
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

645
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,670
我没说我认识他 我说他曾经碰过我的肩膀
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

646
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,380
你问我到底想要什么
You asked me what I want.

647
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,680
我也希望站在皇帝面前...
I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor,

648
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,330
就像你一样
as you did.

649
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:45,850
那你就得听我的 向我学习
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

650
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,770
我并不是最棒的 因为我杀人太快了
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

651
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,650
我之所以是最棒的 是因为民众崇拜我
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

652
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,070
赢取观众的心 你就能赢得自由
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

653
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,410
我会赢得观众的心
I will win the crowd.

654
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,080
我将让他们看见从未见过的东西!
I will give them something they've never seen before.

655
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,090
那么 西班牙人 我们一起去罗马
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together

656
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,570
展开一趟血腥的冒险!
and have bloody adventures.

657
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,450
观众会让我们的荷包撑满...
And the great whore will suckle us

658
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:21,120
开心的笑不出来
until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.

659
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,680
然后...
And then,

660
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:25,930
杀了足够多的人后
when enough men have died,

661
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
也许你就可以得到你的自由
perhaps you will have your freedom.

662
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,320
接着 这个给你
Here. Use this.

663
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:04,220
在远处的某个地方...有我的祖国
It's somewhere out there, my country.

664
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,640
我的家
My home.

665
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,980
我的妻子正在准备食物
My wife is preparing food.

666
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,650
我的女儿从河边打水回来
My daughters carry water from the river.

667
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,030
我还能再见到他们吗?
Will I ever see them again?

668
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,820
我想没机会了
I think, no.

669
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,560
你相信死后能再见到他们吗?
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?

670
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,030
我相信
I think so.

671
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,740
但是 我很快就会死了
But then, I will die soon.

672
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,830
他们会再活很多年
They will not die for many years.

673
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,280
我得等他们
I'll have to wait.

674
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,550
但是你愿意...等
But you would? Wait?

675
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,550
当然
Of course.

676
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,840
你知道的
You see,

677
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,560
我的妻儿...
my wife and my son

678
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,420
已经在等着我了
are already waiting for me.

679
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,190
你会再见到他们的 只是时候未到
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

680
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:59,610
时候未到
Not yet.

681
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,900
- 除非... - 时候未到
- Unless... - Not yet.

682
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,200
时候未到
Not yet.

683
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,630
他在那里
There he is.

684
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,890
出来!
Out.

685
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,020
快出来!
Move, go, out!

686
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,240
老朋友 真高兴又看见你
Good to see you again, old friend.

687
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,290
带给我财富
Bring me fortune.

688
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,760
你以前看见过这么壮观的建筑吗?
Have you ever seen anything like that before?

689
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,430
我不知道他们是如何办到的
I didn't know men could build such things.

690
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,980
赢得观众的心
Win the crowd.

691
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,510
快进去! 走
Get inside. Move.

692
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,900
进去
Inside.

693
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,870
他睡的好香因为他备受宠爱
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

694
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,880
走吧 弟弟 已经很晚了
Come, brother. It's late.

695
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,300
我将使罗马成为当代的奇迹
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

696
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:14,430
那是格瑞克斯和他的朋友所不明白的
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.

697
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,060
我的欲望在脑海中起伏 让我头痛欲裂
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.

698
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,860
康莫德斯 喝了这苏打水
Commodus, drink this tonic.

699
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,870
我看时机已经成熟
I think the time is almost right.

700
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,150
我可以在悼念父亲的庆典上...
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate

701
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:45,320
宣布解散元老院
at the celebration to honor our father.

702
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,380
你认为我该这么做吗?
Do you think I should?

703
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,050
人民能接受吗?
Are the people ready?

704
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,550
我想你现在需要休息
I think you need your rest now.

705
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,290
你会不会留下来陪我?
Will you stay with me?

706
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,810
弟弟 你还是怕黑吗?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

707
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,780
是的
Still.

708
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,910
永远都怕
Always.

709
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,500
- 今晚留下来陪我? - 你知道那不可能
- Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't.

710
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,500
那就吻我一下
Then kiss me.

711
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,850
晚安 弟弟
Sleep, brother.

712
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,760
又聋又哑的仆人...
Having servants who are deaf and mute

713
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,610
至少让我活得久一点
at least ensures I live a little longer.

714
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,720
他们在拘捕学者
They're arresting scholars now.

715
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,660
任何敢表达意见的 甚至包括作家和史学家
Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers.

716
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,210
还有数学家
And mathematicians.

717
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,540
全部送到斗兽场
And all to feed the arena.

718
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,610
国会没有通过戒严法
The Senate did not approve martial law.

719
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:55,550
这全是禁卫军的恐怖势力
This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians.

720
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,830
我入黑后不敢外出
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

721
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:02,460
你更应担心日间的出行
You should be more afraid of your activities during the day.

722
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:07,270
国会中布满他的线眼 由那好色的科高领导的
The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco.

723
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,020
究竟他在想什么? 那是最令我困惑的
But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myself with.

724
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,720
他整天只顾...
He spends all his days singularly obsessed,

725
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,640
筹划你父亲的纪念庆典
planning the festival to honor your father.

726
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,330
他连政府最基本的工作也忽略
He neglects even the most fundamental task of government.

727
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,290
他到底在计划什么?
So just what is he planning?

728
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,270
用什么来支付?
And what pays for it?

729
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,590
每天这些竞技支出庞大 但我们没加新税项
These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

730
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,750
未来
The future.

731
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:38,170
用未来支付
The future pays for it.

732
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,500
他已开始卖贮备的谷物
He's started selling the grain reserves.

733
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,430
不是吧
This can't be true.

734
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,560
他在卖罗马贮备的谷物
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

735
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,060
人民在两年后便会捱饿
The people will be starving in two years.

736
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,090
希望他们享受这游戏...
I hope they're enjoying the games,

737
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,570
那些竞技不久他们便会因此而灭亡
because soon enough they'll be dead because of them.

738
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,240
- 罗马人要知道真相 - 怎样?
- Rome must know this. - And how?

739
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,120
他打算解散国会
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

740
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,290
谁会及时告诉他们? 你 格瑞克斯?
And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

741
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,110
你 盖尔斯
You, Gaius.

742
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,900
你会否在国会上发表演说
Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate,

743
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,750
指责我哥哥?
denouncing my brother?

744
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:15,840
然后看着你全家被推进斗兽场?
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

745
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,170
谁敢?
Who'd dare?

746
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:30,380
我每天都活在恐惧中...
I have been living in a prison of fear every day,

747
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,060
因为我儿子是皇位继承人
because my son is heir to the throne.

748
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,150
他一定要死
He must die.

749
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:48,270
但昆塔斯和禁卫军会夺去控制权
Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves.

750
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:52,230
不 把领导者杀了就不会失去控制权
No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.

751
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,360
露西娜 盖尔斯说得对
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

752
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,590
不能压制禁卫军的话 我们不会成功
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

753
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:01,620
那我们坐以待毙?
So we do nothing?

754
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:04,510
不 我们在暗中计划
No, child. We keep our counsel.

755
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:06,850
我们准备
We prepare.

756
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:12,480
人民支持他 我们的声音便没有力量
As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel.

757
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,690
我们是空气
We are air.

758
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,470
但每天他都在竖敌
But with every day that passes, he makes enemies.

759
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,450
终有一天 他的敌人会多过朋友
One day, he'll have more enemies than friends.

760
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,820
那就是我们行动的时候
And on that day, we will act.

761
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,290
那时我们便反击
Then we will strike.

762
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,960
在那刻来临前...
But until then,

763
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,710
我们是听话的
we are docile.

764
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:37,340
我们是服从的
We are obedient.

765
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,920
而我们亦是不忠的
And we are treacherous.

766
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,720
快!
Come on!

767
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,610
好了 够了
All right, that's enough.

768
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:25,490
皇帝想看搏斗
The Emperor wants battles,

769
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,740
但我不想牺牲最好的斗士
and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.

770
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,160
观众想看竞技 所以皇帝就举办大型的竞技搏斗
The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles.

771
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:34,850
- 你的人将参加迦太基的战役 - 迦太基的大屠杀
- You get the battle of Can'thage. - Massacre of Can'thage.

772
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,210
你为什么不把监狱里的
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

773
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,300
乞丐小偷都找来?
round up all the beggars and thieves?

774
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,550
我们早就这么做了
We've done that.

775
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,010
如果你想要我牺牲
If you want to give away the best gladiators

776
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,260
全帝国最棒的角斗士
in the whole of the empire,

777
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,470
就得给我双倍的钱
then I want double the rates.

778
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,350
我们要么按照合约给钱 要么就取消合约
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.

779
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:52,850
你不高兴吗?
You don't like it?

780
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:56,910
那就滚回你的老家去
Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from.

781
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,170
等等 卡西亚斯!
Cassius, please. You can free us.

782
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:35,100
你就是外号"西班牙人"的角斗士吗?
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?

783
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,330
是的
Yes.

784
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,320
他们都说你力大无穷
They said you were a giant.

785
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,570
他们说你单手就能捏碎大人的头
They said you could crush a mars skull with one hand.

786
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:44,420
大人的? 不可能
A mars? No.

787
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,090
小孩的也许可以
A boy's.

788
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:52,640
- 西班牙有良种马吗? - 有最优秀的马
- Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best.

789
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,770
这是银子 这是黑点
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

790
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,980
他们是我的马
They were my horses.

791
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,980
可是被别人抢走了
They were taken from me.

792
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:06,570
我很喜欢你 西班牙人 我会替你加油的
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

793
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,430
- 他们准你看竞技比赛? - 我舅舅说这会使我变得勇敢
- They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong.

794
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:13,830
- 那你父亲怎样说? - 我父亲死了
- And what does your father say? - My father is dead.

795
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,660
卢修斯少爷 该走了
Master Lucius, it is time.

796
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,270
我得走了
I have to go.

797
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,960
你叫卢修斯?
Your name is Lucius?

798
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:26,750
卢修斯维勒斯 为了纪念我父亲
Lucius Verus, after my father.

799
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:59,120
往下放!
Lower!

800
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:07,150
- 哥地亚斯! - 是?
- Claudius! - Yes?

801
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,670
- 克劳迪亚斯! 还要更多的盾牌! - 好的 长官
- More shields! - All right.

802
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:33,510
当皇上进场时 举起你们的武器向他致敬
When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,

803
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,660
然后齐声向他问候!
and then speak together.

804
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:39,950
面对着皇帝 不可以背对着他!
Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him.

805
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,920
去吧! 为荣誉而战!
Go, and die with honor.

806
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,060
欢迎伟大的凯撒!
Hail, mighty Caesar!

807
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:48,520
- 凯撒万岁! 凯撒万岁! - 凯撒万岁! 凯撒万岁!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

808
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:54,530
- 角斗士们向您致敬! - 角斗士们向您致敬!
- We who are about to die salute you! - We who are about to die salute you!

809
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,820
今天...
On this day

810
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:01,530
我们把战场移到神圣的古代...
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

811
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:06,060
呈现在各位面前的是...
to bring you a re-creation of the second fall

812
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,210
迦太基沦亡的历史战役!
of mighty Can'thage!

813
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:16,340
在荒芜的扎马平原上...
On the barren plain of Zama

814
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,050
汉尼拔将军的...
there stood the invincible armies

815
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:23,060
不可战胜的野蛮人军队正严阵以待
of the barbarian Hannibal.

816
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:26,920
来自所有残暴民族的...
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

野蛮的异帮人!
the barbarian horde!

822
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,450
有人在军队里服役过吗?
Anyone here been in the army?

823
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,470
有 我曾在凡度巴纳和你一起服役

824
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,090
你可以帮我忙
You can help me.

825
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,930
不管从铁门后出现的是什么
Whatever comes out of these gates,

826
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:08,460
我们只有同心协力才会有较大的胜算
we've got a better chance of survival ifwe work together.

827
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,270
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

828
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,420
只有团结一致 我们才能活命
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

829
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:17,640
我很荣幸为你们介绍...
The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires

830
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,320
非洲的西比欧军团
of Scipio Africanus!

831
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,830
奋战到底!
To the death!

832
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:40,220
- 杀! 杀! 杀! - 杀! 杀! 杀!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

833
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,640
大家靠拢!
Stay close.

834
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,520
集合起来!
Come together!

835
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:58,900
纵队交错排列!
Stay close. Staggered columns!

836
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,170
你没机会了!
You don't have a chance.

837
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:28,060
固定盾牌! 紧密衔接!
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

838
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,140
稳住!
Hold!

839
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:36,190
稳住! 盾牌衔接起来!
Hold! As one!

840
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,440
做得好
Well done.

841
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:56,170
稳住! 下面!
Hold. Down low!

842
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,170
好!
Yes!

843
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,520
贺格!
Hagen!

844
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:44,170
一队去移战车! 一队...跟我来!
This column to the chariot! This column stay with me!

845
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,180
快点!
Quickly!

846
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,600
- 去前面! - 快!
- Get out there. - Hurry!

847
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,970
马西墨斯!
Maximus!

848
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,610
单排队形! 排成一排!
Single column! Single column!

849
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:36,330
我们赢了!
We win!

850
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:44,210
我对历史不太清楚 卡西亚斯
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

851
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,950
不过应该是野蛮人打输了迦太基战役吧?
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Can'thage?

852
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:49,800
是的 陛下
Yes, sire.

853
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,080
请见谅 陛下
Forgive me, sire.

854
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,890
没关系 我喜欢惊喜
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

855
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,790
他是谁?
Who is he?

856
01:36:57,790 --> 01:37:00,890
他们叫他做西班牙人 陛下
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

857
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,300
我想见见他
I think I'll meet him.

858
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,730
是 陛下
Yes, sire.

859
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,860
为野蛮人欢呼!
Hail to the barbarians!

860
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:29,210
前进! 严密戒备!
Forward! Arms at ready!

861
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,440
放下武器!
Drop your weapons.

862
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:51,400
皇帝要见你 角斗士
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

863
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:54,240
我随时听候差遣
I am at the Emperor's service.

864
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:23,060
起身 起身
Rise. Rise.

865
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,640
西班牙人 你果然名不虚传
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

866
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,220
我相信其他的角斗士都不是你的对手
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.

867
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:40,230
这位年轻人坚持你是赫克托转世
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.

868
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,910
还是你是大力神的化身?
Or was it Hercules?

869
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:47,170
你为何不表明身份 告诉大家你的真名?
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?

870
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,840
你总有名字吧?
You do have a name.

871
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,510
"角斗士"就是我的名字
My name is Gladiator.

872
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,970
你竟敢背对着我? 奴隶!
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

873
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,680
脱掉头盔 告诉我你的名字
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.

874
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,950
我叫马西墨斯德西斯梅里丢斯
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

875
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,270
北方军队的指挥官
commander of the armies of the north,

876
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,690
菲力克斯军团的将军
general of the Felix Legions,

877
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:27,080
真正的皇帝马可・奥勒留忠心的仆人
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

878
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,670
儿子被人谋杀
father to a murdered son,

879
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:33,420
妻子遭人杀害...
husband to a murdered wife,

880
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:37,510
不管今生或来世 我定会为他们复仇
and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

881
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,890
卫兵!
Arms!

882
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:02,310
活! 活! 活! 活! 活! 活!
Live! Live! Live! Live!

883
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:05,620
- 活 活 活 - 活 活 活
- Live! Live! Live! Live! - Live! Live! Live! Live!

884
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,330
卫兵 退下!
Arms, at rest!

885
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:49,310
- 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! - 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

886
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:38,560
父亲
Father.

887
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:54,810
他怎么还活着?
Why is he still alive?

888
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,560
我不知道
I don't know.

889
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,640
他应该早就死了
He shouldn't be alive.

890
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:01,900
实在让人烦恼
It vexes me.

891
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,440
我非常生气
I'm terribly vexed.

892
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,580
我只是做了不得不做的事
I did what I had to do.

893
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:23,360
要是按照父亲的意愿 罗马早就解体了
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.

894
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,130
你明白的 是吗?
You do see that.

895
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:26,670
是的
Yes.

896
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,680
你看到他的时候有何感觉?
What did you feel when you saw him?

897
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,430
没有任何感觉
I felt nothing.

898
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:42,940
看来他伤得你很深 对不对?
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

899
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,190
我伤害他更深
No more than I wounded him.

900
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,990
在日耳曼的时候他们说谎
They lied to me in Germania.

901
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,700
他们告诉我他已经死了
They told me he was dead.

902
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,270
他们骗我 即是不尊重我
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

903
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:04,710
既然如此 他们又怎么可能爱我?
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?

904
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,410
那么你必须让军团了解...
Then you must let the legions know

905
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:11,590
他们的背叛行为一定会受到惩罚
their treachery will not go unpunished.

906
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:13,890
可怜的姐姐
Poor sister.

907
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,760
我绝对不想与你为敌
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

908
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:19,720
你打算怎么做?
What will you do?

909
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,030
出来!
This way.

910
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,840
贵妇人付高价是为了让英勇的角斗士取悦她
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

911
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:15,450
我知道你弟弟会派刺客来
I knew your brother would send assassins.

912
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:18,580
但我没想到他会派最好的来
I didn't realize he would send his best.

913
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,290
马西墨斯 他毫不知情
Maximus, he doesn't know.

914
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:26,360
我的家人被钉在十字架上活活烧死
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.

915
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,000
- 我真的不知情... - 别对我撒谎!
- I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me!

916
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:37,200
我为他们哭泣
I wept for them.

917
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,120
就像你为你父亲哭泣?
As you wept for your father? As you wept for your father?

918
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,810
自从我父亲去世后 我便生活在恐惧之中
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.

919
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:49,150
因为害怕自己的弟弟而无法哀悼自己的父亲
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.

920
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,220
因为自己的儿子也是王位继承人
To live in terror every moment of every day,

921
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,110
我时时刻刻都生活在恐惧之中
because your son is heir to the throne.

922
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:59,450
我有哭过
I have wept.

923
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:03,620
我儿子是无辜的
My son was innocent.

924
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,500
我儿子也是
So is mine.

925
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,590
难道非得用我儿子的命来换取你的信任?
Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?

926
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:16,010
我是否信任你又有何区别?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

927
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:19,910
你难道不明白? 神已经宽恕你了
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?

928
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:23,460
今天我看见了比罗马皇帝还要有权力的奴隶
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

929
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,330
诸神已经宽恕我了?
The gods have spared me?

930
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:28,880
因为他们的怜悯 我才有娱乐观众的力量!
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob.

931
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,520
那就是力量
That is power.

932
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,130
观众代表着罗马
The mob is Rome.

933
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,860
康莫德斯控制了他们就等于掌控了一切
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.

934
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:37,740
听我说
Listen to me.

935
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:41,390
元老院的大多数人都是我弟弟的敌人
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.

936
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:43,730
只是当人民都支持他的时候:
But while the people follow him,

937
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:46,870
没有人敢和他正面冲突 除了你
no one would dare stand up to him until you.

938
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,110
他们反对他 却什么事都不做
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

939
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:53,950
有些政治家为罗马奉献出全部的心力
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

940
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:55,800
他们有个领袖
One man above all.

941
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:59,970
如果我出面安排 你愿意和他见面吗?
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

942
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,220
你到底明不明白?
Do you not understand?

943
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:06,670
我只是个奴隶 随时随地都有可能丧命
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

944
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:09,440
我又能改变些什么呢?
What possible difference can I make?

945
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,960
这个人有和你一样的目的
This man wants what you want.

946
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,270
那就让他去杀了康莫德斯!
Then have him kill Commodus!

947
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,700
我曾经认识一个人...
I knew a man once,

948
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:20,910
一个高尚的人
a noble man.

949
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,780
他不但有原则...而且还敬爱我的父亲
A man of principle who loved my father,

950
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:27,830
我的父亲也爱他
and my father loved him.

951
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:31,960
这个人为罗马贡献良多
This man served Rome well.

952
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,010
那人已经死了
That man is gone.

953
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,280
你弟弟干的很成功
Your brother did his work well.

954
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,050
让我帮你
Let me help you.

955
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,060
对 你能帮我
Yes, you can help me.

956
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:59,110
忘了我们曾经相识...再也不要来这里看我
Forget you ever knew me, never come here again.

957
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:05,530
守卫 这位夫人要离开了
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

958
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,650
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

959
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,240
朱利安克拉苏
Julian Crassus.

960
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:46,990
名字?
Name?

961
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,790
马可斯 陛下
Marcus, sire.

962
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,410
跟我父亲同名
My father's name.

963
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,070
他们在发现马西墨斯逃走时
They must have known of Maximus' escape,

964
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:05,010
一定可以找到他们四个的尸体
when they found the bodies of the four men.

965
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:08,050
他们以为是野蛮人突袭
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

966
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,270
他们是好人 陛下 他们忠于皇上
These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor.

967
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:21,320
搭箭!
Load your arrows!

968
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,870
准备放箭!
Prepare to fire!

969
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:54,680
又或者是你知道...
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

970
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,230
而不告诉我
and never told me.

971
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:59,730
- 我并不知道 - 你不知道?
- I didn't know. - You didn't know?

972
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:04,070
但将军永远有控制权
But a general is always in control.

973
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:09,120
永远是命令者 不是吗?
Always in command, isn't he?

974
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,120
是的 凯撒
Yes, Caesar.

975
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:28,760
那下命令吧 快说
Then give the command. Say it.

976
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:46,780
放箭
Fire.

977
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,360
马西墨斯
Maximus.

978
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:27,240
你指挥过军团? 你打过很多胜仗?
You commanded legions? You had many victories?

979
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:30,320
- 是的 - 在日耳曼?
- Yes. - In Germania?

980
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,990
在很多国家
In many countries.

981
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,910
将军
General.

982
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,880
你已经出名了
You have a great name.

983
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,430
在杀你之前他得先羞辱你的名声
He must kill your name before he kills you.

984
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,710
没错
Yes, at the far end.

985
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,730
- 盖尔斯议员 - 你好
- Senator Gaius. - Hello.

986
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:47,190
格瑞克斯议员
Senator Gracchus.

987
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:52,180
很难得看见你出现在这种龙蛇混杂的地方
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

988
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:55,390
我不会假装和人民打成一片
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator,

989
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:58,030
但我会做个为人民说话的议员
but I do try to be a man for the people.

990
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:19,510
- 凯撒! 凯撒! 凯撒! 凯撒! - 凯撒! 凯撒! 凯撒! 凯撒!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! - Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

991
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,650
罗马的人民!
People of Rome!

992
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,400
今天是安提俄克战役的第四天
On the fourth day ofAntioch,

993
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:35,410
同时也是竞技庆典的第64天
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

994
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:40,280
在他的仁慈下
And in his majestic charity,

995
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:45,250
皇帝决定赐予罗马人民...
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome

996
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:49,250
一场历史性的决战
with an historical final match.

997
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:54,630
在退休五年后...重回竞技场
Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement,

998
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:59,500
凯撒很高兴为大家请到...
Caesar is pleased to bring you

999
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:03,370
罗马历史上...
the only undefeated champion

1000
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:05,420
唯一的不败冠军...
in Roman history,

1001
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:10,440
来自高卢的传奇的底格里斯!
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

1002
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:35,160
他太清楚该如何操纵观众
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.

1003
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,950
马可・奥勒留的梦想是建立一个全新的罗马 普罗西莫
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.

1004
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:40,830
但新罗马不应该是这样的!
This is not it. This is not it!

1005
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:43,760
马可・奥勒留已经死了 马西墨斯
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

1006
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:47,190
我们只是凡夫俗子 一切终归尘土
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

1007
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,960
一切终归尘土 马西墨斯
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

1008
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:53,930
让我们隆重介绍...
Representing the training lyceum ofAntonius Proximo,

1009
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:57,680
代表普罗西莫训练会馆的...
Caesar is proud to give you

1010
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,620
马西墨斯!
Aelius Maximus!

1011
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,780
他们把他当成自己人 敞开双臂欢迎他
They embrace him like he's one of their own.

1012
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:20,800
观众是很善变的 弟弟 不出一个月就会忘记他的
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.

1013
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,390
错了 用不了那么久
No, much sooner than that.

1014
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:30,100
一切都安排好了
It's been arranged.

1015
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,580
角斗士向你致敬
We who are about to die salute you.

1016
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:56,710
我们支持你 马西墨斯!
We're with you, Maximus!

1017
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,090
打败他!
Fight on, finish it!

1018
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:11,000
用力拉!
Pull, pull!

1019
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:44,900
放开! 放开!
Loose! Loose!

1020
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:15,100
- 杀了他! - 杀!
- Gut him! - Kill!

1021
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:20,150
- 杀! 杀! 杀! 杀! - 杀! 杀! 杀! 杀!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! - Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1022
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:42,630
- 杀! - 杀!
- Kill! - Kill!

1023
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,710
仁慈的马西墨斯!
Maximus the Merciful!

1024
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:37,640
- 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! - 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1025
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,490
卫兵 前进 攻击队形!
Forward, arms at ready!

1026
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:19,850
我该拿你怎么办?
What am I going to do with you?

1027
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:24,480
为什么你...不去死
You simply won't die.

1028
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:31,610
我们之间的差异真有这么大吗?
Are we so different, you and I?

1029
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,660
必要时你也杀人...就象我一样
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1030
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:40,700
只剩下一个人我非杀不可 然后我的责任就完成了
I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.

1031
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,000
那现在就动手啊
Then take it now.

1032
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:58,060
他们告诉我你儿子...
They tell me your son

1033
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:02,770
在被钉上十字架的时候...象女孩子一样在尖叫
squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross.

1034
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,560
还有你妻子...
And your wife

1035
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,730
在被他们蹂躏的时候...
moaned like a whore

1036
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,410
象妓女一样在呻吟...
when they ravaged her again and again

1037
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,160
一次又一次...呻吟着
and again.

1038
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:27,170
你呼风唤雨的日子很快就要结束了
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,

1039
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,130
陛下
Highness.

1040
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:06,460
将军!
General! General!

1041
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,290
- 将军! - 西斯洛!
- General! - Cicero!

1042
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,250
- 将军! - 军队在哪里扎营?
- General! - Where are you camped?

1043
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,640
在奥斯亚
Ostia.

1044
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,050
- 我们爱你 马西墨斯! - 赞美胜利者!
- We love you, Maximus! - Praise the victor!

1045
02:03:30,050 --> 02:03:32,650
告诉大家我还活着 来找我
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1046
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,610
- 快走! - 来找我!
- Move along! - Find me!

1047
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:02,430
他们可以听到你的祈祷吗?
Can they hear you?

1048
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,520
- 谁? - 你在黄泉的家人
- Who? - Your family, in the afterlife.

1049
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,360
- 会的 - 你跟他们说什么?
- Yes. - What do you say to them?

1050
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,700
对我的儿子
To my boy,

1051
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:24,060
我告诉他我们很快就能见面了
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1052
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:27,750
骑马的时候记得脚跟要压低点
and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.

1053
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,540
对我妻子...
To my wife,

1054
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:35,170
那不关你的事
that is not your business.

1055
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:45,720
现在观众反而敬爱马西墨斯的仁慈
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1056
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,640
因此我更不能杀他 不然就会显得我更残暴
So I can'tjust kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1057
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:56,230
这整件事简直就象场恶梦
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.

1058
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:59,300
他是在公然向你挑战
He is defying you.

1059
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:02,770
他每一次的胜利都是种反抗的举动
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1060
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:06,450
观众和元老院议员们都看到了
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1061
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:10,120
只要他存在一天 他们就会越来越大胆
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1062
02:05:11,570 --> 02:05:13,420
- 杀了他 - 不行
- Kill him. - No.

1063
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,760
我不会帮他成为烈士
I will not make a martyr of him.

1064
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:27,330
我今天去国会...
When I went to the Senate today,

1065
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:31,890
特意告诉他们 我用了谷物贮备来支付竞技赛
I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1066
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:35,970
你记得发生什么事吗?
And did you note what happened?

1067
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:39,280
- 没什么 - 对 什么都没发生
- Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing.

1068
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:42,600
一句抗议都没有
Not a single word of protest.

1069
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:46,310
连傲慢的格瑞克斯议员也没出声
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1070
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:47,580
为什么?
Why?

1071
02:05:49,190 --> 02:05:52,980
我听说有一种海蛇
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1072
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:57,130
用非常特别的方法来诱捕猎物
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.

1073
02:05:57,490 --> 02:06:01,300
它会假装受伤 躺在海底
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as ifwounded.

1074
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:04,580
接着它的敌人会渐渐的靠近
Then its enemies will approach,

1075
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:07,760
它会继续躺着不动
and yet it will lie quite still.

1076
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,880
接着敌人会开始慢慢的咬它
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,

1077
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:15,270
但它还是...一动不动
and yet it remains still.

1078
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:19,650
那么
So,

1079
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:22,780
我们要不动声色...
we will lie still,

1080
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,820
耐心等待我们的敌人上钩
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1081
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:30,240
让所有的议员也自投罗网
Have every senator followed.

1082
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:49,620
西斯洛 我的老朋友
Cicero, my old friend.

1083
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:51,580
我以为再也见不到你了
I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

1084
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:54,210
- 我以为你死了 - 差不多
- I thought you were dead. - Close.

1085
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,920
军团驻扎在奥斯亚有多久了?
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1086
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,350
整个冬季
All winter.

1087
02:06:57,590 --> 02:07:00,980
- 他们的状况如何? ? - 整天吃饱了 无所事事
- And how do they look? - Fat and bored.

1088
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:04,740
- 指挥官是谁? - 从罗马来的白痴
- Who's in command? - Some fool from Rome.

1089
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:08,180
他们最快要什么时候才能准备好?
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight?

1090
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,080
为了你 明天
For you, tomorrow.

1091
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,040
有件事我需要你帮忙
I need you to do something for me.

1092
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:20,070
各位 快来看
Come, see, witness.

1093
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:23,200
如果你没去竞技场的话 你能在这里看见当时的情景
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.

1094
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:26,910
马西墨斯快要打败我们的皇帝康莫德斯了 我们该怎么办?
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1095
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:29,620
他藐视每一个人
What are we to do? He's just defying everyone,

1096
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:31,390
我们该怎么办?
by doing this to him, they do...

1097
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:33,970
啊! 我的天啊!
My goodness!

1098
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:39,350
- 他赢了! - 让路!
- He got him, he's defeated. - Give way!

1099
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:48,010
公主陛下? 我在凡度巴纳侍奉过你父亲
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1100
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:49,640
- 退后 - 我的夫人
- Back. - My lady.

1101
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:52,140
我在凡度巴纳服侍过你父亲
I served your father at Vindobona.

1102
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:53,310
退后!
Back!

1103
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:56,620
我也服侍过马西墨斯将军 我现在还为他服务
And I served General Maximus. I serve him still.

1104
02:07:58,020 --> 02:07:59,710
停下来
Stop. Stop.

1105
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:01,420
停!
Stop!

1106
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:03,750
退下
Stand back.

1107
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:08,090
将军让我带个口信 他愿意见你说的政治家
The general sends word, he will meet your politician.

1108
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:13,100
- 士兵 奖赏你的忠诚 - 谢谢 夫人
- For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady.

1109
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,190
出去吧
Leave us.

1110
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:31,620
格瑞克斯议员
Senator Gracchus.

1111
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,710
将军
General.

1112
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:50,530
我希望今天我来这里能够...
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough

1113
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:53,720
使你信任我
that you can trust me.

1114
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:00,480
- 元老院和你的立场一致? - 元老院?
- The Senate is with you? - The Senate?

1115
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:04,690
是的 我能代表他们
Yes. I can speak for them.

1116
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,650
你能帮我获得自由偷偷把我运出罗马吗?
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?

1117
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:10,490
你打算干什么?
To what end?

1118
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:14,280
把我送到城外去
Get me outside the city walls.

1119
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:18,730
准备好马匹让我去奥斯亚 我的军队在那里扎营
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1120
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:22,150
我会在第二天傍晚率领五千名士兵回来
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5, 000 men.

1121
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,480
但军团的新指挥官
But the legions all have new commanders,

1122
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:25,990
全都效忠于康莫德斯
loyal to Commodus.

1123
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:29,240
只要我的部下看到我还活你就知道他们效忠谁了
Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1124
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,010
简直太疯狂了
This is madness.

1125
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:35,000
百年来罗马军队从未进入过首都
No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years.

1126
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,330
我不愿意引狼入室!
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1127
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:40,980
议员 已经没时间商量权宜办法了
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.

1128
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:44,600
在你光荣的政变之后又将如何?
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1129
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:49,430
你会带着五千名士兵离开罗马?
You'll take your 5, 000 warriors and leave?

1130
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:51,070
我会离开
I will leave.

1131
02:09:51,470 --> 02:09:53,600
士兵们会留下来保护你们
The soldiers will stay for your protection,

1132
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,370
受元老院的指挥
under the command of the Senate.

1133
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:56,660
换言之
So,

1134
02:09:56,890 --> 02:10:01,200
一旦罗马被你控制以后...你会将它交还给人民?
once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?

1135
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,580
告诉我原因
Tell me why.

1136
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:12,880
因为那是某人临死前最后的期望
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.

1137
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:17,800
我会杀了康莫德斯
I will kill Commodus.

1138
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:22,810
罗马的命运就交给你了
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1139
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,860
马可・奥勒留信任你
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1140
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:30,730
他的女儿信任你
His daughter trusts you.

1141
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,410
我也会信任你
I will trust you.

1142
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,870
但我们时间紧迫
But we have little time.

1143
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:41,160
给我两天时间...
Give me two days,

1144
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:44,210
我会想办法使你获得自由
and I will buy your freedom.

1145
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,170
而你...
And you,

1146
02:10:47,610 --> 02:10:49,290
你千万要活下去
you stay alive,

1147
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:52,460
否则我就死定了
or I'll be dead.

1148
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:56,010
我们得走了
Now we must go.

1149
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:26,650
他会在等你 站在斗兽场脚下
He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1150
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:28,330
他会找到你
He'll find you.

1151
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,960
不可能成功的
It won't work.

1152
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:17,050
皇帝对一切都了如指掌
The Emperor knows too much.

1153
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:18,800
对我来说...
And as for me,

1154
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,180
形势越来越危险了
it's becoming dangerous.

1155
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:26,730
我回来后会酬谢你的
You'll be paid on my return.

1156
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:30,600
我向你保证
I give you my word.

1157
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:33,940
保证? 你不回来的话怎么办呢
Your word? What if you don't return?

1158
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:38,140
你还记得信任别人的感觉吗 普罗西莫?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?

1159
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:39,490
信任?
Trust?

1160
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:45,490
有谁值得我信任?
Who am I to trust?

1161
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:49,250
- 我会杀死康莫德斯 - 对我有什么好处?
- I will kill Commodus. - Why would I want that?

1162
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:51,750
他给我带来财富
He makes me rich.

1163
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:59,720
我知道你是个信守承诺的人 将军
I know that you are a man of your word, General.

1164
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:04,050
我也知道你愿意为荣誉而死
I know that you would die for honor.

1165
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:07,350
你愿意为罗马而牺牲
You would die for Rome.

1166
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:11,500
愿意为祖先的名誉而死
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.

1167
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:13,900
但我 换个角度说...
But I, on the other hand,

1168
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:18,440
我不过是个表演艺人
I'm an entertainer.

1169
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:23,160
守卫!
Guard!

1170
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:30,580
他杀了还你自由的那个人
He killed the man who set you free.

1171
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,590
大人 是禁卫军
Praetorians, master.

1172
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,930
停!
Halt!

1173
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,870
你去哪里了?
Where have you been?

1174
02:14:56,230 --> 02:14:57,920
我派人去找你
I sent for you.

1175
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,170
弟弟 别疑神疑鬼了
Please, brother.

1176
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:08,800
什么事让你烦心?
What's troubling you?

1177
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,600
格瑞克斯是不是有了新爱人?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1178
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,900
我不知道
I don't know.

1179
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,020
我以为你见过他
I thought you'd seen him.

1180
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,360
他象伤寒一样影响着每个人
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1181
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:29,410
为罗马着想 必须要牺牲元老院
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.

1182
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:31,870
他也不能幸免
And he will bleed, too.

1183
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:34,120
时机成熟了
Very soon.

1184
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,290
不要选在今晚
But not tonight.

1185
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:55,230
还记得父亲曾说过的话吗?
Do you remember what our father said once?

1186
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:58,230
"一场梦...
"It's a dream,

1187
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:02,020
生活就是...
"a frightful dream,

1188
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:05,900
一场噩梦"
"life is."

1189
02:16:08,510 --> 02:16:10,700
你觉得他说的对吗?
Do you think that's true?

1190
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:12,950
我不知道
I don't know.

1191
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,080
我认为是真的
I think it is.

1192
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:23,590
而我只能和你分享
And I have only you to share it with.

1193
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:02,790
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

1194
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:41,870
你知道我爱你
You know I love you.

1195
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:45,540
我也爱你
And I love you.

1196
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,750
出去 滚出去!
Out. Get out!

1197
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,210
快点!
Move!

1198
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,910
恭喜你 将军
Congratulations, General.

1199
02:18:32,910 --> 02:18:35,800
你的朋友很擅于说服别人
You've got very persuasive friends.

1200
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:44,290
我弟弟已经逮捕了格瑞克斯
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1201
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:47,840
我们不能再等下去了 今晚一定得离开
We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight.

1202
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:51,570
普罗西莫半夜会来把你带到大门口
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.

1203
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,910
你的仆人 西斯洛 会带着马在那边等你
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.

1204
02:18:57,810 --> 02:19:00,200
- 你一个人安排这一切的吗? - 是
- You have done all this? - Yes.

1205
02:19:01,310 --> 02:19:03,120
你太冒险了
You risk too much.

1206
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:06,080
我有太多的债要还
I have much to pay for.

1207
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:10,700
你并没有亏欠任何人
You have nothing to pay for.

1208
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:13,880
你爱你的儿子 为了他 你变得十分坚强
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1209
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:19,430
我已经厌倦了
I am tired of being strong.

1210
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:25,600
我弟弟憎恨全世界 尤其是你
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.

1211
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,230
- 因为你父亲选了我 - 不
- Because your father chose me. - No.

1212
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:32,780
因为我父亲爱你
Because my father loved you.

1213
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:39,120
而我也爱你
And because I loved you.

1214
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,370
很久以前的事了
A long time ago.

1215
02:19:48,030 --> 02:19:50,250
我变了很多吗?
Was I very different then?

1216
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,550
你以前比较爱笑
You laughed more.

1217
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,060
我一直都觉得很寂寞
I have felt alone all my life,

1218
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:08,020
除了跟你一起时
except with you.

1219
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:12,480
我要走了
I must go.

1220
02:20:13,050 --> 02:20:14,280
是的
Yes.

1221
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:43,970
那里
There.

1222
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:57,030
我赢了
And I got you.

1223
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:01,970
现在玩士兵打仗不会晚了点吗?
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1224
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:04,160
我不是士兵
I'm not a legionnaire.

1225
02:21:04,390 --> 02:21:07,080
- 不是士兵? - 我是角斗士
- Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator.

1226
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:09,830
角斗士?
A gladiator?

1227
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:13,190
角斗士只在竞技场里打斗
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1228
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:16,700
难道你不想像凯撒朱利叶...那样当一名出色的罗马战士?
Wouldrt you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1229
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,380
我是马西墨斯 罗马的救世主!
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1230
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:24,050
罗马的救世主?
The savior of Rome?

1231
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,770
是谁说的?
And who said that?

1232
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:44,200
卢修斯在哪里?
Where's Lucius?

1233
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:47,830
他和皇帝在一起 夫人
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1234
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:52,440
- 她不可能那样做 - 不 是真的
- She couldn't. - Yes, she did.

1235
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,750
她在篮中拿出来...
She took it from a basket,

1236
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:59,920
她从篮子里拿出来 把它放在胸口 就在她心脏的正上方
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.

1237
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:04,760
- 它咬在她的胸口上? - 是的
- It bit her in the breast? - Yes.

1238
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:09,390
你知道吗? 卢修斯 有时候那些皇室的小姐们...
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1239
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:13,840
为了爱可以做出一些非常奇怪的事来
behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.

1240
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:16,520
- 我觉得这样做很愚蠢 - 我也这么想
- I think it's silly. - So do I.

1241
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:19,940
我也这么想
So do I.

1242
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:22,570
姐姐 过来加入我们
Sister, join us.

1243
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:24,930
我在念故事给卢修斯听
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1244
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:27,020
- 我也在读 - 没错
- I've been reading, too. - Yes.

1245
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:31,450
他是个非常机灵的小男孩 总有一天他会成为了不起的皇帝的
He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1246
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:35,400
我们在读伟大的安东尼
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony,

1247
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,820
和他在埃及的冒险
and his adventures in Egypt.

1248
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:39,450
还有皇后用蛇自杀的故事
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1249
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:42,870
我还没告诉你发生在我们祖先身上的故事
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.

1250
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:44,780
如果你很乖的话
If you're very good,

1251
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,660
明晚我会给你讲克劳迪亚斯皇帝的故事
tomorrow night, I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1252
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:50,470
他身边最亲近的人...
He was betrayed

1253
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:53,810
背叛了他
by those closest to him.

1254
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:57,440
他的亲人
By his own blood.

1255
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:01,220
他们在黑暗的角落里商议...
They whispered in dark corners

1256
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:03,760
并且在半夜偷偷出去...
and went out late at night,

1257
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:07,200
共同密谋...
and conspired, and conspired.

1258
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:13,660
但皇帝知道他们在策划阴谋
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.

1259
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:16,330
他知道象小蜜蜂一样忙碌
He knew they were busy little bees.

1260
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:21,340
有天晚上 他和其中一人谈话...
And one night he sat down with one of them,

1261
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:24,130
他看着她...
and he looked at her,

1262
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,430
然后说...
and he said,

1263
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:30,180
"告诉我你们的计划...
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1264
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:32,560
忙碌的小蜜蜂
"busy little bee.

1265
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:37,940
不然我会杀死你最亲的人...
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1266
02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:42,150
你会看到我身上沾满他们的鲜血"
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1267
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,280
而皇帝的心都碎了
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1268
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:52,560
小蜜蜂对他的伤害
The little bee had wounded him more deeply

1269
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,370
比任何人都要深
than anyone else could ever have done.

1270
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,380
卢修斯 你认为接下来会发生什么事?
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1271
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:02,840
我不知道 舅舅
I don't know, Uncle.

1272
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,930
小蜜蜂告诉了他所有的事
The little bee told him everything.

1273
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:12,820
开闸 皇上有令!

1279
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:35,640
老头 你想找死吗?
Do you want to die, old man?

1280
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:37,970
拿去

一切准备好了
Everything is prepared.

1282
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:43,250
看来你赢得你的自由了
It seems you have won your freedom.

1283
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:46,940
普罗西莫 当个好人是否会替你惹上麻烦
Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man?

1284
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:55,870
- 裘巴 - 反抗皇帝的人都得死!
- Juba. - All enemies of the Emperor die!

1285
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:58,580
开门! 皇帝的命令!
Open the gates!

1286
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:06,040
用力拉!
Pull!

1287
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:11,050
冲! 两队人去左边!
Move! Form a column on the left!

1288
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:18,040
我只需要机会脱身 千万别做无谓的牺牲
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.

1289
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:20,580
不想被卷入这事的 就回到囚室里去
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.

1290
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:22,920
我们会留在这里帮你 马西墨斯
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1291
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,800
- 勇气和荣誉 - 勇气和荣誉
- Strength and honor. - Strength and honor.

1292
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,940

1295
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:26,650
马可・奥勒留914-922

1296
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:30,760
普罗西莫

一切终归尘土
Shadows and dust.

1298
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:25,680
马西墨斯!
Maximus!

1299
02:28:31,050 --> 02:28:32,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

1300
02:28:58,870 --> 02:29:00,340
事情都解决了
It's done.

1301
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:09,180
该如何处治我的外甥?
And what of my nephew?

1302
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:12,270
还有他的母亲?
And what of his mother?

1303
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:16,900
他们应该面对和她爱人相同的命运吗?
Should they share her lover's fate?

1304
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:20,650
还是我应该网开一面?
Or should I be merciful?

1305
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:25,280
仁慈的康莫德斯
Commodus the Merciful.

1306
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:34,040
从现在起 卢修斯由我照顾
Lucius will stay with me now.

1307
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:37,000
如果他母亲...
And if his mother

1308
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:40,510
用令我不快的眼神看着我...
so much as looks at me

1309
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:44,180
用令我不快的态度对我...
in a manner that displeases me,

1310
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:47,560
他就会死
he will die.

1311
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:54,310
如果她想...抵死不从...
If she decides to be noble,

1312
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:58,150
或者想自杀的话...
and takes her own life,

1313
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:01,200
他会死
he will die.

1314
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,530
至于你...
And as for you,

1315
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:11,080
你会爱我...
you will love me,

1316
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:13,710
就像我爱你一样
as I have loved you.

1317
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:18,960
你会帮我生育下一代 血统纯正的继承人...
You will provide me with an heir of pure blood,

1318
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,760
那么康莫德斯
so that Commodus

1319
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,300
和他的子孙...将世世代代统治罗马
and his progeny will rule for 1, 000 years.

1320
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:31,680
我不够仁慈吗?
Am I not merciful?

1321
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:56,170
我不够仁慈吗?
Am I not merciful!

1322
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:12,390
- 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! - 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯! 马西墨斯!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! - Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1323
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:42,590
我是军人 我职责是服从
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1324
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:49,600
没人可以逼你做你不愿意的事
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1325
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:28,510
马西墨斯!
Maximus.

1326
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:32,050
他们在为你欢呼
They call for you.

1327
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:37,270
一个沦为奴隶的将军
The general who became a slave.

1328
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:40,900
一个变成角斗士的奴隶
The slave who became a gladiator.

1329
02:32:42,170 --> 02:32:45,070
一个挑战皇帝的角斗士
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1330
02:32:46,970 --> 02:32:48,740
一个震撼人心的故事
A striking story.

1331
02:32:49,810 --> 02:32:53,120
现在人们想知道故事的结局
Now the people want to know how the story ends.

1332
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:57,750
只有一个出名的死亡才能令人满意
Only a famous death will do.

1333
02:32:59,570 --> 02:33:02,210
还有什么能比...
And what could be more glorious

1334
02:33:02,490 --> 02:33:06,340
在竞技场上亲自挑战皇帝来的光荣呢?
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?

1335
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:11,720
- 你要和我决斗? - 为什么不?
- You would fight me? - Why not?

1336
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:14,850
你以为我害怕吗?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1337
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:18,790
我认为你一生人也在害怕
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1338
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:22,600
不象无敌的马西墨斯 有谁从来不害怕?
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?

1339
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,740
一个我认识的人曾经说过 "死亡向所有人微笑...
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.

1340
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,120
人们所能做的就是还以微笑"
"All a man can do is smile back."

1341
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:38,330
我在怀疑
I wonder,

1342
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:41,750
你的朋友在面对死亡时也在微笑吗?
did your friend smile at his own death?

1343
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:43,630
你要知道
You must know.

1344
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:48,340
他是你父亲
He was your father.

1345
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:54,550
我知道 你爱我的父亲
You loved my father, I know,

1346
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,560
但我也爱他
but so did I.

1347
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:01,770
我们因此是兄弟 不是吗?
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1348
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:05,980
兄弟 对我微笑吧
Smile for me now, brother.

1349
02:34:11,890 --> 02:34:14,820
替他穿上盔甲 把伤口遮住
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1350
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:11,210

1351
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:04,620

02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,340
剑! 给我把剑!

1354

收剑入鞘! 收剑入鞘!

1355
02:39:33,710 --> 02:39:36,320
马西墨斯

1356
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:43,740
昆塔斯
Quintus.

1357
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:46,860
还我的人自由
Free my men.

1358
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,950
恢复格瑞克斯议员的职位
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1359
02:39:52,150 --> 02:39:54,330
罗马的共和是个梦想
There was a dream that was Rome.

1360
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:56,870
它应当被实现
It shall be realized.

1361
02:39:57,320 --> 02:40:00,000
这些都是马可・奥勒留的心愿
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1362
02:40:00,990 --> 02:40:03,090
释放囚犯 快去

1363
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,200
马西墨斯
Maximus.

1364
02:40:30,980 --> 02:40:32,660
卢修斯安全了
Lucius is safe.
