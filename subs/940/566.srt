生活大爆炸
第七季  第七集

13
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,130
我從沒見過他這么歡樂
I've never seen him this happy before.

14
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,190
那是因為你從來沒有在
That's because you've never seen him

15
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,820
"醫藥箱補貨日"見過他
on "Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

16
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,220
你們看
Look!

17
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,910
新出的帶麻藥局部抗組胺劑呢
A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine.

18
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,010
好想趕快發疹子來用用看啊
I can't wait until I get a rash.

19
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,590
解脹氣藥也出了加強版呢
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

20
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,760
看來他們真會看顧客意見郵箱啊
I guess they really do read their mail.

21
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,400
那不是質子教授嗎
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

22
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,770
是啊
Oh, yeah.

23
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,230
你們看他  像普通人一樣排隊
Look at him, just standing in line

24
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,540
好像自己30年前并不是個二流名人似地
like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago.

25
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,320
去跟他打招呼吧
Let's go say hello.

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,370
我們還是別煩人家比較好吧
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

27
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,990
我沒有要去煩他啊  我是要去跟他聊聊
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.

28
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,640
他總以為這兩者不一樣
He thinks there's a difference.

29
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,830
亞瑟
Arthur?

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,620
亞瑟  是我啊
Arthur, it's me--

31
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,880
謝爾頓·庫珀
Sheldon Cooper.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,420
你可能因為年事已高忘了我是誰了
You may not remember because of your advanced age.

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,080
相信我  你化成灰我也認得
Trust me, I... I remember.

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,280
這位是我的女朋友  艾米
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,960
艾米  這位是電視圈傳奇亞瑟·杰弗里斯
Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries.

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,690
他的科普節目啟發了無數孩子
His science show inspired millions of children.

37
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,740
等  等等
Ho-hold on.

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,650
你...  你有女朋友啊
You... You have a girlfriend?

39
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,000
是的  久仰大名啊
Yes, and I've heard so much about you.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,720
而且你看  我們穿著同款矯正鞋呢
Hey look-- we're wearing the same orthopedic shoes.

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
真不敢相信我跟名人穿同樣的鞋
I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.

42
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,850
現在我明白了
O-Okay, I get it now.

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,570
你好  我是萊納德·霍夫斯塔德
Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.

44
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,910
是你啊  我記得你的女朋友
Oh, oh, right, I remember your-your girlfriend.

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,560
她...  她在嗎
Is-Is she... is she here?

46
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,240
她不在這里
No, she's not.

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,290
你是來補什么藥的存貨呢
So, what prescription are you getting filled?

48
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,090
-謝爾頓  -別說  讓我猜猜
- Sheldon. - Wait, I want to guess.

49
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,550
別告訴我答案
Don't tell me.

50
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,350
我本來就沒打算告訴你
I wasn't going to tell you.

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,810
謝爾頓  別玩了
Sheldon, come on.

52
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,030
不不不  玩這個我最拿手了
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,970
好  給我的提示
All right, give me a hint.

54
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,940
是不是跟排某些液體有困難有關
Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,930
看我的年紀就知道  猜中很容易吧
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.

56
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,620
謝爾頓  我們還是去取笑
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,370
買順勢療法藥的人吧  你不是很喜歡嗎  
buying homeopathic medicine-- you love that.

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,970
但是我現在跟朋友一起
But I'm hanging out with my friend,

59
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,220
我們聊得正歡呢
and we're having fun.

60
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,830
你看他多開心
Look how happy he is.

61
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,390
妮妮這周五要在家里辦閨蜜之夜
Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place.

62
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,750
不如那晚咱倆出去玩呀
You want to do something?

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,300
-那晚我有事呢  -什么事
- Actually, I'm busy. - Doing what?

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,720
科羅拉多大街那邊開了一家新體育酒吧...
There's a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave...

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,230
-你也要去參加閨蜜之夜  -是啦
- You're going to girls' night. - Yeah.

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,140
你知道她們是要串珠寶的對吧
You know they're making jewelry, right?

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,510
你以為那主意是她們想出來的嗎
You think they came up with that?

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,630
她們本來是要喝啤酒  射飛鏢好嗎
They were going to drink beer and play darts.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,620
怎么樣啦[什么上升]
What's up?

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,070
絕對不是他的睪丸酮水平
Not his testosterone levels.

71
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,020
別亂說
Excuse me.

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,120
人家對自己的男子氣概很滿意好咩
I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,480
這怎么可能
How is that possible?

74
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,810
質子教授給我發了電郵
Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.

75
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,320
好耶  他說什么了
Goody! What's it say?

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,140
他在寫一篇納米真空管的論文
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes,

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,620
問我能不能幫他看看
and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.

78
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,550
奇怪
That's strange.

79
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,250
他居然會找你  而不是找我幫忙
That he would come to you for that and not me.

80
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,900
我收到他兩封電郵呢
Oh, I got two emails from him.

81
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,720
"你有萊納德的郵箱嗎"
"Do you have Leonard's email address?"

82
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,610
還有
And...

83
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,300
"不用了  我找到了"
"Never mind, I found it."

84
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,190
他居然會選你不選我
I can't believe he picked you over me.

85
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,500
你也不會想看一篇好幾十年沒正經
You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,860
搞過科研的過氣老頭寫的論文呢
who hasn't done any real science in decades.

87
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
這有什么好哭訴的
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,350
謝爾頓·庫伯才不哭呢
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

89
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,920
有道理  你個機器人碰水會生
It's true, you'd rust.

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,620
想到我居然曾經當他是我偶像
And to think I idolized that man.

91
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,980
我何苦呢
And why?

92
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,050
說到底  他不過也是個好萊塢偽君子罷了
At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony.

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,320
這事情真的值得你不開心嗎
Is it really worth getting upset about?

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,210
常言道  別見你心中的英雄
They say don't meet your heroes.

95
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
不要窺探他們名望與名聲背后的真實
Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity,

96
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
如果你犯了這禁忌  你會看到真實的他們
because if you do, you'll see them as they really are--

97
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,370
墮落的賣笑戲子
degenerate carnival folk.

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,330
別這樣  他只是個退休的兒童節目主持
Come on, he's a retired kids show host.

99
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,500
這才更糟呢
That's even worse.

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,710
用美好的科學當糖果
Using the sweet candy of science

101
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,830
騙取小孩對他的愛慕
to trick children into loving him.

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,440
死淫賊
Pervert.

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,270
你有仔細想過
Have you ever thought about

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,000
為什么亞瑟沒找你讀論文嗎
why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?

105
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,410
我想過
Yes, I have.

106
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,740
我唯一的結論就是
And my only conclusion

107
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,610
他那天在藥房買的藥
is the prescription he was picking up the other day

108
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,470
是要治神經病的
was for cuckoo pills.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,020
有可能是他覺得你有點過了吧
Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.

110
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,360
你這話說得才過吧
That's kind of a stretch.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,010
要說社交技巧
Look, when it comes to social skills,

112
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,460
我已經掌握了三大技巧
I've mastered the big three.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,590
首先是靦腆一笑
There's the coy smile.

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,350
以及友善的輕笑
There's the friendly chuckle.

115
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,550
以及如何發出同情音
There's the vocalization of sympathy.

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,290
最后這個太難了  我還在練
That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.

117
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,980
就我那天看到的情況來看
From what I saw the other day,

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,620
我能理解他或...
I could understand why he and...

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,800
有些人可能會覺得你
some people might find you...

120
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,980
什么
What?

121
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,040
算了
Doesn't matter.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,130
不行  快說
No, go ahead, say it.

123
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,630
我知道你想說什么
I know what it is.

124
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,070
我這輩子聽過無數遍了
I've heard it my whole life.

125
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,260
你想說的是"惹人厭"
The word's "annoying".

126
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,570
說吧  說吧
Go ahead, say it.

127
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,560
快說  說我惹人厭
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

128
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
謝爾頓
Sheldon...

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,900
我才不會覺得受傷
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

130
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,730
說吧  艾米  說我惹人厭啊
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

131
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,200
我惹人厭  我超級惹人厭
I'm annoying. I'm annoying.

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
我最惹人厭了  沒錯
I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh...

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,430
你要去哪里
Now where are you going?

134
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,900
你知道你想說出口  快說啊
Look, you know you want to say it-- say it.

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,390
說我惹人厭  快說啊
Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,090
說啊  艾米  快說啊
Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,050
這妞不能忍受我是對的就走啊
Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.

138
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,390
真有意思
This is fun.

139
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,160
我會像戴著珠寶的那種傲嬌的貴婦
I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,220
只不過我不會對一大堆藥物過敏
that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,700
佩妮  你做得怎么樣
Penny, how's it going over there?

142
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,660
很好  只是我有點搞不定膠水
Good-- I'm just having little trouble with the glue.

143
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,030
你難道不會用膠水嗎
How do you not know how to use glue?

144
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,130
你學前班老逃課了吧
Did you ditch pre-school?

145
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,790
是啊  當時我忙著跟二年級的學生約會呢
Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.

146
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,600
各位好啊
Hello, everyone.

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,990
好吧  你想說什么就說吧
Okay, let me have it.

148
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,960
你只管開"拉杰是娘們"的玩笑好了
Let's hear all the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

149
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,620
你想錯了
Nope.

150
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,310
伯納黛特說這樣不對  她不許我這樣
Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

151
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,000
那還真是多謝了
Thank you.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
所以我不會嘲笑你
So I won't be making fun of you,

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,670
也不會恥笑你喜歡的事物
or the things you like,

154
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
更不會譏笑你"只想玩樂"的事實
or the fact that you just want to have fun.

155
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
源自辛迪·勞帕的著名單曲《Girls Just Wanna Have Fun 女孩們只想玩樂》

156
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,440
華仔  別說了
Howie, stop.

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,290
過來看看我做的東西
Come on, look at what I'm making.

158
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
還挺好看的嘛
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

159
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
我在做手鐲
I'm making a bracelet.

160
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,860
而我做的是"一團糟"
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,640
你們其實可以拿我的焊鐵玩
You know, instead of beads and glue,

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
而不是在這光玩珠子和膠水
you guys can use my soldering iron.

163
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
這樣你們可以做更酷的東西
You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,410
我覺得這樣就挺好  謝啦
Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.

165
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,120
-老實說  我想試試  -我也是
- Actually, I'd kind of like to try that. - Me, too.

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,970
馬上給你們拿來
Be right back.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,240
我胳膊上怎么黏有開心果
When did I have pistachios?

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,670
亞瑟
Arthur.

169
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,380
亞瑟
Arthur.

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,400
亞瑟
Arthur.

171
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,410
門環
Door knocker.

172
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,630
從那個電視節目賺的吧
That's TV money.

173
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,630
同名DIY電視節目

174
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,430
謝爾頓  你來這兒干嘛
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

175
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,150
抱歉  我吵醒你了嗎
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

176
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,790
當然啦  現在都晚上7點半了
Of course you woke me, it's 7:30.

177
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,550
本來我可以早點到的
Well, I would have been here sooner,

178
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,010
但不知道為什么
but for some reason your home

179
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,210
你家不在"好萊塢明星之家"這幅地圖上
isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,590
你找我有事嗎  謝爾頓
What do you want, Sheldon?

181
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,610
我的女朋友指出
It's been pointed out by my girlfriend

182
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,140
那天我可能惹到你了
that I may have been annoying to you.

183
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,600
這么懂事的姑娘你可別放手
She sounds like a keeper.

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,300
總之我想跟你道歉
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

185
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,770
真的很對不起
I am truly sorry.

186
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,970
好的  我接受你的道歉  晚安
All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.

187
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,750
不  還有呢  既然我們冰釋前嫌
No, no, now that... we've cleared the air,

188
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,440
我還想跟你商量一件事
I wanted to discuss another matter with you.

189
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,140
謝爾頓  再過兩個小時  我就得起床
Sheldon, in a couple hours, I have to get up,

190
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,470
尿個尿  然后在房子里游蕩[夢游]
pee and then wander around the house.

191
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,060
那我長話短說
Well, then, I'll make this quick.

192
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,640
我想跟你談談你發給萊納德那篇論文
Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard.

193
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,510
我知道他說可行性很高
Now, I know he said it's promising

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,400
他也打算跟你合作
and he's going to collaborate on it,

195
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,730
但現在我們又是朋友了
but now that you and I are friends again,

196
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,360
我隨時聽候您差遣
I am at your disposal.

197
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,380
坦白說  借助我的名字和聲望會對論文大有幫助
Frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help,

198
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,850
因為很多人都認為你已經是"過氣的前浪"
because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been.

199
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,290
或已經"死在沙灘上"了
Or dead.

200
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,610
那我真是走了大運啊
I should be so lucky.

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,350
那你覺得怎么樣
So, uh, what do you say?

202
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,780
如果你還是跟以前一樣
You know, if it's all the same with you,

203
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,930
那我還是繼續跟萊納德合作吧
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

204
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,060
因為我惹人厭  對吧
It's because I'm annoying, right?

205
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,000
我知道  說啊
I know it is. Say it.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
快說  說我惹人厭
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

207
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,130
-晚安  -說啊
- Good night. - Say it.

208
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,170
亞瑟  說啊  說我惹人厭
Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying.

209
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,950
說啊  快說啊
Say it. Say it.

210
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,020
說我惹人厭
I'm annoying. Say it.

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
你超級惹人厭
You're annoying!

212
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,150
人家好傷心啊
Wow, that really hurt.

213
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,340
如果在我小時候  有人跟我說
If you would have told me when I was a kid

214
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,880
我長大后會有機會
that someday I would be doing science

215
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,380
跟質子教授一起做實驗
next to Professor Proton,

216
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,500
我一定不會相信
I would not have believed you.

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,540
如果有人跟我說
If someone had told me

218
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,040
人們在我83歲的時候
that people would still call me Professor Proton

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
還會稱我為"質子教授"
when I was 83 years old,

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,180
我肯定不會戒煙
I never would have quit smoking.

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,370
抱歉  杰弗里斯博士  我只是太興奮了
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited.

222
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,360
你對于納米真空管的想法很有意思
This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is really interesting.

223
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
你好啊  萊納德
Hello, Leonard.

224
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,160
你好  亞瑟
Oh, hello, Arthur.

225
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,810
你們倆都在這里  真是意外的巧合呀
What an odd coincidence that you're both here.

226
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,240
有什么巧合的
Why is it odd?

227
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,030
因為碰巧的是  我今天也跟一位
Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day

228
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,160
深受兒童喜愛的電視科學明星在一起
with a beloved children's television science personality.

229
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,590
對不對呀  我的新友兼新同事
Isn't that right, new friend and colleague,

230
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,840
美國科教節目《比爾·奈教科學》主持人

231
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,840
教科學的比爾·奈
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

232
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,160
不好意思  我用新型號替換了你
Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.

233
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,910
亞瑟·杰弗里斯
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

234
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,280
見到您真是太榮幸了
It's an honor to meet you.

235
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,620
沒有您的鋪墊  也不會有我的節目
My show never would have happened without yours.

236
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
所以我跟我律師說你是抄襲我
That's what I told my lawyers.

237
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,470
奈先生  你好
Mr. Nye, hello.

238
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,330
被他把你卷進這無謂的紛爭里  真是抱歉
I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.

239
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,630
他說是請我來給學生上課的
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

240
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,470
不對  我是說請你來給某人上一課[教訓]
No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson.

241
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,720
好了  走吧
Now let's go.

242
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,510
你們在研究什么呢
What are you guys working on?

243
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,730
我們在研制納米真空管
Oh, uh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

244
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,490
很有意思嘛
That's interesting.

245
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,930
你從我這里偷的哽還不夠嗎
Haven't you stolen enough from me?

246
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,950
走開啦  領結男
Back off, bow tie!

247
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,240
各位
Hey, guys...

248
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,020
這一副怎么樣
What do you think?

249
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,990
佩妮  做得真漂亮
Wow, Penny, good job.

250
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,990
謝了  在商場買的  4塊99
Thanks. Target, $4.99.

251
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,360
我再去倒一杯酒
I'm getting a drink.

252
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,710
你在做什么呢
What are you working on?

253
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,540
幫我媽做一串項鏈
Oh, I'm making a necklace for my mom.

254
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,520
真孝順
That's sweet.

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,810
最近她和我爸的
Yeah, she and my dad are going through

256
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,170
關系有點緊張
a bit of a rough patch, so

257
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,290
所以我想表示一下讓她知道
I wanted to do something to let her know

258
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,580
我掛念著她
I was thinking about her.

259
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
他們干嘛吵架呢
What's going on with them?

260
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,240
他們有點小小的溝通不良
They're just having a little trouble communicating.

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,570
我爸說我媽的聲音
My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice

262
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,910
讓他想把自己耳朵揪下來
makes him want to tear his ears off

263
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,850
再縫在他的眼睛上
and sew them over his eyes

264
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,600
這樣他就永遠不用再看見她了
so he never has to look at her again.

265
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,670
嗨
Hi.

266
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,680
-大家好啊  -嗨
- Hey, guys. - Hello.

267
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,570
看看是誰把
Look who's here to put

268
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,270
猶太和珠寶音似

269
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,270
"猶太人"帶進"珠寶之夜"了
the "Jew" In "Jewelry Night"!

270
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,100
種族笑話你自己說就沒關系是吧
Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.

271
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,710
抱歉我們遲到了
Sorry we're late.

272
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,700
我順便去了實驗室
I wanted to swing by the lab

273
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,820
把更給力的工具給搬來了
and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.

274
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,180
我沒想到你居然又出現了
I didn't know you were coming again.

275
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,550
上周還挺好玩的
Well, last week was a blast.

276
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,580
再說  我想你們也愿意有個男士陪伴吧
Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.

277
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,960
其實一點也不好笑
It was not funny.

278
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,390
那你帶了什么工具來
So, what tools did you bring?

279
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,170
各種制作珠寶模子的工具
Everything we need to make jewelry molds.

280
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,920
銀  坩堝
Here's some silver, a crucible

281
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080
還有用來融化的乙炔炬
and an acetylene torch to melt it down.

282
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,950
這個看起來有意思
Ooh, that looks like fun.

283
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,380
還是等你先搞定膠水
Maybe you should master glue

284
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,710
再學習玩火吧
before you move on to fire.

285
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,110
好了  誰想先玩啊
Okay, who's up first?

286
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,970
拉杰什  你想再做一副和那項鏈
Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom

287
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,410
搭配的手鐲送給你媽嗎
to go with the necklace?

288
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,510
不用了
No, thanks.

289
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,420
我也想給我媽做一串項鏈
I was gonna make a necklace for my mom,

290
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,070
可惜  她胖得脖子都沒有
but unfortunately, she doesn't have a neck.

291
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,160
她下巴之下是脂肪  脂肪之下就是腳
She's just chins and fat and feet.

292
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,910
好  我們馬上就可以開始了
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

293
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,390
把線連上  就可以開始測試這些管子了
Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.

294
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,120
太讓人激動了  我覺得
This is so exciting, I-I feel...

295
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,930
就像重新回到75歲一樣
like I'm 75 again.

296
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,510
老天爺
Oh, God.

297
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,650
出...什么事了
What... what is it?

298
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,800
謝爾頓發了一張
Sheldon just sent me a picture

299
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,370
他和比爾·奈一起喝冰沙的照片
of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

300
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,130
我  我能問個問題嗎
Can-can I ask you a question?

301
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,560
當然  問吧
Yeah, sure.

302
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,350
你怎么能忍受謝爾頓這種人啊
W-Why do you put up with Sheldon?

303
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,060
因為我們是朋友呀
Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.

304
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,290
為什么呀
Why?

305
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
-你真喜歡給人出難題  -當然
- Wow, you ask really hard questions. - Yeah.

306
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,930
我知道他總是惹人厭
Look, I-I know he can be aggravating,

307
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,290
但你要知道
but what you have to remember is that

308
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,730
他不是故意的
he's not doing it on purpose.

309
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,460
只是他這人天性如此
It's just how he is.

310
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,580
其實他很忠誠也很可靠
But he's also loyal and trustworthy

311
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,070
我們在一起挺開心的
and we have fun together...

312
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,280
你...你知道自己是在描述一只狗吧
You... you know you're describing a dog.

313
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,940
他的確咬過我一次
He did bite me once.

314
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,530
但他解釋說
But in his defense,

315
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,570
我在他進食時突然從背后冒出來  所以
I came up behind him while he was eating, so...

316
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,730
狗都不喜歡那樣
Yeah, they-they hate that.

317
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,290
謝爾頓是我遇見過的最聰明的家伙
You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met.

318
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,910
他并不是完人  所以才需要我
And he's a little broken and he needs me.

319
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,930
我大概也需要他吧
I guess I need him, too.

320
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,970
為  為什么呢
Why-why is that?

321
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,380
你非得打破沙鍋問到底  是吧
Boy, you will not let this go, will you?

322
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,450
我的天
Oh, geez.

323
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,790
又是謝爾頓發來的照片嗎
Another photo from Sheldon?

324
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,380
不是  我得去接他一下
No, I have to go pick him up.

325
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,850
比爾·奈把他拋棄在冰沙店了
Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.

326
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,150
大概把他的錢包也順手偷走了
He probably stole his wallet, too.

327
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,010
如果你們感興趣的話
You know, if you guys are interested,

328
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,360
有種技術可以讓我把你們的一束頭發
there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair,

329
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,280
提煉成碳粉
refine it into carbon dust,

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,690
然后用實驗室的液壓器
and use the hydraulic press at work

331
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,620
把它轉變成一顆小小的鉆石
to turn it into a tiny little diamond

332
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,100
里面還有你自己的DNA哦
with your DNA in it.

333
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,870
太神奇了吧
Oh, that's amazing!

334
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
看到妮妮訂婚戒指了嗎
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

335
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,540
原料是我媽背部的體毛
That came right off my mom's back.

336
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
他開玩笑的
He's kidding.

337
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,170
真是這樣  鉆石會大得多
If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.

338
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,020
我叫霍華德
"My name is Howard.

339
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,410
我可以把你的毛發變成鉆石
I can make your hair into diamonds.

340
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,690
我媽有病態肥胖癥
My mom is morbidly obese.

341
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,660
人人都愛我
Everybody love me."

342
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,050
為啥一股很不爽我的口氣
Whoa, where is that coming from?

343
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,860
我告訴你為什么
I'll tell you where it's coming from.

344
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,870
你之前嘲笑我參加閨蜜之夜
All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night

345
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,010
現在你又跑來這里毀了大家的好時光
and now you're here ruining it for everyone.

346
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,040
拉杰  淡定
Raj, cool it...

347
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,370
他要給咱們做鉆石呢
he's gonna make us hair diamonds.

348
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
我怎么毀了你們的好時光
How am I ruining anything?

349
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,070
我只是想幫你把珠寶做得更好
I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry.

350
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,710
但是重點不在珠寶
But this isn't about the jewelry.

351
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,350
而在于在這里
This is about me having a place

352
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,650
我可以敞開心扉  無所不談
where I can open up about my feelings.

353
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,770
你什么時候開始不能對我敞開心扉談了
Since when can't you open up with me?

354
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,250
有些話題
There are just some things

355
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,110
我覺得和姑娘們說更自在
that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls,

356
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,730
因為她們不會嘲笑我
because they won't make fun of me

357
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,130
不會給我取綽號  或是問我
or and call me names, or ask me if my

358
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,080
庫薩帕里你的內褲是不是卷在了一起
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

359
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,080
意為因為小事就發脾氣

360
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,510
兄弟  我那是開玩笑的
Buddy, I was just joking around.

361
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,830
有時候你的玩笑很傷人
Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.

362
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,680
你說得對
Well, you're right.

363
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,210
我沒意識到會讓你有這種感受
I didn't realize I was making you feel that way.

364
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,400
你能坦白告訴我真是太勇敢了
It was very brave of you to tell me.

365
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,280
謝謝
Thank you.

366
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,070
對我來說不容易
It wasn't easy.

367
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,500
他們會搶在我和謝爾頓之前先上床  
They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do,

368
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,580
我就知道
I know it.

369
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,530
亞瑟
Arthur.

370
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,980
你好  謝爾頓
Hi, Sheldon.

371
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,850
真意外在這里看見你
I'm surprised to see you here.

372
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,160
我也意外
Yeah, me, too.

373
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,560
我爬到三樓時
Somewhere around the third floor,

374
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
我眼前都開始出現白光了[回光返照]
I began to see a white light.

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,110
我去叫萊納德
I'll get Leonard.

376
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,240
不用  我...
No, no, no, I'm...

377
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,220
我是來找你的
I'm here... I'm here to see you.

378
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,880
如果你想通過我的關系找比爾·奈
If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye,

379
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,490
我幫不了你
I can't help you.

380
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,000
我已經被通知他現在是
I've been informed that he's now

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,830
限制令男比爾·奈
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

382
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,770
不是  我...
No, I'm...

383
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,380
我想  如果不太麻煩的話
I-I was thinking, if it isn't too much trouble,

384
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,970
我希望你給我的論文提提意見
I'd like to get your opinion about my-my paper.

385
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,210
謝謝
Thank you.

386
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,630
這是我的榮幸
It would be an honor.

387
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,100
太好了
Oh. Uh, great.

388
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,770
其實你可以不用給我稿子了
Well, actually, I don't need that.

389
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,770
我已經黑進你的郵箱看過了
I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.

390
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,550
那你覺得如何
And... what did you think?

391
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,790
首先  我覺得
Well, first, I think the fact that

392
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,820
你使用生日作為郵箱密碼
you use your birthday as a password

393
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,400
這個錯誤太丟人
is embarrassing.

394
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
多謝提醒
Thank you.

395
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,230
第二
Second, um...

396
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,000
我覺得你的論文極具啟發性
I thought your paper was inspired.

397
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,670
你的肯定對我來說意義重大
Oh, well, that... that means a lot to me.

398
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,340
進來喝杯茶好嗎
Can I invite you in for tea?

399
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,120
不用了  我真的得...
Uh, no, no. I-I really...

400
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
我得走了
I have... I have to run.

401
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
亞瑟  你好嗎
Hey, Arthur. How are you?

402
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,790
喝一杯也無妨
Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

403
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,430
兄弟  什么事
Oh, hey, buddy, what's up?

404
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,010
我為自己那天晚上的表現感到內疚
Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night

405
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,700
所以我給你做了個小禮物
so I made you a little something.

406
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,230
這么客氣干嘛呀
You didn't have to do that.

407
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,210
很有趣
Well, it was fun.

408
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,740
我運用了你教我們的珠寶制作技藝
I used some of the jewelry techniques you taught us.

409
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,890
這是一個光劍皮帶扣
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

410
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,600
太厲害了  謝謝
Wow, this is so cool, thanks.

411
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,670
好戲在后頭
Oh gets better.

412
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,200
更精彩的好戲還在后面  瞧
And that's not even the best part. See?

413
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,530
我也有一個
I have one, too.

414
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,050
你瞧
Check it out.

415
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,130
你可以戴上你的  咱們隨時可以來一場
You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,390
激情小劍大比拼
whenever we want.

417
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,370
質子教授節目  我心中排名第八的那集是
Yeah, and my eighth favorite episode of Professor Proton

418
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,420
泡騰劑式消化片火箭
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

419
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,850
你說  撲通撲通  嘶嘶嘶嘶
You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,

420
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,880
精彩的發射來一次
oh, what a blast-off it is."

421
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,500
記得嗎  記得這集嗎
Remember? Remember that?

422
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,880
記得嗎
Remember?

423
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,940
他就是這德行  就是這樣
He can't help it. He can't.

424
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,110
他真的沒辦法
He really can't.

425
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,430
你等著
You wait here.

426
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,550
我去拿些消化片
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

427
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,690
我們可以造出火箭
we can build that rocket,

428
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,930
然后朝著比爾·奈家發射
and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house.

429
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,560
只要我離他超過五百英尺范圍就行
As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.

430
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,450
那么   你...
So, you, uh...

431
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,370
你有沒有
you have... you have any...

432
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,130
單身的奶奶或外婆
single grandmothers?

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,570
-抱歉  兩位都嫁人了  -很好
- Sorry, they're both married. - Good.

434
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,800
婚姻幸福嗎
H-Happily?
