1
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,739
This is a picture of Walter Black,

2
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,471
a hopelessly depressed individual.

3
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,942
Somewhere inside him is a man
who fell in love,

4
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,209
who started a family...

5
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,650
And then I woke up.

6
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,113
...who ran a successful company.

7
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,727
That man has gone missing.

8
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,521
No matter what he's tried,

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,763
and he's tried everything,

10
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,732
Walter can't seem to bring him back.

11
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,970
It's as if he's died

12
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,806
but hasn't had the good sense
to take his body with him.

13
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,472
So, mostly, what he does is sleep.

14
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,652
Shares in his father's
once-proud toy company

15
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,457
are now almost as worthless as Walter feels.

16
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,525
His family used to resemble something
out of a holiday greeting card

17
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,729
but now seems to be in perpetual mourning.

18
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,502
Henry, his youngest, has become
what his teachers call "solitary. "

19
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,973
He'd like to become invisible one day

20
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,640
instead of merely unnoticed
by his own father.

21
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,948
And, Porter, his eldest?

22
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,787
Well, he's terrified of becoming
just like his father.

23
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,788
His mission? To catalog
every dreaded similarity that links them.

24
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,585
Every lip bite.

25
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,792
Every neck crack.
Every involuntary behavior.

26
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,997
He plans to erase them one by one.

27
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:17,936
His wife, Meredith, has hidden herself
behind her engineering work

28
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,945
and nighttime conference calls to Tokyo
and roller coaster designs.

29
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,974
Anything to drown out the reality
of an absent husband.

30
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:31,414
Walter's depression is an ink
that stains everything it touches.

31
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,487
A black hole that swallows all who get near.

32
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,926
They've all been waiting for him to wake up,

33
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,590
to snap out of it,

34
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,660
but he hasn't.

35
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,502
So, Meredith does the only thing left to do

36
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,005
and says the only thing left to say.

37
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,204
Goodbye.

38
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,628
Jared, you're failing this class.

39
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,331
Do you honestly think you can suddenly
hand in an "A" paper and get away with it?

40
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,395
What about Hector?

41
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,240
You got him an "A" in Family Development.

42
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,542
Look, I've never written anything for Hector.
All right?

43
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,309
If he told you differently, he's a liar.

44
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,243
Hypothetically, had I written him something,

45
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,514
we would have
raised his grades incrementally.

46
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,890
And if that happened, then, yes,
he might have turned in an "A" paper.

47
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,928
He might even be making a "B"
in a class that he used to be failing.

48
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,931
So, if someone wanted me to do this,
and do it as them,

49
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,898
in their voice and at their skill level,

50
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,061
I would say that they could
either do it my way

51
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,539
or take your chances buying
some piece of shit off the Internet.

52
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,372
-$200 every time?
- If it's too much, write it yourself.

53
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,269
More than I pay for weed.

54
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,277
Sorry, buddy.

55
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,851
You passed me again.

56
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,421
I know, honey. I was looking.

57
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,366
How was your day?

58
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,068
Did you talk to anyone?

59
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,969
I guess.

60
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,904
A new person or an old person?

61
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,564
New.

62
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,803
Good. What did you talk about?

63
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,005
He said I was a ball-licker.

64
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,913
I told him I wasn't,
and he threw me in the dumpster.

65
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,075
What?

66
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,486
Did you tell your teacher?

67
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,183
She got me out of the dumpster.

68
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,924
Well, this must be
some kind of misunderstanding,

69
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,927
and we just have to realign
or correct their...

70
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,936
I'll talk to the teacher.

71
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,031
Is Dad gone?

72
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,376
No. He's not gone, honey.

73
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,984
We just agreed that it's better
if we don't live together anymore. Okay?

74
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,738
What do you look for
beyond the sea, Grasshopper?

75
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,912
That part of me
which I know little of.

76
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,353
The past of which I was born.

77
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,752
Then, some day,
you must seek it.

78
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,058
ls it good to seek the past,
Master Po?

79
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,895
Does it not rob the present?

80
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,296
If a man dwells on the past,
then he robs the present.

81
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,769
But if a man ignores the past,
he may rob the future.

82
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,371
-The seeds of our destiny are nurtured...
-That's beautiful, Grasshopper.

83
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,775
Here. Here you go.

84
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,412
You moved.

85
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,422
Oi!

86
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,240
Hmm.

87
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,419
You know, since we're making changes
around here,

88
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,517
maybe you want to get, like,
a plumber or something.

89
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,729
I mean, this place is falling apart.

90
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:56,625
Well, that's too bad, because there's really
not much we can do about it, is there?

91
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:02,404
Whoa, relax. I'm on your side, okay.
I'm glad you kicked him out.

92
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,241
I'm just saying this whole
eating-at-the-table thing together.

93
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,337
I mean, that's...
How long do you expect us to keep that up?

94
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,309
I don't know, Porter.

95
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,374
Maybe until we start respecting
each other again?

96
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:20,515
You know, maybe when we start
asking each other how was our day

97
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,024
and clearing out the dishes...

98
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,254
Maybe I should get a paper route, too.

99
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,862
Then I'm going
to guess the number.

100
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,067
If I guess right, we do the kitten story.

101
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,538
Two big stories to get to tonight,
unfortunately...

102
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,677
Wake up.

103
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,711
Wake up, you worthless sod.

104
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,754
Bloody hell. Look at you.

105
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,689
Stone-drunk and flattened by a television.

106
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,996
That's quite an obituary
you're working up for yourself, Walter.

107
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,983
Leave me alone.

108
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,860
No. Can't do that. You don't want that.

109
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:38,733
'Cause I'm the only one what knows
how you really feel.

110
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,472
Everybody needs a friend, Walter.

111
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,505
And you've got me.

112
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,546
That's why you read all them
useless self-help books.

113
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:59,221
Chicken Soup, Positive Thinking,
How to Win Friends.

114
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,754
Which one has the chapter
about dropping the telly on your head?

115
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,724
I'm sick.

116
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,825
Yeah, Walt. On that, we agree.

117
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,904
The question is, do you want to get better?

118
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,772
I can't.

119
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,817
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're depressed.
-Yeah.

120
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,876
Lethargic. Anhedonia.

121
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,582
Wake up!

122
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,059
Books and pills. They're cotton candy.

123
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,329
You've seen
too many home-improvement shows.

124
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,386
You think you can just

125
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,865
splash up some paint
and rearrange the furniture,

126
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,231
and everything will be all right.

127
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,232
You want things to change?
I mean, really change?

128
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,007
You gotta forget
about home improvement, Walter.

129
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,179
You have gotta blow up
the whole bloody building.

130
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,491
What are you gonna do, Walter?

131
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,888
-Blow it up.
-Louder!

132
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,365
-Blow it up.
-Louder!

133
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,504
Blow it up! Blow it the fuck up! Blow it up!
Blow it up!

134
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,561
Right.

135
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,497
Too right, mate.

136
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,107
You can blow it up. Start again.

137
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,313
Who are you?

138
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:38,550
I'm the Beaver, Walter,
and I'm here to save your goddamn life.

139
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,321
Hey.

140
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,555
I'm sorry. I must have passed him again.
He just blends in.

141
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,294
No, his dad picked him up early.

142
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,157
Walter?

143
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:57,103
He said he sent you a text.
Your husband is quite a character.

144
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,021
Mom, you gotta see what we did.

145
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,087
-Okay. Where's your father?
-Come on! I'll show you.

146
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,034
You put your memory in it.

147
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,195
Where'd you get that?

148
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,399
-We made it.
-You and your dad?

149
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,203
Me and the Beaver.

150
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,609
-The Beaver?

151
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,176
Any idea where Walter
stuffed the power sander

152
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,016
you gave him two Christmases ago?

153
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,845
No?

154
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,383
No trouble. We'll make do.

155
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,485
Walter, what's with the accent
and the puppet?

156
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,125
-Give her the thing.
-Right.

157
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,469
"Hello. The person
who handed you this card

158
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,532
"is under the care of a prescription puppet."

159
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,374
Walter, what the hell is this?

160
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,903
Henry, mate, go see if you can find
that varnish we was talking about.

161
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,241
-I'll get it!
-Thanks, mate!

162
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,717
Did you read the card?

163
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,080
-Yes, I...
-Read the card.

164
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,056
-I've...
-Read the card.

165
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,597
"The person who handed you this card
is under the care of a prescription puppet

166
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,069
"designed to help create
a psychological distance between himself

167
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,368
"and the negative aspects
of his personality.

168
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,208
"Please treat him as you normally would

169
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,744
"but address yourself to the puppet.
Thank you."

170
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,801
There you go.

171
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,579
-Is this some kind of a joke?
-No, hardly, love. Nothing funny about it.

172
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,384
Stop it with the puppet!

173
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,582
All right. I'm confused, Walter,
and I need some answers right now.

174
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,656
He said if I stick with it that maybe...

175
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,627
He? Who said that?

176
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,824
Dr. Macy.

177
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,032
Dr. Macy? You quit seeing him.

178
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,702
Well, I went back.

179
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,107
So this is some kind of a program?

180
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,050
I'll field that one. Yes, Meredith.
The answer is yes.

181
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,219
That is exactly what it is.

182
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,483
I know it seems radical,

183
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,355
but in cases like Walter's,
cases where all else has been known to fail,

184
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,426
it's proven quite effective.

185
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,166
But if it's going to work,
it's going to need your full support.

186
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,893
It's very big in Sweden.

187
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,294
I couldn't find it.

188
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,738
Ah. No worries.

189
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,837
I best be on me bike.

190
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,037
You're not leaving, are you?

191
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,636
Don't worry.
I'll come back this weekend, then.

192
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,205
But you have to stay for dinner!
Mom, let him stay for dinner!

193
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,444
Look, it's all right.

194
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,077
-I don't need to.
-Please, Mom, let him stay for dinner.

195
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,087
-I'll come back this weekend, then.
-Come on.

196
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,385
-It's okay. Just for dinner.
-Please, Mom.

197
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,261
-Yeah!
-Well, right, then.

198
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,455
Let's tidy up the garage
so we can mess up the kitchen.

199
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,828
Come on. Don't touch anything sharp.

200
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,795
Hey.

201
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,733
What the hell am I doing here?

202
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,547
I need you to write me something.

203
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,576
I knew it.
He thinks I'm going to fall for this?

204
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,517
-Who?
-Mumphry, or whatever

205
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,052
vice-principal sent you.

206
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,222
Tell him I'm insulted.

207
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,088
Hey, will you hold on for a second?
No one sent me.

208
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
I really need help.

209
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,760
Look, you're the valedictorian, all right.
You have a 4.0.

210
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,036
I copy off of you in calculus.

211
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,365
Why would you want me
to write you a paper?

212
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,430
It's not a paper.

213
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,070
It's my graduation speech.

214
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,344
Save your money.
No one gives a shit about those things.

215
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,215
Yeah, well, my mom will. So...

216
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,945
Not that I'm saying that
you write other people's papers for them,

217
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:11,020
but if you did, I hear that you're really good
at making yourself sound like them.

218
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,155
Getting inside their heads.
That's what I need.

219
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,633
-No way.
-Why?

220
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,866
Because it's one thing for your little
anorexia squad to get by on their looks.

221
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,808
That's all they've got.
But for someone like you, it's just lazy.

222
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,568
Hold on.

223
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,603
Wait a minute.

224
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,039
Does this look lazy to you?

225
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,479
That is 428 pages of lazy.

226
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,085
And if you don't want to take my money
because you're just dying to see me

227
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,321
make an ass of myself, then that's fine.

228
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,421
But don't you dare call me lazy.

229
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
Douche.

230
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,071
Thank you very much.
You want olives in your salad?

231
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,275
- Yeah.
-Here you go. Watch this.

232
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,009
Would you like some more?

233
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,883
-What the...
-There he is. Hello.

234
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,390
My card.

235
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,796
We was afraid we'd have
to start without you.

236
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,195
This is a joke, right?

237
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,371
No, son, it's a fresh start.

238
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,469
Have you completely lost your mind?

239
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,669
-I know it seems a bit...
-I'm not talking to you, nut job.

240
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,172
I'm talking to Mom.

241
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,814
It takes you years to get him out of here,

242
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,841
and you let him come back the next night
with a talking hamster?

243
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,159
Failure on this scale
doesn't happen overnight.

244
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,860
Still I can't believe
that you guys made that.

245
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,932
I mean, you never... I mean, Walter never...

246
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,904
I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure
how I'm supposed to address you.

247
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,206
Well, you're doing fine, love.

248
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,580
Well, tools were always
on your Christmas list,

249
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,846
but I had no idea that you knew
how to actually make anything.

250
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,783
He's a beaver, Mom. That's what they do.

251
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,321
Yeah. Spot on, mate.

252
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,587
But, you know, Walter
wasn't half-bad himself, at one time.

253
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,594
Yeah? Who taught him?

254
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,924
I suppose he taught himself.

255
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,222
He was about your age, yeah. Cub Scouts.

256
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,666
He and his pop were supposed
to make a race car for a contest.

257
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,936
Except, his pop weren't around
so he had to do it himself.

258
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,400
Where was his dad?

259
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,613
He got very sad and he had an accident.

260
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,014
You mean Grandpa Jerry
from the graveyard?

261
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:53,053
Right-o. Anyway, Walter had Grandpa's
tools but no clue how to use them.

262
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,619
So, what he ended up making was so awful

263
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,095
that it looked like he'd screwed a set
of wheels onto a piece of dog crap.

264
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,196
And you know what the other kids called it?

265
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,427
The Turd. That was generous, mate.

266
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,639
One lady threw up all over herself
just 'cause it got close to her.

267
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,911
But when it came to racing...

268
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,668
What?

269
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,278
The Turd could not be beat.

270
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,708
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

271
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,411
-Dad?
-Yeah, mate?

272
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,287
-Can we make a Turd?
-Yeah, anytime, mate.

273
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,053
You give the word, we'll make the Turd.

274
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,817
Yeah.

275
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,291
Good night, Beaver.

276
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,656
Good night, mate.

277
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:45,997
Good night.

278
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,540
Good night, Beaver.

279
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,517
-Hello?
-Norah.

280
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,916
Hey, it's Porter.

281
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,619
Listen, what I said earlier...

282
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,319
-So, are you going to help me or not?
-Yeah.

283
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:11,857
But for this sort of thing, I'm going to have
to ask you for, like, $500?

284
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,692
Done.

285
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,871
Wow. Would you have gone $1,000?

286
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,339
-Oh, yeah.
-How about a million?

287
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,502
Can you come by tomorrow?

288
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,210
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

289
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:30,383
You know, I didn't... Look, I...
We're cool, right? I... I'm...

290
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,620
You've never even said a word to me,
you know, and...

291
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,054
-Porter?
-And it's not like we

292
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,355
-know each other or anything... Yeah.
-Just come by tomorrow.

293
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,124
-Okay.
-Okay.

294
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,196
Good night! See you soon.

295
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,358
Trust me, mate. Today will set you free.

296
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,032
What the hell is this?

297
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,500
I have no idea.

298
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,662
This is layoffs, isn't it? Goddamn China.

299
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,330
Nobody's getting laid off.

300
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,330
Get rid of you lot?

301
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,371
I'd have no one to boss around, yeah?

302
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,376
-The boss woke up and brought a friend.

303
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,816
I think we should maintain some respect
until Mr. Black tells us...

304
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,210
Good morning, all.

305
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,089
I assume you all got the cards.

306
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,487
If not, allow me to briefly explain.

307
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:57,661
Walter Black ascended
to CEO of this company two years ago.

308
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:03,195
Not through any particular skill or merit,
but because Walter was next in line

309
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,868
rather than our infinitely more qualified VP
standing right here.

310
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,467
Hello, love.

311
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,778
It was a job Walter was, well,
ill-prepared to handle.

312
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,250
Basically, well...

313
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,212
Walter's been a loser.

314
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:26,888
Which is why, as of now, he is resigning
and putting me in charge.

315
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:31,391
So, before you decide to run me out on a rail
with all the flaming torches and pitchforks,

316
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:37,600
hear me out, give me five minutes,
then you may tear me to shreds, if you like.

317
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,441
First, I will be ceding control
of all individual projects

318
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,002
back to the teams themselves.

319
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,412
That means you will be free

320
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,041
and entrusted to do the jobs
you was hired to do in the first place.

321
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,108
Hello, Hank.

322
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,850
Second, we will revamp, revitalize, re-launch

323
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,550
at the International Game
and Toy Manufacturers Expo

324
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,392
in six weeks' time.

325
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:05,791
Now, I know there's a very high degree
of skepticism about my ability to lead.

326
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,431
Isn't that right?

327
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,871
I mean, middle-aged man
with his arm stuck up my bum. Right?

328
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,272
Who wouldn't doubt me?
But I'll make you the following deal.

329
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,975
You give me two weeks, just two,
and at the end of that time,

330
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,281
anyone who wants to resign
will receive severance pay

331
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,582
and a glowing letter of recommendation.

332
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,818
-No questions asked, no exceptions.
- Excuse me?

333
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,392
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

334
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,062
Bollocks. Did I forget to introduce myself?

335
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,532
You may simply call me the Beaver.

336
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,400
Impressive.

337
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,634
So, what do you need to know?

338
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,044
Well, I guess the first thing is,
what do you want to say?

339
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,886
Well, that's kind of the problem.

340
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,420
I mean, I got good grades. Big deal.
What do I know?

341
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,258
Okay. Well, how do you want people to feel
when you're done?

342
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,128
I guess I just want them to feel not

343
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,399
let down.

344
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
"Not let down."

345
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,336
That's powerful.

346
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,104
"I'm excited, pumped. How are you doing?"

347
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,204
"Me? I'm not let down."

348
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,280
I told you that I suck. This is why I need you.

349
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,877
Okay, well, you're a cheerleader,
notorious hothead.

350
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,980
Could we talk about you getting expelled
from the eighth grade?

351
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,325
How did you find out about that?

352
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,188
No secrets on the Internet.

353
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,720
What did you do?

354
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,026
Did you steal some encyclopedias?

355
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,125
-Chew some nicotine gum?
-No.

356
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,101
What? Tease a fat kid?

357
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,626
Shut up.

358
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,197
All right. So, what is it?

359
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,139
I was tagging.

360
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,075
Tagging?

361
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,910
Like...

362
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,610
Like graffiti tagging?

363
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,183
More like art. It was just illegal.

364
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,587
Where's all this rebel-artist shit now?

365
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,123
That was a long time ago.

366
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,460
You still have some, don't you? Yeah.

367
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,765
-Show me, please.
-No.

368
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,870
If you show me, I will write you a speech
that you could free Tibet with.

369
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,304
Why do you want to see it so bad?

370
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,276
Because I like to be surprised.

371
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,420
-We have to be quick.
-All right.

372
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,054
Whose room is this?

373
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,657
No one's.

374
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,199
Oh, wow.

375
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:11,914
I like to do it big.
Like freeways, buildings, billboards.

376
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,354
And fast.
Like I'm running a million miles an hour.

377
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,721
No thinking, you know?

378
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,429
Why did you stop?

379
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,664
'Cause I got caught
and my mom couldn't take it.

380
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,512
Anyway, I threw them all away.

381
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,569
Someone must have liked them.

382
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,881
Pulled them out of the trash, didn't they?

383
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,246
-Who was it?
- What are you doing in here?

384
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,325
I was just showing Porter around the house.

385
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,424
He's on the math team with me.

386
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,627
-Right.
-Time to go.

387
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,601
Hey, I'm sorry about my mom.

388
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,935
-She's just, you know...
-That's fine.

389
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,310
You know, you are

390
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,850
so much weirder...

391
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,848
Not weird, I just mean, like,
different, I guess.

392
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,861
You're a lot more different
than I thought you'd be.

393
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,093
You know, for someone I'm paying
a lot of money to write a speech for me,

394
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,656
you're not very articulate.

395
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,895
I'm much better on paper.

396
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,369
We'll see.

397
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,375
Thank you for not laughing, I guess.

398
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,834
I wouldn't do that.

399
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,739
I wouldn't laugh.

400
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,707
Good.

401
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,777
Very, very good.

402
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,899
We salute at the threshold
of the North Sea in my mind

403
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,940
And a nod to the boredom that drove me here

404
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,072
To face the tide and swim

405
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,810
I swim, oh, swim

406
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,319
And, eventually,
what seems strange becomes common.

407
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,587
What seemed impossible becomes real.

408
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,895
Up to my knees now,
do I wait? Do I dive?

409
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:43,528
The sea has seen my like before though
it's my first and perhaps last time

410
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,844
Let's call me a Baptist,
call this the drowning of the past

411
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:55,479
She's there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back

412
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,953
So swim until you can't see land

413
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,820
Swim until you can’t see land

414
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,985
Swim until you can’t see land

415
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,792
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?

416
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,337
Until things almost
start to feel the way they used to.

417
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,902
Fixed it, love. Working like a charm.

418
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,171
It's like it's all brand new.

419
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,213
-Walter. Walter, wake up. Wake up.
-Mmm. What?

420
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,019
It's Henry. He snuck out of his room.
He's down in the garage again by himself.

421
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,323
Well, tell him to come to bed.

422
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:45,232
I know. I tell him every night, but he needs
to hear it from, you know, you.

423
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,191
Yeah.

424
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,603
I'm on it.

425
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,608
Whoa, where are you going
this time of night?

426
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,875
I'm gonna tell the little guy
to knock it off so I can sleep.

427
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,938
Right.

428
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,418
I was going to the same place.
Come on. Let's triple-team him.

429
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,550
That's okay.
You've got your little furry friend.

430
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,683
Good night.

431
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,869
What are you making besides a racket?

432
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:24,929
You couldn't sleep, either?

433
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,073
Well, actually, mate,
I was having a brilliant kip

434
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,340
till you started banging away.

435
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,047
I just had this idea.

436
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,585
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's have the idea in the morning.

437
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,712
Just 10 more minutes, please?

438
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,415
Ten more minutes, all right, yes.

439
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:45,928
But no more mucking about with tools
when I'm not around. it's not safe.

440
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,758
Or when your mother's asked you not to.
Or at night.

441
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,700
Or in a toilet.
Or when you're climbing Mount Everest.

442
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,761
Or picking your nose. Agreed?

443
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,236
-Agreed.
-There you go.

444
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,138
Can you talk to me? I like it when you talk.

445
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,638
What do you want me to talk about?

446
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,182
Doesn't matter. Just talk.

447
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,650
You have a funny voice.

448
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,952
You're quite easily entertained, aren't you?

449
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:22,088
Give you a buzz saw, a block of wood,
and some chatter...

450
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,597
Hey, Walter, did you talk to him?

451
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,911
Yes, and everything's fine.
He'll stick to the schedule.

452
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,305
What's going on?

453
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,076
I've had a breakthrough, love.
Got to get to work right away.

454
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,173
Now?

455
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,810
Not a moment to spare!

456
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,818
You're a goddess.

457
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,504
Sir? You're in early.

458
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,871
Just the woman I wanted to see.

459
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,932
Have a look at this.

460
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,843
Now, we need to get started on this
right away.

461
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,815
It's a beaver?

462
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,907
It's the future.

463
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,375
This?

464
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,815
The Talking Beaver
Woodworking Set.

465
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,988
You get your basic tools, a block of wood

466
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,618
and a talking beaver
to work right alongside of you.

467
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,391
You should see the kids, love.

468
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,522
I mean, they've got their cell phones
and their computers,

469
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,158
but, wow, you give them a block of wood,
a hammer and a saw?

470
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,566
Bob's their bleeding auntie.

471
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,161
Their poor little brains are starving
for something like this.

472
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,640
So, you're talking about a new product line
for what? Christmas?

473
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,678
Christmas? I'm talking about right now,
woman. Today.

474
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,880
This morning.

475
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,541
I guess there could be an ancillary market
in more tools.

476
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,318
Maybe pre-cut lumber pieces?

477
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,412
Sort of like Lego kits but made of wood.

478
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,117
And you can work them
into shapes on your own.

479
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,587
Now, that's using your scone.

480
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,896
Not just made out of wood, is it? Let's go.

481
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,495
But this would mean, I mean,

482
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,399
even if we could get one ready in time,
this is all we would have for the Expo.

483
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,364
That's all we'll need, my darling.

484
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,709
And for every person that points out

485
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,614
that there's a rodent at the helm,

486
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:28,248
there's another to remind him or her that
production has already increased by 35%.

487
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,425
At the end of those first two weeks,
not one person resigns.

488
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,918
Not one.

489
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,597
Now, we're going to start with...

490
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,033
The Beaver, as a core item,
along with endless project kits

491
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,371
could produce an exponential return.

492
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:50,176
The question is, do we want
to continue struggling merely to survive,

493
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:55,149
or do we want to embrace something new,
something different,

494
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,310
and see where it takes us?

495
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,851
Once again,
our beloved Jerry Co.

496
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,124
Has vision, power, energy, balls.

497
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,393
Item number three this morning,
we've got some fabrication concerns.

498
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,003
Why are you all laughing?

499
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,180
Did you talk to Dr. Macy today?

500
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,514
Indeed. He says we're coming along
just brilliantly.

501
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,453
Well, did he give you some kind of a timeline
for when the treatment might be over?

502
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,027
No, nothing specific, love.

503
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,225
Like a week, or a month, or...

504
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,529
it's a process, love.

505
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,328
We'll know when the time is right.

506
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,043
Now, rest up, you delicious little tart.

507
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,545
There's more where that came from.

508
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,412
Hector, what do I always say, man?
Read it before you turn it in.

509
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,076
It was about your own family,
for Christ's sake.

510
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,054
I just figured since it was personal,
there wouldn't be no test questions on it.

511
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,284
-But your own grandma turned you in.
-Yes. She was so proud.

512
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,318
Talking about the stuff that you had wrote
about her back in the day in D.R.

513
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,024
And then all of a sudden,
she could just tell I knew nothing about it.

514
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,260
So, she starts crying.
She calls the principal, says she doesn't...

515
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,359
All right. My name stays out of this.
You understand that, right?

516
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,168
-She called me a liar and a cheater.
-All right, all right, all right. Look.

517
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,671
Okay, I'm gonna make
a dummy website, all right?

518
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,872
You tell them you sent in your money,
you got your paper.

519
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,972
That's all you know, okay?

520
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,143
Hector, look, I gotta go.

521
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,686
I'm gonna give you the website tomorrow,
all right?

522
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,415
-Hector!
-Yes, yes, yes.

523
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,821
Great. Good.

524
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,550
Norah!

525
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,318
-Hey.
-Hey.

526
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,693
-Why are you all sweaty?
-I was doing yoga.

527
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,095
-Manly.
-Downward Dog's a bitch.

528
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,002
-Are you busy tonight?
-Are you asking me out?

529
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,330
No. Not at all.

530
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,640
I was just gonna casually inquire
if you're busy

531
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,909
without making it seem like I'd been
up all night planning something elaborate.

532
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,746
Have you been up all night
planning something elaborate?

533
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,178
Yeah, I have, like, maps and stuff.

534
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,721
You can pick me up at 7:00.
I have to be back at 12:00.

535
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,527
Awesome, so it's a date. I mean, it is, right?

536
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,796
We'll see.

537
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,959
Cool.

538
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,135
Don't mess this up.

539
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,861
You let me lead, all right?

540
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,230
Are you almost ready? Reservation's at 8:00.

541
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:18,344
-Bloody hell, woman. Look at you.
-Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

542
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,643
-Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
-Yeah?

543
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,241
The girls whipped up
something special for me.

544
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,553
We're talking full-on tux, love.

545
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,227
Yeah. Just give us a minute to pop it on,
and we'll be off.

546
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,321
Wait, it's our anniversary, honey.

547
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,990
That's why I went for the penguin suit.

548
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,898
I do not want to celebrate
20 years of marriage with a puppet.

549
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,030
I'm sorry. I've been very patient
and I've been very supportive,

550
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,804
but I want you, not him.

551
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,548
Not tonight.

552
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,216
Hi.

553
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,158
Black, party of two.

554
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,811
So, when do I get
to see some of your pages?

555
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,371
Never. it's a pyramid scheme.

556
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,741
-I didn't tell you that?
-No.

557
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,150
You didn't get the brochure?

558
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,018
-I'm kidding. I'll get it done.
-You better.

559
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:38,322
I'm not giving you 500 bucks just so you can
buy a flat screen for your dorm room.

560
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,124
I'm not buying a flat screen
for my dorm room.

561
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,220
Then, what?

562
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,960
-A mummy.
-No mummy.

563
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,103
-Then, what? What's it going to?
-Nothing.

564
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,203
Mmm-mmm.

565
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,333
A guy like you
doesn't do anything for no reason.

566
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,071
You've got a plan.

567
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,055
I was listening to the radio and, apparently,
it's gonna be really hot this weekend.

568
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:13,291
Not hot-hot, just above average.

569
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,664
-So, how's work?
-Good. Yeah, busy.

570
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,161
Busy?

571
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,844
Maps? That's what
you're saving all your money for?

572
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,437
Yeah.

573
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,676
Okay, explain, because right now,
it's looking like where you hide your bodies.

574
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,811
-It is. Every red dot is a dead body.

575
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,211
Just trying to be honest.

576
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,450
Okay, really, what's it for?

577
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:49,431
It's, like, all these places where
everything changed in the blink of an eye.

578
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,598
Like the balcony
where Martin Luther King got shot.

579
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,728
The train tracks where Woody Guthrie
hopped on his first train.

580
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,261
And?

581
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:04,908
And I just visit them and then I end up
at Brown the day before school starts.

582
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,249
It's kind of like a find-yourself trip?

583
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:13,119
No. More like a lose-stuff trip.

584
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,420
What kind of stuff do you want to lose?

585
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,659
At last count, 49 things.

586
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,899
An elaborate, mysterious plan,
and a little weird.

587
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,362
But I like it.

588
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,872
It's your paper-writing dollars at work.

589
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,576
What was that for?

590
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,955
You said you liked to be surprised.

591
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,652
-Ready?
-For what?

592
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,370
It's a great place.

593
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,970
It's kind of scary but beautiful.

594
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,352
Look, I wasn't sure which color you liked,
so I kind of got everything.

595
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,513
I hope you like sunburst yellow.

596
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,949
Porter? Porter, come on.
What are you doing?

597
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,954
Is this fantastic, or what?

598
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,758
Are you kidding?
it's awesome, but I'm not going to touch it.

599
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,233
-Why not?
-Because.

600
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,493
-Because, what? Why not?
-Because I don't want to.

601
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,665
Come on, Norah.
You have this amazing thing that you do.

602
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,672
You just put all of yourself out there.
All I can do is sound like other people.

603
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,413
-I know you have something to say.
-Okay.

604
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:52,152
-Knock yourself out. You do it.
-Come on.

605
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,050
No. I don't paint.

606
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,693
Why not?
You're so good at being other people.

607
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,788
-Well, maybe if I could paint I would, but...
-Porter, just start.

608
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,358
Okay.

609
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,773
What are you going to do?
Write "Norah + Porter forever"?

610
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,701
Because that'd be pretty cute.

611
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,269
Right?

612
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,615
-That's what you've been wanting to say.
-No.

613
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,811
You wrote 400 pages of notes.
Not one word about him?

614
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,287
What happened to my brother
is none of your business.

615
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,412
Do you understand?

616
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,321
I just thought there was something
you wanted to say

617
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,360
and you didn't know how.

618
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,624
It's none of your business.

619
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,690
What kind of person
does something like this?

620
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,995
What's the matter with you?

621
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,183
Go on. Open it.

622
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,555
Henry helped me, which basically means

623
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,854
that I bought the wood
and he did all the work.

624
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,461
It's a memory box.

625
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,364
It's very nice. Thank you.

626
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,403
Look inside.

627
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:59,437
I thought it was important
to remind ourselves of how things were.

628
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,243
How things should be.

629
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,094
Walter. No, no, no. it's okay. it's okay.

630
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,528
Is this what you want?

631
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,704
Is this progress? Christ, woman!

632
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,605
He's suffering from depression,
not amnesia!

633
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,737
You think the problem
is he can't remember these things?

634
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,045
-No.
-He can't go back. Don't you see that?

635
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:40,251
This is all in the past, and dredging it up...
Do you know where this leads?

636
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,255
You know where this Walter goes?

637
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,887
To a 10th floor balcony,
tied to a shower curtain rod.

638
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,862
Is that what you want?

639
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,927
You want the rest of your life
to be just like tonight?

640
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,598
-Well, that was Walter.
-No, Walter. No, come on.

641
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,936
Look at this. You really look at this.

642
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,404
That's you, Walter.

643
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,105
Remember that?

644
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:14,044
When Porter was born, and he was so little?

645
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:18,285
And they pulled him out of me,
and you stood right by him.

646
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,418
You looked him right in the eye,

647
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,190
and you let him know
that you weren't going anywhere,

648
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,130
that you were staying right there
so he wouldn't be scared.

649
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,670
Walter, that's you. That's the man I love.
That's the man I need.

650
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,306
You're still inside there, honey.

651
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:38,241
I know you're in there. We can go back.

652
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,110
We can get back to the way
that we used to be.

653
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,912
We are not going
down that street again, Meredith.

654
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:48,285
This man is a dead end.
He's gone. He has to be.

655
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,181
You get it?

656
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,315
I fought for you.

657
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,121
I practically breathed for you for two years
when you couldn't even get out of bed,

658
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,292
and I will continue to fight for you
because I love you.

659
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,329
I've got to know that you're coming back.
Come back to me, please.

660
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,333
Walter?

661
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,304
Walter?

662
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,622
Norah, I can't take this again.

663
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,491
Come on.

664
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,130
Hello. We came as soon as we heard.

665
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,811
I'm the Beaver,
and this is Porter's dad, Walter.

666
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,646
Listen, we'll get it all sorted.
I'm here now so we'll take care of things.

667
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,247
Have a nice safe drive home.

668
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:09,726
Wait.

669
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,140
Porter, mate, hang about. Come on.
We can discuss this. Come on.

670
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,678
-Give me that thing!
-Calm down!

671
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,044
-Give it to me! Goddamn it!
-Stop it!

672
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,673
-Give me that thing!
-Stop!

673
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,342
Leave him alone!

674
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,788
Porter! Porter! Oh, my God.
Porter, are you okay? Are you all right?

675
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,782
Porter, let me see your hands.
Are they bleeding?

676
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,454
I'm sorry, son. I didn't mean to do that.

677
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,623
You keep your hands off him!

678
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,595
Porter, come on. Let me see.

679
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,077
Are you happy now?

680
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,916
Porter? Porter?

681
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,218
It's Christmas in May.

682
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,226
That's what some retailers are saying

683
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:43,287
with Mr. Beaver Woodchopper Kits
selling out in droves.

684
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,459
Recently, Jerry Co.
had been in steep decline,

685
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,868
hovering on the verge of bankruptcy
earlier this year.

686
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,999
But thanks to Mr. Beaver,
that won't be happening any time soon.

687
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,111
It's like a $100 million ad campaign, for free!

688
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,754
Jerry Co.'s back in the game.
The old man would be so proud.

689
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,286
I've got to hand it to you.

690
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,556
You pulled all the strings,
and look where we landed.

691
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,494
On top, for once.

692
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,232
-It feels good, doesn't it?
-They.

693
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,330
Sir?

694
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,241
My family.

695
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,738
Who's the biggest interview request
we've had so far?

696
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,918
-All the morning shows. CNN, CNBC...
-Today Show, then. Set it up.

697
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:44,754
But, sir, the Today Show is on television.

698
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:51,197
What are we hiding? We're winners.
We should be shouting it from the rooftops.

699
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,793
It would certainly be a story.

700
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:07,747
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anyone else,

701
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,577
but I think you're ready to hear it.

702
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,714
Okay.

703
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,020
I'm not a puppet.

704
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,726
I'm real.

705
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,265
I'm alive.

706
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,498
And the world needs to know.

707
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,090
You all right, love?

708
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,899
Some trouble?

709
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,795
I talked to Dr. Macy today.

710
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,464
What did he have to say for himself?

711
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,977
He says that you haven't been to see him
in over a year.

712
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,949
Dr. Macy says that you're sick, Walter.
Very sick.

713
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,078
Yeah. Right.

714
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,054
He said this sounds like
some kind of a mania.

715
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,218
Okay, well, who gives a shit
what Dr. Macy has to say?

716
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,282
I fixed him.

717
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:32,062
Everybody else seems to get it.
Henry, people at work. Everyone except you.

718
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,359
Does that tell you something?

719
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,631
You just want to live like this forever?
Talking through your hand?

720
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,606
I'd say it's been a pretty
smashing success so far, wouldn't you?

721
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,075
You need help, Walter! You need help!
You're sick.

722
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,411
"Help." Eat the pill, read the book,
see the bleeding expert.

723
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,612
-Walter finally helped himself.
-Listen to yourself. This is insane.

724
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,708
You're talking about a puppet.

725
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,552
No, Meredith.
You're talking about a bloody puppet.

726
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,587
We're talking about a miracle.

727
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,225
-Who's "we," Walter?

728
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,407
I know it's hard, mate. I know.

729
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,473
You can't afford to get mixed up
in all of this.

730
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,576
You just keep moving.
Keep moving and don't look back.

731
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,003
You're right, of course.

732
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,769
Walter is sick.

733
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:54,074
But make no mistake about it, love.
I'm not going anywhere.

734
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,721
I've rented a house.

735
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,327
I'm taking the boys
and everything we can carry.

736
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:11,695
I don't want you to call.
I don't want you to visit.

737
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:17,803
If you're determined to lose your mind,
well, I can't stop you.

738
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:22,940
But I'm not gonna let them stand there
and watch it. Not my sons.

739
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:33,814
Insanity may play at the office,
but it's not gonna work in front of a judge.

740
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,172
Why aren't you coming with us?

741
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,984
Another time, mate. Another time.

742
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,420
But I want to stay with you.

743
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,524
You go with your mum, all right?
We'll get it sorted. You'll see.

744
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,327
Everything will be good again real soon.
All right.

745
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,089
-Bye.
-Let's go.

746
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,190
Bye.

747
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,308
I love you, Daddy.

748
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,613
I love you, too, son. I love you, too.

749
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:17,620
Go on. Off you go. Go on.

750
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,353
Well, sometimes, Matt... May I call you Matt?

751
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,453
Yeah, sure.

752
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,696
Sometimes, a single inspiration
just comes to you

753
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,897
in the middle of the night.

754
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,308
But your genius seems to hide
in a stuffed toy.

755
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,142
So people have to doubt your sanity a little.

756
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,345
Well, Mozart was said to occasionally meow
like a cat,

757
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,476
but he got on all right.

758
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,089
Great music, don't you think?

759
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,690
Walter, I want to talk about depression.

760
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,092
Because the way it's been told to me,

761
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,256
this whole thing started as a way for you
to deal with your mental illness.

762
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,932
Well, all right.

763
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,229
Well, sometimes, Matt,

764
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,168
we reach a point where, in order to go on,

765
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,835
we have to wipe the slate clean.

766
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,874
We start to see ourselves as a box
that we're trapped inside.

767
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,580
And no matter how we try and escape,

768
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,143
self-help, therapy, drugs,

769
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,883
we just sink further and further down.

770
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,017
The only way to truly break out of the box

771
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,153
is just to get rid of it altogether.

772
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,498
I mean, you built it in the first place.

773
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,229
If the people around you
are breaking your spirit, who needs them?

774
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,771
Your wife who pretends to love you,

775
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,669
your son who can't even stand you.

776
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,232
I mean, put them out of their misery.

777
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,107
Starting over isn't crazy.

778
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,081
Crazy is being miserable

779
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,880
and walking around half asleep, numb,

780
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:27,714
day after day after day.

781
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,848
Crazy is pretending to be happy.

782
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,559
Pretending that the way things are

783
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,030
is the way they have to be
for the rest of your bleeding life.

784
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,461
All the potential, hope,

785
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,594
all that joy, feeling,

786
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,038
all that passion
that life has sucked out of you.

787
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,603
Reach out, grab a hold of it

788
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,613
and snatch it back
from that blood-sucking rabble.

789
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,385
Walter, it's good to have you here.

790
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:00,751
Thank you.

791
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,363
This is a picture of Walter Black,

792
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,268
a hopelessly depressed individual

793
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,369
who becomes the Beaver,

794
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,276
who becomes a phenomenon.

795
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:30,044
There's a lot of people out there
who are desperate enough to listen.

796
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,942
People seem to love a train wreck

797
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,978
when it's not happening to them.

798
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,919
Norah, look, we need to talk.

799
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,055
Now's not a good time.

800
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,657
Yeah, well, I called you, I texted you,
and I lM'd you,

801
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,565
and it never seems like a good time. So...

802
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,331
Maybe you should take that as a hint.

803
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,033
I'm an idiot, all right?
That's not how I wanted things to turn out.

804
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,633
I like you, all right? I actually give a shit.

805
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,908
You don't give a shit about me.
You don't even know me.

806
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,913
Look, your brother OD'd, all right?

807
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,178
But ditching your own talent,
what makes you you,

808
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,117
that's not gonna bring him back.
It's just going to make you nothing.

809
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:11,057
You stay the hell away from me.

810
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,683
You and your psycho family.

811
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:32,106
Are you happy? Are you truly, truly happy?

812
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,680
Because, Jon,
there's something lacking in all of us.

813
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,010
A missing piece.

814
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,645
There's a little bit of a black spot
or a dark spot.

815
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,482
-It's that obvious?

816
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,452
I'm sorry to say, Jon,
but Walter needs a little help.

817
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,255
Because he's not too articulate
at the moment.

818
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,763
In fact, he's not well.

819
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,439
Get up. Get up.

820
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,682
Get up, you miserable wanker.

821
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,084
You're not going to get much
out of ol' Walter.

822
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,816
He's feeling a bit under the weather,
you see?

823
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,017
Come on. it's a radio show.

824
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,559
People can't even see the puppet.

825
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,495
So why talk through the puppet?

826
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:37,993
Hello ?

827
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,055
Mere, it's me.

828
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,164
Walter, are you okay?

829
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,634
Yeah, look,

830
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:46,829
I can't... I can't...

831
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,034
What are you doing?

832
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,636
What's going on?

833
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,844
Walter? Walter, talk to me!

834
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,911
Who are you talking to?

835
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,619
-Hang up. You hang up right now.
-Walter?

836
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:11,897
Can your mother stitch?

837
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,415
You'll never win.

838
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,662
- I want Daddy. Where's Daddy?
- I know.

839
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,199
I want the Beaver.

840
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,637
Are you awake?
Honey, you've got to go get Dad, all right?

841
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,101
Why?

842
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,233
He's not answering his phone,
and Henry won't stop crying.

843
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,540
I just don't know what to do. Please.

844
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:02,447
Come on, baby.
We're going to find Daddy soon. it's okay.

845
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:55,595
Haven't I given you
exactly what you asked for?

846
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,738
You don't need them, Walter.

847
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,084
I love you.

848
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:20,316
I'm the only one that really, really loves you.

849
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:27,697
And that is why
I would never let you go back.

850
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,770
Never.

851
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,086
I don't want to sleep anymore.

852
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,381
Maybe...

853
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,493
Maybe, you know,
we should work on something.

854
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,894
Yeah, sure, mate. Come on.

855
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,308
Walter, not like this.

856
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,786
Don't do it.

857
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,549
It will be worse than before. Much worse.

858
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,586
Do you want to end up
a worthless, lonely piece of shit?

859
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,588
You're nothing without me, Walter.

860
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,488
Nothing!

861
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,960
I'm the only part of you that works.

862
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,005
I'm sorry.

863
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,554
Walter! How about Henry, your kid?
You remember him?

864
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,797
Walter!

865
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,029
Dad?

866
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,706
BP's dropping. Don't touch the tourniquet
until he's on the table.

867
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,568
It's the only reason he still has a pulse.

868
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,645
Wake

869
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,115
From your sleep

870
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:38,459
The drying of your tears

871
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:44,599
Today we escape

872
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,800
As the new CEO of Jerry Co.,

873
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,777
I want to assure people
that the company is back in good hands.

874
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,479
Pack

875
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,349
And get dressed

876
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:09,926
Before your father hears us

877
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,366
Before

878
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,668
All hell

879
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:22,336
Breaks loose

880
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,662
I paid Porter $200,

881
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,000
and he did some research.

882
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,372
I let my family down.

883
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,976
I'm really ashamed about this,

884
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:02,277
and I just want to put it behind me
as soon as possible.

885
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,922
Grasshopper,
are you fishing in our lily pond?

886
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,086
Come on. Let's go see your dad.

887
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,664
-I'm not going.
-Fine.

888
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:24,062
If you don't want to go, then don't go.
But you're not just going to sleep all day.

889
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,029
Come on.

890
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,840
Come on, Porter. Let's go. Get up!

891
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:30,899
-For Christ's sake.
-Stop!

892
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,946
- Are we going?
-Stop! Stop!

893
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,536
Yes.

894
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,775
Fine.

895
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,115
Just do something, all right?

896
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,386
Go outside, take a walk, steal a car.
I don't care.

897
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,485
I just don't want to find you back in bed
when I get home.

898
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,870
Your family's here.

899
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,412
It's okay. Go on.

900
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,224
Hey, little fella. How are you?

901
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,092
Good.

902
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:28,861
What's that?

903
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,194
-it's a brain.
-Wow. it's a brain!

904
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:34,965
Mom says yours got broken.

905
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,401
This will come in handy.

906
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:41,413
So, are you crazy?

907
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,873
Maybe.

908
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,213
We're working on it.

909
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,054
Does that mean you can come home?

910
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,318
We're working on that, too.

911
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,488
Hey, where's your brother?

912
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,088
Probably sleeping. It's all he does.

913
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,300
Come here.

914
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,967
Come here! I'll bite you on your ear!

915
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,953
Wow.

916
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,590
I must have sent you 15 texts.

917
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,228
I'd given up on you.

918
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,795
Well, that makes two of us.

919
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:16,006
You were right.
I guess I had some stuff to say.

920
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,936
Apparently, a lot of stuff.

921
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,508
Anyway, now you know what's on my mind,
so you can write my speech.

922
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,485
No.

923
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,217
I think I'm officially out of that business.

924
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,791
You owe me.

925
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,257
You made this for me.

926
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,695
Yesterday.

927
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,061
How come?

928
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,193
Because there's more
that belongs on a wall than,

929
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,206
"Norah has a dead brother."

930
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,777
Even if it is a big mess.

931
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,777
It's amazing.

932
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:01,677
Funny. I think it's a mess,
and you think it's amazing.

933
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,417
And I think you're amazing,
and you think you're a mess.

934
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,088
You know what?
I don't want to think anymore.

935
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,669
You still owe me a speech.

936
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,532
Just make sure it sounds like me.

937
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:32,649
So, do I just sit here writing
and get arrested again?

938
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,279
No, take it with you, dummy.

939
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,624
Take it with me?

940
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,998
Good afternoon,
graduates, dead poets,

941
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:31,373
painters, future Einsteins,
and all those in between.

942
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:35,212
Today l'm here to warn you
that you are being lied to.

943
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:40,218
Our parents, our teachers, our doctors
have lied to us.

944
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:45,417
And it's the exact same lie.
The same six words,

945
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,994
"Everything is going to be okay."

946
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,793
But what if it isn't?

947
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,894
What if some of human experience
is just something you inherit,

948
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,767
like curly hair or blue eyes?

949
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:03,503
What if pain is just in your DNA
and tragedy is your birthright?

950
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:05,934
Or what if..

951
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,777
- "Or what if sometimes... "
- ...sometimes...

952
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,816
"...right out of the blue,
when you least expect it,

953
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,120
"shit just happens?

954
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,221
"Shit just happens."

955
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,163
Okay, I'm sure, right now,
you're all thinking,

956
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,665
"Man, this is the darkest graduation speech
I've ever heard."

957
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,703
And it is.
I agree with you, but I didn't write it.

958
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:40,172
I've spent so much time
waiting for this lie to come true

959
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,910
that I finally paid someone
to tell the truth for me.

960
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,878
I'm not okay.

961
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,890
Not at all.

962
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,557
The truth is,

963
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,893
I'm missing something,

964
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,124
the thing I loved the most,

965
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,371
the face I wish
were in the front row right now.

966
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,437
The brother I'll never get back.

967
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,608
So what do I do with that?

968
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,314
What do any of us do,

969
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,248
besides lie?

970
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,690
This is what I believe.

971
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:40,035
Right now, in this auditorium,
there is someone who is with you.

972
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,475
Someone who is willing to pick you up,
dust you off,

973
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:45,806
kiss you, forgive you,

974
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:50,079
put up with you, wait for you, carry you,

975
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,849
love you.

976
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:57,019
So, while everything
may not always be okay,

977
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,119
one thing I know is true.

978
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,195
You do not have to be alone.

979
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,141
I didn't think you'd come.

980
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,775
I didn't think I would, either.

981
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,451
I'm just glad you're still here.

982
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,188
Yeah, most of me, anyway.

983
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,316
Yeah.

984
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,434
You know, when I was a little kid,

985
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:18,336
man, all I ever wanted was to be like you.

986
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,875
Then I got older,

987
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,309
and I just wanted to be anybody else.

988
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,044
And now?

989
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,621
Dad.

990
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,755
This is a picture of Walter Black,

991
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,120
who had to become a beaver,

992
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,663
who had to become a father,

993
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:57,460
so that, one day,
this might just be a picture of Walter Black.
