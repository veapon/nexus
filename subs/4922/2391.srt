4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,480
中世紀的時候  興起了一種比賽

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,150
不管貴族或平民  都為之狂熱

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,430
即使只有貴族騎士  可以參賽

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,390
那就是馬上槍術比賽

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,400
對某個騎士而言  一個過氣的前任冠軍

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,400
這代表了結束

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,240
但對他的平民隨從  威廉來說

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,640
這只是開始

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,750
我們該幫他嗎  
Should we help him?

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,750
他得在兩分鐘內上場  不然就等于棄權
He's due in the lists in two minutes. Two minutes or forfeit.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,420
這借我們
Lend us those.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,420
右邊  左邊
Right. Left.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,600
-死了  -什么  
- Dead.  - Eh?

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,610
兩回合下來的比數是三比零
Three scores to none after two lances.

18
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,280
只要艾克特爵爺不摔馬  我們就贏了
As long as Sir Ector doesn't fall off his horse,we've won.

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,780
他死了
He's dead.

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,390
-什么意思  -他死了
What do you mean?  - His life's spark is covered in shite.

21
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,150
他的精神已遠走  但臭味還在
His spirit is gone but his stench remains.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,890
-這樣回答你的問題了嗎  -不
- Does that answer your question?  - No,no,no.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,470
不  他只是睡著了  叫醒他
No,he sleeps. Rouse him.

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,740
我三天沒吃東西了  
I haven't eaten in three days!

25
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,240
我們也沒吃啊  
None of us have!

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,810
-我們得去找個神父來  -不  他沒死  
- Let's fetch a priest.  - No,he's not dead!

27
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,080
醒醒  快點  
You waKe up! Come on!

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,180
快啊  
Come on!

29
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,250
你這臭笨蛋  
You manKy git!

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,990
洛倫
Roland.

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,150
隨從  艾克特爵爺必須馬上報到  不然就等于棄權
Squire,Sir Ector must report at once or forfeit the match.

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,500
他馬上過去
He's on his way.

33
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,240
我三天沒吃東西了  
I haven't eaten in three days!

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,660
三天哪  你吃了什么  同伴  
Three days! What did you eat,mate?!

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,500
如果你沒死  我就殺了你  
If you wasn't dead,I would Kill you!

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,610
我替他上場
I'll ride in his place.

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,000
脫掉他的盔甲  我替他上場
Strip his armor. I'm riding in his place.

38
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,340
華特  別踢他了  我替他上場  來幫我
Wat,stop KicKing him! I'm riding in his place. Help me.

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,550
威廉  你有什么頭銜  
What's your name,William?

40
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,960
威廉柴契爾  把頭銜告訴我啊
William Thatcher,answer me with your name.

41
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,960
不是威廉爵士
It's not Sir William.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,860
也不是伯爵  公爵或威廉國王
It's not Count or DuKe or King William.

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,290
這我知道
I Know that.

44
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,670
要有貴族血統才能參賽
You must be of noble birth to compete.

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,040
那不重要  重要的是有飯吃  你到底想不想吃飯  
A detail. The landscape is food. Do you want to eat or not?

46
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,570
要是被貴族發現  我們就吃不完兜著走
If the nobles find out,there'll be the devil to pay.

47
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,480
那就祈禱他們不會發現
Then pray that they don't.

48
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,070
騎士傳說
A.Knight`s.Tale.

49
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,480
面甲拉下
Visor.

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,240
快點  我們遲了
Come on,we're late.

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,360
目前比數是三比零  艾克特爵士領先
The score stands at three lances to none in favor of Sir Ector.

52
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,530
阿拉貢的菲力浦勛爵
Lord Philip of Aragon.

53
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,620
您準備好了嗎  
Stand ye ready?

54
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,960
艾克特爵士  您準備好了嗎  
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,030
準備好了嗎  
Ready?

56
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,470
我跟艾克特爵士對打過很多次
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

57
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,540
當他的練習靶  你從來沒擊中他
In practice as his target. You never strucK him.

58
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,300
-別拿這些細節來煩我  -為了食物  千萬別摔下馬
- Badger me not with details.  - The landscape. Stay on the horse.

59
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,210
他需要三分  他必須把你打下馬
He needs 3 points. He has to KnocK you off the horse.

60
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,710
洛倫  我知道怎么記分
I Know how to score,Roland.

61
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,380
我這輩子等的就是這一刻
I've waited my whole life for this moment.

62
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,720
等艾克特爵爺死翹翹  
For Sir Ector to shite himself to death?

63
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,060
插進托架  托架
Get it in the cradle. In the cradle.

64
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,670
插進托架啊  
Get it in the cradle!

65
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,690
威廉  你還活著嗎  
William,are you alive?

66
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,190
-我們贏了  -你聽得到我說話嗎  
- We won! We won! - Can you hear me?

67
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,520
走開啦  威廉  你聽得到嗎  
Get off me! William,can you hear me?

68
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,860
我們贏了  
We won!

69
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,640
他在呼吸  他還有氣  
He's breathing. He's breathing!

70
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
艾克特爵士
Sir Ector.

71
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,810
艾克特爵士  取下頭盔
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

72
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,980
大人  最后一擊  讓我的頭盔變形拿不下來了
My lord,the final blow of the lance has bent it onto my head.

73
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
他說最后一擊
He says the final blow of the

74
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,650
大人  這位就是優勝者
I present your champion,my lord.

75
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,120
二十
Twenty.

76
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,620
不  十
No,10.

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
-十五  -好
- Fifteen.  - Done.

78
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,620
很好  再見了
Very good. Cheers.

79
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,200
十五個銀幣  他不要那個
Fifteen silver florins. He didn't want that.

80
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,200
五個給威廉
That's five for William.

81
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,710
五個給華特  另外五個  給要回英格蘭老家的洛倫
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,who's going home to England.

82
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,450
我要直接去酒館  鰻魚派  乳酪餅
Straight to the pub for me. Eel pie,brie tart

83
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,550
薄荷夾心的艾菊蛋糕
tansy caKes with peppermint cream.

84
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,520
我們辦得到
We could do this.

85
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,390
我們已經辦到了  在你手上的可是銀幣啊
We've done it,boy. That's silver in your hand.

86
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,220
我是說我們可以靠比賽吃飯  我們可以打遍天下
No,I mean,we can do this. We can be champions.

87
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,240
把銀幣給我
Give us your coins.

88
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,680
快把銀幣給我
Give me your coins.

89
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,410
好  一個給你
Now,that's one for you.

90
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,590
一個給你
And onefor you.

91
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,520
這樣就剩下十三個
Which leaves 13.

92
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,590
當作訓練和治裝的費用
That's 1 3 for training and outfitting.

93
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,760
再一個月就是魯昂槍術比賽
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

94
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,260
我們可以共享更大的獎
We could split a bigger prize.

95
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,430
再一個月我們就可以名利雙收
In one month we'd be on our way to glory and riches.

96
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,200
或跟艾克特爵士一樣去見閻王  威廉  我只想回家
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector. William,I just want to go home.

97
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,940
艾菊蛋糕和時蘿小牛肉丸  我的五個銀幣給我
Tansy caKes. Dilled veal balls. I'll taKe my five now.

98
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,210
等等
Oh,wait up.

99
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,890
你走錯路了  
You're going the wrong way!

100
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,630
你根本不會馬上槍術比賽
You can't even joust.

101
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,630
只要夠膽準備被痛擊就行了  我膽子夠大
Most of it is the guts to taKe a blow. Guts I have.

102
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,300
至于技巧呢  我有一個月的時間可以學
And technique? I have a month to learn that.

103
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,610
告訴我誰比我還會使劍
And name a man better with a sword than I am.

104
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,400
-那是在練習的時候  -你沒有貴族血統
- In the practice ring.  - You're not of noble birth.

105
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,130
那就騙他們啊
So,we lie.

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,970
貴族一開始  是怎么成為貴族的  
How did the nobles become noble in the first place?

107
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,980
他們在劍尖下受勛  我就用長槍來受勛
They tooK it at the tip of a sword. I'll do it with a lance.

108
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,880
-一支鈍槍  -華特  那無所謂
- A blunted lance.  - No matter,Wat.

109
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,990
命運可以改變  我才不要一輩子默默無聞
A man can change his stars. I won't spend the rest of my life as nothing.

110
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,000
那才叫沒沒無聞  那就是想要名利雙收的下場
That is nothing. And that's where glory will taKe us.

111
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,670
我們只是平民  名利不是我們能享受的
We're peasants. Glory and riches are beyond our grasp.

112
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,600
但是把肚子喂飽  這種夢才可能實現
But a full stomach? That dream can come true.

113
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,850
如果你們能拿走銀幣  就去英格蘭吃蛋糕吧
If you can taKe your coins,go eat caKe in England.

114
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,350
如果不能  就跟我走
But if you can't,you come with me.

115
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,860
瞧吧  錢并不重要
You see? Money doesn't matter.

116
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,240
看到我有多餓了嗎  
See how hungry I am?!

117
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,710
-看到了嗎  -華特  去你的肚子
- Do you?!  - Damn your stomach,Wat!

118
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
洛倫  拜托你
Roland,please.

119
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,730
利用十三個銀幣  三個男人可以改變他們的命運
With 13 silver pieces,three men can change their stars.

120
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,060
威廉  上帝愛你
God love you,William.

121
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,670
我知道  我是爹不疼娘不愛
I Know,I Know. No one else will.

122
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,180
運氣不好
UnlucKy.

123
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,250
-他好像愈來愈糟了  -他是愈來愈糟
- I thinK he's getting worse.  - He is getting worse.

124
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,100
換手
Switch.

125
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,780
換手
Switch.

126
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,280
名利雙收  名利雙收  
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

127
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,390
你知道多危險了吧  
You see how dangerous it is?

128
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,300
快一點  快一點  好好發揮你的腳力  
Faster! Faster! All right,use those legs!

129
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,310
快啊  洛倫  再快點  
Come on,Roland. Faster! Faster!

130
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,970
你沒擊中
You missed it.

131
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,970
你已經練習幾十遍了
You've done it dozens of times.

132
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,310
我想那表示我們應該再來一次
Well,I guess that means we should do it again.

133
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,980
來吧
Come on.

134
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,660
快啊  小馬兒
Come on,ponies.

135
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,150
給他好看
Fong him.

136
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,830
快一點  保持平衡
Faster. Balance.

137
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,660
不  慢一點  穩一點
No,slower. Keep it steady.

138
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,170
我穿過去了  瞧  我穿過去了  
I got it! Look,I got it!

139
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,460
就快了
Any minute now.

140
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,150
-比較好了  -不錯
- Yes,better.  - Nice.

141
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,300
-換我騎了  -不
- It's my turn to ride.  - No.

142
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,200
我們還沒到指定的地方  而且你不該騎
We haven't reached the marKer. And you shouldn't.

143
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,500
我的隨從騎馬  我卻走路  這樣能看嗎  
How would it looK if my squire rode while I walKed?

144
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,300
我才不管  該我騎了  該我騎了  
I don't give a witch's teat! It's my turn! It's my turn!

145
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,140
也許大家都不該騎  這匹馬體力不比從前了
Maybe nobody should ride. The horse is not what he used to be.

146
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,980
好吧
Fine. Fine.

147
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,480
早
Morning.

148
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,650
早
Morning.

149
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,330
先生
Hoy,sir.

150
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,260
您在做什么  
What are you doing?

151
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,030
呃  跋涉
Uhtrudging.

152
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,600
你知道跋涉吧  跋涉啊  
You Know,trudging? To trudge?

153
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,280
緩慢  疲憊  沮喪
To trudge the slow,weary

154
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,380
卻意志堅定地走著  我什么都不剩
depressing,yet determined walK of a man who had nothing left

155
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,280
只剩下繼續向前邁進的沖動
except the impulse to simply soldier on.

156
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,380
你被搶了嗎  
Were you robbed?

157
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,620
有意思的問題  是的
Interesting question. Yes.

158
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,620
同時呢  我也要大聲地說‥不是〃
And at the same time,a huge,resounding,"No."

159
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,130
其實  這比較像是  非自愿性的貧窮
It's more a sort of involuntary vow of poverty,really.

160
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,960
但往好的一面看  跋涉代表著自豪
But on the brighter side,trudging does represent pride.

161
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,970
自豪  果斷  全心相信全知全能的上帝
Pride,resolve and faith in the good Lord Almighty.

162
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,970
基督啊  求求您  拯救我免于苦
Please,Christ,rescue me from my tribu-

163
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,140
難
lations.

164
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,210
你是誰  
Who are you?

165
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,650
荊棘里的百合
Lilium inter spinas.

166
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,150
荊棘里的百合
The lily among the thorns.

167
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,150
姓喬瑟名杰佛瑞  以寫作為業
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name. Writing's the game.

168
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,400
喬瑟

169
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,400
杰佛瑞喬瑟  作家啊  
Geoffrey Chaucer,the writer?

170
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,070
-作什么  -"作什么"作家
- A what?  -"A what?" A writer.

171
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,410
我以墨水在羊皮紙上書寫  給我一文錢  我什么都幫你寫
I write with inK and parchment. For a penny,I'll scribble anything.

Summonses,decrees,edicts,warrants,patents of nobility.

173
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,090
我還以寫詩聞名  如果有靈感的話
I've been Known to jot down a poem,if the muse descends.

174
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,350
你們大概看過我的書  公爵夫人之書
You probably read my booK,The Book of the Duchess.

175
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,920
那是個寓言
Well,it was allegorical.

176
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,200
我們不會因此對你有成見的  每個人都有權自作決定
We won't hold it against you. Each man decides that for himself.

177
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,530
你剛說貴族血統證明嗎  
Did you say patents of nobility?

178
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,700
沒錯  我是這么說的
That's right. I did.

179
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,780
你們三位是  
And you gentlemen are?

180
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,550
我是烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦爵士  來自蓋德蘭
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein from Gelderland.

181
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,290

These are my faithful squires,Delves of Dodgington

182

183
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,300
我是獅心理察  幸會
I'm Richard the Lionheart. A pleasure.

184

No,I'm Charlemagne! John the Baptist!

185
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,470
好了  
All right!

186
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,470
閉嘴  否則我讓你開不了口
Hold your tongue,sir,or lose it.

187
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,300

杰夫
Geoff.

191
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,910
赤裸大師  你還有話要說  或者我們可以上路了  
Have you any more to say,Master Nude,or may we be on our way?

192
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,820
-去槍術比賽  -這條是到魯昂的路
- Off to the tournament?  - This is the road to Rouen.

193
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,920
那還不一定呢  魯昂那里限制得很嚴
That remains to be seen. They're limiting the field at Rouen.

194
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
父母雙方四代都是貴族  才會被認定是貴族
Noble birth must be established for four generations on either side.

195
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,100
還要附貴族血統證明書
Patents of nobility must be provided.

196
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,350
聽著  只要給我衣服
Listen,clothe me

197
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,350
給我鞋子  喂飽我  你的證明書就不成問題
shoe me,for God's saKe,feed me and you'll have your patents.

198
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,020
不

201
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,200
好聲好氣  好聲好氣
Nice,nice,nice.

202
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,540
好
All right.

203
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,550
你要是敢背叛我們  我就打得你吐破腸流
Betray us and I will fong you until your insides are out

204
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,550
面目全非  內臟變外臟
your outsides are in and your entrails are your extrails.

205
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,830
我會讓你痛苦
Pain.

206
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,890
非常痛苦
Lots of pain.

207
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,570
比賽大會會場  魯昂

I present Sir Ulrich,whose mother's father was Shilhard von Rechberg

son of the DuKe Guelph of Saxony,son of Ghibellines,son of Wendish.

210
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,350
-而溫狄胥繼承了  -可以了  傳令人
- Wendish inherited the fief  - That'll do,herald.

211
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,420
六代很夠了  證明書給我看
Six generations is more than enough. Show me the patents.

212
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,200
指出你的烏瑞克大人  要參加哪幾場比賽
Indicate in which events shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

213
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,940
他第一場出戰的是摩提莫大人
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

214
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,270
非常謝謝你
ThanK you very much.

215
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,460
真不敢相信  喬瑟  你做到了
I can't believe it. You did it,Chaucer.

216
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,560
我得謝謝你  我本來不認為  我們會有機會
I thanK you. I didn't thinK we had a chance.

217
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,300
威廉  我很樂意幫忙
My pleasure,William.

218
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,970
你不介意的話  我想留下來
If you don't mind,I'll sticK around.

219
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,800
當我的傳令人吧  我贏的話你也有份
Be my herald,you'll get part of the winnings.

220
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,340
說定了  現在請容我離開  我必須去找一個人談生意
Done. Now if you don't mind,I have to see a man about a dog.

221
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,520
離開了奇普塞
Walking out from Cheapside

222
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,850
尋找大好前程
My fortunes for to seek

223
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,190
我走過泰晤士河畔
I passed along the River Thames

224
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,520
河水臭氣沖天
Its Waters did they reek

225
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,960
我在那兒遇見一位美麗姑娘
"Was there I met a pretty lass

226
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,190
她說她名叫妮爾
She said her name Was Nell

227
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,050
不管天堂地獄  我都跟她去
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

228
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,100
你愿意跟我說話嗎  
Would you speaK to me?

229
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,270
說話啊
Ah,to speaK.

230
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,280
先生  女人不該多話的
Sir,my sex are marKed by their silence.

231
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,280
我很想聽你說話  即使我會因此失去雙耳
I would hear you speaK if it cost me my ears.

232
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,620
很好  因為我可不希望  一生沉默無語
That is well,for I do not want silence in my life.

233
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,820
告訴我你叫什么名字
Tell me your name.

234
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,560
-若我很丑  你還會在乎嗎  -會
- Would you care if I were ugly?  - Yes

235
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,960
我是說不會  我是說
I mean,no. I mean

236
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,140
你褻瀆了上帝的居所  
You desecrate the house of God!

237
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,850
告訴我你的名字
Tell me your name.

238
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,190
你要拿我的名字做什么呢  獵人先生  
And what would you do with my name,Sir Hunter?

239
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,530
叫我狐貍吧  我對你而言不過如此
Call me a fox,for that is all I am to you.

240
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,530
性感美女  那我就先叫你狐貍  直到我問出你的名字
Then a fox you shall be until I find your name,my foxy lady.

241
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,200
我承認他這獵人挺英俊的
He's a handsome hunter. I give him that.

242
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,210
小姐們  你們不震驚嗎  
Does this not shocK you,ladies?

243
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,710
當然震驚啊  大人
Certainly,my lord.

244
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,380
我笑是因為怕自己哭出來
I only laugh just to Keep from weeping.

245
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,760
美貌真是詛咒啊
Beauty is such a curse.

246
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,160
祈禱你年華早逝
Pray your years come swiftly.

247
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,490
花容盡褪  好更盡心服侍上帝
Pray your beauty fades so you may better serve God.

248
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,840
我有啊  我常常這么祈禱
Oh,I do,my lord. I pray for it all the time.

249
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,600
上帝啊  你為何詛咒我  給我這張臉  
Why,God,did you curse me with this face?

250
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,770
上帝自有他的道理  但我們可能無從得知
God's will has a purpose,but we may not Know it.

251
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,680
這真好看
Well,that is lovely.

252
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,720
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦爵士
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein

253
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,390
打敗摩提莫大人  比數是一比零
defeats Roger Lord Mortimer one lance to none.

254
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,820
真簡單  他們會以為  我從來沒打贏過
Easy. They'll thinK l never broKe a lance before.

255
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,510
-你是沒打贏過啊  -烏瑞克贏過數千次
- But you haven't!  - Ulrich's broKen thousands of lances.

256
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,570
走吧  該去比劍了
Come on. You're due in the sword ring.

257
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,600
我的盔甲松了
My armor's loose.

258
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,550
可惡  我會擋不住上方的攻擊
Shite. I can't blocK an overhead.

259
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,380
現在來不及修了  我們比劍已經遲到了
We can't fix it now. We're overdue in the sword ring.

260
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,960
不該比兩種的  太趕了
It was a mistaKe to do two events. I'm too hurried.

261
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,790
-我退出比劍好了  -劍術是你最拿手的
- I'll withdraw from the sword.  - Sword's what you're best at.

262
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,470
但是比長槍的獎賞比較豐富  名聲也比較響亮
But the prizes and prestige are bigger in the joust.

263
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,970
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦  我是傳喚者賽門
Ulrich von Lichtenstein? I am Simon the Summoner.

264
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,240
而我比劍快遲到了
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

265
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,470
我謹代表你的傳令人留下你

266

你才沒有被搶
You Were never robbed.

267
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,420
我有酗賭的問題
I have a gambling problem.

268
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
我控制不了自己
I can't help myself.

269
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,490
而這些人真的會
And these people will

270

剝光你的衣服
Iiterally taKe the clothes off your bacK.

271
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,490
你要我們怎么辦  
What are we supposed to do?

272
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,170
他跟我們保證他的主人  也就是你  會付我們錢
He assured us that you,his liege,would pay us.

273
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,840
你是什么人來著

彼得  卑微的免罪符小販

和宗教遺物供應商

276
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,780
他欠了多少錢  
How much does he owe?

277
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,920
十個金幣
Ten gold florins.

278
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,920
你這蠢蛋

280
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
華特  放開他
Wat,let him go!

281
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,710
如果我不付錢  你會對他怎樣  
What would you do to him if I was to refuse?

282
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
我們會謹代表上帝
We,on behalf of the Lord God

283
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,880
要他用命來還  好讓他了解
will taKe it from his flesh so that he may understand

284
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,560
賭博是有罪的
that gambling is a sin.

285
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,560
別這樣
Oh,come on.

286
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,900
威廉  求求你
Please,Will.

287
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,240
求你幫我好嗎  烏瑞克爵士

288
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,070
我保證你不會后悔的

289
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,480
我沒那么多錢

放了他

沒問題
Done.

294
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,600
你說謊
You lied.

295
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,600
對  我說謊  我是作家  我對真話的定義很廣泛
Yes,I lied. I'm a writer. I give the truth scope!

296
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,940

別再讓他打中你了
Stop letting him hit you!

302
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,480
閉嘴  閉嘴

303
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,140
沃特羅令爵士得兩分

換烏瑞克爵士出劍

那是我教他的  是我教他的  
I taught him that! That's me!

308
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,000
烏瑞克爵士以五比二獲勝  
Sir Ulrich prevails,five striKes to two!

309
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,800
好耶

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,880
看哪  我的烏瑞克大人  他穩若磐石  聳立如泰山  
Behold my Lord Ulrich! The rocK! The hard place!

311
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,020
他像蓋德蘭來的一陣風  橫掃而過  
LiKe a wind from Gelderland,he sweeps by!

312
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,350
從他的家鄉吹襲過來  尋求勝利和榮耀  
Blown far from his homeland in search of glory and honor!

313
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,020

00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,800
想碰碰他嗎  你們想碰碰他嗎  
Do you want to touch him? Do you want to touch him?

318
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,310
我們應該留點錢修盔甲的
We should've saved our money for the blacKsmith.

319
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,680
我現在沒錢付你

先生  請問一下

324
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,840
去蹄鐵匠那里試試吧

325
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,510
女的  
A woman?

326
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,840
大人  乞丐是沒得選的

我流的每一滴汗都有價錢
Each drop of this sweat has a price on it.

331

Just as well. They told me I was daft to even asK.

-誰  -其他的盔甲匠
- Who? - The other armorers.

333
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,140
他們是不是說我修不好  因為我是女人  
Did they say I couldn't do it because I'm a woman?

334
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,640
他們說你擅長的是馬蹄鐵  不是盔甲
They said you're good with horseshoes,not armor.

335
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,320
沒人提什么女人不女人的
No one mentioned you being a woman.

336
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,050
貓肉  熱酒

00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,920
在基督教世界最美的女子面前  那一切都無足輕重了
All forgotten when standing before the most beautiful woman in Christendom.

343
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:00,260
伯爵  你只是裝個樣子  或是真的在打仗  
Do you only pretend to fight,Count Adhemar,or wage real war as well?

344
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:06,110

348
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,830
你對槍術比賽有何看法  
What do you thinK of the joust?

349
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,330
非常唐突
It's very abrupt.

350
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,500
規則我也不了解
And I don't understand the rules.

351
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,170
那就讓我來教你
Then I shall educate you.

352
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,010
一場比賽分三回合
A match is three lances.

353
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,950
擊中對手腰頸之間而斷槍  得一分
One point is given for breaKing a lance between the waist and necK.

354
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,350
擊落面甲而斷槍  得兩分  這很困難
Two points for breaKing on the helmet. It's difficult.

355
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,680
面甲會彈回來  所以多半只是一閃而過
The helmet sweeps bacK. Most blows glance off.

356
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,620
讓對手落地得三分
Three points for bearing a rider to the ground.

357
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,200
而且  如果你讓對手落地  他的馬就是你的了
Also,if you bear a rider to the ground,you win his horse.

358
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,860
有人在槍術比賽中喪命嗎  
Do men die in the joust?

359
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,640
長槍頭是裝上了冠狀的鈍器
Lance points are tipped with coronals,which blunts them.

360
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,040
當然  難免會有意外
Of course,accidents happen.

365
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,820
獵人先生  你還真堅持
Sir Hunter,you persist.

366
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,890
或許天使沒有名字  只有美麗的臉龐
Perhaps angels have no names. Only beautiful faces.

367

- Your armor,sir.  - What about it?

How stylish of you to wear an antique. You'll start a new fashion if you win.

375
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,760

My grandfather will be able to wear his in public again.

376
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,260

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
我初次遇見他
I first met him

397
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,430
是在耶路撒冷附近的山頂
atop a mountain near Jerusalem

398
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,860
他向上帝祈禱
praying to God

399
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,710
請他原諒他劍上沾滿了
asKing his forgiveness for the Saracen blood

400
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,980
撒拉遜人的血
spilt by his sword.

401
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,380
接著  在意大利  他更令我覺得不可思議
Next,he amazed me still further in Italy

402
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,710
當他拯救一位失怙的孤女
when he saved a fatherless beauty

403
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,650
免于她惡叔父的殘害
from the would be ravishings of her dreadful uncle.

404
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,890
在希臘
In Greece

405
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,560
他保持緘默一年
he spent a year in silence

406
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,570
只為求更加了解
just to better understand the sound

407
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,740
輕聲細語
of a whisper.

408
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,910
我就不再錦上添花  也不再多費唇舌
So without further gilding the lily and with no more ado

409
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,920
我要介紹給各位  安詳平靜的追尋者
I give to you the SeeKer of Serenity

410
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,920
意大利貞節的保護者
Protector of Italian Virginity

411
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,100
上帝旨意的執行者  獨一無二的
the Enforcer of our Lord God,the one,the only

412
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,420
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦爵士  
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

413
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,950
謝謝  謝謝各位  我整個星期都會在這里
ThanK you! ThanK you! I'll be here all weeK.

414
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,320
真與眾不同啊
That was different.

415
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,690
是我們頌揚每個人  獨特之處的時候了
It's time we celebrated our differences.

416
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,890
只要不在公開場合
Just maybe not in public.

417
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,960
你
You.

418
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,960
是的  我很清楚  我很快就會被好好修理了
Yes,I'm well aware a good fonging is on the way.

419
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,140
對  沒錯
Oh,yeah. Oh,yeah.

420
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,570
我負責引他們注意  你去贏得他們的心
I got their attention. You win their hearts.

421
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,160
非常好
Very good.

422
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,330
-杰夫  她剛剛有看嗎  -什么  
Was she watching? Geoff. What?

423
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,660
-她看了我嗎  -是的
- Did she see me?  - Yes,she did.

424
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,170
-她看到我受擊  -是的
- Did she see me taKe the hit?  - Yes.

425
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,430
-她擔心嗎  -她眼淚盈眶  太糟了
- Was she concerned?  - Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

426
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,190
寇維爾技巧很完美  我以前從未見過他
Colville has perfect technique. I've never seen him before.

427
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,860
我也是
Nor I.

428
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,100
但這個利頓斯坦
But this Lichtenstein.

429
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,530
他的技巧只在入門階段  風格更是完全不存在
His technique,rudimentary. Style,nonexistent.

430
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,200
然而  他無所畏懼
Still,he's fearless.

431
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,530
無所畏懼  怎么說  
Fearless? How so?

432
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,710
面甲里的縫隙很窄  但碎木片可以穿透其間
The slit in the visor is narrow,but splinters can penetrate it.

433
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,970
大多數騎士在最后一瞬間  都會抬起下巴
Most Knights raise their chins at the last instant.

434
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:56,210
雖看不到對手  卻能保護雙眼  烏瑞克則否
You lose sight of your opponent,but protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

435
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,050
他眼睛牢牢盯著目標
He Keeps his eye on the target.

436
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,890
不折不扣的獵人
A true hunter.

437
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,390
烏瑞克爵士
Sir Ulrich

438
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,230
我要退出了
I'm through.

439
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,740
但我以前從未中途退出
But I've never not finished before.

440
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,070
我希望完整保持我的榮譽
I wish to Keep my honor intact.

441
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,770
不分勝負  寇維爾受傷了
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

442
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,120
寇維爾退出  烏瑞克晉級
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

443
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,290
烏瑞克為何不乘勝追擊  
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

444
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,790
他慈悲為懷
He shows mercy.

445
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,790
那么他就展露了弱點  慈悲只會使人脆弱
Then he shows his weaKness. That's all mercy is.

446
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,630
威廉  看在勝利的份上  快睡吧
For the love of victory,William,go to sleep.

447
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,140
我睡不著
I can't.

448
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,310
愛情給了我翅膀  我必須飛翔
Love has given me wings,so I must fly.

449
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,750
我無法解釋
I can't explain it.

450
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,390
-她讓我自覺像個詩人  -你或許自覺像詩人
- She maKes me feel liKe a poet.  - You may feel liKe a poet

451
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,220
但你聽起來像個白癡
but you sound liKe an idiot.

452
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,330
-你連她的名字都不知道  -她的名字  
- You don't even Know her name.  - Her name?

453
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,500
她叫愛芙蘿黛蒂
Her name is Aphrodite.

454
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,500
卡麗普索  維納斯  隨你選
Calypso. Venus. TaKe your picK.

455
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,510
女人讓人意志軟弱
Women weaKen the heart.

456
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,680
沒有了意志  你就無法獲勝
Without your heart,you cannot win.

457
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,780
-但她的眼睛  -專心
- But her eyes  - Concentrate.

458
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,520
艾菊蛋糕  
Tansy caKes!

459
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,700
阿德瑪伯爵派人來傳話
Count Adhemar sends Word.

460
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,190
他說他會為你贏得這場錦標賽
He said he will win this tournament for you.

461
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,200
他已贏過許多次  他是為他自己和他的榮譽而贏
He's won many. He wins them for himself and his own honor.

462
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,880
他這么說是毫無價值的
It's nothing to say he wins them for me.

463
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,040
他希望能再次跟您談談
He wishes to speaK to you again.

464
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,680
而不是聽我說話
Not to hear a word I say.

465
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,320
阿德瑪要他的女人保持沉默
Adhemar wants his women silent.

466
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,330
你會要烏瑞克爵士  為你贏得這場錦標賽嗎  
Would you have Sir Ulrich win the tournament for you?

467
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,900
不
No.

468
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,400
他是唯一一個  未許諾要這么做的騎士
And he is the only Knight who has not promised to do so.

469
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,900
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦爵士
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

470
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,230
我要他贏得我的心
I would have him win my heart.

471
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,580
阿德瑪  阿德瑪  阿德瑪  
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

472
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,420
真帥啊
Oh,lovely.

473
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,920
我不認為我看過阿德瑪伯爵輸
I don't thinK I've ever seen Count Adhemar lose.

474
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,430
的確  但打敗了他  你就會第一個看到
No,but defeat him and you'll see it firsthand.

475
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,630
我的主人
My liege

476
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,770
烏瑞克爵士
Sir Ulrich.

477
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,110
這位是克麗絲堤亞娜
Christiana.

478
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,770
-我家小姐吩咐你戴上這個  -當然
- My lady bids you wear this toKen.  - Of course.

479
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,120
她還要我告訴你  她名叫
She also said to tell you,her name

480
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,990
約瑟琳
is Jocelyn.

481
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,220
-再會  -再會
- Au revoir.  - Au revoir.

482
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,400
約瑟琳
Oh,Jocelyn.

483
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,460
專心比賽
Concentrate.

484
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,950
我無法呼吸
I can't breathe.

485
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,140
毫無風格可言
No style whatsoever.

486
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,470
鐵砧也是如此
But neither has an anvil.

487
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,810
-他出手真是驚人地有力  -但是不完美  瞄得太高了
- He hits like a hammer. Amazing.  - But not perfect. He aims high.

488
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,810
肩膀向后  他可能會往右邊刺
Roll your shoulder back,his blow may go right.

489
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:56,080
但要是他往我左邊刺  我就毀了
But if he strikes to my left,I'll be obliterated.

490
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,420
我沒說這不是場賭博
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

491
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,690
烏瑞克  烏瑞克  烏瑞克  
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

492
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,590
威廉  
William?

493
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,920
威廉  這里
William,here.

494
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,760
過來這里
Come here.

495
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,270
總有一天我會成為騎士
Someday I'll be a knight.

496
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,110
補屋頂工匠家的孩子  騎士  
A thatcher's son? A knight?

497
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,280
你還不如試著改變命運呢
You might as well try to change the stars.

498
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,950
父親  有可能嗎  
Can it be done,Father?

499
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,780
-人可以改變命運嗎  -可以的  威廉
- Can a man change the stars?  - Yes,William.

500
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,050
如果一個人信心堅定  他可以成就任何事情
If he believes enough,a man can do anything.

501
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,150
來
Come here.

502
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,150
烏瑞克  再去鍛煉鍛煉吧
Gain more bearing,Ulrich.

503
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,820
等你夠資格了再來見我
See me again when you're worthy.

504
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,000
我非要你好看不可  
I'll fong you in the arse!

505
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,000
大人  精采啊  真精采
Well done,my lord! Well done.

506
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,640
-你這混帳  -快去看看烏瑞克
- You bastard!  - Go and see to Ulrich.

507
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,680
去看看烏瑞克
Go see to Ulrich.

508
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,010
大人  漂亮
Well done,my lord.

509
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,180
贏得真高尚
A noble victory.

510
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,850
小姐  這應該是你的
My lady,I believe this is yours.

511
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,860
長矛的優勝者是

512
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,700
潘多佛馬拉泰斯塔

安竺的阿德瑪伯爵
Adhemar,Count of Anjou.

516
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,400
阿德瑪  阿德瑪  阿德瑪  
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

517
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:08,100
這幾位就是優勝者
I present to you your champions.

518
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,580
下一次  你會躺在地上  仰望著我
Next time,you will look up at me from the flat of your back.

519
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,850
拜托  你打也打了  比也比了
Please. You have been weighed,

520
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,110
大家都知道你能力不足
you have been measured

521
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,030
繼續保持劍術方面的戰績
Keep winning the sword.

522
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,700
-我不比劍了  -那是你最擅長的啊
- I won't compete in it.  - It's your best.

523
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,600
不  除非得到總冠軍  否則什么都不算數
No. It's tournament champion or nothing at all.

524
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,600
十個銀幣  這應該夠了
Ten florins. That should do.

525
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,110
喬瑟  今晚還有得賭  覺得手氣還順嗎  
Sixes and sevens tonight,Chaucer. Do you feel lucky?

526
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,620

- Have you enough clothes?  - Be gone. I'm done with you.

527

除了展開我的報復
Except to exact my revenge.

528
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,960
你能對我們怎樣

593

那就是讓月亮靜止

讓月亮靜止  讓這個夜晚

Well,it's a lot like the farandole

604
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,370
但有些不同
but with some differences.

605
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,530
先鞠躬

-我不知道  太小太輕了  -他會被打扁  打到死翹翹
- I don't know. Too small,too light.  - He'll be crushed. Killed.

No. I found a new way to heat steel. It's thinner,smaller

612
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,270

616
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,550
-但我終究會被擊中  -然后死掉
- But eventually I will be struck.  - And then death.

617
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,960
你有勇氣測試看看嗎  
Do you at least have the courage to test it?

618
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,390
你還好嗎  
You okay?

619

624
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,870
很有可能是真的吧

663
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,820
這場比賽不分勝負
The match is a draw.

664
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,600
你瘋了嗎  你差點傷了皇室成員
You mad? You endanger a royal family member.

665
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,010
是他自己讓自己置身危險
He endangers himself.

666
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,330
爵士  打得好  一如在魯昂
Well fought,Sir Ulrich,as in Rouen.

667
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,110
您也是  愛德華王子
You also,Prince Edward.

668
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,440
你知道是我  
You knew me?

669
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,850
但你還是上場比賽  
And still you rode?

670
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:33,020
-退出不是我的作風  -我也一樣
- It's not in me to withdraw.  - No. Nor me.

671
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,300
雖然這種事常有
Though it happens.

672
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,700
的確
Yes,it does.

673
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,540
-祝你好運  -您也是
- Good luck to you.  - You also.

674
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:53,210
馬上長槍大賽  和錦標賽的優勝者是
The winner of the mounted joust and tournament champion

675
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,820
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

676
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:05,230
-要熔要賣都隨你  -是的  大人
- Melt it,sell it,do whatever you do.  - Yes,Your Majesty.

677
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,660
你是冠軍  
You're champion!

678
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,890
我還不是冠軍  除非打敗阿德瑪  他中途退出
I'm not champion until I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

679
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,570
烏瑞克爵士
Sir Ulrich.

680
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:16,740
-告訴我你今晚要穿什么  -什么都不穿
- Tell me what you'll wear tonight.  - Nothing.

681
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,910
那么我們會引起騷動  因為我會配合你
We'll cause a sensation,for I'll dress to match.

682
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,670
你穿衣服穿得不煩嗎  
Don't you get tired of putting on clothes?

683
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,410
她說的是不要穿
She's talking about taking them off.

684
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,250
有花沒有瓣也是沒有用的  不是嗎  
A flower is only as good as its petals,no?

685
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,250
花兒一點用處也沒有
A flower is good for nothing.

686
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,920
真的  
Really?

687
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,760
花兒不能吃  也不能保暖
You can't eat a flower. It doesn't keep you warm.

688
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,530
玫瑰也從來不曾  把男人擊落馬下  不是嗎  
And a rose never knocked a man off a horse either,did it?

689
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,530
你只是個蠢女孩  不是嗎  
You're just a silly girl,aren't you?

690
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,610
拿著花的蠢女孩  總好過騎馬拿著棍棒的蠢男孩
Better a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and stick.

691
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,620
再見
Goodbye.

692
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,780
那叫做長槍
It's called a lance.

693
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,620
懂不懂啊
Hello.

694
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:15,130
波爾多

695
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,820
-我聽到消息  -什么  
- I have word.  - What?

696
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,000
阿德瑪被召回自由連隊
Adhemar was called back to the free companies.

697
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,270
是愛德華下的令  他可能整季都不會回來
Edward commanded it. He could be gone all season.

698
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,170
先是約瑟琳  現在又是阿德瑪
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

699
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,180
說得真好
well done.

700
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,680
是啊  說得好
Yeah,well done.

701
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,510
南方前線  普瓦提耶戰役

702
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,690
大人  比賽結果在這里
The tournament results,my lord.

703
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:30,870
烏瑞克
Ulrich.

704
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,040
烏瑞克
Ulrich.

705
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,040
烏瑞克
Ulrich.

706
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,230
-杰夫  -威廉
- Geoff.  - William.

707
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,730
我需要寫一封信
I need to write a letter.

708
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,000
"親愛的約瑟琳"不"摯愛的約瑟琳"
"Dear Jocelyn." No."My dearest Jocelyn."

709
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,600
好多了
Better.

710
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,510
"我想你"
"I miss you."

711
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,150
那樣不對嗎  
Was that wrong?

712
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:15,010
其實要看你啦  這是你的告別式  我是說你的信
Well,it's up to you,really. It's your funeral,I mean,letter.

713
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,920
-提提她的胸部  -你想念他們
- Say something about her breasts.  - You miss them.

714
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,750
她的胸部  
Her breasts?

715
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:27,020
是的  你可以  但要是我  就會看她胸部以上的地方
Yes,you could,but I would tend to look above her breasts.

716
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,100
我想念她的喉嚨  
I miss her throat?

717
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,700
再高一點  朝向天堂
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

718
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,770
月亮啊  她的雙峰沒那么讓人印象深刻
The moon. Her breasts weren't that impressive.

719
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,270
月亮  月亮啊
The moon? The moon.

720
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,450
想起來實在奇怪
"It is strange to think

721
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,280
我已經一個月沒見你了
I have not seen you in a month.

722
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,290
我見到了新月  卻不見你
I have seen the new moon,but not you.

723
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:00,130
我看到了日升日落  卻未看到你美麗的容顏
I have seen sunsets and sunrises,but nothing of your beautiful face."

724
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,460
非常好
That's very good.

725
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,800
我曾經認識一個女孩
I knew this girl once who.

726
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,480
她讓我心碎  我說心的碎片
She broke my heart. I said the pieces- -

727
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:18,410
"我說心的碎片  小的都可以穿過針孔了"
"The pieces of my broken heart can pass through the eye of a needle."

728
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,580
他寫得好像我已經死了
He writes as though I had died.

729
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,810
是的  女士  他也像死了一樣
Yes,madame. He dies as well.

730
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,160
她曾是約克公爵的廚子
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

731
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,500
我對她的思念  就像太陽對花兒的思念
I miss her like the sun misses the flower.

732
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
我對你的思念  就像太陽對花兒的思念
"I miss you like the sun misses the floWer."

733
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,340
就像太陽在深冬  對花兒的思念
Like the sun misses the flower in the depths of winter.

734
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:50,180
少了花兒的艷容  引導著陽光
Instead of beauty to direct its light to

735
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:55,340
心也就變得麻痹  就像你不在我身邊般寒冷
the heart hardens like the frozen world your absence has sent me to.

736
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,680
我接下來會在巴黎出賽
I next compete in Paris.

737
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,850
如果你不在那里  我會覺得空虛寒冷
I'll find it empty and cold if you're not there.

738
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,520
我喜歡
I like it.

739
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,530
現在  寫結語吧
And now,to finish it.

740
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,530
用"希望"
With"hope."

741
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,530
愛應該以希望作結
Love should end with hope.

742
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:17,710
我丈夫  愿他安息
My husband,God rest him

743
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,370
說了句我永遠不會忘記的話
said something I'll never forget.

744
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,710
"希望引導著我"
"Hope guides me. It"

745
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,480
讓我得以度過白日  特別是夜晚
"It gets me through the day and especially the night.

746
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:31,050
希望即使你遠離我
The hope that after you leave my sight

747
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,050
這也不會是  我最后一次看到你
it will not be the last time I look upon you."

748
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,560
結語就寫
Finish it With:

749
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:44,500
"獻上我所有的愛威廉"
"With all the love that I possessWilliam."

750
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,030
你是指"烏瑞克"
You mean"Ulrich."

751
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,770
獻上我所有的愛
"With all the love I possess

752
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,280
我依舊屬于你
I remain yours

753
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,110
你芳心中的騎士
the knight of your heart."

754
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:11,290
我的主人希望你或許能夠  回他幾句話
My master hoped you might have something to send him in return.

755
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,800
巴黎

756
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,910
雞鳴一次  我不會不承認他  雞鳴兩次  我不會  三次  
Cock a doodle once! I shall not deny him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

757
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,240
我不承認他
I deny him.

758
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,090
三次他不承認他
Thrice he denied him!

759
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,790
阿德瑪沒參加
No Adhemar.

760
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,730
阿德瑪沒參加
No Adhemar.

761
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,570
華特
Wat.

762
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,740
告訴我  你見到了她嗎  她看了信嗎  
Tell me,did you see her? Did she read the letter?

763
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,040
是的  有的
Yes,and yes.

764
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,880
然后  
And?

765
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,480
她要來巴黎  
She's coming to Paris!

766
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:18,730
她要你帶什么回來給我嗎  一封信  一個信物  
Did she give you anything for me in return? A letter? A token?

767
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,560
她要給我一個信物  她有
Did she give me a token? She did.

768
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,340
我是說  嗯
Uh,I mean,um.

769
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:28,570
是什么  快給我
Well,what is it? Give it to me.

770
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,750
好耶  
Yes!

771
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,750
太好了  
Hell,yes!

772
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:47,930
她  因為她  那表示她  太好了  
She-- Because she's-- That means she-- Yeah!

773
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,100
五十
Cinquante.

774
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,890
那是個不錯的整數
That's a nice round number.

775
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:57,870
借過
Excuse- moi.

776
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,840
他們賭法國人  而非烏瑞克爵士會贏得比賽
They wager that a Frenchman,not Sir Ulrich,will win the tournament.

777
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,240
但賭注是五十個銀幣
But the amount is 50 florins.

778
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,420
-那是我們全部的錢  -就是要賭我們所有的錢
- That's all we got.  - If we had 60,it would be that.

779
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,180
烏瑞克對抗這里每個法國人  
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

780
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:19,090
他已經連續贏得四場比賽  而且阿德瑪不在這里
He's won four tournaments in a row. And Adhemar isn't here.

781
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,350
我也查過盾牌了  約翰波蒙在這里
I check shields too. John Beaumont's here.

782
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,190
席德伯爵  勃艮地的菲力浦  都是法國的冠軍
Count Theobald,Philip of Burgundy all French champions.

783
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,960
英國人無法贏得
Englishmen will not win

784
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,000
這場法國錦標賽
this French tournament.

785
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:34,000
英國人的腳  在法國土地上站不穩
English legs are unsteady on French soil.

786
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,670
閉上你的嘴  可以嗎  
Shut your mouth,all right?!

787
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:44,680
洛倫  賭吧  勝算很大  贏了我就可以買間酒館
Come on,Roland. It's a good bet. Win and I can buy my own tavern.

788
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,850
-我就可以專職寫作  -我可以買個煉爐
- I could write full- time.  - A forge for me.

789
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:52,680
而且法國酒  對英國人的胃來說也太烈了
And because French wine is too much for English bellies.

790
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:57,960
聽著  老兄  我就快揍人了  我對上帝發誓  真的  
Listen,I'm about this fonging close,mate. I swear to God,Quasimodo!

791
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:02,870
我只想回家  而且我的錢  夠我回家一百次了
All I want is to go home,and I've enough for that trip a hundred times.

792
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,700
最重要的是  連教宗都是法國人  
And most importantly,because the pope himself is French!

793
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,640
教宗或許是法國人  但耶穌是英國人  賭了
The pope may be French,but Jesus is English. You're on.

794
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,210
有公主來看他  他不會輸的
He won't lose with the princess watching him.

795
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,480
他金發碧眼  他極度惱火  
He's blond! He's pissed!

796
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,390
他會上場的  利頓斯坦  利頓斯坦  
He'll see you in the lists! Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

797
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:28,220
他金發碧眼  他黝黑健壯  他來自蓋德蘭  
He's blond! He's tan! He comes from Gelderland!

798
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,550
他來自蓋德蘭  
He comes from Gelderland!

799
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,730
蓋德蘭  
Gelderland!

800
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:53,240
-你想他會來嗎  -就像太陽會升起一樣肯定
- You think he will come?  - As sure as the sun will rise.

801
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:20,780
你喜歡大教堂
You favor cathedrals.

802
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,280
我是來懺悔的
I come for confession.

803
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,610
還有來欣賞玻璃
And the glass.

804
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,790
一個沉悶灰暗世界里的  繽紛色彩
A riot of color in a dreary,gray world.

805
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,450
你不認為嗎  
Don't you think?

806
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,130
真美
It's beautiful.

807
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,140
你送來的信  也讓我有同樣的感覺
I feel the same about the letter you sent.

808
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,640
跟我說話
Speak to me.

809
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,140
說說那些話
Speak those words.

810
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,580
我會為你贏得這場錦標賽
I will win this tournament for you.

811
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,410
什么  
Excuse me?

812
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:05,650
我會為你贏得這場錦標賽  我會為你打敗每一個騎士
I'll win this tournament in your name. I'll defeat each knight for you.

813
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:10,990
你的美會反映在我手臂的力量  和我馬兒的側腹上
Your beauty will be reflected in the power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

814
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,330
哇
Wow.

815
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,830
真的  
Really?

816
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,670
真的  它的側腹  
Really? Its flanks?

817
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,500
烏瑞克  我想聽的是詩句
I wish to hear poetry,Ulrich.

818
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,000
我還沒準備好
Well,I'm not ready.

819
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:33,950
我準備好了  為什么女人  事事必須照男人的時間表來  
I am. Why must everything for a woman be run on a man's schedule?

820
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:37,680
男人要做的事比較多  而且
Well,a man's day is fuller,and

821
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,020
他的時間也比較寶貴
he has more demands on his time.

822
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,350
-是嗎  -是的
- Is that so?  - Yes.

823
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,190
或許吧
Maybe.

824
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:47,690
不是嗎  
No?

825
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,370
我要聽詩句
I demand poetry

826
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,870
我要聽  而且現在就要聽
and when I want it. And I want it now.

827
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,530
你的雙峰
Your breasts

828
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,370
在你的喉嚨下方
they're below your throat.

829
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:07,710
約瑟琳  我要怎么做才能證明  我對你的愛  怎么做  
Jocelyn,how may I prove my love to you? How?

830
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,720
-你是認真在問  -是的
- Do you ask in earnest?  - Yes.

831
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,900
如果你要證明你的愛
If you would prove your love

832
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:23,400
-就做出你最差的表現  -最差的表現  
- do your worst.  - My worst?

833
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,400
什么意思  
What do you mean?

834
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:31,740
不要用你高度的名望  為我贏得大賽
Instead of winning to honor me with your high reputation

835
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,910
而是一反常態  表現走樣
act against your character and do badly.

836
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,580
-表現走樣  -輸掉比賽
- Do badly?  - Lose.

837
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,840
輸掉只會證明我是窩囊廢
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

838
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,580
錯  輸了更能證明你的愛
Wrong. Losing is a much keener test of your love.

839
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,410
輸會跟你的自憐相抵觸
Losing would contradict your self- love.

840
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,250
會顯示你對愛人  而非對自己的順從  
It would show obedience to your lover and not yourself!

841
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,930
-真的  -女人  安靜  
- Really?  - Woman,shh!

842
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,760
別叫我安靜  而不罵他  你走  走啊  
Do not"shh" me and spare him! Now be gone! Go!

843
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,210
你的答案是什么  
What is your answer?

844
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:07,110
我不會輸的
I will not lose.

845
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,620
那么你就不愛我
Then you do not love me.

846
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,560
意大利貞節的保護者
The Protector of Italian Virginity

847
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,470
讓法國群情激動的騎士
the Lance that thrilled France

848
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,140
男人中的男人  
the Harasser of Paraser!

849
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,140
在拉羅謝爾打敗群敵  
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

850
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,650
上帝旨意的執行者  
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

851
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,480
獨一無二的
The one,the only

852
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,650
烏瑞克
Sir Ulrich

853
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:52,480
馮利頓斯坦爵士  
von Lichtenstein!

854
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,700
天啊  我真行  
God,I'm good!

855
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,270
他馬兒的側腹
His horse's flanks.

856
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,870
也許在他家鄉  那代表了愛
Maybe where he comes from,it means love.

857
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,880
你在做什么  
What are you doing?

858
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,450
-輸掉比賽  -我不懂
- Losing.  - I don't understand.

859
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,290
我也不懂
I don't understand.too

860
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,240
他愛我
He loves me.

861
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,580
你瞎了嗎  
Are you blind?

862
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,250
-你有看到旗子嗎  -我看到了  可以嗎  
- Did you see the flag?  - I saw it,okay?

863
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,820
我知道
I know.

864
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,330
你故意先落后  再來個戲劇性的勝利
You're dropping behind for a more dramatic victory.

865
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,830
約瑟琳要我輸掉比賽  來證明我的愛
Look,Jocelyn told me to lose to prove my love.

866
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,270
-我寧可你是瞎掉  -威廉  你別傻了
- I'd rather you were blind.  - Don't be foolish,Will.

867
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:20,670
-女人不過都想要證明罷了  -證明什么  
- Each woman wants proof,that's all.  - Proof of what?

868
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,610
她的腿不是平白無故地分開
Her legs weren't uncrossed for nothing.

869
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:28,350
-我沒有分開她的腿  -那我們干嘛這么做  
- I haven't uncrossed her legs.  - Then why are we doing this?!

870
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,950
就是因為  
Because!

871
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,470
因為
Because

872
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,370
我愛她
I love her.

873
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:32,180
-我會輸光光  -所以才叫賭博嘛
- I'm going to lose everything!  - That's why it's called gambling.

874
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,080
痛吧  痛死你  
Pain! Here's your pain!

875
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,580
但是非常羅曼蒂克
It's very romantic,though.

876
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:40,360
你到底是女人還是鐵匠  
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

877
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,350
有時候我兩者都是
Sometimes I'm both.

878
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,430
好痛啊  可惡  
Ooh,that chafes!

879
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,100
把他放下啦
Put him down.

880
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,600
沒有騎士會故意輸掉
No knight has distanced himself with victories.

881
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:57,600
如果你剩下的幾場比賽都贏  而且你的對手都大敗特敗
If you win your remaining matches and your opponents take key losses

882
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,370
你就可以進入準決賽  或者決賽
you could make the semis,or the finals.

883
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:04,380
-至少盔甲證明了它的能耐  -那你的愛呢  
- At least the armor's proven itself. - And your love?

884
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,270
你證明你的愛了嗎  
Have you proven that?

885
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:14,120
華特  想想小時候對教堂的感覺  那份戒慎恐懼  那份熱情
Wat,you remember church as a boy. The fear,the passion.

886
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,290
那就是我對她的感覺
That's what she makes me feel.

887
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:22,470
因為如此  我的玫瑰經  只為約瑟琳一個人念
And for that,I say my rosary to Jocelyn and no one else.

888
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,790
威廉  那樣說很不敬
William,that's blasphemous.

889
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,140
那就讓我在地獄受苦吧
Then may I burn in hell.

890
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,640
退出比賽
Withdraw.

891
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,310
就這么輸了算了  不要再撐下去了
Lose that way. Take no more punishment.

892
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,480
洛倫
Oh,Roland.

893
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:49,660
我家小姐要我來傳話  如果你愛她
My lady sends this message. If you love her- -

894
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,330
我知道  我知道  我必須輸  她沒在看嗎  
I know,I know. I must lose. Isn't she watching?

895
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:56,660
她說你若愛她  就不會再輸了
She says if you love her,you won't lose again.

896
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,660
她說你若愛她  就會贏得這場大賽
She says if you love her,you will win this tournament.

897
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:13,680
她在那里  愛的化身  你的維納斯
There she is,the embodiment of love. Your Venus.

898
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,350
我真恨她
And how I hate her.

899
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:35,970
-我真不懂女人  -我也不懂  但她們很懂我們
- I don't understand women.  - Nor do I,but they understand us.

900
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,210
也許不包括你
Maybe not you.

901
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,690
好耶  
Yes!

902
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,890
女人哪
Women,eh?

903
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,150
四十八
Forty eight

904
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,820
四十九
forty nine

905
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,820
五十

906
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:27,650
謝謝各位了  很高興跟你們做生意
Thank you,gentlemen. A pleasure doing business with you.

907
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,760
到倫敦記得來找我們  也許在世界冠軍賽時
Look us up if you're in London,the world championships,maybe.

908
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,160
別那么沮喪嘛  拿去  我請你們喝一杯
Don't look too sad. Here,have a drink on me.

909
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:41,430
他身手敏捷  他幽默風趣  他還很會賺錢  利頓斯坦  
He's quick,he's funny and makes lots of money,Lichtenstein!

910

911
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:09,860
小姐  好好服侍他睡

我的獎賞
My prize.

919
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:41,490
我不配得獎
I am not worthy of a prize.

920
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,190
那么誰有資格  
Then who is?

921
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,170
我的女仆告訴我  有時候你的屬下

是不是  烏瑞克爵士  
Is this so,Sir Ulrich?

924
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,340
是的
Yes.

925
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,180
的確如此
It is so.

926
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,030
你叫什么名字對我不重要
Your name makes no matter to me.

927
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,530
只要你是我的
Just so I can call you my own.

928

但約瑟琳  我的確是你的呀

該死
Damn,girl.

930

孩子  你怕我嗎

你的牙齒長齊了嗎

我會不知道回家的路

971
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:07,800
別傻了  威廉  跟隨你的腳步就行了

01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,410
他很好
He is very well.

1065
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,920
他希望你知道
He wanted you to know

1066
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,190
他終究改變了他的命運
that he changed his stars after all.

1067
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,440
他跟隨了他的腳步嗎  
And has he followed his feet?

1068
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,700
他終于找到回家的路了嗎  
Has he found his way home at last?

1069
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,200
是的
Yes.

1070
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:22,450
父親
Father.

1071
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:25,620
威廉  我的孩子
Oh,William. Oh,my boy.

1072
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:39,900
我真想見見這個華特  還有洛倫
I should like to meet this Wat. And Roland too.

1073
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,130
你會見到的
You will,Father.

1074
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:48,980
女人呢  你有特定對像  還是很多個  
And what of women? Is there a certain one or many?

1075
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,480
我有一個心儀的對象
There is a certain one.

1076
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,310
我也想見見她
I should like to meet her too.

1077
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:05,160
漏水成這樣不行
This leak won't do,Father.

1078
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:10,500
-尤其在補屋頂工匠家中  -這對瞎眼人來說不成問題
- Not in a thatcher's chamber.  - It's quite fitting for a blind one.

1079
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,670
我是補屋頂的
Well,a thatcher I am.

1080
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:17,680
我會幫你修好
I'll fix it.

1081
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:05,220
活著  我以為他死了  我真是瘋了
Alive. I thought he was dead,which is mad

1082
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,730
因為他仍那么強壯  非常強壯
because he was also so strong. Very strong.

1083
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,390
-杰夫  -約瑟琳
- Geoff.  - Jocelyn.

1084
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:14,170
今天真是愈來愈精采
This day just gets better and better.

1085
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:18,330
有人死了嗎  
Somebody die?

1086
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:23,570
烏瑞克馮利頓斯坦爵士
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1087
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,580
阿德瑪
Adhemar

1088
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:33,080
昨晚跟蹤你到奇普塞
followed you last night. To Cheapside.

1089
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,190
他看到你父親
He saw your father.

1090
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:39,190
威廉  他們跟我要你的證明書
Will,they asked me for your patents.

1091
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,030
他們在場上等著逮捕你
They're waiting for you in the lists to arrest you.

1092
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,600
十二個皇家侍衛
A dozen royal guards.

1093
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:55,770
-他們會把你抓上示眾臺  -但我馬上就要跟阿德瑪交手
- They'll put you in the stocks.  - But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1094
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,110
不  你喪失了比賽權  他們已經記下了
No,you forfeit. They've already marked it down.

1095
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,620
把馬上鞍  他們可以逮捕你的行李而非你
Saddle the horses. They can arrest your baggage,not you.

1096
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:13,280
站住
Halt.

1097
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:20,290
你有何感想
So,what do you think

1098
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,740
既然你知道了我是誰  
now that you know what I am?

1099
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:30,300
威廉  要知道你是誰  必須花上一輩子的時間
To know what you are,William,would take a lifetime.

1100
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,810
我很愿意這么做  但你現在必須快點跑
One I am willing to give. But now you must run.

1101
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:37,980
快跑吧  我會跟你一起跑
Run,and I will run with you.

1102
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,310
約瑟琳  我不能跑
Jocelyn,I cannot run.

1103
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:44,150
我是個騎士  我要排除萬難  
I am a knight,and I will put myself to the hazard!

1104
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:48,330
在你心中  不是在文件上  而他們在乎的只有文件  
In your heart,not on paper. And paper's what matters to them!

1105
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,630
威廉  我愛你
William,I love you.

1106
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:58,000
我愛你  只有你
I love you. You.

1107
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:05,110
-我不要看你上示眾臺  -但要看我逃跑  不  
- I won't see you led to the stocks.  - But you'll see me run? No!

1108
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:08,340
去你的自尊  威廉
Damn your pride,William.

1109
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:11,680
是你不愿意見到自己逃跑
It is only you that will not see you run.

1110
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,180
自尊是他們奪不走的  
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1111
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:17,950
但他們可以踐踏你的自尊  他們可以  也會這么做
But they can take it from you. They can and they will.

1112
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:20,180
他們絕對會這么做
Oh,they will.

1113
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:23,360
但他們奪不走愛
But love they cannot take.

1114
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,040
那我們要住在哪里  
And where will we live?

1115
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:33,700
我的破房子嗎  
In my hovel?

1116
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:40,710
-在冬天里跟豬共處一室  -是的  跟豬共處一室
- With the pigs inside in winter?  - Yes,William,with the pigs.

1117
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:42,310
跟豬共處一室
With the pigs.

1118
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:47,050
窮人可以為愛結婚
The poor can marry for love.

1119
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:51,720
約瑟琳  你不懂  
Jocelyn,you speak of what you do not know!

1120
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,550
威廉  我求你
William,I beg you.

1121
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,730
求求你
Please.

1122
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,000
跑吧  為了愛
Run. Do it for love.

1123
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,740
洛倫  你要我跑嗎  
Roland,you would see me run?

1124
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,920
你呢  杰夫  
And you,Geoff?

1125
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,590
我也希望你這么做  衷心這么希望
I wish it too,with all the pieces of my heart.

1126
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:35,100
華特  你跟我  我們不輕易逃跑的
Wat? You and l? We aren't runners.

1127
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:40,940
跑吧
Yes.

1128
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,710
威廉  今天我們得跑
William,today we are.

1129
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,450
威廉  跑吧
Run,William.

1130
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,280
我不會逃的  
I will not run!

1131
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:07,120
我是個騎士
I am a knight.

1132
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,480
各位
Well,boys

1133
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,480
好事終難長久
all good things must come to an end.

1134
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:27,320
我們就一起做個結束吧
Let's end them together.

1135
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:08,190
你自愿退出吧
You will remove yourself from this position of honor.

1136
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,630
我是來參賽的
I am here to compete.

1137
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:14,360
你是來被逮捕就范的
You are here to be arrested.

1138
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,210
好  
All right!

1139
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:54,230
一心想摘星的人
He that strives to touch a star

1140
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,740
往往會失足于
oft stumbles

1141
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,740
一個枝微末節
at a simple straw.

1142
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,420
你打也打了
You have been weighed.

1143
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,760
比也比了
You have been measured.

1144
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:25,530
而且發現你能力不足
And you have been found wanting.

1145
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:34,100
世事古難全啊威廉
It's one loss or anotherWilliam.

1146
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,950
你在哪方面能擊敗我  
In what world could you have ever beaten me?

1147
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:23,720
洛倫  你走吧
Leave,Roland.

1148
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,130
隨他們高興吧
Let them have me.

1149
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,970
威廉  上帝愛你
God love you,William.

1150
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:30,740
我也是
So do l.

1151
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,470
走  快走開  
Go! Disperse!

1152
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:37,400
不然我要你們好看  
Or I will fong you!

1153
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:40,910
我以拿撒勒的耶穌基督
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene and his holy mother

1154
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:44,740
和圣母瑪麗亞做我的見證  我會要你們好看  
the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,I will fong you!

1155
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:48,320
我會揍扁你們  痛死你們  
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1156
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:52,890
我會打爛你們  要你們痛苦  非常痛苦  
I'll stick my fist and break you! Pain! Lots of pain!

1157
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:00,600
我們麻煩大了
We're in trouble.

1158
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:06,000
聽我說
Listen to me.

1159
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,670
聽我說
Listen to me.

1160
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:47,710
我們真是哥倆好
What a pair we make,huh?

1161
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,380
都試著隱藏真實身份
Both trying to hide who we are.

1162
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,050
卻也都失敗了
Both unable to do so.

1163
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,900
你的同伴愛你
Your men love you.

1164
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:12,230
即使我不了解你  知道這點也就夠了
If I knew nothing else about you,that would be enough.

1165
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:17,580
但你在你應該退出的時候  勇敢不屈
But you also tilt when you should withdraw.

1166
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,010
那也是騎士精神
That is knightly too.

1167
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,420
放了他
Release him.

1168
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,430
他或許看來出身低微
He may appear to be of humble origins

1169
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:48,770
但我私人的史學家發現
but my personal historians have discovered

1170
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:52,710
他的遠祖是皇室成員
that he descends from an ancient royal line.

1171
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,780
這是我說的
This is my word.

1172
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:02,780
因此  你們不得爭辯
And as such,is beyond contestation.

1173
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:09,060
現在
Now

1174
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:13,800
讓我回報  你曾經對我展露的情誼
if I may repay the kindness you once showed me.

1175
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,130
屈膝跪下吧
Take a knee.

1176
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:37,150
謹以我父王愛德華國王  賦予我的權力
By the power vested in me by my father,King Edward

1177
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:40,820
并在這里所有人的見證下
and by all the witnesses here

1178
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,330
我封你為
I dub thee

1179
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,330
威廉爵士
Sir William.

1180
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:04,180
起身吧威廉爵士
AriseSir William.

1181
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:12,860
你能上場嗎  
Can you joust?

1182
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:16,520
我還有比賽要完成呢
There's my tournament to finish.

1183
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:21,520
你可以上場比賽  或者還是要棄權  
Now,are you fit to compete,or shall the forfeit stand?

1184
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,300
我沒問題
I'm fit.

1185
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:29,640
我會找人通知你的對手  去場上找他的盾牌吧
I shall have your opponent informed. Look for his shield on the lists.

1186
01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:31,540
馬上去
At once.

1187
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:33,650
謝謝你  殿下
Thank you,my lord.

1188
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,550

I give you the son of Philippe de Vitry,son of Gilles.

1192

-你確定嗎  -確定
- Are you sure?  - Yes.

1193
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:11,070
這不過是漆了黑漆的糖衣
It's nothing but spun sugar and boot black.

1194
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:21,690
目標雖然小
It's a small target

1195
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:25,090
瞄準他的心臟
but aim for his heart.

1196
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:33,500
功勛彪炳

1197

1199
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,710
天啊  我去找醫生
Oh,God. I'll get the surgeon.

1200
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,050
洛倫  
Roland!

1201
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:33,820
你就是醫生
You're the surgeon.

1202
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:37,390
快點
Come on.

1203
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:46,230
他裝了尖頭
He tipped it.

1204
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,240
凱蒂  快領我回起點
Kate,get me back to one.

1205
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,570
否則我們就得棄權
Otherwise we forfeit.

1206
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,920
那個黑心的渾蛋  
Dirty son of a bitch!

1207
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:16,490
凱蒂  我沒辦法呼吸
Kate,I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1208
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,330
正如我說的  補屋頂工匠
As I said,thatcher.

1209
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:30,500
你在哪方面能擊敗我  
In what world could you have ever beaten me?

1210
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:33,110
那方面是不存在的
Such a place does not exist.

1211
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:36,450
她來了
She's here.

1212
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:40,510
和你的父親一起來了
With your father.

1213
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:46,620
改變命運
Change your stars.

1214
02:00:51,630 --> 02:00:53,460
你我好好比一場吧
Let's dance,you and l.

1215
02:00:57,210 --> 02:00:58,870
目前是二比零
It's two lances to none.

1216
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:02,870
你得讓他落馬或殺了他  才能獲勝
You must unhorse him or kill him. It's the only way to win.

1217
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:15,720
-你需要多加些襯墊  -不了  我不穿了
- You need more padding.  - No,leave it off.

1218
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:18,050
穿著我會無法呼吸
I can't breathe with it on.

1219
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:24,820
長槍給我
Lance.

1220
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:31,830
我抓都抓不穩
I can barely grip it.

1221
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:33,400
可惡
Damn.

1222
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,410
把槍綁在我手臂上
Lash it to my arm.

1223
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:46,750
華特
Wat

1224
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,010
把槍綁在我手臂上
Iash it to me arm.

1225
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:53,250
照他說的做
Do it.

1226
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:13,030
各位  
Good people!

1227
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:15,450
我忘了說介紹詞  
I missed my introduction!

1228
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:28,290
但請你們
But please

1229
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:30,290
請你們  請求你們
please,I pray you.

1230
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,290
現在好好傾聽
Hear it now.

1231
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:35,630
因為我接下來
For I would lay rest

1232
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:38,300
放下花言巧語
the grace in my tongue

1233
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:40,300
只說簡單的
and speak plain.

1234
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:43,310
像今天這種罕見的機會
Days like these

1235
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:47,310
不該讓拙劣的言詞  貶損了它的價值
are far too rare to cheapen with heavy- handed words.

1236
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:52,480
因此  我想  我就不再無事自擾
And so,I'm afraid,without any ado whatsoever

1237
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:54,480
大人  抱歉
Excuse me,my lord.

1238
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:58,320
他就在那里  你們的同胞  
Here he is! One of your own!

1239
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:02,230
在這個場上誕生的璞石
Born a stone's throw from this very stadium

1240
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,390
現在就在你們的面前
and here before you now.

1241
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:06,720
約翰柴契爾之子
The son of John Thatcher

1242
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,730
威廉柴契爾爵士  
Sir William Thatcher!

1243
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:22,940
那是你的名字
That's your name.

1244
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:27,840
威廉柴契爾爵士
Sir William Thatcher.

1245
02:03:28,690 --> 02:03:30,120
你父親聽到了
Your father heard that.

1246
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:49,870
威廉  祝你成功
Godspeed,William.

1247
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:04,610
威廉  
William!

1248
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:27,630
你打也打了
You have been weighed.

1249
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,300
比也比了
You've been measured.

1250
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,640
而且絕對的
And you absolutely

1251
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:37,980
能力不足
have been found wanting.

1252
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,990
歡迎來到新世界
Welcome to the new world.

1253
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,980
愿上帝保全你  如果他這么做是對的
God save you,if it is right that he should do so.

1254
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:56,760
威廉  
William!

1255
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,550
太好了  
Yes!

1256
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:15,610
他贏了  他贏了  
He's won! He's won!

1257
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:52,320
威廉  你打敗了他  
You beat him,Will!

1258
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,400
威廉
Oh,William.

1259
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:21,010
我要寫下這個故事
I'm going to write this story.

1260
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:23,280
王子和騎士的故事  
About the prince and the knights?

1261
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:28,520
不  全部  一個藝術家要寫盡人事
No,all of it. All human activity lies within the artist's scope.

1262
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:32,860
你的就免了
Maybe not yours.

1263
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,080
她其實就是一臺高速運轉的機器
She was a fast machine,

1264
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:03,080
只不過讓自己的發動機永葆清潔
She kept her motor clean,

1265
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:07,080
她也許是我見過最好的女人
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen,

1266
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,080
因為她有一雙不明晰的眼睛
She had sightless eyes,

1267
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,480
而且她從不撒謊
Telling me no lies,

1268
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:14,480
用那美國式的胴體誘惑把我制服
Knocking me out with those American thighs,

1269
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:16,080
我試圖索取更多
Taking more than her share,

1270
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,080
結果我卻不堪重負
Had me fighting for air,

1271
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:22,080
她說來吧  事實上我已經在那了
She told me to come,but I was already there,

1272
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:24,080
然后棷N開始抖動
Cause the walls started shaking,

1273
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:26,080
大地也在晃動
The earth was quaking,

1274
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,080
我的思想已經極度疼痛
My mind was aching,

1275
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:30,080
你知道我們在干什么  因為你
And we were making it and you

1276
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:34,080
整晚的折磨我
Shook me all night long,

1277
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:38,080
整晚的折磨我
All night long

1278
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:47,080
我已付出了代價
I've paid my dues

1279
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,080
一次又一次
Time after time

1280
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:55,080
我服了刑
I've done my sentence

1281
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:58,080
但沒有犯罪
But committed no crime

1282
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:03,080
我犯過了一些
And bad mistakes

1283
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,080
嚴重的錯誤
I've made a few

1284
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:12,280
我自作自受
I've had my share of sand,kicked in my face

1285
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:14,080
但我都熬過來了
But I've come through

1286
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:19,080
我要繼續
And I need to go on and on and on and on

1287
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,680
我們是冠軍  我的朋友們
We are the champions,my friends

1288
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:33,080
我們會一直戰斗到最后
And we'll keep on fighting till the end

1289
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:38,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1290
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1291
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:46,080
這世界不屬于失敗者
No time for losers

1292
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:59,080
因為我們是世界冠軍
'Cause we are the champions of the world

1293
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,080
我鞠躬謝幕
I've taken my bows

1294
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,080
將落下帷幕
And my curtain calls

1295
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,080
你們給我帶來名譽和財富
You've bought me fame and fortune

1296
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:14,080
和隨之而來的一切
And everything that goes with it

1297
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,480
我感謝你們
I thank you all

1298
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:21,080
但沒有任何游樂
But it's been no bed of roses there

1299
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,080
也不是歡樂的海洋
No pleasure cruise

1300
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:30,080
我認為這是一個擺在全人類面前的挑戰
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race

1301
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:33,080
而我絕不會輸
And I ain't gonna lose

1302
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:38,080
我要繼續
And I need to go on and on and on and on

1303
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:43,080
我們是冠軍  我的朋友們
We are the champions,my friends

1304
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:51,080
我們會一直戰斗到最后
And we'll keep on fighting till the end

1305
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:57,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1306
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:00,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1307
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:04,080
這世界不屬于失敗者
No time for losers

1308
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:08,080
因為我們是世界冠軍
'Cause we are the champions

1309
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:22,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1310
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:26,080
我們是冠軍
We are the champions

1311
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:30,080
這世界不屬于失敗者
No time for losers

1312
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:35,080
因為我們是冠軍
'Cause we are the champions

1313
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:06,900
你輸了
Your round.
