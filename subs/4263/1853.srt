那我说说我的感觉
Do you mind if l tell you how l feel?

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,950
我觉得，你越早认清你是个下贱员工
l feel the sooner you realize that you're the bitch,

138
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,980
不是老板…
not the boss,

139
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,350
你会比较好过
(WHlSPERlNG) the better off you will be.

140
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,780
操你妈    - 你说什么？
(WHlSPERS) Fucker. What was that?

141
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,980

144
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,530
“欢迎光临东大瀑布”

145
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,140
你知道，我们还没谈…
You know, we still haven't discussed the whole

146
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,650
浴缸的事情

147
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,710
喔，那个嘛
Huh? Oh, that? That's...

148
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,010
别在意
That... Don't worry about that.

149
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,050
我是说，我比较希望…
Well, l mean, you know, obviously,

150
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,020
让爽的是我，但…
l would prefer it if l was the one that made you feel that way, but...

151
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,660
我知道你的感觉
l know how you feel.

152
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,830
每次我想上“博客来”购物
Every time l want to shop online and l start typing ''Amazon,''

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,490
出现的网址总是“勃起来”
''amazingcollegesluts.com'' pops up.

154
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,430

Amazing what?

155
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,870
好吧，很显然…
Okay, look, obviously

156
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,540
我们需要多嘿咻
we need to have more fun together.

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,510
我保证，这个周末…

Look at this big bruiser! Oh, my goodness!

164
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,170
他长大了    - 看看他！
He has grown. LEVENSTElN: Look at him! Huh?

165
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,750
有人尿裤子
Someone's got a little poopy diaper.

166
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,980
吉姆？
Jim?

167
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,510
真不敢相信是你
l can't believe it's you.

168
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,850
你不记得我了，对吧？
You don't remember me, do you?

169
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,360
还记得天线宝宝星期二吗？
Uh... Remember Teletubby Tuesdays?

170
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,930
卡拉？

171
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,760
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

172
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,430
怎么会？长大了
What? You're not a kid anymore.

173
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,010
我不需要保姆已经很久了
lt's been a long time since l needed a babysitter.

174
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,080
真不敢相信长这么大了
l can't believe how much you've grown up.

175
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,180
谢了

你应该来我的派对
You should come to my party.

179
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,250
谢谢，不了，有点走不开

卡拉！我们得走了

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,420
好啦，别急嘛
Okay, relax.

183
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,330
那是阿杰，别提了

184
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,490
希望明天可以见到你
Hopefully l will see you tomorrow.

185
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,110

186
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,930
嘿，亲爱的    - 嘿
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

187
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,100
你在跟谁说话？
Who were you talking to?

188
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,710
只是个隔壁的孩子
That was Just the kid next door.

189
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,390
“准备好迎接千禧年了吗？”

190
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,830
“剃光光杂志”

191
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,570
哈，我的老友们
Hello, my old friends.

192
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,010
我本来想统统丢掉…
l thought about throwing them out,

193
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,390
但它们对你太重要了
but they Just have too much sentimental value.

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,580
是啊
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

195
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,220
喔，吉姆，吉姆，吉姆
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim.

196
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,430
我还记得你只是个小孩
You know, l can remember when you were Just a little guy.

197
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
现在你都有自己的小孩了
And now you've got your own little guy.

198
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,500
我知道
l know.

199
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,870
转眼间他就会变成青少年
And before you know it, he's gonna be a teenager...

200
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,110
你就要教他打手枪…
And you'll be teaching him about masturbation

201
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,250
所有该与不该的老二守则
and, you know, all the do's and all the don'ts that have to do with the little guy's weenie. Okay. Right?

202
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,080
希望他到时那里也粗壮了
Hopefully, it'll be more of a bratwurst by the time he's a teenager...

203
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,280
好啦，爸，我懂了
Okay, Dad, l get it. ...but l'm Just...

204
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,680
这些都是你要面对的事
Well, these are things you're gonna have to deal with.

205
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,620
我了解，但他才两岁
l understand. lt's Just, you know, he's two.

206
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,620
是啊，也许你还有时间
Well, yeah, maybe you've got time, but...

207
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,800
我不想谈他的老二，你好吗，爸？
So, you know, l Just, l'd rather not talk about his penis.

208
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,860
我很好
How you doing, Dad? l'm good.

209
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,920
你都做什么消遣？最近有看电影吗？
Yeah? What are you doing for fun? You seen any movies lately?

210
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,900
你妈和我以前常看电影
Well, you know, your mother and l did go to a lot of movies.

211
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,170
她过世三年了，爸
You know, it has been three years since she passed, Dad.

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,570
城里一定有人可以陪你看电影
There's gotta be someone in town you can see a movie with.

213
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,980
现在你回来，我们今晚就去看吧
l have you now. We'll see a movie tonight, you and me.

214
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,080
今晚？
(STUTTERlNG) Tonight?

215
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,920
我跟兄弟们晚上约在酒吧
Well, l made plans with the guys, to meet up with them tonight at the bar... Oh. But... Yeah, yeah...

216
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,550
但我不一定要去，可以改明天
But l don't need to do that. l can do that tomorrow.

217
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,420
不，不，你就是为了同学会回来的
No. No, no, no, no. This is why you're in town, isn't it?

218
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,730
你去吧，我没事
No, no, no. You go. l'll be fine.

219
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,930
我今晚打算待在家里看看书
l was Just planning on staying in tonight and, you know, doing a little reading.

220
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,430
喔，不是看这个，不是
Oh, not this. No. No.

221
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,610
不过我记得读过一篇很有趣的文章
Although, l do remember reading a very interesting article

222
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,580
跟巴西有关
on something Brazilian.

223
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,150
这几页都黏在一起了
Boy, these pages are all stuck together here.

224
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,090
我来处理

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,560
凯文    - 嘿！

你来了
You made it.

230
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,770
我错过你的婚礼，这次不能再错过了
Hey, l missed your wedding, l wasn't gonna miss this.

231
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,640
嘿，兄弟    - 你好吗，伙伴？

235
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,350
别这样啦
Oh, stop it. Come on.

236
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,170
男士们
Gentlemen.

237
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,280
芬奇？    - 芬奇！
Finch? Finch!

238
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,210
见到你真棒，吉姆
Oh, my God! lt great to see you, James. Changed at all, Jim.

239
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,410
见到你真好，兄弟
Good to see you, pal.

240
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,740
我以为你不来了
l didn't think you were gonna make it. Finch, how are you, man?

241
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,710
北京的麻烦解决后，我搬去杜拜
So, after my troubles in BeiJing, l Just moved to Dubai,

242
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,050
沉溺在赌博的黑暗世界里
and then l got all caught up in the world of underground baccarat.

243
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,420
2009年剩下的日子都在非洲部落混
Spent the rest of '09 living with this African tribe.

244
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,760
他们还封我为荣誉族人
Oh, they made me an honorary tribesman.

245
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,290
那看起来很痛
Whoa, that looks like it hurt.

246
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,530
因为真的很痛，凯文
lt looks like that because it did hurt, Kevin.

247
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,660
之后，我骑单车游遍南美洲
Since then, l've Just been biking through South America.

248
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,880
所以，基本上你是全世界最有趣的人
So, basically, you are the most interesting man in the world.

249
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
我猜…
Yeah. Let me guess,

250
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,610
你们是来参加同学会的吧？
you guys are here for the reunion, huh?

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,780
没错，99年毕业班
You got it. Class of '99.

252
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,540
我在哪里见过你？

253
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,740
是啊，我上电视

254
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,080
不，不是你
No, not you.

255
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,280
是你
You.

256
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,860
你看起来好面熟
'Cause, your face, you're Just so familiar.

257
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,670
对了！这就是你，对吧？
Yeah! Yeah, this is you, right? (ALL LAUGHlNG) KEVlN: Oh! Man, Nadia!

258
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,130
再来，再来，你这个坏男孩！
More, more, you bad boy!

259
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,770
我以为我都删掉了
l swear l had these all taken down. How did you...

260
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,560
你到底早泄了几次？
Oh, yeah. How many times did you pre-eJaculate again?

261
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,140
别闹他
Oh, leave him alone.

262
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,310
我想当时你们都是饥渴的处男
l bet you were all desperate virgins back then.

263
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,240
瑟琳娜维嘉
Selena Vega.

264
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,480
这就是瑟琳娜维嘉
That's Selena Vega in front of us. Wait, wait, wait, Selena...

265
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,750
等等，米雪儿在乐队的朋友？
Hold on, Michelle's friend from band?

266
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
答对了
You got it.

267
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,650
我的天啊，抱歉我没认出
Oh, my God. l'm sorry l didn't recognize you.

268
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,620
看起来…
You look

269
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,730
不一样了

赶到什么？你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

293
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,590

What do you mean?

294
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,260
我们发电子邮件给你…

You know what? l must have put two F's in ''Stifmeister.''

297
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,810

So, Stifler, you're looking sharp. What are you up to these days?

303
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,790

304
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,690
哇！大公司呢

你妈好吗，史提勒？
How is your mother, Stifler?

311
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,940
你离我妈远一点，猪头
You stay away from my mom, shitbreak.

312
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,280
好了，都是过去式，可以和解了
Okay, boys, the past is the past. We can bury the hatchet here, huh?

313
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,040

纪念册里有一页给大家写志愿的

334
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,040

342
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,270
我还没谈过所谓的真感情
Alas, l have yet to find what you would call a real relationship.

343
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,070
对，因为跟史提勒他妈上床不算
Right, because banging Stifler's mom didn't count.

344
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,270

我想你老婆看到一定高兴死了
l am sure your wife would be very happy to read that.

349
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,950
我当时跟维基在谈恋爱啊

So, l'm assuming you didn't know he was gay back then.

354
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,480
吉姆，你娶的女人
Jim, it's a good thing you found a woman

你嘿咻次数大概比我们都多
l mean, you're probably having more sex than any of us.

357
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,350
可能吧
Probably, you know.

358
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,510

Hope you guys are thirsty. Stifler Claus is here.

359
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,250

Whoa! Stifler, that's a little too much, don't you think?

360
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,830
老兄，有点胆量好不好

回忆旧时光

380
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,430
我不太记得了

我们去湖边前要把这些收干净
Well, we gotta clean this up before we go to the lake.

384
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,050

Hey, watch it! Okay, Jeez.

我们年轻时这里好玩多了吧？
Am l wrong, or was this place a lot more fun when we were younger?

401
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,830
不，我觉得一样，是我们老了
No, no. l think it's the same. We're Just old now.

但我们以前也这么机车吗？
But were we Just as obnoxious as these kids back in the day?

不
No.

404
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,330
我们这一代成熟多了
Us, our generation, we were more mature.

405
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,170
嘿，兄弟们，你们看
Hey, guys, check it out.

406
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,680
阴道鲨！
Vagina shark!

407
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,610
他摸我下面！
He touched my snatch!

408
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,850
算我没说
l take that back.

409
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,290
喔，天啊
FlNCH: Oh, my God.

410
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,190
各位，你们一定要盯着她吗？
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

411
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,350
对    - 对
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,120
对，我们一定要盯着她
Yes, we do need to stare.

413
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,160
你也太明显了吧？
(SCOFFS) Could Jim be any more obvious?

414
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,000
算了吧
Oh, give him a break.

415
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,510
平常要看到活生生的模特儿并不容易
l mean, it's not every day you get to see a model walking around off the page.

416
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,910
最近我们家的…
There hasn't been a whole lot of sexy time

417
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
性生活并不美满
in the Levenstein household lately.

418
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,120
为什么？
Why not?

419
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,020
不知道，我现在是妈妈了
l don't know. l'm a mom now.

420
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,390
喔，拜托！
(SCOFFS) Oh, please!

421
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,190
当妈妈不表示需要隐藏自己另一面
Just because you're a mom doesn't mean there isn't a whole other side to you. (LAUGHS)

422
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,960
记得当初在乐队夏令营…
Hey, remember that one time at band camp,

423
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,470
我们在“那里”舔鲜奶油…
when we licked whipped cream off each other's...

424
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,900
好！好！我记得
Yes! Yes! l remember.

425
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,070
就当作是过去的秘密好吗？
Let's keep that in the past, though, okay?

426
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,940
喔，她在…
JlM: Oh, she's...

427
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,440
对啊，那样才不会晒出一条线
Yeah, well, you gotta do that, or else you're gonna get tan lines.

428
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,080
侧奶耶，奥斯，快看！
Sideboob. There... Sorry. (WHlSPERlNG) Sideboob. Ozzy, look!

429
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,650
好啦，够了喔！
Okay! Come on!

430
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,480
你真幸运，奥斯
You're a lucky man, Oz.

431
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,920
拜托，我觉得大家都蛮…
Oh, come on, guys. l think we're all pretty

432
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,860
幸运的
lucky.

433
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,330
等等，那是海蒂吗？
Wait, is that Heather?

434
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,170
对，是她
Yeah, it is.

435
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,770
海蒂    - 克里斯！
Heather. Chris!

436
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,480
你在这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

437
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,420
我想我们的目的相同吧
l guess we had the same idea, huh?

438
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,120
克里斯，这位是朗，我的男友
Chris, this is Ron, my boyfriend.

439
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,590
我是朗道格拉斯，很荣幸认识你
Chris Ostreicher, Ron Douglas. lt's a pleasure to meet you.

440
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,710
幸会
How do you do?

441
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,860
朗是医院的心脏科医师
Ron's a cardiologist at my hospital.

442
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,360
心脏科医师，哇
A cardiologist. Wow.

443
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,860
我朋友叫我朗医师、阿朗、小朗
Yeah. And, hey, listen, my friends call me Doctor Ron, D-Ron or Just Dron.

444
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,060
所以随便你叫吧
So you feel free.

445
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,170
好
Okay.

446
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,960
嘿，大便脸！
Hey, fuckface!

447
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,170
唱诗妹！哇！
Choir chick! Whoa!

448
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,600
我也很高兴见到你，史提勒
Nice to see you, too, Stifler.

449
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,840
这白痴是谁？
Who's this douche?

450
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,170
我是她男友
l'm her boyfriend.

451
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,640
所以你们两个有一腿
So, you two are banging,

452
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,250
你们两个曾经有一腿
and you two used to bang.

453
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,320
你们一定觉得很尴尬
This must be awkward for all of you.

454
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,350
现在尴尬了
(LAUGHS) lt is now.

455
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,650
那个死小孩抢了我的胸罩！
That little shit took my top! (LAUGHS)

456
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,160
还给我！
Give it back!

457
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,160
那是…我女友
Um, that's my girlfriend.

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,660
这是啥？这是啥？
What's this? What's this? (WOMEN SCREAMlNG)

459
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,810
嘿，小子！你以为你在干嘛？
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing?

460
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,540
快，快，快闪！
Hey! Come on, come on, let's go!

461
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,840
拜托，这样很过分！
Come on, guys. Not cool!

462
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,970
你们这些笨蛋能怎样？
What're you assholes gonna do about it? (BOYS SNlCKERlNG)

463
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,120
还真有趣
Well, that was interesting.

464
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,520
我们该做些什么吗？
Well, should we do something?

465
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,120
打算怎么办？
What are we gonna do? Come on.

466
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,390
同意，不用跟他们一般见识
Agreed. There's no need to stoop to their level.

467
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,000
见识个屁！
Fuck that!

468
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,070
我很清楚他们去哪里
l know exactly where they're going.

469
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,370
史提勒？
Stifler?

470
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
他跑哪去了？
JlM: Where the hell is he?

471
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,920
各位，这样很愚蠢
Guys, this is stupid.

472
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,220
我不能再让米雪儿等了，回去好吗？
l really can't keep Michelle waiting. Can we Just head back?

473
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,260
等一下，让史提勒搞他的
Hold on. Let Stifler do his thing.

474
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,530
我就怕这点
Yeah, that's what l'm afraid of.

475
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,740
你们看到他们的表情吗？
Did you guys see the look on their faces?

476
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,970
他妈的超赞
Fucking awesome.

477
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,550
爽翻了
BO: He is crazy.

478
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,910
其中一个男的当过卡拉的保姆
l think one of those guys was Kara's babysitter.

479
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,950
哪一个？
Which one?

480
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,420
就看起来像亚当山德勒那个
You know, the one that looked like Adam Sandler.

481
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,160
史提勒最好不要太夸张
JlM: Stifler better not do anything crazy.

482
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,890
他只是要给他们一点教训
All he's gonna do is tell them off.

483
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,830
我以为他要把水上摩托车放掉
l thought he was gonna cut their Jet skis free.

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,560
不是要在防晒乳液里尿尿吗？
What happened to pissing in their suntan lotion?

485
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,170
等等，他告诉我他要偷啤酒
Hold on. He told me he was going to steal their beer.

486
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,800
史提勒
(SlGHlNG) Stifler.

487
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,250
喔，等等，他在那里
KEVlN: Oh, wait. There he is.

488
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,410
好
OZ: All right.

489
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,920
果然，他要偷啤酒
JlM: Yep, he's taking their beer.

490
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,320
好，快点，史提勒
All right, hurry up, Stifler. Come on.

491
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,160
他在干嘛？
What is he doing?

492
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,420
他在干嘛？
What is he doing?

493
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
喔，不
OZ: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. JlM: Wait.

494
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,760
天啊！      - 喔，我的天啊
Oh, God! KEVlN: Oh, my God.

495
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,230
史提勒！      - 天啊
Steven! No! Oh, God.

496
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,340
你真的觉得卡拉今晚会献身吗？
Yo, so you really think Kara's gonna give it up tonight?

497
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,030
她在等18岁那天，你自己算吧
AJ: She was waiting until she turns 18. You do the math.

498
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,730
我算得出来
The only math l know is

499
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,240
你插过她的次数是0
you've added your penis to her vagina zero times.

500
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,380
珍妮弗可不是荡妇
KYLE: Jennifer's not a skank.

501
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,490
是，她是
BO: Dude, yes, she is.

502
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,750
我要吐了
l'm gonna throw up.

503
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,190
天啊，好恶
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

504
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,420
你在干嘛？
What're you doing?

505
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,460
（我在撇条…）
(MOUTHlNG)

506
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,330
快点啦！
Hurry up. Come on!

507
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,490
干了啦！喝快点
BO: Down it, man! Just chug it! Chug it!

508
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,660
快点！撑下去！
Do it. Do it! Don't puss out.

509
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,330
不要停！
Don't puss out!

510
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,500
走吧    - 快，快，快！
Let's Just go. Let's go. Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

511
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,670
再来一瓶吗？
You want another?

512
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,870
当然
For sure.

513
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,610
各位，今晚她将实现一年前的誓言
Guys, l'm telling you, tonight is gonna be the night she promised me a year ago.

514
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,550
靠…
What the...

515
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,220
喂！甲赛啦！
Hey! Dipshit!

516
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,630
不！
No!

517
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,730
不！不！
No, no!

518
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,540
史提勒！你发疯喔？
Stifler! Are you crazy?

519
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,150
你不是说只是要偷啤酒吗？
Jesus, Stifler, what happened to Just stealing their beer?

520
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,250
我知道，但这样爽多了吧
l know, this is so much better, right?

521
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,180
什么？
What? (LAUGHS)

522
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,220
你毁了他们的水上摩托车
JlM: You destroyed their Jet skis.

523
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,380
他们对我们泼水
They splashed us.

524
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,420
所以呢
So...

525
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,670
拜托，这样很好玩
Come on, guys. That was pretty funny.

526
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,670
在高中时代很好玩，现在是公诉罪
Maybe in high school it was funny. Now it's Just a felony.

527
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,900
除非被抓到
Only if we get caught.

528
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,840
你必须承认，报仇的感觉很不赖
Yeah, you gotta admit, it was nice giving those kids a little payback.

529
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,980
学习尊敬长者是好事
Maybe it was good that they will learn to respect their elders.

530
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,370
说得好！
Exactly!

531
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,210
等我一下，我去找卫生纸
Hey, give me a second, l gotta find some toilet paper.

532
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,580
好恶心
That's gross.

533
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,980
99年毕业班，你们好吗？
VlCKY: What's up, Class of '99-ers?

534
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,090
天啊，维基？
Oh, my God! Vicky!

535
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,480
真不敢相信来了
l can't believe you're here.

536
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,250
是啊，我昨晚从纽约飞来
Yeah, l flew in from New York last night.

537
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,860
我一直跟我爸妈在一起
l've been hanging out with my parents.

538
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,090
他们才提到你
They were actually Just talking about you earlier.

539
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,790
真的吗？他们说什么？
Really? About what?

540
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,430
他们在瀑布抓到我们那次
That time they caught us making out at the Falls.

541
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,760
喔，对
Oh, right.

542
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,070
瀑布，哇，我好久没去了
The Falls. Wow, l haven't been there in forever.

543
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,260
米雪儿以前很喜欢去瀑布
Michelle used to love going to the Falls.

544
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,770
那地方是爱情的泉源
The place is romance incarnate.

545
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,110
妈的没错，我第一次舔屁眼就在那里
Hell, yeah. l got my first rim Job at the Falls.

546
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,750
真是的
Okay.

547
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,370
嘿，亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

548
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,550
甜心！
Mmm, sweetie pie!

549
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,740
哈
Hello.

550
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,550
大伙在讨论要去瀑布玩
So, the guys were all talking about heading over to the Falls.

551
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,680
那吉姆和米雪儿的爱爱时间怎么办？
Well, what about Jim and Michelle time?

552
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,120
我在想，去那里还蛮浪漫的
l was thinking it could be kind of romantic.

553
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,750
我很想去，但你爸照顾艾文一整天了
Well, l'd love to, but your dad has been with Ev all day.

554
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,660
对，说的没错
Yeah, no, you're right.

555
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,830
好吧，我们就回家吧
Okay. Yeah, we'll Just, we'll go home.

556
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,970
不，你去玩吧
Oh, no, no. You go and have fun.

557
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,130
真的吗？    - 对啊
Really? Yeah.

558
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,900
你到家的时候，最好准备好
Just, when you get home, you Just better be ready.

559
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
才要准备好
You better be ready.

560
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,300
我早就准备好了
l'm ready.

561
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,620
史提勒，你知道路吗？
Um, Stifler, do you know where you're going?

562
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,220
跟我玩老二一样熟
l know this place like the back of my cock.

563
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
看起来好像是高中派对
lt looks like a high school party.

564
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,510
好多高中女生耶…
With high school chicks.

565
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,770
开趴
lt's on.

566
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,500
小心，史提勒，她们年纪比你小一倍
Watch it, Stifler. You know these girls are, like, half your age.

567
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,550
我知道
l know.

568
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,520
现在的女生是不是比较淫荡？
Okay, is it Just me, or do girls today seem a bit sluttier?

569
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,660
绝对是
Definitely.

570
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,850
青少年性行为、群交、手机互传裸照
Teen sex, rainbow parties, sexting nude photos...

571
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,400
新闻都有报导
l saw it all on Kathie Lee & Hoda.

572
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,300
生日快乐！
Happy birthday! (WHOOPlNG)

573
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,510
吉姆？
Jim?

574
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,740
卡拉    - 你来了！
Kara. You came!

575
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,480
失陪
Sorry.

576
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,750
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

577
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,510
天啊，这就是那位保姆？
Oh, my God, is this the babysitter? Mmm-hmm.

578
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,050
讲得好像我是超级英雄一样
You make it sound like l'm a superhero. (CHUCKLES)

579
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,920
比婴儿车快，比小货车有力
Faster than a speeding stroller, more powerful than a mini-van.

580
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,490
我就说他很爱搞笑吧
l told you he was funny.

581
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,820
他很可爱
He's adorable.

582
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,070
吉姆，介绍一下你的朋友吧
Hey, Jim. Do you wanna introduce me to your friends?

583
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,230
不了
No.

584
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,010
女孩们，这位是史提勒
Girls, this is Stifler.

585
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,910
们怎么会认识我的死党吉姆？
So, how do you know my best friend Jim?

586
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,810
吉姆以前是我的保姆
Jim used to be my babysitter.

587
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,110
我正要干杯，跟我一起喝吧
Hey, l was Just gonna do a birthday shot. Do you guys wanna do one with me?

588
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,390
不，不，不    - 要
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

589
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,220
我不该喝的    - 我们应该要喝
l shouldn't. Yes, we should, yes, we should.

590
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,780
我从没在大庭广众下打过炮
Never have l ever had sex in public.

591
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,960
真的吗？你们都没有？
Really? None of you?

592
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,760
来吧，海蒂，还没喝
Oh, come on, Heather. You haven't drank once.

593
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,460
好ㄍㄧㄥ喔！
You are such a prude!

594
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,400
也许是因为我没在大庭广众下打过炮
Or maybe l've Just never had sex in public.

595
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,740
我也没玩过多P
Okay, never have l ever been in an orgy.

596
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,250
他们人都很好啊
They were really nice guys.

597
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,120
信不信，这是我第一个高中派对
Believe it or not, this is my first high school party.

598
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,730
没错过什么
You didn't miss much.

599
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:33,460
我一直比较喜欢待在家里听广播
l always preferred staying at home, throwing on a little NPR.

600
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,460
你比我酷多了
You were so much cooler than me.

601
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,530
我都窝在家里尝试写X档案小说
l sat around writing X-FileS fan fiction.

602
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,310
我把俄文小说翻成拉丁文
l translated The BrotherS Karamazov

603
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,310
只是为了好玩
into Latin for fun.

604
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,140
那样好性感
That is so sexy.

605
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,650
说的没错
You know it is.

606
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,020
过去几年我在家开业当建筑师
l've only been working as an architect for the last few years, and from home.

607
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,020
在同一家公司待十几年了
You've been with the same company for over ten years.

608
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,460
很棒，成功了
That's awesome, it sounds like everything is working out for you.

609
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,830
是啊，一切都好，尤其是工作方面
Yeah. l mean, everything's good, especially work-wise.

610
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,130
但现在回来看到老朋友们
But now that we're back here in the town, and we see, like, all of our old friends,

611
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,830
大家都结婚生子了
and everyone's married and having kids,

612
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,940
你知道，会让我开始思考
it Just makes me, you know, think.

613
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,540
凯文，你没事吧？
You okay there, Kev?

614
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,210
没事，只是我平常不会这样喝酒
Yeah, l Just don't normally drink like this.

615
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,350
你是说你在品酒会上
You're telling me you haven't gotten a little bit tipsy

616
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,950
完全都没醉吗？
on Myers Family Wine Night?

617
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,150
有人在追踪我的脸书喔
l see somebody's been stalking my Facebook page.

618
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,690
至少我不会拍食物照
At least l don't take pictures of my meals.

619
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,330
是谁在追踪谁的啊
Who's stalking who now?

620
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,830
好啦，我也许看过一两次
Okay, so l've been by your page maybe once or twice.

621
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,230
跟某个叫亚力山卓的人约过会？
You were dating someone named Alessandro?

622
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,030
他知道拍照可以穿衣服吧
You know, he does know that he can take a picture with his shirt on, right?

623
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,330
亚力山卓早就是过去式了
Alessandro is long gone.

624
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,270
结束了，是吧？
lt's over, huh?

625
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,210
好，喝完这杯我就要回家了
Okay, after this drink, l have to go home.

626
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,320
吉姆
Jim.

627
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
你照顾过的18岁辣妹站在你面前
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl over there that you used to babysit.

628
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,420
你完全没有遐想吗？
And you're not going to do anything about that?

629
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,720
提醒你，我娶了米雪儿
Need l remind you that l am married to Michelle?

630
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,880
那就对啦
Exactly.

631
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,290
老兄
Dude,

632
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,630
这些正妹的床上功夫了得
these young chicks, they know some crazy shit in the bedroom.

633
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,030
你可以从卡拉身上学点东西
You could take what you learn from Kara,

634
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,760
回家用在米雪儿身上
bring it home, and apply it to Michelle.

635
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,060
你在乎你的婚姻吧，吉姆？
You do care about your marriage, don't you, Jim?

636
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,040
你在说什么啊？我才不要出轨！
What are you talking about, Stifler? l'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

637
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,210
我已经当爸爸了，拜托
l'm a father for Christ's sakes.

638
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,350
对，这样想才对
Yeah, that's perfect.

639
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,180
女生超爱老爸类型的，继续用这招
Yeah, chicks love a father figure. Keep playing that card, dude.

640
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,510
这不是招数，是事实
lt's not a card, it's the truth.

641
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,390
你们在谈什么？
Hey. Hi. What are you guys talking about?

642
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,750
喔，知道的
Oh, you know... Just...

643
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,390
吉姆说照顾很开心
Jim was Just saying how much fun he had taking care of you.

644
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,190
女士们，我们给他们一点时间聚聚
Hey, ladies, why don't we give them some time to catch up?

645
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,360
女士优先
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

646
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,800
不，不用了，我们应该聚在一起
No, that's not necessary. We should all hang out together.

647
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,460
大家…史提勒…
Why don't we all... Stifler, Just...

648
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,070
让她叫爸爸
Be her daddy.

649
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,110
史提勒？史提勒！
Stifler? Stifler!

650
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,170
那个…
So,

651
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,150
听起来你跟米雅的生活很刺激
sounds like you and Mia have quite an adventurous lifestyle.

652
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,750
有时有点太刺激了
Sometimes a little too adventurous.

653
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,480
海蒂比较保守
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit more on the conservative side. But, uh...

654
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,560
我得老实说，克里斯
But, l gotta be honest,

655
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,620
我需要一点刺激
Chris, l could use a little adventure myself.

656
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,730
你是指什么，朗？
What are you getting at, Ron?

657
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,600
我是说我通常不玩换妻的
l'm Just saying that usually l'm not one for swapping,

658
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,970
但你以前上过海蒂，这样就好解决
but the fact that you've been with Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

659
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,610
所以，你意下如何？
So, what do you think?

660
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,920
你觉得她们想吗？
Think they'd be into it?

661
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,750
我开玩笑的，拜托，开玩笑的啦！
l'm kidding. Come on, l'm kidding!

662
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,190
说真的，我才不会呢！
Seriously, l would never do that!

663
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,930
除非你们想
Unless you guys wanted to.

664
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,860
你去过南美洲所有国家？
So you've really been to every country in South America?

665
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,970
不，不是全部
No, no, not all of them.

666
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,160
而且我不认为法属圭亚那是个国家
And l don't consider French Guiana a nation.

667
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,170
我还记得，我等不及要毕业
l remember, l couldn't wait till graduation

668
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,310
可以离开这里，重新开始
so l could leave this town and reinvent myself.

669
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,170
的确变了一个人
You have certainly reinvented yourself.

670
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,280
我不知道
l don't know.

671
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,150
我心里还是有点希望可以探索世界
There's Just a part of me that still wishes that l could Just explore the world, you know?

672
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,150
做我理想中的人
Be everything l set out to be.

673
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,320
办得到的，做就是了
You can be whoever you wanna be. You Just gotta be it.

抱歉打扰，史呆勒

采购部的鲍伯心脏病发

有个白痴跟他说他被开除

他就失控了，我不清楚怎么回事

老天，我在干什么？

算了，我自己处理
You know what, l am gonna handle this myself.

卡拉，今晚怎么回家？
Hey, Kara, how are you getting home tonight?

710
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,790
阿杰本来要开我的车回来的
AJ was supposed to drive my car back,

711
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,300
但他到现在都还没来

712
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,800
说什么水上摩托车的烂借口
Some lame excuse about his Jet skis.

713
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,630
你相信那个混蛋吗？
Can you believe that Jerk?

714
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,300
你呢？
What about you?

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,600
你可以吗？
Will you take me?

716
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,620
拜托嘛，我们要去一样的地方
Come on! We're going to the same place.

717
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,480
而且，让我这样开车很不负责任
Besides, it wouldn't be responsible to let me drive in this condition.

718
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,550
对吧？
Right?

719
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,230

724
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,340
这什么时候变成经典摇滚了？
Classic rock? This is classic rock now?

725
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,040
该多喝水，我给的那瓶在哪？
Hey, you know, Kara, you should drink some more water. Where's that bottle l gave you?

726
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,120
喔，在这里    - 好

路上有一只小松鼠…
There was a little baby squirrel in the road, so...

730
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,060
哇哩咧！那不是水
Whoa! Hey! Whoa! That's not water. Okay.

731
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,610
喝太多了
lt's a little too much now.

732
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,470
这么多年了，你还是照顾着我
l love how, after all these years, you're still taking care of me.

733
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,050
一日保姆，终身保姆嘛
Well, you know, a babysitter's Job never ends.

734
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,950
你知道我一直暗恋你吧
(GlGGLlNG) You knew l always had a crush on you, right?

735
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,190
不知道
(HESlTANTLY) No.

736
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,520
我想把第一次献给你

00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,350
天啊…
Oh, God. Okay. Um...

739
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,630
卡拉，听着
Kara, listen. Um...

740
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,110
第一次是很神圣的
A person's virginity is something sacred, you know?

741
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,800
应该要留给特别的人
You should save yourself for someone special.

742
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,930
你很特别啊
You're special.

嘿，在干什么？
Hey, what are you doing?

拜托嘛，不会有人发现的
Come on. No one will ever find out.

748
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,050
我不知道，我不觉得…

你觉得我不美吗？
You don't think l'm pretty?

750

但那些王八昨天打电话来取消

你们怎么这么久才来？

我们找不到凯文
We were looking for Kevin. Couldn't find him.

00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,060
哇靠！
Holy shit!

811
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,310
干得好，吉姆！
Way to go, Jim.

812
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,250
我们没怎样，史提勒
Shh. Okay, nothing happened, Stifler.

813
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,450
我们没怎样
Okay? Nothing happened.

814
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,620
住手！
Stop that!

815
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,830
对不起
l'm sorry.

816
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,290
吉姆，你要我们怎么做？
So, Jim, what do you wanna do?

817
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,400
我不知道
l don't know.

818
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,530
我不能就这样留下她，她没穿衣服
l can't Just leave her here naked, you know?

819
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,430
要是警察经过，发现跟我有关
l mean, if the cops come by and find out l'm involved,

820
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,440
我就完了
l'm screwed.

821
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,510
我们有两个选择
That leaves us with two options.

822
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,070
把尸体丢掉，或是偷偷带她回房里
We dump the body or we sneak her inside.

823
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,270
把尸体丢掉？这又不是黑道暗杀
Dump the body? This isn't a mob hit.

824
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,640
好，等一下
Okay, wait a second.

825
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,150
我进她家当保姆超多次
l have been in her house a million times to babysit.

826
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,340
我可以从后门偷带她进去
l can totally sneak her in through the back door.

827
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,050
我需要你们转移她父母的注意力
l need you guys to distract her parents.

828
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,020
你们办得到吗？
Do you think you can do that? (SCOFFS)

829
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,450
我是专家，吉姆
l'm an expert, Jim.

830
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,420
相信我，我搞得定
Trust me. l got this shit.

831
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,500
晚安，先生
Good evening, sir.

832
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,500
我朋友的车抛锚了
My friend's car broke down,

833
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,130
能否借您的电话联络拖车行
and we were Just wondering if we could use your phone to call AAA.

834
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,380
你是说你们没人有手机？
You mean to tell me that none of you have cell phones?

835
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,350
天啊，是你 你参加过“名人来尬舞”
Oh, my God, l know you. You were on Celebrity Dance Off.

836
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,750
喔，对！
Oh, yeah!

837
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,650
克里斯奥斯
Ostreicher.

838
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,020
对了
Oh, yeah.

839
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,100
进来吧
Hey, come on in.

840
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,730
你真行啊，史提勒
That was very smooth, Stifler.

841
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,160
闭嘴啦，猪头
Shut up, shitbreak.

842
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,460
上次用这招，根本还没有手机这东西
The last time l did this, cell phones didn't exist.

843
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,180
妈的！
Shit!

844
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,390
爹地
Daddy.

845
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,030
妈咪，看，是爹地
Look, Mom, Daddy!

846
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,190
妈的！
Shit!

847
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,710
干！
Oh, fuck!

848
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,380
卡拉？
Kara?

849
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,540
卡拉？
Kara?

850
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,550
卡拉？
Kara?

851
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,120
你得来找我
KARA: Gonna have to find me.

852
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,260
卡拉？
Kara?

853
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,260
谢谢你，莎蓝德，帮了大忙
Thank you, Sheranda. You've been very helpful.

854
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,800
给打一百分
You get a Triple A-plus in my book.

855
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,060
也保重，好，掰掰
Oh, you take care, too. Okay, yeah, bye-bye.

856
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,440
拖车行很快就派人过来
So, that was AAA on the phone and they should be here in a Jiffy.

857
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,070
这首歌很耳熟吧？
Does this song sound familiar?

858
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,980
你好会跳舞，你被淘汰我好难过
You were such a good dancer. l felt so bad when you got voted off.

859
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,310
谢谢
Thank you.

860
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,450
但我得说，你本人性感多了
But l have to say you're much sexier in person.

861
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,660
苏珊，冷静点
Okay. Calm down there, Susan.

862
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,990
她超想上你的，奥斯
Dude, she wants to fuck you big time, dude.

863
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,320
你要上吗？    - 妈的当然不要
You got to hit that. No fucking way.

864
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,800
为了吉姆上吧，别自私
Do it for Jim, dude, don't be selfish.

865
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,070
我得去一下洗手间
Hey, you know what? l think l have to go to the bathroom.

866
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,000
卡拉，这不是闹着玩的
Kara, this is not funny.

867
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,900
卡拉，拜托！出来啦
Kara, come on! Kara, come out.

868
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,770
喔，我的天啊
Oh, my God!

869
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,380
来，好，乖
Come on. Okay, good.

870
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,210
你老是找不到我
You never could find me.

871
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,120
吉姆，我不想催你，但时间不多了
Jim, l don't mean to alarm you but you don't have much time.

872
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,280
好，我知道
Yes, l know.

873

876
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,380
当然
Sure.

877
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,490
相机应该在这附近
l know it's in here somewhere.

878
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,570
发胶…
Okay, a bottle of hair spray...

879
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,640
你们还好吧？
You guys all right?

不，你不想
No, you don't.

887
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,460
上床吧
Let's get in bed. (GlGGLlNG)

888
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,760
你想跟我一起上床吗？
Come on and get in bed with me?

889
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:05,690

Oh, shit!

891
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,940
史提勒，你来干嘛？
Stifler, what are you doing here?

892
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,940
我只想看一眼    - 不行
l Just wanted another glimpse. No.

893
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,440
你干嘛把她衣服穿回去？逊！
Why'd you put her clothes back on, dude? Boo.

894
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,580
你得走了
You have to go.

895
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,680
那是什么声音？
What was that?

896
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,080
听起来像是外面传来的
That sounded like it came from outside.

897
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,050
不，是卡拉的房间
No, that came from Kara's room.

898
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,210
喔，天啊
Oh, Jesus.

899
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,390
卡拉？
KARA'S DAD: Kara?

900
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,450
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

901
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,390
快走，快走！
Go, go, go!

902
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,170
这里在搞什么鬼？
What the hell's going on in here?

903
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,270
嗨，爹地
Hi, Daddy.

904
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,400
怎么回来的？
How'd you get back in?

905
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,370
我不记得了
l don't remember.

906
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,940
不记得？
You don't remember?

907
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,780
刚刚是什么声音？
What was that sound?

908
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,880
我不知道
l don't know.

909
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,040
什么叫不知道？
What do you mean, you don't know?

910
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,210
我不知道嘛
l don't know.

911
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,480
喝酒了，对不对？
You've been drinking, haven't you?

912
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,810
没有
No.

913
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,420
卡拉，我说过，那些男生灌醉
Kara, l told you these boys try to get you drunk

914
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,420
是为了占的便宜
so they can take advantage of you.

915
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,150
我长大了，我懂，爹地
l'm old enough to know that, Dad.

916
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,770
我不想因为扁人而坐牢
Yeah, well, l don't want to go to Jail for kicking some horny kid's teeth in

917
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,760
但相信我，我会的
but l will, believe me.

918
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,560
那是什么？
What is that?

919
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,970
喔，是牛宝宝啦
(LAUGHlNG) Oh, that's Mr. Moo!

920
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,510
帮我拿来好吗，爹地？拜托
Will you get him for me, Daddy? Please.

921
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,920
我真是没办法生的气
l can't be mad at my angel.

922
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,100
生日快乐，公主
Happy birthday, princess.

923
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,670
谢谢，爹地
Thanks, Dad.

924
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,010
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

925
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:01,750
没什么
Nothing.

926
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,020
Oh, Jeez.

927
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,250
史提勒？
(WHlSPERlNG) Stifler?

928
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,430
史提勒？
Stifler?

929
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,560
在上面啦
Up here, dude.

930
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,400
跟你说我是专家吧
l told you l was an expert.

931
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,470
喔，靠
Oh, shit.

932
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,100
现在又怎么了？
What the hell is going on now?

933
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,970
要不要去小贾斯汀的演唱会？
Want to go to a Justin Bieber concert?

934
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,780
吉姆？
Uh... Jim?

935
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,350
史提勒，闪了啦
Stifler, come on. Come on!

936
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,810
走啦
Let's go.

937
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,680
你们两个，在那别动
You and you, stay here.

938
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,680
不要推我
Don't push me.

939
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,160
哇咧！天啊
Whoa! Oh, my God.

940
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,530
卡拉，到底跑哪去了？
AJ: Kara, where the hell are you?

941
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,490
我在去家的路上…
l'm on my way to your place and...

942
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,830
搞什么…
What the...

943
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,260
干！
Fuck!

944
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,470
搞屁啊？
What the hell is going on?

945
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,010
喔，天啊
Oh, God!

946
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,490
嘿，猛男
Hey, stud.

947
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,530
我还以为你不…
l thought you'd never...

948
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,820
糟糕，我们本来要…
Oh, shit, shit. We were supposed to...

949
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,850
没关系啦
No, it's fine.

950
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,050
不，有关系
What? No, God, it's not fine.

951
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,090
真对不起，我想要，我只是…
Shoot! l'm so sorry, Michelle. l really... l wanted to, l Just...

952
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,420
我带艾文去我外婆家，下午就回来
l'm going to drop Ev at my grandma's and l'll be back this afternoon.

953
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,500
不，米雪儿，等一下
No, Michelle, hold on.

954
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,810
吉姆，我很担心
Jim, l'm worried.

955
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,470
担心什么？
What are you worried about?

956
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,480
我们好久没嘿咻了
Just we're like so out of sync.

957
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,240
我只是…
l Just...

958
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,890
我不知道我们这样下去能撑多久
l don't know how much longer we can go on like this.

959
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,620
我保证会尽力补偿
l promise you l will do everything l can to make it up to you.

960
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,220
好吗？
Okay?

961
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,020
史提勒晚上要开趴
Stifler's having a party tonight.

962
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,800
我知道听起来不太浪漫
Okay, l know that doesn't sound romantic or anything,

963
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,300
但我们的第一次就是在他的派对上
but remember our first time was at a Stifler party.

964
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,970
占有了我
You made me your bitch.

965
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,980
是啊，我是
Yes. Yes, l did.

966
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,030
要射的时候说一声
Tell me when, okay?

967
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,600
哇靠
What the fuck?

968
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,400
米雅
So, Mia.

969
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,460
她真是自由自在
She's a free spirit.

970
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,160
她很特别
She's something else.

971
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,810
是啊，她是
Yeah, she is.

972
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,680
等一下，有人在吃醋吗？
Wait a minute, do l sense a little Jealousy there?

973
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,320
没有    - 没有？
No. Mmm-mmm. No?

974
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,180
别忘了，是跟我分手去念医学院的
Hey, don't forget, you were the one who broke up with me before you went to med school.

975
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,420
是你要搬去洛杉矶，还不打算回来
Hey, you were moving to LA with no return in sight.

976
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,030
不能怪我想定下来
You can't blame me for wanting to settle down.

977
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,490
不，我不怪
No, l don't.

978
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,200
我只是不希望迁就
l Just don't want you to settle.

979
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,890
现在是谁在吃醋啊
Look who's Jealous now.

980
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,830
跟朗在一起不算是迁就
l wouldn't call being with Ron ''settling.''

981
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,530
当然不是，他看上去很体面
Oh, no, he's gorgeous on paper.

982
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,270
这话什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

983
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,040
没什么
Nothing. Um...

984
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,640
对不起，是对的
l'm sorry. You're right.

985
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,050
我是有点吃醋
l am a bit Jealous.

986
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,190
你知道吗，很有趣
You know, it's funny.

987
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,720
在某些方面，你完全变了
ln some ways, you've completely changed,

988
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,830
但其它方面，你还是一样
and, in other ways, you're exactly the same.

989
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,020
海蒂，相信我
Heather, you can believe this,

990
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,690
一切都没变
nothing's changed.

991
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,230
喔，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

992
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,000
克里斯奥斯？
Chris Ostreicher?

993
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,970
嗨，女孩们    - 可以合照吗？
Hi, girls. Can l get a pic?

994
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,070

995
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,870
爸？

996
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,880
爸    - 吉姆
Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jim.

997
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,680
我要出门一下
l'm Just going to run out for a sec.

998
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,650
我在看你成年礼的影片

你的犹太围巾在我手上！

还来啦，史提勒

是啊，我也想念她，爸

1004
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,550
我知道
l know.

1005
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,120
爸，你一向支持我，给我建议
Dad, you've always been there to give me advice.

1006
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,120
如果有什么事你想谈谈
But if there's anything that you want to talk about,

1007
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,920
我洗耳恭听
l'm here for you.

1008
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:56,470
我不觉得有什么想谈的
Yeah, l don't think there's anything l really need to talk about, Jim.

1009
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,470
你不觉得你应该…
Do you think maybe it's time for you to

1010
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,280
跟别人约会？
meet someone else?

1011
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,510
爸，没关系的
Dad, it's okay.

1012
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,810
你的遭遇很正常
What you're going through is perfectly natural.

1013
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,520
你知道，有一些服务…
You know, there are services out there...

1014
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,660
服务？    - 对啊
Services? Yeah.

1015
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,020
像什么？
Like what?

1016
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,960

A happy ending? What's that?

1017
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,430

Because l won't go there. Oh, my God.

1018
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,420
我不需要那种按摩
l don't need that... l don't need that kind of massage, Jim.

1019
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,300
我不是说…    - 很危险
That's not what l was... Because, you know what, it's dangerous.

1020
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,700
可能会有传染病
And you can pick things up.

1021
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,770
你不会想知道被传染到什么
You don't even wanna know what you can pick up.

1022
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,500
问问你叔叔莫特    - 我不想
Talk to your uncle Mort. l'd rather not.

1023
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,280
他住院两个礼拜    - 真恶心
He was in the hospital for two weeks. That's disgusting.

1024
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,980

Yeah, right, at my age? l don't think so.

1028
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:51,050
我太老，来不及了，以前哪来这套
l've been out of the game for so long. There wasn't even a game back then.

1029
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,190
爸，别担心，我来帮你安排
Dad, don't worry. l'll hook you up.

1030
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,700

哇    - 帅吧
Wow. Yeah. Oh.

1033
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,710
我们也许需要最近一点的照片
We might need something a little more recent.

1034
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,780
是吗？
Do you think?

1035
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,470
你有性感一点的衣服吗？
Do you have something that's a bit sexier?

1036
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,550

LEVENSTElN: Are we sure we're not taking off too much?

1046
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,410
这两条毛毛虫是我的注册商标

1053
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,580
我怎么30年前没想到？
Why didn't l do this 30 years ago?

1054
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,640
很帅喔
Looking good.

今晚来测试新造型怎么样？
Why don't we test this new look out tonight?

史提勒的派对会有点…

这是在搞屁啊
What the fuck is this?

1064
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,150
他妈的是谁换音乐？

1080
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,570
天啊！看看是谁来了

1088
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,920
我们已经各走各的路了
Let's Just say that friendship is a two-way street.

1089
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,960
失陪了
Excuse me.

1090
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,300
这个趴也太烂了吧
Could this party get any lamer?

1091
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,900
还可以啦
lt's not so bad.

1092
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,110
要不要来颗摇头药？
You want some E?

1093
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,970
不要，怎么会有？
No. Why do you have that?

1094
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,810
这里大概不会有人带
No one else here probably has any.

1095
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,010
你确定你不要？
Are you sure you don't want one?

1096
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,170
确定
Yeah.

1097
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,550
不…确定
No... Yes.

1098
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,650
不要
No.

1099
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,880
好吧，那我多吃点
Okay. Fine. More for me, then.

1100
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,550
他们在这
And there they are.

1101
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:46,960
芬奇
JlM: Finchy.

1102
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,060
你们在这啊
There you guys are.

1103
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,500
看看这里，真是烂透了
Look around. Can you believe this shit?

1104
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,470
是啊，真会办趴
Yeah, man. Nice work.

1105
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,300
给你的
For you.

1106
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,870
这个我他妈的该怎么处理？
What the hell am l supposed to do with this?

1107
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,510
那叫红酒，史提勒
That's called wine, Stifler.

1108
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,680
不，我的趴要喝烈酒
No, no, no, no, not at my party. l'm going to get us some shots.

1109
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,070
嘿，凯文
Hey, Kev.

1110
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,770
我可以跟你们谈一下吗？
Can l talk to you guys for a sec?

1111
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,080
当然，在这等，我马上回来
Yeah, sure. Wait here, l'll be right back.

1112
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,850
带家伙来了吗？
So, you brought the goods?

1113
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,250
就在这里
Right here.

1114
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,980
我要看
l want to see.

1115
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,430
哇咧，那些白痴跑哪去了？
What the... Where did those fuckers go?

1116
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,820
哈，史提勒
Hello, Steven.

1117
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,330
李文斯丁先生    - 是的
Mr. Levenstein. Yes.

1118
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,330
你来了
You made it.

1119
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,230
好高兴看到你们都回来了
lt is so great to see all you kids back in town. Hmm.

1120
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:32,710
今晚的聚会真是太棒了
And what a terrific soiree you're throwing here tonight.

1121
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,710
棒极了！
Just wonderful!

1122
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,580
这样吧，我要把你弄茫
You know what? l'm going to get you fucked up.

1123
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,910
来一杯
Hmm? Have a shot.

1124
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,610
喔！不，不，不
Oh! No, no, no.

1125
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:45,220
不行，我不太能喝
l don't think so, Steven. l'm not much of a drinker.

1126
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,320
快喝！快喝！      - 我不能喝
Drink it. Drink it! Drink it! No, l can't.

1127
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,550
快喝！
Drink it! Drink it!

1128
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,020
赞！再来一杯
Awesome! Let's do another one.

1129
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,290
不行
(STRAlNED) l don't think so.

1130
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,660
凯文，你不确定到底做了什么
Look, Kev, you don't know for sure if anything happened.

1131
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,130
我跟她在床上醒来，我们没穿衣服
l woke up next to her in bed, and all our clothes were off.

1132
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,000
不管发生什么事，我很内疚
l mean, whatever happened, l feel guilty.

1133
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,800
凯文，在法国…
Kevin, in France,

1134
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,640
被老婆抓到才算偷吃
it's only considered cheating if your wife catches you in the act.

1135
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,080
她来了
She's here.

1136
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,780
我得走了
l gotta go.

1137
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,710
好，准备好
All right, get ready.

1138
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,360
等一下，等一下
Wait for it. Wait for it!

1139
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,390
等一下
Wait for it!

1140
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,080
来！
Here she comes!

1141
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,390
牛±钗乃苟∠壬！
Fuck yeah, Mr. Levenstein!

1142
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,690
叫我诺亚，王八蛋
The name is Noah, motherfucker.

1143
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,330
摸摸沙发
Feel the sofa.

1144
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:37,240
好柔软
lt's so smooth.

1145
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,510
好像蓝色小精灵的屁股
lt feels like a Smurf's ass.

1146
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,040
感觉到了吗？
Did you feel it?

1147
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,270
好了，米雅，可以…
Okay. Mia, can you...

1148
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,720
嘿，各位，抱歉迟到了
Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.

1149
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:54,010
我找到好玩的东西给大家看
Hey, l got a treat for everybody. l picked something up.

1150
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,060
名人来尬舞第六季，我的偶像克里斯
Celebrity Dance Off, Season Six. My man, Chris Ostreicher.

1151
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,030
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1152
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,600
我们要看
We have to watch this.

1153
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,460
谁想看我的宝贝扭屁股？
Who wants to see my baby shake his booty?

1154
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,500
我想
l know l do.

1155
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,010
网络交友？开什么玩笑
JDate? You have to be kidding me.

1156
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,470
找靓鲍当然要出来狩猎啊
lf you want quality vag, you have to go out into the wild.

1157
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,840
靓鲍？
''Vag''?

1158
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,540
什么形容词啊？
What is that, a half a vagina?

1159
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,920
我们那一代都称女生下面为海狸
You know, in my day we called it a beaver.

1160
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:26,960
我告诉你，我以前可是一尾活龙
And let me tell you something, l snagged a pelt or two.

1161
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,060
我相信你
l bet you did.

1162
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,020
爸？
Dad?

1163
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,560
吉姆，你爸比你酷多了
Hey, Jim, your dad is so much cooler than you.

1164
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,390
史提勒，不要再灌醉我爸了
Stifler, please stop getting my dad drunk.

1165
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,930
不是啦，他只是想帮我尬靓鲍
No, he's Just trying to get me some vag.

1166
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,070
好了，走吧
Okay, come on.

1167
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,560
让他自己做决定
Let the man make his own decisions.

1168
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,900
够了，来吧    - 不要听他的
Stop. Come on. Don't listen to him.

1169
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,870
我要你硬起来
l want you to dust off that old dick of yours,

1170
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,030
走出去，尬个靓鲍
go out there, and get some ass.

1171
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,650
走出去    - 我想我会的
Oh! Just go out there. l think l will.

1172
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,270
爸，别这样，好吗？
Dad, stop, okay? lt's exactly what l'm gonna...

1173
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:56,350
抱歉，你今晚喝太多了
l'm sorry, but you have had a little too much to drink tonight,

1174
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,610
我不会让你…
and l'm not letting you... No, no.

1175
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,190
不，儿子，我根本没喝几杯
No, son, l haven't hardly had one drink.

1176
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,590
你知道我爱你
And you know l love you.

1177
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:08,030
我真的爱你，但你需要…
l do love you, but you need to

1178
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,560
晃松
chillax.

1179
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,030
“晃松”？爸，你要去哪？
''Chillax''? Dad, where are you going?

1180
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,640
看看他    - 吉姆，吉姆！
Do you see him? Jim! Jim!

1181
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,800
让他去吧，让他去玩
Let him go. Let him have some fun.

1182
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,310
这样我们自己也可以好好地玩
And now we can have some fun.

1183
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,510
来吧
Come on.

1184
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:26,750
不好意思
Excuse me.

1185
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,820
抱歉，不好意思
l'm sorry, excuse me.

1186
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,350
这是厕所吗？
ls this a washroom?

1187
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,280
你不知道你很自大…
lt doesn't even occur to you that you're self-centered

1188
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,450
因为你自大到…
because you are so self-centered and...

1189
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,530
你等等
You know what? Hold on a second.

1190
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,590
有事吗？
Can l help you?

1191
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:44,570
是哪位？
Who might you be?

1192
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,330
我是史提勒的老妈
l'm Stifler's mom.

1193
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,140
喔，我是吉姆的老爸
l'm Jim's dad.

1194
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,010
拜，混帐
Later, fucker.

1195
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:14,960
天啊，这真是我看过最可笑的东西了
Oh, my God, this is the most ridiculous thing l've ever seen.

1196
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,370
老兄，你身材真好！
Dude, you have an amazing body!

1197
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:28,880
大家为克里斯欢呼！
Everybody, raiSe the roof for ChriS OStreicher!

1198
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,850
你这整季都很拼命
You have really been bringing it all SeaSon long.

1199
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,540
但现在要看美国观众是否认同
But now it'S time, ChriS, to See if America thinkS you done brought it.

1200
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,620
准备好了吗？    - 来吧
You ready? Let'S do it.

1201
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,780
请看结果
Let'S See the reSultS.

1202
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,520
“克里斯奥斯39％ 吉尔伯特加佛莱61％”

1203
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,530
蛤？怎么是你出局？
What? Gilbert Gottfried and not you?

1204
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,820
妈的乱搞！
Fucking bullshit!

1205
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,090
克里斯，我很抱歉
ChriS, I'm So Sorry, man.

1206
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,900
你跳过舞了，现在可以闪了
well, we Saw you jam. Now, it'S time to Scram.

1207
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,140
最后有没有什么话要对观众说？
Do you have any laSt thoughtS for the audience?

1208
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,800
好了，各位，看到这就够了
Okay, guys, we can probably end it there.

1209
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,280
开什么玩笑，我还没看过呢
What? No, are you kidding? l haven't seen this.

1210
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,970
我想我学到的是…
I think what I've learned iS to be true

1211
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,910
要做自己…
to mySelf,

1212
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,090
因为跳舞就是要表现真我
becauSe that'S what dancing iS, it'S truth.

1213
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,310
也许…
And maybe,

1214
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,720
如果我们多跳一一点舞
if we juSt danced a little bit more,

1215
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:19,260
就再也不会有战争
there would be no more warS.

1216
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,500
拒绝战争！
No more war!

1217
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,960
真是令人深思的外交政策评论
Well, that is a thoughtful take on foreign policy.

1218
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,970
别走开，霍克浩根的热舞，马上回来
HOST: Stick around. Hulk Hogan getS jiggy-friggy, right after thiS.

1219
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,470
千万别错过，不要转台
You don't want to miSS thiS. Stick around.

1220
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,980
我觉得你输得很冤枉
lf you want my opinion, l think you got cheated.

1221
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,220
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

1222
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,820
知道吗？
You know,

1223
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,050
当你失去重要的东西
when you lose something that's important to you,

1224
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,560
感觉很差
it doesn't feel very good.

1225
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,390
奥斯，那不过是个电视节目罢了
Oz, it's Just a show.

1226
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,560
我不是在说节目
l'm not talking about the show.

1227
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,640
海蒂，在楼下吗？
RON: Hey, Heather, you down there?

1228
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:09,840
来了！
Um, coming!

1229
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,180
喔，天啊
Oh, my God.

1230
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:13,870
在这里等着，我马上回来
Wait here, l'll be right back.

1231
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,450
我进史提勒房间无数次…
l can't tell you how many times l walked into Steven's room

1232
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,450
老是抓到他跟女生在上床
and l caught him in the middle of sex with some girl.

1233
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,420
至少他是跟真的人上床
At least he was with a real, live human girl.

1234
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:24,490
什么意思？
What are you talking about?

1235
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,060
有一次我进厨房，看到吉姆在捅派
l walked into the kitchen once, and l saw Jim humping a pie.

1236
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,730
不到两秒整个派就碎了
He turned the damn thing into a crumble in about two seconds.

1237
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,970
我还有更好笑的
l can top that.

1238
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,130
有一次我进房间
l once walked into my bedroom

1239
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,710
抓到史提勒用我的梳子戳屁眼
and l caught Steven sticking my hairbrush up his ass.

1240
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,780
而且他不是用把手那一头
No, and it wasn't the handle side, either.

1241
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,990
不，不，不
No, no, no.

1242
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:05,970
这种美女不该喝这么多酒
A pretty lady like you shouldn't be drinking quite so much.

1243
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:08,100
我也不该
And neither should l.

1244
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,010
那来一管怎么样？
How about a Joint, then?

1245
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,250
我们不必等13年再见面
We don't have to wait 13 years to see each other again.

1246
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,980
对，没错
Yeah, true.

1247
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,120
我想我可以跟你去探险
And l guess l could come along on one of your adventures.

1248
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,160
我会是个好跟班吗？
Am l good sidekick material?

1249
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,090
跟班？
Sidekick?

1250
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:38,220
我觉得不只是个跟班
l think you are a lot more than sidekick material.

1251
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,940
你没事吧？
ls everything okay?

1252
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,600
好多了
lt's better than ever.

1253
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,880
好，等等
Okay, wait, wait.

1254
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,920
我觉得我们的服装不适合
l don't think we're dressed appropriately for the occasion.

1255
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,650
把这穿上
Put that on.

1256
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,020
等一下，要去哪里？
Wait, where are you going?

1257
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,060
换衣服，马上回来
To change. Be back soon.

1258
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,830
兄弟们！
Dudes!

1259
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,200
怎么样，老兄？
BOTH: What's up, bro?

1260
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,140
史大支？
WOMAN: Big Stiffy?

1261
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,370
喇叭妹莉丝坦
BlowJob Lipstein.

1262
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,120
妈的开什么玩笑！
Oh, you have to be fucking kidding me!

1263
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,480
你说什么？
Excuse me?

1264
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,260
来吧
Okay.

1265
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:45,030
你干嘛？你以为我会就这样帮你吹？
What the hell are you doing? You Just expect me to blow you?

1266
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,130
不然呢？
Yeah!

1267
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,700
我要走了
l'm out of here.

1268
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,360
等等，等等
Wait. Wait, wait!

1269
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,940
我懂
Look, l get it.

1270
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,770
对自己的身体很敏感
You're self-conscious about your body.

1271
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,340
别担心，反正我会关灯
Don't worry. l was going to shut the lights off anyway.

1272
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,180
你还是跟高中一样贱
You are the same douchebag that you were in high school.

1273
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,380
你指望我付出一切却空手而回？
You Just expect me to do everything while l get nothing?

1274
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,850
再见    - 不，不！
Later. No, no!

1275
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,890
我们谈个条件
Let's make a deal.

1276
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:16,570
我让高潮，也让我射
l'll get you off, you get me off.

1277
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,600
怎么样？
What do you say?

1278
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,130
可以
Fine.

1279
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,640
但你要努力一点
But l am putting you to work.

1280
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,440
惨了
Holy shit.

1281
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,300
尽情吃吧！
Chow time!

1282
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,080
你在这啊！
(SlGHS) There you are!

1283
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,480
我到处找你
l've been looking all over for you.

1284
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:38,280
听着，我们真的要…
Listen, we really need to...

1285
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,550
在干什么？
What are you doing?

1286
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,120
享用我的东西
Taking what's mine.

1287
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,360
不，我只是想听听的声音
No, l Just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.

1288
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,460
你没事吧？你听起来有点心烦
Aw, is everything okay? You seem stressed.

1289
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,260
心烦？
Stressed?

1290
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,900
你在这啊！
There you are!

1291
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,430
不，不，不
No, no, no.

1292
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:04,310
我得走了，我等一下再打给
l have to go right now, but l'll call you back in a little bit.

1293
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,680
好，别担心，我不会自己看偶像剧的
Okay. And don't worry, I won't watch Gossip Girl without you.

1294
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,820
我想你，宝贝    - 我也想
I miSS you, babe. l miss you, too.

1295
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:17,180
听我说，维基，昨天晚上…
Listen, Vicky, about last night,

1296
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,430
我不是那样的人
that wasn't me.

1297
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,660
我们做的事情…
With what happened...

1298
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,860
我不知道，也许在的世界很正常
l don't know. lt might be normal in your world.

1299
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:26,830
你以为发生了什么事？
What do you think happened?

1300
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,640
我们的衣服都在地上
Well, all our clothes were on the floor.

1301
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,840
因为你喝醉掉进湖里，衣服都湿透了
Yeah, because they were soaking wet from when you got drunk and fell in the lake.

1302
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,500
我帮忙照顾你
l took care of you.

1303
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,510
所以我们没嘿咻？
So, we didn't have sex?

1304
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,810
当然没有
Of course not.

1305
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,420
喔，感谢老天！
Oh, thank God!

1306
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,690
我很高兴你这么看得起我
l'm glad you think so highly of me.

1307
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:48,820
不
No.

1308
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,850
维基，等等
Vicky, wait.

1309
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,960
喔耶，喔，天啊！
MlA: Oh, yeah! Oh, my God! (MOANlNG)

1310
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,620
米雅，住手
Mia, stop.

1311
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,560
喔，我的天啊，耶！
Oh, my God, yeah!

1312
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,800
米雅，起来！
Mia, get off!

1313
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,000
快了！我快来了！
l'm about to! l'm about to!

1314
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,370
海蒂
Heather.

1315
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,670
搞什么啊？
What the hell?

1316
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,410
你跟这个荡妇有一腿？
You have something going on with this skank?

1317
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:16,580
叫谁荡妇，这个臭贱人
Who are you calling a skank, you fucking bitch?

1318
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,520
住手！住手！
Stop it! Stop!

1319
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,790
住手！
Stop it!

1320
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,060
我靠！
Ow! What the fuck?

1321
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,390
那是我的接发，贱人！
That's my extension, you bitch!

1322
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,190
操你妈的！
You motherfucker!

1323
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,600
不，米雅，等等！
No, Mia! Wait a minute!

1324
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,840
对了，我跟马力欧罗培兹上过床！
By the way, l fucked Mario Lopez!

1325
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,840
好，该我了
Okay, it's my turn now.

1326
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,510
你想得美
Uh-uh. Not this time.

1327
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,450
等等，我们不是说好了？
Wait, what about our deal?

1328
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,220
你现在知道我的感受了吧，史大支
Now you know how it feels, Big Stiffy.

1329
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,700
好恶！
Gross!

1330
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,310
不会以为我又睡着了吧
You didn't actually think l'd fall asleep again, did you?

1331
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,320
只要你是我的，我就开心了
As long as you're mine, l'm happy.

1332
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,180
卡拉，来这干嘛？
Jesus, Kara. What are you doing here?

1333
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,550
你的怪咖朋友邀请我和我朋友来
Your creepy friend invited me and all my girlfriends.

1334
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:32,090
衣服不错喔，很变态
Nice outfit, by the way. Very kinky.

1335
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,030
惨了
(POUNDlNG ON DOOR) Oh, shit.

1336
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:36,430
别担心，我锁住了
Don't worry. l locked it.

1337
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,300
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

1338
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,970
你们在这里搞什么东西？
What the hell kind of freaky shit is going on in here?

1339
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,410
阿杰，你来这里干嘛？
AJ, what are you doing here?

1340
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,440
我跟踪，我要亲眼看到
l followed you. l had to see it with my own eyes.

1341
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,240
你弄坏我的水上摩托车，还搞我女友
First you fuck with my Jet ski, then you fuck my girlfriend?

1342
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,650
不！老天，没有！什么事都没发生
No! God, no! Nothing happened.

1343
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:57,840
你死定了，亚当山德勒
You're going down, Sandler.

1344
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,490
亚当山德勒？哇咧
Sandler? What the...

1345
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,120
老天！
Jesus Christ!

1346
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:04,520
我要宰了你！
AJ: l'm going to kill you!

1347
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,560
吉姆，你他妈的穿著什么东西啊？
Jim, what the fuck are you wearing?

1348
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,130
我可以解释！真是的！
Hey, l can explain everything! Jesus!

1349
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,920
来啊！      - 妈的！
Come on! Shit!

1350
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,630
站起来，变态！
Get up, gimp!

1351
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,800
别这样，我不想跟你打架，好吗？
Come on, l'm not fighting you, okay?

1352
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,460
这样很蠢，我是大人
This is silly. l'm an adult.

1353
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,630
喔，是吗？
Oh, really?

1354
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,840
我觉得你看起来像个犯贱胆小鬼
Because to me you look like a little bitch pussy.

1355
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,680
别当胆小鬼，吉姆
Don't be a pussy, Jim.

1356
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,410
听着，阿杰，冷静下来，好吗？
Look, AJ, Just calm down, okay?

1357
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,680
你们这些混帐竟敢在史大炮的趴捣乱
What makes you little fuckers think you can crash one of the Stifmeister's parties?

1358
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,220
你刚刚叫自己史大炮吗？
Did you Just refer to yourself as ''the Stifmeister''?

1359
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,520
真是史上最逊的名字
Because that's the lamest name ever!

1360
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,220
我他妈的要宰了你
l'm going to fucking kill you.

1361
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,370
过来啊
Bring it on.

1362
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:44,900
嘿，史提勒，拜托，这…
Hey, Steve, come on, this is...

1363
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,280
你要去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

1364
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,680
别惹毛99年毕业班，贱人！
Don't mess with the Class of '99, bitch!

1365
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,040
芬奇！
Finch!

1366
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,810
不要伤害我朋友！
Don't hurt my friend!

1367
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:23,130
放开我丈夫，你这死小孩！
Get off my husband, you little piece of shit!

1368
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,080
糟了！警察杯杯来了！
Oh, crap! lt's the fuzz!

1369
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,050
我们得出去，该怎么出去？
We have to get out. How do you get out?

1370
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,450
我需要逃生路线！
l need an escape route!

1371
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,180
妈的！
Oh, shit!

1372
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,330
你要跟他在一起？
You want to be with him?

1373
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,090
好！去吧！
Fine! He's all yours.

1374
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,360
闪了啦！
Come on, man!

1375
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:54,070
吉姆，到底是怎么回事？
Jim, what's going on?

1376
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,260
这一切我很抱歉，我可以解释
l am so sorry for all of this. l can explain.

1377
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,270
昨晚我遇到我们邻居卡拉
Last night l ran into Kara, our neighbor.

1378
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,500
她喝醉不能开车，所以我载她回家
She was too drunk to drive, so l drove her home.

1379
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:07,480
然后她开始脱衣服，摸我的…
And she started taking off her clothes, and touching my...

1380
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:11,250
我知道听起来不妙，但我们没做什么
Okay, l know it doesn't sound good, but nothing happened, okay?

1381
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,480
我根本不在乎她！
l don't care about her at all!

1382
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:16,220
谢谢你喔
Thanks a lot.

1383
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,120
不，卡拉，等等，我不是这个意思
No, no, Kara, wait. l didn't mean...

1384
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,990
等等，米雪儿，等等
Wait, Michelle. Hold on, hold on.

1385
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,560
不是想的那样，好吗？
lt's not what you think, okay?

1386
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:27,260
我发誓，我只是想把事做好…
l swear, l was Just trying to do the right thing, and l...

1387
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,970
一定要相信我，米雪儿，求
(SlGHS) You have to believe me, Michelle, please.

1388
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:34,000
不管我相不相信你…
Whether l believe you or not,

1389
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:35,610
我很失望
l'm disappointed.

1390
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:38,480
我要去外婆家住
l'm going to stay with my grandmother.

1391
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,710
等等，米雪儿    - 不要跟着她，吉姆
Hold it, Michelle. No, Jim.

1392
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:42,910
各位，已经打完了
Hey, the fight's over, guys.

1393
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:44,490
我们不是来劝架的
We're not here to stop a fight.

1394
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:47,050
我们是为了那辆失窃的摩托车来的
We're here about that stolen motorcycle.

1395
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:48,850
车牌号码符合
Looks like the VlN numbers match up.

1396
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,320
保罗芬奇
Paul Finch.

1397
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,190
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

1398
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,830
赞！
Awesome!

1399
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,290
不好意思，警官
KEVlN: Excuse me, officer.

1400
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,800
那是他赌阿根廷踢赢世界杯的奖品
He won that bike betting on the World Cup in Argentina.

1401
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:00,990
你们搞错了
You made some sort of mistake.

1402
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,140
怎么回事？    - 发生什么事？
Paul, what's going on? What is this about?

1403
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,470
保罗
Paul.

1404
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,870
芬奇，跟他们说
Finch, Just tell them.

1405
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,070
保罗！
Paul!

1406
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:12,000
猪头，晚上你被牢友插的时候…
STlFLER: Hey, shitbreak, when you're getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

1407
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,310
就当作是凯文
think of Kevin.

1408
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:19,350
米雪儿，我可以…拜托！
Michelle, can l Just... Please!

1409
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,160
爸？
Dad? Ah!

1410
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,800
爸？
Dad?

1411
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,070
爸，你在干什么？
Dad, what are you doing?

1412
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,040
你没看到我！我不在这里！
You didn't see me! l'm not here!

1413
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,370
我不在这里！
l'm not here!

1414
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,070
他还好吧？
ls he all right?

1415
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,480
我不知道
l don't know.

1416
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,440
芬奇怎么办？
What are we going to do about Finch?

1417
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,880
管他去死喔，让他被关一晚
Fuck Finch. Let him spend the night in Jail.

1418
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,150
干嘛这样，史提勒
Come on, Stifler!

1419
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:52,550
你算什么朋友
Some friend you are.

1420
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,360
那你们呢？
What about you guys?

1421
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,820
不打电话，不写信，不回脸书讯息
You don't call me, you don't e-mail, you don't comment on my Facebook page.

1422
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,200
回来参加同学会也不告诉我
You guys didn't even let me know you were coming back for the reunion.

1423
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:07,630
因为我们知道你一定会把事情搞砸
Because we knew, somehow, you would find a way to screw things up.

1424
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,830
抱歉喔，吉姆
Oh, l'm sorry, Jim.

1425
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,130
我只想大家周末爽翻天，像高中一样
l wanted us to have a fucking fun time this weekend, like we did in high school.

1426
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,270
但我们已经不是高中生了
But we're not in high school anymore.

1427
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,000
你还活在过去，史提勒
You are so trapped in the past, Stifler.

1428
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:20,170
你什么时候才会了解我们回不去了？
When are you going to realize that things will never be the way they used to be?

1429
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,520
好吧
Fine.

1430
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,560
我想派对结束了
Guess the party's over.

1431
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,090
王八蛋
Dicks.

1432
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,930
真是个好趴
Well, that was a great party.

1433
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,730
我真的觉得超过瘾的
l honestly think l had fun.

1434
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,430
至少有人玩得开心
Well, that makes one of us.

1435
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,140
米雪儿有跟你联络吗？
Have you heard from Michelle?

1436
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,580
没有，她不想跟我说话
No. She doesn't want to talk to me.

1437
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,550
今晚的同学会怎么办？
What about the reunion tonight?

1438
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,840
她说她不一定会去
She said she may or may not come.

1439
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:30,820
你们俩是怎么了？
What's going on with you two?

1440
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,650
吉姆，你想不想谈谈？
Jim, is there anything you want to talk about?

1441
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,650
好吧
Okay.

1442
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,390
你和妈…
How often

1443
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,830
多久…
did you and Mom...

1444
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,170
那个？
You know?

1445
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,430
就是为了这个？
ls that what this is about?

1446
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,440
你和米雪儿最近都没有…
You and Michelle haven't been...

1447
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,480
最近都没有
Not lately, no.

1448
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,880
是因为…
ls it

1449
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,540
你硬不起来？
an erectile problem?

1450
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:09,690
有时候你可以拖延一点时间…
Because sometimes you can buy a little time

1451
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:10,920
先用拇指代替
with a well-placed thumb.

1452
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,030
喔，天啊    - 只是说说罢了
Oh, God. l'm Just saying.

1453
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,990
不是那个原因    - 不是吗？
l don't think that's it. That's not it?

1454
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:20,230
这招要学起来，屡试不爽
Oh! That's something to keep in your back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

1455
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,000
好，别再提这个
Okay, let's be done with that.

1456
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,570
那方面没有问题
No, things in that department were fine.

1457
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,870
后来艾文出生了
And then Evan was born

1458
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,950
我们就不做了
and we kind of stopped.

1459
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,120
之后也都没做了
And they haven't really picked up since, you know?

1460
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:40,050
这不算问题，别担心
This is not a problem, so do not worry.

1461
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,050
你懂？    - 懂啊，听着
You understand? Yeah, listen, Jim.

1462
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,490
你还没出生前
Before you were born,

1463
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,490
你妈和我每天都做
your mother and l, we would do it every day.

1464
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,650
我不需要听这个
l don't need this.

1465
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,130
有时候一天两三次
Sometimes two or three times a day.

1466
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,900
那是七○年代，大家都勇于尝试
This is back in the '70s. A lot of experimentation was going on.

1467
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,800
你妈超喜欢一招叫“长驱直入”
Your mother favored something she called, ''diving for dollars.''

1468
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,430
挖哩咧，我不需要…
Holy shit. l'm sorry, l don't need...

1469
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,340
没关系，我们可以…
(CLEARS THROAT) That's fine, we can...

1470
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,710
不需要继续讨论这个
l don't have to go on with that.

1471
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,550
我的重点是，虽然有了孩子做了爸妈
But my point is, when you have a kid, you become a dad and a mom.

1472
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:16,090
继续当夫妻也是很重要的
But it's very important not to stop being a husband and a wife.

1473
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:20,290
这样性爱才会持续
And if you do that, the sex will come.

1474
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:23,600
听起来还蛮有道理
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1475
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:27,130
但你们不能等两人独处的时光
But you can't Just wait for the two of you to be alone.

1476
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,800
要自己想办法制造机会
You have to make your own alone time.

1477
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,770
你以为你为何一周去犹太学校三次？
Why do you think you went to Hebrew school three times a week?

1478
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,810
周日中午到三点，周二四点到七点？
Sundays, noon to three? Tuesdays, four to seven?

1479
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,240
好，我懂了，爸
Okay, l get it, Dad.

1480
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:42,650
如果你懂，干嘛问这些？
lf you get it, then why the questions?

1481
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,810
对不起
l'm sorry.

1482
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,050
很抱歉你经历这些，我应该支持你
You're going through this, l am sorry. l should be listening.

1483
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:49,230
不，我反应过度了，对不起
No, l'm overreacting. l'm sorry.

1484
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,790
谢谢你
(SlGHS) Thank you.

1485
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:57,270
又救了我一次，真的
Again. Really.

1486
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:01,900
别客气
Anytime.

1487
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:06,540
“欢迎99年毕业班”

1488
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,270
各位，欢迎
Welcome, you guys.

1489
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,870
去拿名牌，找指定的位子坐
Listen, find your nametag, find out what table you're sitting at.

1490
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,310
艾许莉，好高兴见到！
Ashley, so good to see you! Oh, my God.

1491
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:17,510
比利！天啊，你看起来真瘦
Billy! Oh, my God, you're looking so svelte.

1492
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:21,980
你以前超肥，我好担心
You used to be morbidly obese. l was concerned. KEVlN: Hey.

1493
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:23,090
嘿，各位
Hey, guys.

1494
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,890
嘿，吉姆    - 奥斯
Hey, Jim. Oz.

1495
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,190
米雅呢？
Where is Mia?

1496
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,520
她早上搭飞机走了
She flew out this morning.

1497
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:31,060
喔，我很抱歉，兄弟
Oh. l'm sorry, man.

1498
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:32,960
米雪儿呢？
What about Michelle?

1499
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,070
我还不确定
l am not sure yet.

1500
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,040
芬奇！
ALL: Finch!

1501
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:41,510
怎么回事？我一直打电话去警局
What happened? l called the police department a thousand times.

1502
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,550
谢了，是我妈把我保释出来的
l appreciate that, Kevin. But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

1503
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,810
兄弟们，我搞砸了
Guys, l screwed up.

1504
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:52,050
那辆机车是我老板的
That bike belongs to my boss.

1505
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:56,520
他答应要给我加薪，但他耍我
And l was promised a raise, and l didn't get it, so l

1506
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,920
所以我就借了那辆车
simply borrowed it.

1507
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:01,220
其实我的人生一点也不有趣
The truth is that my life isn't interesting at all.

1508
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:05,720
我是文具量贩店的副理
l am an assistant manager at a Staples in Bayonne, New Jersey.

1509
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:09,200
我骗了我的死党，对不起
l lied to my best friends, and l'm sorry.

1510
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,610
你知道吗，虽然你违背原则
You know, Finch, Just because you sold out

1511
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,870
跟我们大家一样工作无趣
and got a boring Job like most of us,

1512
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,570
但不表示你很丢脸
that doesn't mean you should be embarrassed.

1513
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:21,110
对啊，别这样，那些鸟事不重要
Yeah, come on, man. None of that shit matters.

1514
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,450
这对我意义重大
That means a lot, gentlemen.

1515
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,050
那你的手臂是怎么回事？
What about your arm?

1516
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,450
我开车时打翻咖啡
l spilled coffee on myself while l was driving.

1517
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,750
不会吧
No. (CHUCKLES)

1518
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,220
超痛的耶
lt hurt like a bitch, though.

1519
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,320
我想也是    - 你真是的
l'll bet. Jesus, Finch.

1520
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,970
嘿，你们看看这个
Oh, hey, check this out, you guys.

1521
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,430
很扯吧？看看我们
Crazy, huh? Look at us.

1522
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,730
好多回忆
OZ: A lot of memories.

1523
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,370
“史提勒”
''Steve Stifler.

1524
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:52,250
“希望跟麻吉们一直开趴”
''Hopes to keep the party going with his boys.''

1525
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,950
有看到他人吗？
Any sign of him yet?

1526
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,490
我觉得他不会来了
l don't think he's going to show.

1527
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,600
史提勒？
Stifler?

1528
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:21,800
你们怎么找到我的？
How'd you find me?

1529
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,310
我们问你妈的
We asked your mom.

1530
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,640
没有喔，我什么都没做
Oh, no. l didn't do anything.

1531
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:32,680
我们想为昨晚说的话道歉
We wanted to apologize for what we said last night.

1532
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,390
我们不是有意的
We didn't mean it.

1533
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,660
少来了，我懂，你们觉得我很鸡巴
Yeah, you did. l get it, you guys think l'm a dick.

1534
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:46,600
好吧，其实…
Okay. Well,

1535
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,900
也许你还蛮鸡巴的
maybe you are kind of a dick.

1536
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,860
但…
But,

1537
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,670
你鸡巴起来很好玩
you're a fun dick.

1538
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,870
你是我们的鸡巴
And you're our dick.

1539
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,810
是啊，老兄
Yeah, man.

1540
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:03,320
因为有你，高中才这么好玩
You were one of the biggest reasons that high school was awesome.

1541
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:06,150
是啊，高中超好玩
Yeah, high school was awesome.

1542
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:09,120
结果毕业以后，大家开始工作
Then we graduated and everybody started getting Jobs

1543
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:14,030
结婚生子，一大堆鸟事
and getting married and having kids and all that other stupid shit.

1544
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,760
现在，看看我，窝在这里被看扁
Now, look at me. l'm the bitch of this place.

1545
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,960
史提勒，我们的人生都不完美
Look, Stifler, none of our lives are perfect.

1546
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,300
尤其是我
Especially mine.

1547
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:26,710
但我们继续玩，一起去同学会如何？
But what do you say we keep this party going, and hit up this reunion together?

1548
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:29,940
这里在搞什么鬼？
What the hell is going on here?

1549
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:34,740
天啊，这就是那个王八
Oh, my God. This is the Jackass.

1550
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,520
你根本还没开始做，还在这边…
You're not even close to being finished and you're up here

1551
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:39,810
跟朋友喇赛？
''chilling with your posse''?

1552
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:41,180
不好意思，我们可以解释
Sorry, we can explain.

1553
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,550
不，凯文
No, Kevin.

1554
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:44,990
让我来
Allow me.

1555
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,760
是啊，凯文，让他来
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

1556
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,400
最好有好理由，史呆勒
This better be good, Stafler.

1557
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,760
我叫史提勒，操你妈
lt's Stifler, fucker.

1558
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,090
你以为你是谁啊？
(SCOFFS) Oh, wow. Who the hell do you think you are?

1559
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,540
你在马子面前摆架子？
Are you acting tough in front of your girlfriend? Huh?

1560
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,830
我们都知道她只是为了你的钱
Because we both know she's only with you for your money.

1561
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,010
绝对不是为了你的
Definitely not for your dick.

1562
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,980
站你旁边尿尿的人都知道你超小根
Because anybody that's peed next to you knows it's the size of a leprechaun's pinkie.

1563
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,420
才不是
That's not true.

1564
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:14,890
“才不是”，本来就是
(MOCKlNGLY) ''That's not true.'' Oh, yeah, it is.

1565
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:20,290
你有豪华办公室，我连桌子都没有
Look, Just because you got a fancy office and l don't even have a desk

1566
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,730
但这不会改变我们的个性
doesn't change who we really are.

1567
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,430
事实是，你还是个呆瓜
The truth is, you're still a dork,

1568
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,540
我还是能痛扁你
and l can still kick your ass.

1569
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:31,100
但我不会
But l'm not going to.

1570
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,800
你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

1571
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,910
因为我是他妈的史大炮
Because l'm the fucking Stifmeister.

1572
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,570
你跟这份工作都去屎吧
And you can take this Job and shove it up your dickhole

1573
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,880
因为我要去参加同学会
because l have a reunion to attend.

1574
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,210
伙伴们
Dudes?

1575
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:52,450
对了，我根本不知道该怎么做这些
By the way, l had no clue what l was doing with any of this shit,

1576
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,620
所以，你有得忙了
so you got a lot of work to do.

1577
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:31,290
惊喜！      - 嘿！来了！
Surprise! Hey! You made it.

1578
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,770
那当然
Of course.

1579
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,170
底特律狮队今年有没有机会？
What do you think about the Lions this year? They got a shot?

1580
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,700
要看攻击线锋防守行不行
We'll see if their offensive line can hold.

1581
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,500
你要参加名人来尬舞明星赛吗？
Are you planning on being on Celebrity Dance Off.; All StarS?

1582
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,610
其实我没想那么多
l actually haven't thought much about that.

1583
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,710
你应该考虑一下
You should think about it.

1584
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,750
抱歉，各位，失陪一下
l'm sorry, guys, you'll have to excuse me.

1585
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,660
我可以接手吗？
Can l cut in?

1586
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,860
不知道，你保证不脱衣服？
l don't know. Can you promise to keep your shirt on?

1587
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:05,430
我开玩笑的啦
Come on, buddy, l'm busting balls. Huh?

1588
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,660
当然可以
Yeah, of course.

1589
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,300
我去拿饮料
l'll get us some drinks.

1590
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:10,400
好
Okay.

1591
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,240
你不是该跟女友跳舞吗？
Shouldn't you be dancing with your girlfriend?

1592
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:23,750
米雅和我分手了
Mia and l are over.

1593
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:29,880
她要我成为…另一个人
She wanted me to be someone else.

1594
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:34,190
我不想
Something that l don't want to be.

1595
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,430
你想要什么，克里斯？
What do you want, Chris?

1596
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,230
海蒂，我要
Heather, l want this.

1597
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,030
我要我们在一起
l want us.

1598
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,930
你洛杉矶的工作怎么办？
What about your career? LA?

1599
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:50,340
听我说，我知道这样很疯狂
Look, l know that it's crazy.

1600
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:55,350
我现在也没有答案，但我看到
And l don't have all the answers right now, but l see you,

1601
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,150
我就知道…

01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:03,080
我爱
l love you.

1604
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:05,790
我爱你
l love you.

1605
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,330
我滑雪下山，有人心脏病发
So, l'm skiing down a mountain. Guy has a heart attack right there.

1606
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,310
我救了他一命，大新闻，网络上有
Saved his life. lt was a big story, you can google it.

1607
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,600
是啊，大新闻
Yeah, it was.

1608
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,070
我想也是
l bet.

1609
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,240
哇咧！失陪了
Holy shit! Excuse me.

1610
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,880
不好意思，现在是怎样？
Hey, excuse me. What the hell is going on?

1611
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,950
朗，我可以解释    - 真的假的？跟他？
Ron, l can explain. Seriously, this guy?

1612
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:31,280
我他妈的是心脏科医师
l'm a fucking heart surgeon,

1613
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:32,340
他不过是小台体育记者
this guy's not even on ESPN.

1614
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,320
冷静点，朗
Hey, take it easy, Ron.

1615
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,820
怎样？你想揍我吗，奥斯？
What are you going to do? Hit me, Oz? Huh?

1616
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,830
喔，我有个主意，来尬舞好了？
Oh, l got an idea. What about a dance-off? Huh?

1617
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,600
这不是实境秀好吗？这是真实世界
This isn't a reality show, okay? This is the real world.

1618
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:47,170
你挥拳，我就告死你
You take one swing at me, l will sue you for all you're worth.

1619
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:54,100
我一文不值，猪头
l'm not worth Jack shit, Dron.

1620
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,910
我是你的鸡巴
l'm your dick.

1621
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:03,040
他输惨了！      - 超赞的！
Dropped him! That was awesome!

1622
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:05,310
我们那晚玩得好开心
Listen, we had a blast the other night.

1623
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,960
你考虑过当派对顾问吗？
Have you ever thought about being a party planner?

1624
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,030
因为我们要你筹划我们的婚礼
Because we want you to plan our wedding.

1625
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,620
答应吧
Say yes.

1626

你不需要解释
You don't have to explain.

1633
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:37,750
芬奇，我喜欢你不是因为
Look, Paul, l didn't like you because you climbed the Alps,

1634
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,950
你爬阿尔卑斯山或是徒手杀骆驼
or killed a camel with your bare hands.

1635
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:42,750
我喜欢你是因为你还是当年那个好人
l liked you because you were still the same good guy

1636
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,090
在高中时代真的对我好

1637
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,930
我还是那个人

你知道，上次来这里参加毕业舞会
You know, the last time l was here was for prom.

1640
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:56,530
我没有伴    - 我也没有
l didn't have a date. Neither did l.

1641
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,070
我得去拿饮料
l have to get a drink.

1642
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,740
怎么了？
What?

1643
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,200
我舞技那么差吗？    - 对
Was my dancing that bad? Yeah.

1644
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:06,240

1652
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,830
们喇舌证明一下
Why don't you guys make out and prove it.

1653
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,900
你一定是史提勒，我听说很多你的事
You must be Stifler. l've heard a lot about you. Ow!

1654
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,540
大部分都不是好事
Mostly negative.

1655
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,830
酷，靠北喔
Cool, dude. What the fuck?

1656
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:32,800
洁西卡，很高兴见到
Jessica, it's good to see you.

1657
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,030
才怪
No, it wasn't.

1658
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,240
靠腰咧…
What the...

1659
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,440
凯文，你应该去跟维基谈谈
Look, Kev, l think you should go talk to Vicky.

1660
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,810
她心情很不好
She's really upset over there.

1661
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,780
好，谢了
Yeah, thanks.

1662

很高兴认识
Nice to meet you.

1663
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,450
要像个男子汉，你现在长胡子了
Be a real man, you have a beard now.

1664
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:53,360
凯文，别说了，我没事
Kevin, don't. l'm fine.

1665
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,130
别这样，昨晚我太过分了
Come on. l was a complete Jerk last night.

1666
01:32:57,270 --> 01:33:00,130
我只是很气你觉得我知道你结婚了
l was Just upset that you would think that l would do that

1667
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,170
还会做那种事
knowing that you're married.

1668
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,130
我知道不会
l know you wouldn't.

1669
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:07,940
说真的，是因为我自己太紧张了
Honestly, that was more about me being nervous.

1670
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:13,070
和重逢，所有的旧情绪又浮现
Seeing you again, all these old feelings came up, and...

1671
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,880
我不知道，我只是觉得内疚
l don't know, l guess l Just felt guilty.

1672
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:20,980
但事实是，我对还有感情…
But the fact that l still have feelings for you

1673
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,920
表示我们曾拥有的很特别
Just means that what we had was special.

1674
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:25,960
别误会
Don't get me wrong, all right.

1675
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:29,430
我爱艾莉胜过一切
l love Ellie more than anything.

1676
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,090
但无论过了多久…
But no matter how much time passes

1677
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:35,000
永远是我的初恋
you'll always be my first love.

1678

你也是

You have to try these cupcakes, they're awesome.

1681

艾莉，这位是维基

1682
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:49,480
那位维基？凯文说了好多的事
Oh, my God! The Vicky? Kevin has told me so much about you.

1683
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,710
真幸运，他是个好人
You're a really lucky girl. He's a great guy.

1688
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,200

1689
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:56,420
抱歉，我不认得你
Yeah, l... Sorry, l don't remember you.

1690
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,540
没关系
Okay.

1691
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:02,250
我是大家在网络上看的那个孩子
l was the kid who everyone saw on the lnternet.

1692
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:06,920
抱歉，你得说清楚一点
Mmm. Sorry, you're going to have to be more specific.

1693

我早泄了两次

生了史上最可爱的小孩

没错，你知道为什么吗？
Yes, l did. You know why?

1719

因为魔鬼终结者2还是史上最棒电影
Because Terminator 2 is still the greatest film ever made.

1720
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:51,220

但可以给我们一分钟吗？
But do you think you could give us a minute?

1761
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:34,090
三分钟    - 三分钟
BOTH: Three. Three minutes.

1762
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:37,960
好啊！好开心你们还在一起
Okay! So nice you are still together.

1763
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:41,470
看得粗来你夜来夜行了
And l see you've gotten much better at this.

1764
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:44,400
谢了
Well, thanks.

1765
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:52,180
那就是吉姆？他跟我长得一点也不像
That's Jim? He looks nothing like me.

1766
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:58,810
我高中时代跟曲棍球选手交往过
You know, when l was in high school, l dated a lacrosse player.

1767
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,920
事实上，不只一个
ln fact, l dated a few of them.

1768
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:03,060
不会吧
You don't say.

1769
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:06,390
我一直希望芬奇能多运动
l always wanted Paul to be more into sports.

1770
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,190
但他一直都没兴趣
But he was never that interested.

1771
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:11,430
不必说得这么含蓄
You don't have to sugarcoat it.

1772
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,900
芬奇笨手笨脚的
Finch was a klutz.

1773
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,340
是啊，他是，但可不是遗传我的
Yeah, l guess he was, but he did not get that from me.

1774
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,440
我是拉拉队长
l was head cheerleader.

1775
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:24,710
我从曲棍球员身上学到的…
And if there's anything l learned from lacrosse players,

1776
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,440
就是喜欢握棒子…
it's that l like to handle a stick

1777
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,780
还有把玩球…
and cradle those balls.

1778
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:37,150
我爱
l love you.

1779
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,430
准备好应付我了吗，史提勒？
Are you ready for me, Stifler?

1780
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,320
喔，当然！
Oh, yeah!

1781
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,400
来吧
Let's go.

1782
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:51,340
喔，米雪儿
(MOANS) Oh, Michelle.

1783
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,440

你好棒喔！
You are amazing!

1785
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,400
比浴缸还棒？
Better than the bathtub?

1786
01:40:58,580 --> 01:40:59,440
棒多了
Much.

1787
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,810
比这个还棒？
Better than this?

1788
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:09,210
当然
Of course.

1789
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,630
喔，脱掉！
STlFLER: Oh, take those off!

1790
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,090
我们不该这样做

1791
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,250
我们应该这样做

01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,370
噢，你是史大炮！
Yeah, you are the Stifmeister.

1796
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:27,070

STlFLER: Oh, your son's such a dork!

1807
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:06,380
别再提他了！
Stop talking about him!

1808
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:11,480
第一次同学会结束了
Well, our first reunion is officially in the books.

1809
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,250
我不晓得你们觉得怎样
l don't know about you guys,

1810
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,950
但我昨晚过得很爽

很棒

Fuck yeah! l Jizzed like a racehorse.

1814
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,860
你后来跑哪去了，史提勒？
What happened to you at the end of the night, Stifler?

1815
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:23,190
你跟谁离开？
Who did you end up with?

1816
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,860
绅士绝不泄漏天机
A gentleman never kisses and tells, Jim.

1817
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,000
各位
JlM: Guys?

1818
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:33,870

1819
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,940
卡拉！

1820
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:51,050
我为那晚说的话道歉
Look, l'm sorry about what l said the other night.

1821
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:54,490
不，该道歉的是我
No, l'm the one who should be apologizing.

1822
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,890
我不敢相信我的行为，好丢脸
l can't believe the way l acted. l'm so embarrassed.

1823
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,430
别这么想
Don't be.

1824
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:02,240
我在的年纪时，也对性很沉迷
When l was your age l was pretty obsessed with sex, too.

1825
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,390

不过，谢谢你的体谅

我想过，你是对的
l was thinking about it, and you're right.

1830
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,570
我应该等特别的人
l should really wait for someone special.

1831
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,320
但要找到跟你一样好的人很难
Just, it's going to be tough to find a guy as good as you.

1832
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:24,780
我相信会找到的
l'm sure you will.

1833

这个周末后我觉得自己变了个人

要离开了觉得有点难过
Kind of sucks we have to leave, though.

1835
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:36,440
我还没要走
Not me.

01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:38,470
我要休个假
l'm going to take some time off my Job

1837
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,570
和海蒂留在这里一阵子
and stick around here with Heather for a while.

1838
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:41,570
不赖嘛！
Nice!

1839
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,770
你呢，芬奇？
What about you, Finch?

1840
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:46,140
瑟琳娜和我打算去欧洲度假
Selena and l, we're planning a little Jaunt to Europe.

1841
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,780
记得打电话给你妈，她想你
Just make sure you call your mom. She misses you.

1842
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,080
你怎么知道？
How would you know?

1843
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,960
所以就这样了吧，回去各自的生活？
l guess this is it, huh? Back to reality?

1844
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:00,820
我们不该等下一次同学会
We shouldn't wait until the next reunion.

1845
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:04,060
应该每年都聚聚
We should try to get together every year.

1846
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:06,900
怎么样，期待下一次吧？
What do you say, until next time?

1847
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,170
期待下一次
Until next time. Until next time!

1848

What was that?

1851
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:48,170
这是怎样？
