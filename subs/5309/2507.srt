00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,079
<i>Please turn off
all portable electronic devices.</i>

3
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,792
<i>Thank you.</i>

4
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,162
Sir, could you please turn that off?

5
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,922
It can interfere
with the plane's navigation system.

6
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,166
Do you really believe that?

7
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,344
Because people have been talking

8
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,797
outside the flight attendant
social circle of trust,

9
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,267
and word is that nobody
really believes that.

10
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,433
Excuse my friend.
He was dropped on his head as a child.

11
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,854
No. If these were really that bad,

12
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,557
they wouldn't let you bring them
on the plane, ﬂat out.

13
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,818
If you agree with me,
don't unfold your arms.

14
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,981
See?

15
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,576
Dude, do you really need an extra minute
of playing Dora the Explorer?

16
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,403
She was about to save the Crystal Kingdom.

17
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,411
What the hell?

18
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,883
<i>We just experienced
an electrical short.</i>

19
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,094
<i>To your right,
you will see heavy electrical activity</i>

20
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,770
<i>in the upper stratosphere.</i>

21
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,563
<i>Nothing of major concern.</i>

22
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,850
I hate flying.

23
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,035
<i>Due to electrical storms,
all outbound flights are canceled.</i>

24
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,993
When was the last time you wore that?

25
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,545
I don't know. Graduation?

26
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,339
You didn't go to graduation.

27
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,213
But I still dressed up out of solidarity.

28
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,512
All right, give me a Sharpie.

29
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,972
One of these days,
I'm not going to have a Sharpie in my bag.

30
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,053
- Another poignant metaphor for me?
- Yes.

31
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,918
It's an exclusive social network
for globetrotting travelers.

32
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,005
It's a GPS-based navigation system
that allows young people

33
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,258
to find the hottest bars and clubs
in cities around the world.

34
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,424
Our expansion plans for Moscow...

35
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,184
Sean?

36
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,810
Jump in whenever.

37
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:49,483
Our expansion plans for Moscow
include getting drunk, laid

38
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,153
and ending up in a Russian prison,
all at the click of a button.

39
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,731
Is it just me,
or does Cyrillic look like Klingon?

40
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,316
Dude, get serious for a second.

41
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,575
Come on, man.
I found that freaky Zvezda joint

42
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,198
we're going to hit up for our victory lap.

43
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,207
"Supermodels desperately seeking
software designers."

44
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,125
That's a good idea.

45
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,368
And when the Russians go for this,

46
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,545
we're a $10 million company overnight.

47
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,965
Fifty-six travelers
currently logged into Moscow.

48
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,800
Ooh, an American.

49
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,724
I didn't fly halfway around the world
to see Americans.

50
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,800
Tell her to go to Applebee's.

51
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,802
Zvezda? Zvezda.

52
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,271
- Ben?
- Yeah?

53
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,768
Have I ever let you down?

54
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,398
Yeah.

55
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,818
Yeah.

56
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,825
We'll let Skyler make the introductions.

57
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait for us?

58
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,617
You ready?

59
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,870
Teamwork makes the dream work.

60
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,954
That's ridiculous.

61
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,810
Whoa, guys.
What are you doing here?

62
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,897
Didn't you get my e-mail?

63
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,809
We won't be needing you.

64
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,197
Hang on. My boy just spent, like,
12 grand to develop this.

65
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,319
Plus, flights.

66
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,946
Yeah, what the hell is going on here?
Looks exactly like my idea.

67
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,243
Yeah, I know. It's very good.
It's almost perfect, thank you.

68
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,869
Next time, you send an NDA.

69
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,828
You must mean
the Non-Douchebag Agreement.

70
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,835
Call security.

71
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,542
Whoa, whoa.
Skyler, why are you doing this?

72
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,589
It's business.

73
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,508
It's criminal.

74
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,514
Welcome to Moscow.

75
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,390
Security will help see you out.

76
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,820
This is such bullshit.

77
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,735
Wow.

78
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,530
- Look at this place.
- I know, right?

79
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,614
It's amazing.

80
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,991
Amazing, but are we lost?

81
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,327
No. This map says
we're only two blocks away.

82
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,787
All right. Hold up, hold up.

83
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,668
- Everyone say, "Moscow."
- Moscow.

84
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,839
- Whee!

85
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,635
- So how did we find this place?
- This guy's blog.

86
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,512
- Cute?
- Yeah,

87
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,090
I mean, if he's the one on the left.

88
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,726
Nat, his friend is wearing a Snuggie
with a bolo tie.

89
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,098
I know you're into that, don't lie.

90
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,181
Yeah, if I end up some human lampshade
in this guy's creepy basement...

91
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,642
Relax. I'm giving you
a no-lampshade guarantee.

92
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,900
Shall we?

93
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,445
We shall have a drink.

94
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,698
I'm like, "We have to go up there, right?"

95
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,004
<i>I like the Gucci, Gucci
I like the dollar bill.</i>

96
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,582
<i>I love your pocket rocket
We live to shock it, shock it.</i>

97
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,420
<i>I like the way you smile
I might just bite your lip.</i>

98
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,257
<i>I see you talking, talking
Your hands are talking, talking.</i>

99
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,594
<i>I like that.</i>

100
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,443
<i>I like your dirty mind
Mine's on it all the time.</i>

101
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,147
<i>Oh, let me shake it, shake it
Oh, Polaroid it, shake it.</i>

102
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,822
<i>I'm a graffiti girl.</i>

103
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,526
Screw it.
Big picture, this doesn't mean shit.

104
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,818
It does mean shit.

105
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,322
Our future is exactly shit right now.

106
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,035
Okay. We'll sue those guys.

107
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,203
Get a huge international Matlock-ass
lawyer who knows Russian law.

108
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,669
What Russian law?

109
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,331
Just don't sweat it, all right?
We'll figure something out.

110
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,252
- How can you be like that?
- Like what?

111
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,589
Like delusionally optimistic all the time.

112
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,425
I'm just more used to screwing up
than you are.

113
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,352
I try and get mad at you...

114
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,241
Son, peep the kiosk.

115
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,705
Full on kiosk.

116
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,579
Kiosk her to marry me.

117
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,216
Seriously?

118
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,878
That Swedish prick.

119
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,801
Guys, you're here.

120
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,558
It's impressive. That's good research.

121
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,648
Look. You can't be so naive, okay?

122
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,940
I mean, you come out here,

123
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,815
everybody out here is like hungry wolves,
and you act like two little lambs?

124
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,020
Of course you're going to get eaten.

125
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,034
You may like to think of yourself as a wolf
so you can sleep at night,

126
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,737
but the truth is,
you're just a straight-up thief.

127
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,367
You have to understand,
this is just business.

128
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,955
Some people can take it.

129
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,408
Some people can't.

130
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,617
It's a nice shirt.

131
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,995
Oh, thanks. Your mom left it in my room.

132
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:09,219
No human society exists
without booze or religion.

133
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,426
That's why I drink religiously.

134
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,927
Dude, the American.

135
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,055
Oh, really?

136
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,684
"Stuck in Moscow. Please help."

137
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,269
Applebee's, never mind.

138
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,071
We should help.

139
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,861
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

140
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,859
- Lesbian.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,943
Herpes.

142
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,153
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

143
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,488
Thank you, gentlemen.

144
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,537
Good job. Thank you.

145
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,754
Snuggie, six o'clock.
I told you his friend is hot.

146
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,797
You and your valedictorians.

147
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,375
"Stuck in Moscow. Please help"?

148
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,085
Theglobetrot.com.

149
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,337
Now officially retired.

150
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,340
What happened? Are you guys
some kind of millionaires or something?

151
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,471
No, no. Try billionaire.

152
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:03,349
Uh... Or just the loyal friend
of a full-of-shit wingman?

153
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,149
- I'm Ben.
- Full-of-shit wingman.

154
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,727
Anne. This is Natalie.

155
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,906
Well, thanks for the tip.
It's definitely living up to expectations.

156
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,654
Sean is actually the man
who finds this stuff.

157
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
And what do you do?

158
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,486
Everything else.

159
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,411
Can I get a lager? A beer?

160
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,622
Does anyone speak Russian?

161
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,920
Only what he learned in <i>Rocky IV.</i>

162
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,339
So, anyway, I'm on my way to Nepal.
Shooting photos.

163
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,848
I'm trying to get them into this gallery.

164
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,175
You will get in.

165
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,228
Nat, here, is my faithful assistant
and my best girl.

166
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,690
Well, I did have other plans this summer,
but they fell through,

167
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,939
so I quit my job and I left my mom a note.
And here I am.

168
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,019
Why would you do that?

169
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,688
A dumb-ass boy.

170
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,690
- Ooh.
- Okay, can we not talk about that?

171
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,445
Sorry.

172
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,152
So, what do you actually do?

173
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,699
Yeah, what do you do?

174
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,537
Uh...

175
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,833
He likes basking in the possibility.

176
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,909
Right?

177
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,791
Or just never having to commit to anything.

178
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,046
You're kind of a dick.

179
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,123
Photo time.

180
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,128
No dumb-ass faces, no peace signs.
Come on, now.

181
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,087
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

182
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,973
One, two, three!

183
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,592
What?

184
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,644
Sorry, guys, my bad.

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,017
What did you do now, Sean?

186
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,313
Russia

187
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,645
What's happening?

188
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,740
What is that?

189
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,201
Northern Lights, maybe?

190
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,405
I've never seen this before.

191
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,294
What the hell?

192
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,132
Wow.

193
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,509
My phone is dead.

194
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,587
The whole block is dark.

195
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,933
- My God.
- They're beautiful.

196
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,306
This isn't normal, bud.

197
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,771
Holy shit.

198
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
Nat.

199
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,983
Look at that.

200
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,784
Sean, you see that?

201
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,286
Whoa.

202
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,120
What's he doing?

203
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,177
Oh, my God!

204
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,306
Run!

205
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,188
Run!

206
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,743
- Go!
- Run! Run! Run! Run!

207
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,578
Natalie! Come on!

208
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
Stay together!

209
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,597
Lock it!

210
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,661
Run!

211
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,097
Move.

212
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,978
Come on! Come on!

213
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,563
Oh, my God.

214
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,238
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

215
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,535
Come on! Come on! Come on!

216
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,875
- This way.
- Go, go, go, go!

217
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,336
Go!

218
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,220
Holy shit! Come on!

219
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,560
This way. Come on!

220
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,691
Come on, come on.

221
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,693
Ben! Let's go!

222
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,244
Get in there. Go, go, go.

223
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,321
- Come on. This way.
- Annie!

224
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
Sean!

225
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,828
Come on.

226
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,763
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

227
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,057
Ben?

228
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,010
Natalie! Natalie!

229
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,055
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

230
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,936
- What are we going to do?
- He's dead.

231
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,600
It's okay. It's okay.

232
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,770
Oh, shit.

233
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,194
No! No! No! No!

234
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,570
Don't open the door!

235
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,407
Oh, God.

236
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,792
What do they want?
They're killing everyone.

237
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,994
They're shredding people.

238
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,545
- Did you see that?
- No!

239
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,040
- Quiet, quiet, quiet! Holy shit!

240
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,007
What is it? Where did it come from?

241
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,507
Annie, what's going on?

242
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,134
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

243
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,474
What the...

244
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,635
No, no.

245
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,937
It isn't safe up there. I saw it.

246
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,229
What the hell are those things?

247
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,807
It's like they're invisible.
We can't see them.

248
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,937
What's happening?

249
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,734
There's nowhere to go,
they're everywhere.

250
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,482
Everybody, be quiet.

251
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,376
Saturday

252
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,430
Sunday

253
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,263
Do you really think
that you're the only person down here?

254
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,347
Monday

255
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,977
Come on! Oh, come on!

256
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,688
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit, man!
I'm sick and tired...

257
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,619
Tuesday

258
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,624
This is it.

259
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,460
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

260
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,045
Yeah, like, the thousandth time is a charm?

261
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,134
How long since we've heard them?

262
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,270
I said 27 hours. Give or take an hour.

263
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,811
Unless you want to stay down here
pissing in tin cans forever...

264
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,105
Screw that.

265
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,739
It's time to go.

266
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,655
We're going to head to the U.S. Embassy.

267
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,055
Come on.

268
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,640
Careful, now.

269
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,782
Ben. Look at this.

270
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,575
They killed everyone.

271
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,243
It was a massacre.

272
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,037
We should go to the Swedish Embassy,
it's closer. We should really go...

273
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,250
Annie.

274
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,454
See if they have
any water, food, supplies.

275
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,046
Here, take these waters.

276
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,123
Grab that bag.

277
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,800
Just take what you can.

278
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,048
Take this. Go.

279
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,424
Holy shit.

280
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,051
Look at this place.

281
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,228
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,147
You think they're gone? Like "gone" gone?

283
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,478
All the ash.

284
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,818
Is it going to be like this
all over the city?

285
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,898
We can't be the only ones.

286
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,740
Do you even know where we're going?

287
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,490
I just wish we had a plan
that didn't come from some takeout menu.

288
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,583
Nobody's going to find us
hiding in the storeroom.

289
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,246
Stay here, or find your embassy.
Nobody's stopping you.

290
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
Jesus.

291
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,173
Let's go.

292
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,751
Come on, Annie.

293
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,587
It's a big city.

294
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,549
There has to be more people out there.

295
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,297
Slow down. Slow down.

296
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,882
- Oh, man.

297
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,966
- Shit. You okay?
- You okay?

298
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,017
Just wait, guys.

299
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,060
- Okay. I'm okay.
- Wait.

300
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,729
Come on, we got to keep going.

301
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,681
- Come on. Let's keep going.
- Natalie.

302
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,562
- Let's go.
- Come on.

303
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,113
Come on, hurry up.

304
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,659
Wait, wait, wait. This way, come on.

305
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,751
Come on, down here.

306
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,704
Is this the right way?

307
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,797
Quiet.

308
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,887
Hang on a second.

309
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,262
Wait, you hear that? Come on, this way.

310
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,768
What's there?

311
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,060
Wait.

312
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,604
Come on.

313
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,606
- Hey! Hey, lady?

314
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,686
Go away.

315
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,363
You will bring ghosts with you.

316
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
Go away.

317
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,941
Novinskiy Street?

318
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,072
Everyone in the city is dead.

319
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,286
They will kill you!

320
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,534
What?

321
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,864
That way.

322
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,876
- Ben, keep moving. Let's go.
- Thank you so much.

323
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,874
Beware of the lights.

324
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,293
- What did she say?
- We're all going to die.

325
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,669
Oh, my God.

326
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,218
We don't know where they are.

327
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,385
It's okay.

328
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,429
Ben. This way, right?

329
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,015
Are we lost?

330
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,772
- God damn it, we're lost already!
- We're not lost.

331
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,770
Do you know where you're going?

332
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,147
Dude, are we lost?

333
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,901
No, I think once we cross the bridge...

334
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,908
Oh, shit.

335
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,137
This crew doesn't inspire confidence.
We don't know anything about them.

336
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,429
It's the best we've got right now.

337
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,599
There's another bridge right over there.

338
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,304
What's important is that
you and I stick together, okay?

339
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,512
- He's right.

340
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,972
Guys, come on.

341
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,228
It's back this way. Come on.

342
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,787
Stop, stop, stop.

343
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,589
- That cop car will have a better map.
- Yeah, yeah.

344
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,041
You guys wait over there. Let's go.

345
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,592
- All right.
- Okay, go.

346
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,158
What?

347
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,495
Come on. Hurry up.

348
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,879
Did you see that?

349
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,674
Give me that. You're taking too long.

350
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,835
We don't know these things can see or hear.

351
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,002
We know they kill.

352
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,975
- Road flares.
- Here we go.

353
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,552
It's all in Russian.

354
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,893
What did you expect?

355
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,104
We'll count off blocks from landmarks.

356
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,836
No! Wait. Get down. Get down.

357
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
Get inside!

358
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,595
Go, go, go.

359
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,073
Where did it go? Can you see it?

360
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,326
Can you see anything?

361
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,830
Shit!

362
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,682
- What are you doing?
- Something.

363
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,003
Is it gone?

364
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,177
I think $0.

365
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,408
Holy shit.

366
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,452
That was way too close.

367
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:02,950
Sean!

368
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,044
Hey, you waited.

369
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,668
Yeah, yeah. That's the plan, right?
Stick together?

370
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,590
Good. Thanks.

371
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,713
Did you see that dog?

372
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,469
It killed the dog. It killed the dog.

373
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,389
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

374
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,803
It's the wind! Stop freaking out!

375
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,847
What, me?
I'm the only one freaking out here?

376
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,274
This wasn't how I thought
my week would go either, all right?

377
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,147
I'm just trying to keep my freak-out
on the inside!

378
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,528
Let's cut through this way.

379
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,777
Shit.

380
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,404
Oh, my God.

381
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,973
Skyler. Come on.

382
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,731
The faster we get to the embassy,
the faster we get home.

383
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,029
"Home"?

384
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,692
You think there's "home"?

385
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,448
Everybody back home is dead.

386
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,830
- You don't know that.
- Of course they are.

387
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,666
All our friends, our families.

388
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,833
Say it's like this everywhere,

389
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,128
the five of us, we're here,
we're in Moscow, and we're alive.

390
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,461
Okay? I doubt we're the five
luckiest people on the planet.

391
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,086
Which makes for millions of survivors,
in other cities, all over the world.

392
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,848
It doesn't even matter any more.
Don't you understand?

393
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,142
I mean, we take one step outside
and we're dust.

394
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,849
We can't even see these things.

395
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,645
The way it lit up that cop car.

396
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,522
Electricity gives it away.

397
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,612
Street lights, headlights...

398
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,318
You're right.

399
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,865
Daytime is more dangerous than night.

400
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,443
We should go outside when it's dark.

401
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,463
- Warning devices.
- Good idea.

402
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,041
Not as dumb as I thought.

403
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,474
Looks like
the embassy is about a mile away.

404
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,562
Are you going to get it right this time?

405
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,652
Are you going to be less of an asshole?

406
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,536
I just want us to make smart choices.

407
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,327
Is that what you call
what happened at the club?

408
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,121
- Making a smart choice?
- Annie, don't.

409
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,041
I think we all want to be

410
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,257
brave in our own minds.

411
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,008
But the truth is that
you don't know who you are

412
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,228
until something happens.

413
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,351
And then you just react.

414
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,769
And I just...

415
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:21,028
I see these two seconds just playing
over and over and over again.

416
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,371
We need better clothes.

417
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,788
I got it.

418
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,333
What's the dress code
for the end of the world?

419
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,417
Jacket, no tie?

420
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,213
I'll come, too.

421
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,580
Hey, there.

422
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,215
Sorry, buddy.
I'm going to have to take this.

423
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,715
Sean!

424
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,932
Hey, wait. No.

425
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,184
- Are you crazy?
- Don't move.

426
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,370
It's okay. Come on.

427
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,163
They're inside.

428
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,210
- We were so close, why didn't it see us?
- The glass.

429
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,383
- It didn't see you?
- No.

430
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,885
I bet they sense
our bio-electromagnetic shit.

431
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,136
That almost makes sense.

432
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,216
How did you come up with that?

433
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,851
I don't know. Shark Week.

434
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,641
My money's on they see our electric pulses.

435
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,189
And the glass blinded it.

436
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,390
It's an electrical insulator.

437
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,809
You're willing to bet your life
on that theory?

438
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,814
We just did.

439
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,488
Come on.

440
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,065
Come on, come on. Let's go.

441
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,571
This way.

442
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,756
Oh, shit.

443
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,100
What did you expect?

444
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,388
What do we do now?

445
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,189
Where do we go?

446
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,943
Come on.

447
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,147
What are you... What do you...

448
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,310
What are you going to do with that?

449
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,655
I don't know. Feels good.

450
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,570
You know how to use that thing?

451
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,276
Yeah.

452
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,663
- Stop!
- Skyler!

453
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,709
Stop!

454
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,135
All right. I've seen enough.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

455
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,595
And go where?

456
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,551
Up.

457
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,057
God damn it, Sean!

458
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,646
We don't know what's up there.

459
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,816
Or where we're going, for that matter.

460
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,939
Listen, we need a better view.

461
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,022
Somewhere where we can see
what's going on. What direction's safe.

462
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,697
You guys want to get yourself killed?

463
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,529
Skyler, we should stick together.

464
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,911
Come on.

465
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,338
- Nat, I...
- Come on.

466
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,676
I got it down here.

467
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,959
Hello?

468
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,388
Budapest, 1230. Antwerp, 621.

469
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,012
- Are these times?
- Maybe.

470
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,263
Guys, look at this.

471
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,774
"Their electromagnetic bombardment
shorted our hardware."

472
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,773
"No missiles. No jets."

473
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,947
This wasn't just Moscow.

474
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,196
"Communications stayed up
for three minutes."

475
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:25,156
"New York, London, Paris, Tokyo"

476
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:29,209
"all reported invisible invaders.
Aggressive assault strategy."

477
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,999
Skyler was right.

478
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,044
There is no home.

479
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,218
- Not like we remember it.
- Oh, God.

480
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,263
"Hardware from the underground
survived their initial attack."

481
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,846
"We salvaged what we could,"

482
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,142
"hope to reconnect
with Antwerp, Budapest."

483
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,851
These aren't times.

484
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,432
These are numbers of survivors.

485
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,523
"We found an Emergency Action Message
from allies here in Moscow."

486
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,655
"Global HF frequency 4-7-0-9..."

487
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,497
What did the message say?

488
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,078
That's it.

489
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,171
Hey, check this out.

490
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,107
Oh, my God.

491
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,777
You said those things see electricity,
so turn it off.

492
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,699
- The bulbs aren't on.
- Wait.

493
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,660
What's he saying?

494
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,921
- Please, Sean, just turn it off, okay?
- It's repeating.

495
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,711
A message.

496
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,049
Please turn it off!

497
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:01,918
How is it working?

498
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,175
God damn it, okay?
Those things can see it, so turn it off!

499
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,255
Sean!

500
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,516
Okay.

501
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,386
- Jesus.
- It's okay.

502
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,765
Come on. Let's find <i>a</i> view.

503
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,487
Ben? Over here, check this out.

504
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,884
Holy shit.

505
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,176
We're surrounded.

506
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,307
Dead center.

507
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,856
What are they doing out there?

508
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,774
It's like they're
digging for something.

509
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,110
They mess with everything electrical.

510
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,399
They got to obey some sort of rules,
have some sort of purpose.

511
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,111
They came here with a plan.

512
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,487
What's ours?

513
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,202
There's more survivors.

514
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,829
We know they're out there,
we just have to find them.

515
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,383
Who is it?

516
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,004
Skyler.

517
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,137
What the hell is he doing?

518
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,677
Come on. We gotta stop him.

519
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,972
Wait, why?

520
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,808
The guy understands some Russian.

521
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,726
He can translate the message for us.

522
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,810
Be careful.

523
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,692
We'll be right back.

524
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,670
Oh, no.

525
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,384
No.

526
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,047
No.

527
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,554
No, no, no, no, no!

528
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,344
Sean!

529
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,688
Sean!

530
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,602
Sean!

531
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,853
No.

532
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,529
We have to warn them.

533
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,983
Now!

534
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,534
Skyler!

535
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,617
Skyler!

536
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,993
Get back here!

537
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,671
Wait, wait, I think I saw something.

538
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,799
Oh, shit. Skyler!

539
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,845
- Oh, Shit!

540
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,508
Ben!

541
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,718
Oh, shit.

542
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,305
- Look out!
- He's trapped.

543
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,900
Get out of here!

544
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,737
Run!

545
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,540
Sean, come on.

546
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,745
Come on. Right.

547
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,249
No!

548
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,770
Where's Skyler?

549
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,648
He's dead, he's dead. He's dead.

550
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,692
Oh, my God.

551
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,193
Oh, my...

552
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,067
I can't do this.

553
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,863
- Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
- No, I can't do this.

554
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,243
- You have to!
- All we're doing is buying time.

555
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,747
Look at this.

556
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,875
That's got to be what Skyler saw.

557
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,134
There's someone in there.

558
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,466
It's not that far.

559
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,594
The sun is about to come up. No way.

560
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,892
We can make it.

561
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,265
Sean, what is wrong with you?

562
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,064
After what just happened to Skyler?
That could happen to any one of us.

563
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,610
Listen to me! That person is surviving,
right in the middle of all this.

564
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
Whoever it is,

565
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,322
odds are they're going to understand
this message.

566
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,748
Let's go.

567
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,463
I'm not giving up.

568
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,679
And if I'm not giving up,
you're not giving up.

569
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,054
What are we waiting for?

570
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,488
- We're almost there, right?
- Yeah.

571
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,532
Hurry, the sun's coming up.

572
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,080
Come on. Through here.

573
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,232
Who the hell are you?

574
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,693
Do you want to die, assholes?

575
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,566
We saw the light.

576
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,412
Next time, knock.

577
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,085
Are your parents here?

578
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,005
I'm sorry.

579
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,256
It's okay.

580
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,592
I'm tough.

581
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,925
Come this way. Come with me.

582
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,768
Did you find one?

583
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,852
Yes.

584
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,618
Ah, good.

585
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,449
Sergei?

586
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,953
Quickly, we must close the cage!

587
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,691
Welcome, make yourself at home.

588
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,690
You're young...

589
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,777
...and young people make
rash decisions.

590
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,869
It's why you and
Vika are still alive.

591
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,245
We don't really understand much Russian.

592
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,496
Sean.

593
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,636
I turned on the light to attract survivors.

594
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,181
First the girl, then you.

595
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,469
I'm Vika.

596
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,268
That's DJ Lance Rock.

597
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,732
Who is this guy?

598
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,028
Mr. Sergei.

599
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,406
I think he's an electrician.

600
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,363
Or maybe a plumber.

601
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,907
Well, what is this?

602
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,364
Mr. Sergei calls it a Faraday cage.

603
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:13,577
The steel bars
ground external electrical currents.

604
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,129
The cage, it works.

605
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,340
You mean it keeps them away?

606
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,710
They can't smell us if we're inside.

607
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,836
It's a shark cage, bro.

608
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,889
Mr. Sergei thinks
they're made up of wave energy.

609
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,178
They are made up of
lethal wave energy.

610
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,563
That's why they're invisible to us.

611
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,897
He says they microwaved Moscow.

612
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,520
Burned everything out.

613
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,079
Hey, guys, the message.

614
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,749
Vika, you've got to listen to this.

615
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,752
It's repeating a broadcast or something.

616
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,296
"Captain Nikolai Ivanov"

617
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,217
"from the K-1-5-2 Nerpa..."

618
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,056
Oh, my God.

619
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,683
The Russian Navy.

620
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,099
A nuclear submarine

621
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,854
in the Moskva River.

622
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,440
They leave tomorrow morning at 6:00.

623
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,983
Shielded nuclear power.
An undersea Faraday cage.

624
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,409
Brilliant option.

625
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,738
You mean it can get us out of here?

626
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,580
We have to get on that sub.

627
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,618
There are more, with survivors.

628
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,712
One from the U.S., leaving Nova Scotia.

629
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,630
A British submarine
waiting in the English Channel.

630
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,134
We have to go when it's dark.

631
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,798
Gives us five or six hours.
Is that enough time?

632
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,303
It says they are in the
north end of the river.

633
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,058
It's deeper there.

634
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,481
You think we can cross the city?

635
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,643
Yeah.

636
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,489
Can you help me gather supplies?

637
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,990
Sure, kid.

638
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,787
I am not a kid.

639
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,493
Got it.

640
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,346
Come.

641
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,466
Let's go.

642
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,618
We're fine.

643
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,072
- You've done this a hundred times, right?
- Yeah.

644
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,119
Just close the cage.

645
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,034
Make sure it's locked.

646
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,521
Hurry!

647
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,491
What is this?

648
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,535
It's homemade.

649
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,947
It's a microwave projector.

650
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,659
Power comes from here,

651
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,586
and fires incredible microwave there.

652
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,006
It shoots microwaves.

653
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,631
A focused
and compressed microwave beam.

654
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,801
I calculate.

655
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,097
Enough high-density microwave
could break up their energy field.

656
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,840
And what will it do?

657
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,930
Knock them on their ass!

658
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,553
Like, kill them?

659
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:04,766
Slow, wound, kill, perhaps.

660
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,144
Just think, they're like wave energy,

661
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,860
and if we can connect their charge,

662
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,158
maybe we create a chain reaction.

663
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,115
Take a bunch out at once.

664
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,238
Does it work?

665
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,455
You fight fire with fire.

666
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,578
Precisely.

667
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:27,830
Drink coffee.

668
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,010
The world's first alien killer.

669
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,508
This guy sings to his cat.

670
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,555
Yeah. But look at that cat.
So what do you think?

671
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,481
I doubt the hope of all humanity
lies in sketchy homegrown science.

672
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,559
Look, what if it works?

673
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,237
- What if it blows us all up?
- Yeah, but what if it works?

674
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,953
Vika.

675
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,428
Vika, the apartment's upstairs.

676
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,847
You won't make it.
I know where we can hide. Come on.

677
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,431
I'll take the cage.

678
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,021
No! Annie!

679
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,699
Annie!

680
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,033
Nat! Nat!

681
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,582
It's jammed.

682
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,380
Nat!

683
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,046
Nat, I can't move this table! I can't!

684
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,891
Eat this!

685
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,563
We did it!

686
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,037
Keep firing!

687
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,707
Hit it again!

688
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,125
Sergei!

689
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,831
Fire escape! Go! Go!

690
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,924
- Come on!
- No, don't!

691
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,677
Annie! Come on!

692
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,845
I can't! I can't!

693
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,612
Grab my arm!

694
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
Annie.

695
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:31,972
Mr. Sergei?

696
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,270
Where is Anne?

697
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,560
Come on.

698
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,119
Keep moving.

699
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,665
Hide behind us.

700
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,714
What the hell is this?

701
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:03,925
What the...

702
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,088
Run! Run!

703
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,155
Fire!

704
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,870
Sasha go!

705
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,090
Boris get ready!

706
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,050
Fire!

707
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,396
You don't like it bitch!

708
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,873
Welcome to Russia, sucker.

709
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,338
Thank you.

710
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,917
Americans.

711
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,502
Aliens bad for homeland,

712
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,260
but good for business.

713
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,796
What's that discharge?

714
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,589
Microwaves.

715
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,343
Like a big alien stun gun.

716
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,932
What is this?

717
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,738
When they generate their lightning,
their power drains.

718
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,241
Its invisible shield is weakened.

719
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,737
That's when we strike.

720
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,410
Sean, just leave it. Let's go.

721
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,247
We have dislodged fragments,
but we can only wound them.

722
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:55,995
Yeah, but their armor cracks.

723
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,414
Let's go.

724
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,416
I'm sorry about Anne.

725
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,887
Where are you from?

726
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,732
- Seattle.
- Ah, Nirvana.

727
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,559
Yeah.

728
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,946
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need.

729
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,564
I can train you.

730
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,367
Thanks, but we have to keep moving.

731
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,696
Where?

732
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,713
There's a submarine in the river,
it leaves in the morning.

733
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,708
It's joining others. One from the U.S.

734
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,000
Submarine?

735
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,800
- Yeah.
- And you believe that?

736
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,173
What's your name, son?

737
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,766
Sean.

738
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,311
You won't make it, Sean.

739
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,933
Why not? We made it this far.

740
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,107
No.

741
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,026
You made it as far as Academy Plaza.

742
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,237
And we made it here.

743
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,197
And we can make it further.

744
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,569
Okay.

745
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,159
- You want to go there?
- Mmm-hmm.

746
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:02,292
But these areas,
here, here, here and here, are overrun.

747
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,962
Enemy territory. You can't go through.

748
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,414
You want to go around, like this?

749
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,128
It would take five weeks.

750
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,676
If your luck hasn't run out.

751
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:16,257
You stay here, you eventually die.

752
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,601
This is our home.

753
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:23,347
When the enemy are this strong,
we can strike and run,

754
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,556
watching for weaknesses.

755
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,109
We return to camp, but we never retreat.

756
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,904
So, yes.

757
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,028
We'll die tomorrow, but today,

758
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,860
we will kill at least one of the enemy.

759
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,580
I'm sorry, we cannot help you.

760
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,699
I know you think we don't have a chance,

761
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,497
but we have to try.

762
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,626
This isn't our home.

763
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,845
Sean's right, we have to try.

764
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,727
You know what? You're right.

765
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,481
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

766
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,777
But what the hell is the point in saving
people if you don't see them home?

767
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,196
Your mission is to dig in here

768
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,650
so you can die in a slightly different way?

769
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,825
Here's our mission.

770
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,153
We're going to get on that submarine,

771
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,490
get together with whatever other survivors
might be out there,

772
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,833
and fight the hell back.

773
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,997
So why don't we get on that sub

774
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,253
and get you and your men
some real weapons?

775
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,677
Instead of settling for this.

776
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,681
I'm coming with you.

777
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,270
They are kids...

778
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,907
Hey!

779
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,780
We'll use the metro.

780
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,159
It's our best shot.

781
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,288
You have command
until we get back.

782
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,729
That's nice work back there.

783
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,101
That was all Natalie.

784
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,741
Are you guys hearing that?

785
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,411
Sasha.

786
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,305
Onwards.

787
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,141
Are you sure?

788
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,364
Come on! Down to the tracks!

789
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,785
Oh, my...

790
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,624
Stay low!

791
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:32,790
- Ben!
- Vika!

792
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,496
What is that?

793
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,086
Oh, my God.

794
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,339
Ben, what are you doing?

795
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,012
Be careful.

796
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,222
Vika, come on.

797
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,982
Oh, my God. Ben!

798
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,400
- No!
- Shit!

799
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,480
No!

800
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,110
- Sean!
- Ben!

801
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,201
No!

802
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,081
Sean.

803
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,752
We have to go.

804
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,587
Come on.

805
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,546
Which way? Which way?

806
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,178
On that boat.

807
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,430
The river ﬂows north.

808
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,179
We will drift to the submarine.

809
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,482
Get below.

810
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,520
Hey.

811
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,694
It's okay.

812
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,156
It's okay. It's not your fault.

813
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,647
Our moms

814
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,268
were on PTA together.

815
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,691
He was in the smart class.

816
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,816
His mom made him play with me.

817
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,829
I sort of never got over it.

818
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,170
I'm thinking we should say goodbye.

819
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:12,672
What?

820
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,517
I never got a chance to say it to Ben.

821
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,729
Okay. Well,

822
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,321
I'll be seeing you around.

823
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,698
Yeah.

824
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:36,904
Give me your hand.

825
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:41,455
What's happening?

826
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,660
We've run aground.

827
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,043
Oh, my God.

828
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:56,053
This is why they came.
We're just in the way.

829
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,387
What do they want?

830
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,302
We are mineral-rich.

831
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,019
Copper, nickel.

832
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,015
Metals that conduct electricity.

833
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,315
It must be food.

834
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,023
There it is!

835
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,408
The submarine.

836
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,236
We're going to make it.

837
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,825
We're going to make it. It's our way out.

838
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:27,747
What is it?

839
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,547
Shit.

840
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,466
Sean!

841
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,964
Sean!

842
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,470
Natalie?

843
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,478
Natalie!

844
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,431
Natalie!

845
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,308
Sean, swim!

846
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,525
Natalie!

847
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,826
Swim, now! Swim!

848
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,381
Here, give me your hand.

849
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,838
Come on, son. Come on.

850
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:04,014
There's someone else out there.

851
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,722
Her name's Natalie.
She must have swam ashore upriver.

852
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,102
I watched your boat go over.

853
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,859
I don't want to lose this one.
We can't wait any longer.

854
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,935
I won't leave her.

855
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,693
I had orders
not to depart without survivors.

856
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,274
- Now we have to sail.
- Whose orders?

857
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,695
Captain Nikolai Ivanov.

858
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,069
- I'll speak to him. Where is he?
- Dead.

859
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:26,915
Flares!

860
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,501
That's her. That's Natalie.

861
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,800
Look, I'm not asking you
to go out there, okay?

862
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,252
Just to delay your departure.

863
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,757
This area is infested!

864
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,679
I'm sorry,
but her chances for survival are not good.

865
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,849
Look, she knows how to hide. Trust me.

866
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,096
You go back out there, your chances...

867
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,223
He knows what his chances are.

868
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,645
We've all lost comrades.

869
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,560
She's alive.

870
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,816
And right now, every one of us count.

871
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,894
We can't leave her.

872
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,197
If she was one of yours,
you'd want the same.

873
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,399
Okay.

874
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,699
Okay. Let's get under
and make a battle plan.

875
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,614
The new gun is almost ready.

876
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,746
The extra microwave gun
gives us a chance.

877
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,832
The man who built it...

878
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,755
...thought we could microwave
their invisible shield.

879
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:16,670
But to "F" them up,

880
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,213
Mr. Sergei said
that we need much more power.

881
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,048
More batteries will launch a stronger beam.

882
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,384
You will get four or five good shots at it.

883
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,185
We need to wrap the power packs
so they don't short out.

884
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,689
Get the lead blankets
out of radiation...

885
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:32,936
Hurry!

886
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,769
The microwave guns
disrupt their defense shields.

887
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,730
And then we kill it.

888
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,449
With good ol' Russian bullets.

889
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,661
We get to where the
flares were fired, here,

890
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,282
find the girl and get out.

891
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,248
I'll take Sasha's place!

892
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,873
Boris and me. Yuri and Sean.

893
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,292
Microwave guns lead.

894
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,247
Her flares came from that direction.

895
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,673
There is not much cover.

896
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,252
Natalie!

897
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,169
Natalie!

898
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,568
It's not working.

899
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,242
Let's go.

900
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,089
Six o'clock! Spread out!

901
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,087
Come on!

902
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:21,767
Shoot it!

903
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,274
Come on.

904
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:42,830
Kill it!

905
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:57,811
The stun gun, it works!

906
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,275
Yeah!

907
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,351
Sean.

908
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,322
Sean!

909
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,988
Natalie.

910
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,987
Eight o'clock.

911
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,743
There's too many.

912
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,826
Our guns won't last.

913
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,744
Follow me.

914
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,217
It's water.

915
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,012
It will connect its charge
and create a chain reaction.

916
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,089
You are certain?

917
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,924
Wait until they're over the water
to fire the microwave gun.

918
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,093
Take the flanks!

919
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,848
I'll get Natalie.

920
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,074
Prepare to fight!

921
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,717
They stopped before the water.

922
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,883
The plan is not working.

923
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,270
- Natalie?
- Sean!

924
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,056
Bus 19!

925
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,933
Be careful. They're out there.

926
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:41,825
It's Vika!
Vika, what are you doing?

927
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,034
Where did she come from?

928
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,210
It's working. They're over the water.

929
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,171
We can beat them!

930
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,110
Natalie!

931
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,610
Sean!

932
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,782
You came back for me.

933
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:24,950
Of course I did.

934
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,059
Sean!

935
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:53,650
Sean!

936
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:01,987
Get the wheel!

937
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,119
I can't stop it!

938
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,379
Hold on!

939
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,181
- Shoot it again!
- It's not working!

940
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,137
Sean!

941
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,597
The battery is dead!

942
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,575
Sean!

943
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,786
Come on. Let's go.

944
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:32,833
We did it. Let's go.
We got them for now.

945
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,788
Let's get out of here.

946
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,673
Come on.

947
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,557
Are you sure you're not coming?

948
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,982
Hell, we got a nuclear submarine.

949
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,229
Today, we learned how to fight.

950
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,532
Go, and teach the others what we know.

951
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,280
This is the last day of the extermination,

952
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,954
and the first day of war.

953
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,081
No changing your mind?

954
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,294
I can go no further.

955
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,168
I have Moscow at my back.

956
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,234
- There you are.
- Did you get it?

957
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,115
Yes, I replaced the damaged parts.

958
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,492
It will work inside the sub.

959
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,713
<i>Here in London, I picked
up signals from others around the globe.</i>

960
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,638
<i>Europe, Asia, the States.</i>

961
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,765
<i>There are people fighting back.</i>

962
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,803
<i>I even had contact with a militia group
out of Paris.</i>

963
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,730
<i>They took down
one of those mining towers.</i>

964
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,806
They destroyed a tower.

965
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,312
<i>I've been hearing all types of stories.</i>

966
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,268
<i>I've got them here on tape.</i>

967
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:04,901
<i>Toronto, Lima, Peru, Berlin and Shanghai...</i>

968
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,653
This is how it starts.

969
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,484
<i>We will rise against.</i>

970
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,821
<i>Even though we don't know
where we should begin.</i>

971
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,999
<i>Even though we can't see
around the bend.</i>

972
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:19,044
<i>Oh, we know, we know
that we will rise again.</i>

973
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,918
<i>We will rise against.</i>

974
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,297
<i>Even though we don't know
where we should begin.</i>

976
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:33,676
<i>Oh, we know, we know
that we will rise again.</i>

977
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:52,115
<i>We will rise against.</i>

978
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,414
<i>Even though we don't know
where we should begin.</i>

<i>Even though we can't see
around the bend.</i>

980
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:03,293
<i>Oh, we know, we know
that we will rise again.</i>

981
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,715
<i>We will rise against.</i>

<i>Even though we don't know

01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,887
