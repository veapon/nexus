先生  你能把那個關掉嗎

它會干擾到飛機的導航系統

10
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,330
因為人們在上機前
Because people have been talking

11
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,790
已經談論過乘務員的話是否可信
outside the flight attendant social circle of trust,

12
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,250
結果是  沒人相信她們
and word is that nobody really believes that.

13
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,420
原諒我的朋友  他小時候腦袋給門夾了
Excuse my friend. He was dropped on his head as a child.

14
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,840
真的  如果真的那麼危險的話
No. If these were really that bad,

15
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,550
他們根本就不會讓你帶這些東西上來  直接否決
they wouldn't let you bring them on the plane, flat out.

16
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,800
如果你同意我的話  不用舉手贊同
If you agree with me, don't unfold your arms.

17
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
看到了嗎?
See?

18
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,560
哥們  你就非得在這時候玩多拉大冒險嗎?
Dude, do you really need an extra minute of playing Dora the Explorer?

19
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,400
水晶王國就快通關了
She was about to save the Crystal Kingdom.

20
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,400
怎麼回事?
What the hell?

21
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,880
剛才只是一次電氣短路
We just experienced an electrical short.

22
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,090
在你的右邊  平流層上部

23
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,760

24
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,550
不用過於擔心的
Nothing of major concern.

25
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,840
我討厭坐飛機
I hate flying.

26

不清楚  畢業典禮吧?
I don't know. Graduation?

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,330
你根本就沒參加畢業典禮
You didn't go to graduation.

30
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,200
出於相互支持  那天我還是有穿
But I still dressed up out of solidarity.

31
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,500
行了  給我支油性筆
All right, give me a Sharpie.

32
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,960
總有一天  我不會帶它在身上的
One of these days, I'm not going to have a Sharpie in my bag.

33
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,050
-又挖苦我? -沒錯
-Another poignant metaphor for me? -Yes.

to find the hottest bars and clubs in cities around the world.

37
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420

Our expansion plans for Moscow...

38
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,170

你神遊去了?

這次來莫斯科的擴展計劃包括爛醉  濫交
Our expansion plans for Moscow include getting drunk, laid

41
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,140
最後免費參觀俄國監獄  一切只需輕點鼠標
and ending up in a Russian prison, all at the click of a button.

42
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,730
是我的問題  還是這些斯拉夫語看起來像克林貢語
Is it just me, or does Cyrillic look like Klingon?

43
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,310
拜託  你認真點
Dude, get serious for a second.

44
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,560
我剛看到"明星酒吧"了
Come on, man. I found that freaky Zvezda joint

45
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,190
我們這次肯定能凱旋而歸
we're going to hit up for our victory lap.

46
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,190
"超模們為軟體設計師神魂顛倒"
"Supermodels desperately seeking software designers."

47
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,110
這主意不錯
That's a good idea.

48
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
等俄國佬想分一杯羹時
And when the Russians go for this,

49
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,530

52
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,710
我飛了半個地球  可不是來看美國人的
I didn't fly halfway around the world to see Americans.

53
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,790
領她去"蘋果蜂"(美國連鎖餐廳)
Tell her to go to Applebee's.

54
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,800

-Ben? -怎麼了
-Ben? -Yeah?

56
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,760

57
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,800
有
Yeah.

我們會讓Skyler做產品介紹

團隊合作  所向披靡
Teamwork makes the dream work.

62
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
真是太扯了
That's ridiculous.

63
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,800
夥計們  你們來這兒幹嘛?
Whoa, guys. What are you doing here?

64
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,880
沒收到我發的郵件嗎
Didn't you get my e-mail?

65
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,800
我們不需要你們了
We won't be needing you.

66

等等  我兄弟為了這個項目  花了差不多1萬2
Hang on. My boy just spent, like, 12 grand to develop this.

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,310
還得加上機票錢
Plus, flights.

68
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,940
沒錯  怎麼回事  這明明就是我的創意

Yeah, I know. It's very good. It's almost perfect, thank you.

下次記得要簽保密協議
Next time, you send an NDA.

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,820
你一定是說"非混蛋協議"吧
You must mean the Non-Douchebag Agreement.

72
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,830
叫保安
Call security.

73
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,540
Skyler  你為什麼這麼做
Whoa, whoa. Skyler, why are you doing this?

74
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,580
這叫生意
It's business.

75
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,500
這是犯罪
It's criminal.

Nat, his friend is wearing a Snuggie with a bolo tie.

Yeah, if I end up some human lampshade in this guy's creepy basement...

95
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,990
?I like the Gucci, Gucci I like the dollar bill?

96
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,580

I mean, you come out here,

123

everybody out here is like hungry wolves, and you act like two little lambs?

124
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,020
難怪你們會被吃掉
Of course you're going to get eaten.

125

你可以把自己想像成一匹狼  這樣才能在夜媞帢o著
You may like to think of yourself as a wolf so you can sleep at night,

126
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,730
可事實是  你是個徹頭徹尾的賊
but the truth is, you're just a straight-up thief.

127
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,360
你得明白  這是生意
You have to understand, this is just business.

128

沒有哪個社會不存在酒精和信仰
No human society exists without booze or religion.

133

所以我信仰喝酒
That's why I drink religiously.

134
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920

277
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,810
整座城市全是這樣嗎?
Is it going to be like this all over the city?

278
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,890
肯定不只我們這些倖存者
We can't be the only ones.

279
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,730
你知道我們要去哪嗎
Do you even know where we're going?

280
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,480
我可不想看著外賣地圖就出發
I just wish we had a plan that didn't come from some takeout menu.

281
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,570
沒人會發現我們躲在儲藏室
Nobody's going to find us hiding in the storeroom.

282
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,240
留下  還是去大使館  沒人阻止你
Stay here, or find your embassy. Nobody's stopping you.

283
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
天吶
Jesus.

284
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
我們走
Let's go.

285
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,740
走了  Annie
Come on, Annie.

286
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
這是個大城市
It's a big city.

287
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,540
一定還有倖存者
There has to be more people out there.

288
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,290
慢點  慢點
Slow down. Slow down.

289
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,880
天吶
Oh, man.

290
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
你還好嗎  你沒事吧
-Shit. You okay? -You okay?

291
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,000
等等  夥計們
Just wait, guys.

292
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,050
-我沒事  -等等
-Okay. I'm okay. -Wait.

293
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,720
好了  我們要繼續走
Come on, we got to keep going.

294
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,680
-好了  繼續走  -Natalie
-Come on. Let's keep going. -Natalie.

295
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,550
-走  -快
-Let's go. -Come on.

296
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,100
好了  加快速度
Come on, hurry up.

297
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,650
等等  等等  這邊  快
Wait, wait, wait. This way, come on.

298
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,740
好了  一直走
Come on, down here.

299
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,700
是這條路嗎
Is this the right way?

300
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,780
安靜
Quiet.

301
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,870
等一下
Hang on a second.

302
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,250
等等  你聽見了嗎  這邊
Wait, you hear that? Come on, this way.

303
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,750
那是什麼
What's there?

304
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,050
等等
Wait.

305
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,590
快
Come on.

306
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
嘿  夫人
Hey! Hey, lady?

307
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
走開
Go away.

308
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,350
你會把幽靈引來的
You will bring ghosts with you.

309
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,430
走開
Go away.

310
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
諾維斯基大街?
Novinskiy Street?

311
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,060
城堜狾酗H都死了
Everyone in the city is dead.

312
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,270
他們會殺了你的
They will kill you!

313
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
什麼?
What?

314
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
那邊
That way.

315
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,860
-Ben  繼續走  -謝謝你
-Ben, keep moving. Let's go. -Thank you so much.

316
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,860
小心燈光
Beware of the lights.

317
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,280
-她說什麼  -我們都會死了
-What did she say? -We're all going to die.

318
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,660
天呀
Oh, my God.

319
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,200
我們不知道他們在哪
We don't know where they are.

320
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,370
沒事的
It's okay.

321
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,420
Ben  這條路對嗎?
Ben. This way, right?

322
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,010
我們迷路了嗎
Are we lost?

323
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,760
-該死的  我們迷路了  -沒有
-God damn it, we're lost already! -We're not lost.

324
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
你知道在往哪走嗎
Do you know where you're going?

325
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,140
兄弟  我們迷路了嗎
Dude, are we lost?

326
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,890
沒有  等我們過了橋
No, I think once we cross the bridge...

327
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,900
該死
Oh, shit.

328
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,120
這個團隊沒有希望  我們也不瞭解他們
This crew doesn't inspire confidence. We don't know anything about them.

329
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,420
我們還是走吧
It's the best we've got right now.

330
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,590
那邊還有座橋
There's another bridge right over there.

331
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,300
重要的是  你和我在一起  好嗎
What's important is that you and I stick together, okay?

332
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,510
他是對的
He's right.

333
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,970
夥計們  走了
Guys, come on.

334
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,220
往回走  快
It's back this way. Come on.

335
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,780
停下  停下
Stop, stop, stop.

336
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,580
-警車媟|有地圖  -對
-That cop car will have a better map. -Yeah, yeah.

337
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,040
你們在這兒等著  走
You guys wait over there. Let's go.

338
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,580
-好的  -好  走
-All right. -Okay, go.

339
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
那是什麼?
What?

340
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,490
快  加速
Come on. Hurry up.

341
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,870
你看見了嗎?
Did you see that?

342
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,660
給我  你花太多時間了
Give me that. You're taking too long.

343
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,830
不知道這些東西有沒有視覺聽覺
We don't know these things can see or hear.

344
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
只知道他們見人就殺
We know they kill.

345
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,960
-照明彈  -找到了
-Road flares. -Here we go.

346
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,550
全是俄語
It's all in Russian.

347
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,880
你還想什麼啊
What did you expect?

348
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,090
從地標查街道
We'll count off blocks from landmarks.

349
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,830
不  等等  趴下  趴下
No! Wait. Get down. Get down.

350
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
到堶悼h
Get inside!

351
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,580
快  快
Go, go, go.

352
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,060
它在哪  能看見嗎
Where did it go? Can you see it?

353
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,310
你看到什麼了嗎
Can you see anything?

354
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,820
該死
Shit!

355
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,680
-你在幹嘛  -總要做些什麼
-What are you doing? -Something.

356
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,000
走了嗎
Is it gone?

357
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,160
我想是的
I think so.

358
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,400
天吶
Holy shit.

359
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,440
剛才好險
That was way too close.

360
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Sean!
Sean!

361
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,030
你們等我們了
Hey, you waited.

362
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,660
我們說好待在一起的
Yeah, yeah. That's the plan, right? Stick together?

363
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,580
很好  謝謝
Good. Thanks.

364
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,700
你看見那條狗了嗎
Did you see that dog?

365
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,460
它殺了狗  它殺了狗
It killed the dog. It killed the dog.

366
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,380
等等  等等
Wait! Wait! Wait!

367
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,800
是風  別這麼害怕好嗎
It's the wind! Stop freaking out!

368
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,840
什麼? 只有我很害怕嗎?
What, me? I'm the only one freaking out here?

369
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,260
我也沒想到我的週末會是這樣子  好嗎?
This wasn't how I thought my week would go either, all right?

370
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,140
我就不把害怕表現出來
I'm just trying to keep my freak-out on the inside!

371
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,510
從這邊走
Let's cut through this way.

372
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,770
該死
Shit.

373
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,400
天吶
Oh, my God.

374
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,970
Skyler  走了
Skyler. Come on.

375
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,720
越快趕到大使館  我們就越快回家
The faster we get to the embassy, the faster we get home.

376
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,020
家?
"Home"?

377
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,690
你覺得還有家?
You think there's "home"?

378
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,440
家堜狾酗H都死了
Everybody back home is dead.

379
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,820
-你又不知道  -肯定是的
-You don't know that. -Of course they are.

380
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,650
所有的朋友  家人
All our friends, our families.

381
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,820
就算其他地方也是這樣子
Say it's like this everywhere,

382
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,110
我們5個在莫斯科  還活著
the five of us, we're here, we're in Moscow, and we're alive.

383
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,450
對嗎? 我們不是這地球上最幸運的5個人
Okay? I doubt we're the five luckiest people on the planet.

384
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,080
所以在世界各地  還有數不清的倖存者
Which makes for millions of survivors, in other cities, all over the world.

385
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,830
這又能怎麼樣呢  你不明白嗎?
It doesn't even matter anymore. Don't you understand?

386
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,130
走錯一步  就成灰了
I mean, we take one step outside and we're dust.

387
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,840
我們看不到這些東西
We can't even see these things.

388
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,640
剛才輛警車那兒
The way it lit up that cop car.

389
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,510
是電流把它驅走了
Electricity gives it away.

390
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,600
還有路燈  車燈
Street lights, headlights...

391
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,310
沒錯
You're right.

392
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,850
白天比晚上更危險
Daytime is more dangerous than night.

393
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,440
我們應該在天黑時行動
We should go outside when it's dark.

394
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,450
-用來做警告  -好主意
-Warning devices. -Good idea.

395
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,040
你沒我想的那麼蠢
Not as dumb as I thought.

396
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,470
大使館應該只有一里遠了
Looks like the embassy is about a mile away.

397
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,560
你這次能領對路嗎
Are you going to get it right this time?

398
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,640
你能不能別這麼混蛋了
Are you going to be less of an asshole?

399
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,520
我只是想選一個明智的建議
I just want us to make smart choices.

400
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,320
你這麼稱呼夜店發生的事情嗎?
Is that what you call what happened at the club?

401
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,110
-做明智的選擇  -Annie  不要
-Making a smart choice? -Annie, don't.

402
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,030
我想  內心
I think we all want to be

403
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,250
我們都想做個勇敢的人
brave in our own minds.

404
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,000
可真相是  直到大事臨頭
But the truth is that you don't know who you are

405
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,210
你根本不知道自己是什麼
until something happens.

406
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,340
接著便是本能反應
And then you just react.

407
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,760
我只是...
And I just...

408
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,020
那些畫面在我腦海一遍遍重複
I see these two seconds just playing over and over and over again.

409
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,360
我們需要更好衣服
We need better clothes.

410
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,780
我去弄
I got it.

411
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,330
世界末日的  該穿什麼衣服
What's the dress code for the end of the world?

412
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,410
夾克不打領帶?
Jacket, no tie?

413
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,210
我也去
I'll come, too.

414
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,570
哥們
Hey, there.

415
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,210
抱歉啊  老兄  這件我得拿走
Sorry, buddy. I'm going to have to take this.

416
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,710
Sean!
Sean!

417
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
等等  不要
Hey, wait. No.

418
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,170
-你瘋了嗎  -別動
-Are you crazy? -Don't move.

419
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,360
沒事了  我們走
It's okay. Come on.

420
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
他們來了
They're inside.

421
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,200
-我們離這麼近  它為什麼沒看到我們  -因為燈泡
-We were so close, why didn't it see us? -The glass.

422
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,370
-它沒看到你嗎  -沒
-It didn't see you? -No.

423
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,880
它們應該可以察覺到生物電磁場之類的玩意
I bet they sense our bio-electromagnetic shit.

424
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,130
有些道理
That almost makes sense.

425
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,210
你怎麼想到的?
How did you come up with that?

426
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,840
我也不知道  探索頻道《鯊魚周》上面說的
I don't know. Shark Week.

427
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,630
我打賭它們看的到我們的電脈衝
My money's on they see our electric pulses.

428
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,180
燈泡把它屏蔽了
And the glass blinded it.

429
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,380
就像電流絕緣體
It's an electrical insulator.

430
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,800
你願意拿命去賭一把你的理論嗎
You're willing to bet your life on that theory?

431
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,810
我們剛驗證了
We just did.

432
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,470
我們走
Come on.

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,060
快  我們走
Come on, come on. Let's go.

434
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,560
這邊
This way.

435
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,750
該死
Oh, shit.

436
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,090
你還想什麼呢
What did you expect?

437
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,380
現在怎麼辦
What do we do now?

438
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,180
現在去哪
Where do we go?

439
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,930
快
Come on.

440
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
你要  你要幹什麼
What are you... What do you...

441
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,310
你打算拿它幹什麼
What are you going to do with that?

442
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,640
不知道  感覺挺好
I don't know. Feels good.

443
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,560
你知道怎麼用嗎?
You know how to use that thing?

444
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,270
知道
Yeah.

445
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,650
-停下  -Skyler
-Stop! -Skyler!

446
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,700
停下
Stop!

447
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,130
好了  我看夠了  我們還是走吧
All right. I've seen enough. Let's just get the hell out of here.

448
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,590
往哪走?
And go where?

449
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,550
往上
Up.

450
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,050
該死的  Sean
God damn it, Sean!

451
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,630
天知道上面會有什麼
We don't know what's up there.

452
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,800
照你這麼說  我們該去哪
Or where we're going, for that matter.

453
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,930
聽著  我們需要更好的視野
Listen, we need a better view.

454
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,020
一個能看到全局的地方  哪個方向安全
Somewhere where we can see what's going on. What direction's safe.

455
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,680
你們不要命了嗎?
You guys want to get yourself killed?

456
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,520
Skyler  我們該待在一起
Skyler, we should stick together.

457
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,900
過來
Come on.

458
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,320
-Nat  我... -走吧
-Nat, I... -Come on.

459
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,660
我留在下面
I got it down here.

460
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,950
有人嗎?
Hello?

461
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,380
布達佩斯1230  安特衛普621
Budapest, 1230. Antwerp, 621.

462
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,010
-這是時間嗎  -可能吧
-Are these times? -Maybe.

463
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
夥計們  看這個
Guys, look at this.

464
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,760
電磁轟炸使得我們的硬體短路
"Their electromagnetic bombardment shorted our hardware.

465
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,760
不是導彈  不是戰機
"No missiles. No jets."

466
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,930
不只是莫斯科
This wasn't just Moscow.

467
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,190
通信只保持了3分鐘
"Communications stayed up for three minutes.

468
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,150
紐約  倫敦  巴黎  東京
"New York, London, Paris, Tokyo

469
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,190
均報道稱  遭遇無形入侵者猛烈攻擊
"all reported invisible invaders. Aggressive assault strategy."

470
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,990
Skyler說的對
Skyler was right.

471
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,030
無家可歸了
There is no home.

472
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,200
-我好像不記得了  -天吶
-Not like we remember it. -Oh, God.

473
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,250
地下的硬體躲過了它們的首輪攻擊
"Hardware from the underground survived their initial attack.

474
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,830
我們盡可能的挽救了一切
"We salvaged what we could,

475
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,130
希望能與安特衛普重新取得聯繫  布達佩斯
"hope to reconnect with Antwerp, Budapest."

476
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,840
這些不是時間
These aren't times.

477
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,430
而是倖存人數
These are numbers of survivors.

478
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,520
我們收到莫斯科同盟的緊急行動信息
"We found an Emergency Action Message from allies here in Moscow.

479
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,640
全球HF頻率4-7-0-9...
"Global HF frequency 4-7-0-9..."

480
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,480
信息婸﹞偵
What did the message say?

481
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,070
就這些
That's it.

482
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,160
看這個
Hey, check this out.

483
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,100
天吶
Oh, my God.

484
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,770
你說過  這些東西能看到電流  所以關掉好嗎
You said those things see electricity, so turn it off.

485
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,690
-燈泡又沒亮  -等等
-The bulbs aren't on. -Wait.

486
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,650
上面說什麼
What's he saying?

487
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,910
-拜託  Sean  關掉好嗎  -在重複
-Please, Sean, just turn it off, okay? -It's repeating.

488
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,700
一條信息
A message.

489
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,040
求你關掉!
Please turn it off!

490
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,910
這是如何工作的?
How is it working?

491
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,170
該死的  這些東西能看到的  關掉好嗎?
God damn it, okay? Those things can see it, so turn it off!

492
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,250
Sean!
Sean!

493
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,500
好了
Okay.

494
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,380
-天啊  -好了
-Jesus. -It's okay.

495
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,760
好了  我們去找視野
Come on. Let's find a view.

496
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,480
Ben? 這邊  來  看
Ben? Over here, check this out.

497
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,870
天吶
Holy shit.

498
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,170
我們被包圍了
We're surrounded.

499
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,300
死亡中心
Dead center.

500
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,840
他們在那兒幹什麼呢
What are they doing out there?

501
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,760
好像是在挖什麼東西
It's like they're digging for something.

502
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,100
他們破壞一切電子設備
They mess with everything electrical.

503
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,390
他們一定遵守著某種規則  有某種目的
They got to obey some sort of rules, have some sort of purpose.

504
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,100
他們是有備而來的
They came here with a plan.

505
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
我們的呢
What's ours?

506
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,190
還有更多倖存者
There's more survivors.

507
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,820
一定有  我們得找到他們
We know they're out there, we just have to find them.

508
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,370
那是誰
Who is it?

509
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Skyler
Skyler.

510
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,130
他在幹什麼
What the hell is he doing?

511
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,670
走  我們得阻止他
Come on. We gotta stop him.

512
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,970
等等  為什麼啊
Wait, why?

513
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,800
他懂一些俄語
The guy understands some Russian.

514
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,720
他可以翻譯信息
He can translate the message for us.

515
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
小心
Be careful.

516
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,680
我們馬上回來
We'll be right back.

517
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,660

不
No.

522
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,520
必須要提醒他們
We have to warn them.

523
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
快
Now!

524
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,520
Skyler!
Skyler!

525
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,610
Skyler!
Skyler!

526
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,990
回來!
Get back here!

527
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,660
等等  我好像有看到什麼東西
Wait, wait, I think I saw something.

528
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,790
該死  Skyler!
Oh, shit. Skyler!

529
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,830
操
Oh, shit!

530
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,500
Ben!
Ben!

531
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,710
真該死
Oh, shit.

532
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
-小心  -他被困住了
-Look out! -He's trapped.

533
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,890
離開這兒
Get out of here!

534
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,730
快跑
Run!

535
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,530
Sean  趕快
Sean, come on.

536
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,740
快  右邊
Come on. Right.

537
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
不!
No!

538
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,760
Skyler人呢?
Where's Skyler?

539
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,640
他死了! 他死了!
He's dead, he's dead. He's dead.

540
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,680
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

541
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,180
天啊...
Oh, my...

542
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,060
我不能這樣
I can't do this.

543
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,860
-你能  你能的  -不  我做不到
-Yes, you can! Yes, you can! -No, I can't do this.

544
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,230
-你必須去做  -我們只是在爭取時間
-You have to! -All we're doing is buying time.

545
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,740
快看
Look at this.

546
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,860
Skyler看見的  就是這個
That's got to be what Skyler saw.

547
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,120
有什麼東西在堶
There's someone in there.

548
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,460
不是很遠
It's not that far.

549
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,580
太陽要升起來了  不可能的
The sun is about to come up. No way.

550
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,880
我們可以的
We can make it.

551
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,260
Sean  你怎麼了?
Sean, what is wrong with you?

552
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,050
看看SkyIer的下場  我們也會有同樣的下場的
After what just happened to Skyler? That could happen to any one of us.

553
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,600
聽我說  他還活著  就在我們中間
Listen to me! That person is surviving, right in the middle of all this.

554
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
不論是誰
Whoever it is,

555
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,310
他們肯定都會明白
odds are they're going to understand this message.

556
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,740
走吧
Let's go.

557
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,450
我是不會放棄的
I'm not giving up.

558
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,670
我都不放棄  你也要堅持下去
And if I'm not giving up, you're not giving up.

559
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,040
那我們還在等什麼?
What are we waiting for?

560
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,470
是的
-We're almost there, right? -Yeah.

561
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,530
快  太陽快升起來了
Hurry, the sun's coming up.

562
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,070
快  穿過這兒
Come on. Through here.

563
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,220
你到底是誰?
Who the hell are you?

564
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,680
你想死麼? 混蛋
Do you want to die, assholes?

565
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,560
我們看見燈光了
We saw the light.

566
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,400
下次記得敲門
Next time, knock.

567
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,070
你爸媽在嗎?
Are your parents here?

568
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,000
抱歉
I'm sorry.

569
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,250
沒事的
It's okay.

570
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,580
我挺得住
I'm tough.

571
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,920
來這邊  跟我來
Come this way. Come with me.

572
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,760
你找到沒?
Did you find one?

573
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,850
找到了
Yes.

574
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,600
很好
Ah, good.

575
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,440
Sergei?
Sergei?

576
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,950
快點  我們得把籠子關上
Quickly, we must close the cage!

577
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,680
歡迎光臨  請隨意
Welcome, make yourself at home.

578
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,680
你好年輕
You're young

579
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,770
年輕人就是很莽撞
and young people make rash decisions.

580
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,860
但這也就是你和Vika活下來的原因
It's why you and Vika are still alive.

581
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,240
我聽不太懂俄語
We don't really understand much Russian.

582
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,490
Sean
Sean.

583
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,630
我把燈光打開吸引倖存者
I turned on the light to attract survivors.

584
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,170
女孩先來了  然後就是你們
First the girl, then you.

585
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,460
我叫Vika
I'm Vika.

586
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,260
那個是DJ Lance Rock
That's DJ Lance Rock.

587
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,720
這傢伙是誰?
Who is this guy?

588
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,020
Sergei先生
Mr. Sergei.

589
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,390
我想他是個電工
I think he's an electrician.

590
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,350
也可能是個水管工
Or maybe a plumber.

591
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,900
好吧  這是什麼?
Well, what is this?

592
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,360
Sergei先生稱它為達拉第籠
Mr. Sergei calls it a Faraday cage.

593
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,570
鐵棒連接外部電流
The steel bars ground external electrical currents.

594
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,120
籠子就可以工作了
The cage, it works.

595
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,330
也就是說  他們不會靠近這個?
You mean it keeps them away?

596
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
我們在堶  他們就不能察覺到
They can't smell us if we're inside.

597
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,830
這可是個鯊魚籠  夥計
It's a shark cage, bro.

598
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,880
Sergei先生認為  他們是由波能構成的
Mr. Sergei thinks they're made up of wave energy.

599
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,170
是致命的波能
They are made up of lethal wave energy.

600
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,550
所以我們看不見他們
That's why they're invisible to us.

601
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,890
他說他們襲擊莫斯科
He says they microwaved Moscow.

602
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,510
燒燬了一切
Burned everything out.

603
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,070
夥計們  有消息
Hey, guys, the message.

604
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,740
Vika  你來聽聽這個
Vika, you've got to listen to this.

605
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,740
它是在重複廣播還是什麼
It's repeating a broadcast or something.

606
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,290
Nikolai Ivanov長官
"Captain Nikolai lvanov

607
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,210
來自K152Nerpa
"from the K-1-5-2 Nerpa..."

608
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,050
我的天
Oh, my God.

609
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,670
俄羅斯海軍
The Russian Navy.

610
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,090
有一艘核潛艇
A nuclear submarine

611
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,840
在莫斯科河
in the Moskva River.

612
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,430
他們明天早上六點出發
They leave tomorrow morning at 6:00.

613
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,980
屏蔽核電  是一個海底法拉第籠
Shielded nuclear power. An undersea Faraday cage.

614
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,400
很聰明嘛
Brilliant option.

615
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,730
你是說他可以帶我們出去?
You mean it can get us out of here?

616
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,570
我們得登上那艘潛艇
We have to get on that sub.

617
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,610
有很多倖存者
There are more, with survivors.

618
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,700
有一個美國人離開了新斯科捨
One from the U.S., leaving Nova Scotia.

619
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,620
一艘英國潛艇等在英吉利海峽
A British submarine waiting in the English Channel.

620
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,120
天黑得時候我們必須走
We have to go when it's dark.

621
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,790
給我們5到6小時  夠了嗎?
Gives us five or six hours. Is that enough time?

622
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,300
它說他們在河盡頭的北邊
It says they are in the north end of the river.

623
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,050
河的更深處
It's deeper there.

624
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,470
你覺得我們可以穿過城市?
You think we can cross the city?

625
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,640
是的
Yeah.

626
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,480
你能幫我一起收下東西嗎?
Can you help me gather supplies?

627
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:15,980
沒問題  娃娃
Sure, kid.

628
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,780
我不是娃娃
I am not a kid.

629
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,490
好吧
Got it.

630
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,330
走
Come.

631
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,460
走吧
Let's go.

632
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,610
沒事的
We're fine.

633
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,070
-你幹過幾百次了吧? -是的
-You've done this a hundred times, right? -Yeah.

634
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,110
關上籠子
Just close the cage.

635
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,030
確定鎖好了
Make sure it's locked.

636
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,520
趕快
Hurry!

637
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,480
這是什麼?
What is this?

638
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,520
自製的
It's homemade.

639
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,940
微波投影儀
It's a microwave projector.

640
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,650
能量從這堨X來
Power comes from here,

641
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,570
從那發射微波
and fires incredible microwave there.

642
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,990
它能發射微波
It shoots microwaves.

643
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,620
發射高能微波光線
A focused and compressed microwave beam.

644
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,790
我算過的
I calculate.

645
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,080
密度足夠高的微波  能夠打破他們的能量場
Enough high-density microwave could break up their energy field.

646
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
然後呢?
And what will it do?

647
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,920
打得他們落花流水
Knock them on their ass!

648
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,550
就像  KO他們?
Like, kill them?

649
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,760
慢慢的  先打傷了  然後殺了他們  大概是這樣
Slow, wound, kill, perhaps.

650
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,140
想想  他們就像波能
Just think, they're like wave energy,

651
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,850
要是我們能將他們的負荷連起來
and if we can connect their charge,

652
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,140
也就就能創造連鎖反應
maybe we create a chain reaction.

653
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,110
一擊斃命
Take a bunch out at once.

654
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,230
有用嗎?
Does it work?

655
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,440
這就叫以毒攻毒
You fight fire with fire.

656
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,570
對頭
Precisely.

657
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,820
喝咖啡
Drink coffee.

658
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,000
世界第一外星人殺手
The world's first alien killer.

659
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,500
這傢伙對著貓唱歌
This guy sings to his cat.

660
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,550
看看這隻貓  你怎麼想?
Yeah. But look at that cat. So what do you think?

661
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,470
我懷疑人類所有的希望  都寄托於科學
I doubt the hope of all humanity lies in sketchy homegrown science.

662
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,550
看  要是有效呢?
Look, what if it works?

663
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,220
-要是炸飛我們呢? -有可能  但要是成功了呢?
-What if it blows us all up? -Yeah, but what if it works?

664
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,950
Vika
Vika.

665
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,410
Vika房間在樓上
Vika, the apartment's upstairs.

666
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,830
不可能成功的  我知道有個藏處我們可以去
You won't make it. I know where we can hide. Come on.

667
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,420
我要去籠子那
I'll take the cage.

668
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,010
不! Annie!
No! Annie!

669

673
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,040
Nat  我移不開這張桌子! 移不開!
Nat, I can't move this table! I can't!

674
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,890
吃我一炮
Eat this!

675
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,560
成功了!
We did it!

676
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,020
繼續開火
Keep firing!

677
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,690
再揍他!
Hit it again!

678
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,110

繼續走
Keep moving.

689
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
藏在我們身後
Hide behind us.

690
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,700
這他媽的是啥?
What the hell is this?

691
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:03,920

697
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,390
好好享用吧  死玩意兒!
You don't like it bitch!

698
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,860
歡迎來到俄羅斯  倒霉蛋
Welcome to Russia, sucker.

699
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,320
謝了
Thank you.

700
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,910
美國人
Americans.

701
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,500
利用外星人侵略家鄉
Aliens bad for homeland,

702
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,250
倒是可以賺一筆
but good for business.

703
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,790
那個在放什麼?
What's that discharge?

704
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,580
微波
Microwaves.

705
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,340
就像外星人的電擊槍那樣
Like a big alien stun gun.

706
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:38,930
這是什麼?
What is this?

707
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,720
他們發光的時候也就代表能量用光了
When they generate their lightning, their power drains.

708
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,230
他的隱形盔甲就變弱了
Its invisible shield is weakened.

709
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,730
我們就壓抓住這種時機打他們
That's when we strike.

710
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,400
Sean別管那麼多了  走吧
Sean, just leave it. Let's go.

711
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,230
我們只有些碎片  所以殺不死他們  只能傷了他們
We have dislodged fragments, but we can only wound them.

712
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,990
但是可以打碎他們的盔甲
Yeah, but their armor cracks.

713
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,410
走吧
Let's go.

714
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,410
Anne的事  很遺憾
I'm sorry about Anne.

715
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,880
你們哪兒來的?
Where are you from?

716
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,720
-西雅圖  -好地方
-Seattle. -Ah, Nirvana.

717
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,550
是啊
Yeah.

718
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,930
有需要的話  你們可以一直呆在這
Well, you can stay here as long as you need.

719
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,560
我可以訓練你們
I can train you.

720
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,360
謝了  但我們不能停下來
Thanks, but we have to keep moving.

721
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:16,690
去哪?
Where?

722
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,700
河埵鹵智蝮  早上它就要離開了
There's a submarine in the river, it leaves in the morning.

723
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,700
我們要和同樣來自美國的人們匯合
It's joining others. One from the U.S.

724
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,000
潛艇?
Submarine?

725
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,790
-是的  -你們相信那個?
-Yeah. -And you believe that?

726
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,170
你叫什麼名字孩子?
What's your name, son?

727
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,750
Sean
Sean.

728
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,300
不可能的  Sean
You won't make it, Sean.

729
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,920
為什麼? 我們都努力這麼久了
Why not? We made it this far.

730
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,090
不可能的
No.

731
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,010
你們只走了差不多學會廣場那麼遠
You made it as far as Academy Plaza.

732
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,220
我們在這
And we made it here.

733
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,180
我們還可以走更遠
And we can make it further.

734
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,560
好吧
Okay.

735
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,150
你想去那?
You want to go there?

736
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,280
但是這些地方  這  這  這堻ㄓㄞ鄖咫F
But these areas, here, here, here and here, are overrun.

737
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,950
都是敵人的領地  你們不可能穿過去的
Enemy territory. You can't go through.

738
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,410
你們像這樣走?
You want to go around, like this?

739
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,120
那得要五個星期
It would take five weeks.

740
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,660
還要是走運的話
If your luck hasn't run out.

741
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,250
留在這  你會死
You stay here, you eventually die.

742
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,590
這是我們的家
This is our home.

743
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,340
我們打不過敵人  我們還可以回擊  甚至逃跑
When the enemy are this strong, we can strike and run,

744
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,550
照顧那些弱小的
watching for weaknesses.

745
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:28,100
我們回到原點  但我們絕不退縮
We return to camp, but we never retreat.

746
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,890
是啊
So, yes.

747
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,020
明天我們可能會死  但今天
We'll die tomorrow, but today,

748
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,850
只要我們還活著  就要斬殺敵人直到最後
we will kill at least one of the enemy.

749
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,570
抱歉  我無能為力
I'm sorry, we cannot help you.

750
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,690
我知道  你認為我們不可救藥了
I know you think we don't have a chance,

751
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,490
但是我們必須放手一搏
but we have to try.

752
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,620
這不是我們的家
This isn't our home.

753
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,830
Sean說的對  我們要放手一搏
Sean's right, we have to try.

754
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,710
你說得對
You know what? You're right.

755
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,470
要不是因為你  我們也不可能在這
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

756
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,760
要是不能在家看見同胞  那救他們有什麼用?
But what the hell is the point in saving people if you don't see them home?

757
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,180
你們的任務就是呆在這
Your mission is to dig in here

758
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,640
然後就可以死得不那麼痛苦
so you can die in a slightly different way?

759
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,810
而我們的任務是
Here's our mission.

760
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,150
我們得上那艘潛艇
We're going to get on that submarine,

761
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,480
和其他倖存者匯合
get together with whatever other survivors might be out there,

762
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,820
然後一起打回去
and fight the hell back.

763
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,990
為什麼不上去呢?
So why don't we get on that sub

764
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,240
再帶上些武器
and get you and your men some real weapons?

765
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,660
而不只是留下來打得不痛不癢
Instead of settling for this.

766
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,670
我和你一起
I'm coming with you.

767
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,260
他們還是孩子
They are kids...

768
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,770
我們乘地鐵
We'll use the metro.

769
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,150
這是最好的機會
It's our best shot.

770
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,280
我們回來之前  你做指揮
You have command until we get back.

771
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,720
真不錯
That's nice work back there.

772
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,090
都是Natalie的功勞
That was all Natalie.

773
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,740
你們聽到沒?
Are you guys hearing that?

774
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,410
Sasha
Sasha.

775
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,300
前進
Onwards.

776
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,130
你確定?
Are you sure?

777
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,350
快點! 到軌道下面
Come on! Down to the tracks!

778
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,780
我的...
Oh, my...

779
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,610
小心前進!
Stay low!

780
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:32,780
-Ben! -Vika!
-Ben! -Vika!

781
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:34,490
那是什麼?
What is that?

782
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,080
天啊
Oh, my God.

783
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,330
Ben  你在做什麼?
Ben, what are you doing?

784
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,000
當心
Be careful.

785
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,220
Vika  快來
Vika, come on.

786
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,970
天吶  Ben!
Oh, my God. Ben!

787
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,390
-不! -操!
-No! -Shit!

788
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,470
不
No!

789
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,100
-Sean! -Ben!
-Sean! -Ben!

790
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,190
不!
No!

791
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,080
Sean
Sean.

792
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,750
我們得趕緊走
We have to go.

793
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,580
快點
Come on.

794
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,530
怎麼走? 走哪邊?
Which way? Which way?

795
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,170
上船
On that boat.

796
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,420
河朝北邊流
The river flows north.

797
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,170
我們可以飄到潛艇那
We will drift to the submarine.

798
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,470
慢點
Get below.

799
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,510
喂
Hey.

800
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:03,680
沒事的
It's okay.

801
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,140
沒關係的  這不是你的錯
It's okay. It's not your fault.

802
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,630
那時我們的媽媽
Our moms

803
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,260
在家庭教師協會上遇到
were on PTA together.

804
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,680
他在尖子班
He was in the smart class.

805
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,810
他媽媽讓他跟我玩
His mom made him play with me.

806
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,820
我永遠都忘不了
I sort of never got over it.

807
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,170
我該跟你告別了
I'm thinking we should say goodbye.

808
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,670
什麼?
What?

809
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,510
因為我永遠也沒機會跟Ben這樣說
I never got a chance to say it to Ben.

810
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:23,720
好吧  那...
Okay. Well,

811
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,310
回頭見
I'll be seeing you around.

812
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,680
好的
Yeah.

813
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,900
把手給我
Give me your hand.

814
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,450
怎麼了?
What's happening?

815
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,650
我們擱淺了
We've run aground.

816
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,040
不是吧
Oh, my God.

817
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:56,040
所以他們來了  我們擋著路了
This is why they came. We're just in the way.

818
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,380
他們想怎樣?
What do they want?

819
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,300
礦產資源豐富
We are mineral-rich.

820
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,010
銅  鎳
Copper, nickel.

821
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,010
這些金屬都導電
Metals that conduct electricity.

822
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,300
他們肯定是吃這個
It must be food.

823
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,020
在那! 就是那個
There it is!

824
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,390
潛艇!
The submarine.

825
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,230
我們快成功了
We're going to make it.

826
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,820
我們快成功了  我們可以離開這了
We're going to make it. It's our way out.

827
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,740
這是什麼?
What is it?

828
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,540
該死
Shit.

829
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,460
Sean!
Sean!

830
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,960
Sean!
Sean!

831
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,460
Natalie!
Natalie?

832
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,430
Natalie!
Natalie!

833
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,300
Sean! 快游!
Sean, swim!

834
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,520
Natalie!
Natalie!

835
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,820
快游啊! 快點!
Swim, now! Swim!

836
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,370
快 把手給我
Here, give me your hand.

837
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,830
趕緊  孩子
Come on, son. Come on.

838
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,000
還有其他人
There's someone else out there.

839
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,720
她叫Natalie  她肯定游到了上游岸上
Her name's Natalie. She must have swam ashore upriver.

840
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,090
我看著你們的船走的
I watched your boat go over.

841
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,850
我不想你們少掉誰  但我們不能在久留了
I don't want to lose this one. We can't wait any longer.

842
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:12,930
我不會扔下她的
I won't leave her.

843
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,680
有命令說  我不能與倖存者分開
I had orders not to depart without survivors.

844
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,270
-我們現在必須起航  -誰的命令
-Now we have to sail. -Whose orders?

845
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,690
Nikolai lranov長官的命令
Captain Nikolai lvanov.

846
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,060
-我去和他說  他在哪? -已經死了
-I'll speak to him. Where is he? -Dead.

847
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,900
火光!
Flares!

848
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,490
那是她! 是Natalie
That's her. That's Natalie.

849
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,790
我不會叫你離開這的  好嗎?
Look, I'm not asking you to go out there, okay?

850
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,250
只是再等等
Just to delay your departure.

851
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,750
這個地方太危險了
This area is infested!

852
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,670
抱歉  但是她能活下來的幾率  實在太小了
I'm sorry, but her chances for survival are not good.

853
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,830
她知道該怎麼保護自己  相信我
Look, she knows how to hide. Trust me.

854
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,090
要是回到那  你...
You go back out there, your chances...

855
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,210
他知道他該怎麼做
He knows what his chances are.

856
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,630
我們失去了很多夥伴
We've all lost comrades.

857
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,550
她還活著
She's alive.

858
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,800
好吧  一個都不能少
And right now, every one of us count.

859
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,890
我們不能扔下她不管
We can't leave her.

860
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,180
要是她是你的夥伴  你也一定會這麼想的
If she was one of yours, you'd want the same.

861
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,390
好吧
Okay.

862
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,690
那我們藏到下面  準備個戰鬥計劃
Okay. Let's get under and make a battle plan.

863
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,610
新槍準備好了
The new gun is almost ready.

864
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,740
微波槍給我們增加了勝算
The extra microwave gun gives us a chance.

865
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,820
製造它的人...
The man who built it

866
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,740
儘管可以破壞他們的隱形盔甲
thought we could microwave their invisible shield.

867
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,660
但是要打死他們
But to "F" them up,

868
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,210
Sergei先生說  還需要更多能量
Mr. Sergei said that we need much more power.

869
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,040
足夠多的電池  就可以發射出強光
More batteries will launch a stronger beam.

870
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,380
可以開4到5槍
You will get four or five good shots at it.

871
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,170
我們要包好能量包  這樣才不會短路
We need to wrap the power packs so they don't short out.

872
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,680
把鉛毯子拿出來
Get the lead blankets out of radiation...

873
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,930
快!
Hurry!

874
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,760
等微波槍破壞了他們的防禦場
The microwave guns disrupt their defense shields.

875
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,720
我們就可以  用不可思議的俄羅斯子彈
And then we kill it.

876
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,440
殺光它們
With good ol' Russian bullets.

877
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,650
我們到有火光的地方開火  也就是這兒
We get to where the flares were fired, here,

878
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:46,270
找到姑娘後就出來
find the girl and get out.

879
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,230
我代替Sasha的位置
I'll take Sasha's place!

880
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,870
Boris和我  Yuri和Sean
Boris and me. Yuri and Sean.

881
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,290
拿微波槍的帶頭
Microwave guns lead.

882
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,230
火光從那個方向過來
Her flares came from that direction.

883
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,660
範圍不會很大
There is not much cover.

884
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:24,160
Natalie!
Natalie!

885
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,560
不管用啊
It's not working.

886
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:52,230
快走
Let's go.

887
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,080
6點方向! 開火!
Six o'clock! Spread out!

888
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,080
快點
Come on!

889
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,760
打他!
Shoot it!

890
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,260
給點力啊!
Come on.

891
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,820
殺了它!
Kill it!

892
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,800
電擊槍有用!
The stun gun, it works!

893
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,260
太棒了
Yeah!

894
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,350
Sean
Sean.

895
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,310
Sean!
Sean!

896
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:11,980
Natalie
Natalie.

897
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,980
8點鐘方向
Eight o'clock.

898
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,730
這兒有太多了
There's too many.

899
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,820
槍快挺不住了
Our guns won't last.

900
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,740
跟我來
Follow me.

901
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,200
是水
It's water.

902
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,000
水可以導電  可以產生連鎖反應
It will connect its charge and create a chain reaction.

903
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,080
你確定?
You are certain?

904
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,920
等他們過來就用微波槍
Wait until they're over the water to fire the microwave gun.

905
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,090
注意兩邊!
Take the flanks!

906
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,840
我去找Natalie
I'll get Natalie.

907
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,060
準備戰鬥!
Prepare to fight!

908
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,710
他們停下來了
They stopped before the water.

909
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,880
計劃不奏效
The plan is not working.

910
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,260
-Natalie? -Sean!
-Natalie? -Sean!

911
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,050
19路車!
Bus 19!

912
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,930
當心  他們在那兒
Be careful. They're out there.

913
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,820
是Vika! Vika 你在做什麼?
It's Vika! Vika, what are you doing?

914
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,030
他從哪兒過來的?
Where did she come from?

915
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,200
起作用了  他們在水的那邊
It's working. They're over the water.

916
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,160
我們可以戰勝他們!
We can beat them!

917
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,100
Natalie!
Natalie!

918
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,610
Sean!
Sean!

919
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,780
你回來找我了
You came back for me.

920
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:24,940
我不會丟下你的
Of course I did.

921
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:53,640
Sean!
Sean!

922
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,980
去掌握方向
Get the wheel!

923
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,110
停不下來!
I can't stop it!

924
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,370
堅持住!
Hold on!

925
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,170
-再打再打! -沒用啊!
-Shoot it again! -It's not working!

926
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,130
Sean!
Sean!

927
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:28,590
電池沒電了
The battery is dead!

928
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,560
Sean!
Sean!

929
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,770
快點  趕緊走
Come on. Let's go.

930
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,820
我們成功了  快走  我們鎮住他們了
We did it. Let's go. We got them for now.

931
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,780
快離開這
Let's get out of here.

932
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,670
快點
Come on.

933
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,550
你們真的不一起來?
Are you sure you're not coming?

934
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,970
我們找到核潛艇了
Hell, we got a nuclear submarine.

935
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,220
今天我們學會了戰鬥
Today, we learned how to fight.

936
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:01,520
以後可以去教別人拉!
Go, and teach the others what we know.

937
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,270
這是滅掉他們的的最後一天
This is the last day of the extermination,

938
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,940
也是戰爭開始的第一天
and the first day of war.

939
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,070
你還是這麼認為?
No changing your mind?

940
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,280
我們不能再走了
I can go no further.

941
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,160
莫斯科就在我的身後
I have Moscow at my back.

942
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,230
-給你  -那找到了?
-There you are. -Did you get it?

943
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,110
恩  我把壞掉的部分換了
Yes, I replaced the damaged parts.

944
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,480
潛艇媮晱i以用
It will work inside the sub.

945
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:46,710
這堿O倫敦  我收到了其他地區的信號
Here in London, I picked up signals from others around the globe.

946
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,630
歐洲  亞洲還有美國
Europe, Asia, the States.

947
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,750
人們正在反擊
There are people fighting back.

948
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,800
我還聯繫到了在巴黎的軍隊
I even had contact with a militia group out of Paris.

949
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,720
他們拿下了礦塔
They took down one of those mining towers.

950
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,800
他們破壞了塔
They destroyed a tower.

951
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,300
我已經聽說了各種故事
I've been hearing all types of stories.

952
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,260
都錄下來了
I've got them here on tape.

953
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,890
多倫多  利馬  秘魯  柏林和上海
Toronto, Lima, Peru, Berlin and Shanghai...

954
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,640
這只是開始
This is how it starts.

955
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,480
?We will rise against?

956
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,810
?Even though we don't know where we should begin?

957
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,980
?Even though we can't see around the bend?

958
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:19,030
?Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again?

959
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,910
?We will rise against?

960
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:25,290
?Even though we don't know where we should begin?

961
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,580
?Even though we can't see around the bend?

962
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:33,670
?Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again?

963
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,110
?We will rise against?

964
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,400
?Even though we don't know where we should begin?

965
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,780
?Even though we can't see around the bend?

966
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:03,280
?Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again?

967
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,700
?We will rise against?

968
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,870
?Even though we don't know where we should begin?

969
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,130
?Even though we can't see around the bend?

970
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:16,800
?Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again?

971
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,880
?We will rise against?

972
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,300
?Even though we don't know where we should begin?

973
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:25,720
?Even though we can't see around the bend?

974
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:31,140
?Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again?
