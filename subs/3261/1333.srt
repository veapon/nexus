1
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:17,443
1973年埃及和叙利亚突袭以色列

2
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,218
第二天以军地面部队快要溃败

3
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:34,887
由于以军处于劣势

4
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,724
于是派出一架A-4战机巡逻

5
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,361
还载有一枚核弹

6
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,621
29年后

7
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,113
美国弗吉尼亚韦瑟山

8
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,290
肯定是俄国人？    百分百肯定
- You sure it's the Russians?
- 100%, sir

9
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,756
潜艇有近15兆吨核武，准备出击
Submarine launched 12 to 15
megatons. They went to strike status

10
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,794
罗斯福号击落六枚巡航导弹
The Roosevelt's splashed
six incoming cruise missiles

11
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,025
俄军西移，我们在柏林势孤力弱
The Russians are moving west.
Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered

12
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,906
俄罗斯中部的艾耶斯克亦有威胁
Sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk,
CentrAL Russia

13
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,167
什么威胁？
What the hell is in Alyesk?

14
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,208
SS-18洲际弹道导弹
SS-18 ICBMs

15
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,008
目标是纽约、华盛顿和这儿
 Probable targets:
New York, Washington, here

16
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,775
天花坚固吗？    抵御不了直击
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit

17
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:56,284
卫星证实有战机，25分钟内施袭
Satellites confirm birds in the air,
first impact estimated 25 minutes

18
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,514
资料准确吗？    准确
- Is that accurate?
- It's accurate

19
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,853
一级紧急状态吧    联络索总统
- I advise we go to DEFCON-1.
- Get President Zorkin on the hotline

20
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,519
他不见了，接报莫斯科发生政变
Zorkin is missing. We have reports
of a coup in Moscow

21
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,565
现在由鲍上将掌权
GenerAL Bulgakov
is cALling the shots now

22
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,792
他究竟是谁？
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

23
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,665
那个想在车臣用核弹的混蛋
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya

24
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,413
进入一级紧急状态，时间无多
Sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time

25
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,593
动手吧
Do it

26
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,730
总统先生
Mr President

27
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,303
系统在你下令后一分钟才启动
It'll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order

28
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,806
下令前，要先核对身分
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed

29
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,274
数下来第五个号码就是
My ID number is fifth from the top

30
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,047
总统夫人在2104线    谢谢
- Sir, it's your wife on 2104.
- Thank you

31
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,722
请说    要有名单上的人士... 
- Yeah.
- The order must be confirmed

32
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,894
下令才能动手    可恶
- by someone on the approved list.
- Shit

33
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,590
国家安全顾问韦真
Gene Revell,
NationAL Security Advisor

34
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,359
要穿礼服？好，我马上来
Is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way

35
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,262
我们可否... 
Can we... 

36
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,475
改天才继续演习？
... finish this up some other time?

37
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,114
不可以
No

38
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,254
我们得更新这些演习程序
We've got to update these fire drills,
Billy

39
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,550
若有麻烦，我才不要躲到地底去
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not going underground

40
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,125
地底藏有一个核弹
It's a goddamn tomb down there

41
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,321
还要找人对付俄军以外的坏蛋
We have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the Russians

42
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:51,060
是吗？还有谁有27000枚核弹？
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

43
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,829
我是担心那个有一枚核弹的砘
It's the guy with one I'm worried about

44
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,439
我要派人去俄罗斯监察
I have to send some folks to Russia

45
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,703
他们在阿马沙斯解除核武的工作
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at Armazas

46
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,313
是阿尔扎马斯    什么也好
- Arzamas.
- Yeah, whatever

47
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,384
派你的手下去    我亲自去
- Someone from your staff should go.
- I'll go

48
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,021
比利，派人去    我想亲自去
- Billy, send staff.
- I want to go

49
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,325
好吧
OK

50
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,825
别低估老索
Don't underestimate Zorkin. 

51
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,625
俄国经济、罪案、车臣... 
Between
his economy, crime, Chechnya... 

52
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,199
他的肝    所余无几，他怎么样
- His liver.
- What's left of it. How is he?

53
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,839
今天有记者会，他应该能坐起来
He's scheduled a press conference
for today, so we know he can sit up

54
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,411
弗吉尼亚兰利，中情局总部

55
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,573
车臣是俄罗斯的一部分
Chechnya is part of Russia

56
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,111
只有罪犯和其西方朋友想它分裂
Only criminals and their friends
in the West who wish it to be separate

57
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,689
总统先生，请你回去... 
Mr President, if you will kindly
come back... 

58
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,821
你们有留意到吗？
Do you guys see what I see?

59
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,293
他的西装褛？    本来还扣到钮
- His jacket?
- He used to be able to button it up

60
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,333
他发福了
He's getting fat

61
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,904
我明白那种感受... 看这个
I know how he feels.
Oh, wow. Look at that

62
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,735
也许是另一件褛
Maybe it's not the same jacket

63
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,902
看衣袖，他上次出院时也穿这个
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it
the last time he got out of the hospitAL

64
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,641
他没节食    还开酒戒喝个大醉
- He's off the diet.
- And off the wagon. He sIurred... 

65
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,220
所以老卓在旁，以免他喝个不停
That must be why Cherlinski is there,
to keep him off the sauce

66
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,720
老卓在哪里？
Where's Cherlinski?

67
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,191
在... 她叫什么？那个棕发的女人
Next to...  What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair

68
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,365
雷莲娜    那不是老卓
- Elena Rishkov.
- That is not Cherlinski

69
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,332
错了，那是老卓
Bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski

70
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,764
你说的是老查，不是他
You're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him

71
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,064
那是老卓    不，相信我好了
- I know. It's Cherlinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me

72
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,677
他在莲娜旁边，还在日内瓦胡混
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva summit

73
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,848
老卓没去日内瓦，那是老查
Cherlinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was

74
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,449
老查跟雷莲娜有染？
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?

75
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,186
我只是说老索胖了
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight

76
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,222
为何老扯到性事？真讨厌
Why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting

77
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,723
我同意，记下这个... 若他胖了
I agree. Write it up.
If he is putting on weight

78
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,125
定会影响健康，下午简报写这个
that might have heALth consequences,
so get it in the afternoon brief

79
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,464
找人查是谁搭上莲娜，这有看头
Oh, and somebody find out who is
banging Elena Rishkov. This is good

80
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,337
奥地利，维也纳

81
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,171
车臣要求西方庇护是怎么回事？
What shall we make of Chechnya
asking the West for protection?

82
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,942
这就如漂亮处女想摆脱好色老头
She is like a beautiful virgin, escaping
the cIutches of a lecherous bear

83
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,450
跑去找克林顿帮忙保贞操
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood

84
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:29,659
俗语有云“天下乌鸦一样黑”
A poet once wrote, "Meet the new
boss, same as the old boss."

85
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:35,397
这也许适合套用在21世纪的欧洲
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21st century

86
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,661
五十多年来，美、俄一直... 
Over 50 years of America and Russia

87
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,671
将其意愿强加在欧洲社会上
imposing their will
on the European community

88
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,436
东、西双方
East and West

89
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,945
都还当我们是小孩
and we're still treated like children... 

90
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:55,216
但却没给我们玩具和糖果
... but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates

91
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,616
每一天我们都在失去更多... 
Each day we lose a little bit more

92
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,760
独立自主，决定未来路向的能力
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures

93
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:07,365
而每一天这世界亦更接近小蝴蝶
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment

94
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:12,731
拍动翅膀掀起大风波的可怕时刻
when the beating of a butterfly's wings
unleashes a hurricane... 

95
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,964
这个连老天也阻止不了
... God himself cannot stop

96
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,001
这究竟是什么？
So what is it?

97
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,977
你是盲的吗？
Are you blind?

98
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,579
是个炸弹
It's a bomb

99
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,581
那么信管呢？
Where's the fuse?

100
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,892
还是暖的
It's warm

101
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,992
我也是，赶快，时候不早了
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night

102
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,556
这是个哑弹
It's a dud

103
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,864
快搬它上车
Let's get it on the truck

104
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,127
但怎么把它卖掉？
But how can we sell it now?

105
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,897
总会有人买这种垃圾
There's ALways someone
who'll buy this crap

106
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,215
我最讨厌这些健康问题
I cannot stand all these questions
about my heALth

107
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:17,421
该形容我“精神爽利又健康”
I am to be described as
"robust" and "heALthy"

108
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,182
是你的还是我的？
Is that yours or mine?

109
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,148
一定是你的，我那个好看不中用
It must be yours. Mine's just for show

110
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,323
不是医院传呼我
It's not the hospitAL

111
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,428
你好    你还在这里
- Hi.
- You're still here

112
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:04,303
准确点说，应该是你还在这里
Well, I think to be accurate,
it's actually you who's still here

113
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,276
没错
Oh, right

114
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,613
我不是在抱怨
Not that I'm complaining

115
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,585
积克... 
Jack... 

116
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,726
我知道我们初相识，但是... 
I know this is new and all, but... 

117
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,390
我有话要说，实在忍不住了
... I have something I have to say
or I'm going to explode

118
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,329
我也不想吓怕你
I don't want you to be scared

119
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,101
什么事？
What?

120
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,437
你爱上了我
You're in love with me

121
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,379
我是医生，懂看病徵的
Jack, I'm a medicAL professionAL.
I can read the symptoms

122
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,956
你确实爱上了我
You're definitely in love with me

123
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,120
这个令你害怕？
And that scares you?

124
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,298
一点都没有
Not even a little

125
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,370
但你却害怕
But I think it scares you

126
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,005
一点都不怕
No, not even a little

127
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,634
话说回来，是你先提起这个
And for the record,
you're the one who brought it up

128
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,319
别管它
Forget it

129
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,546
我要接传呼    不，任由它响吧
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way. It'll stop

130
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,595
我不知道是谁传呼我
I don't know who this is

131
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,825
你谈你的公事    真扫兴
- Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks

132
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,332
你做你该做的，我会体谅
Do what you have to do. I understand

133
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,595
对，我是梅医生
Yes, this is Dr Muller

134
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,838
但你传呼我
Muller. You paged me

135
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,408
喂
Hello

136
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,473
别闹了！我是雷积克
Stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan

137
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,284
老天！
Jesus

138
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,687
好的，我在半小时内赶到
OK. I'll be there in hALf an hour

139
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,650
我要走了，工作上有急事
I gotta go. I have an emergency
at work

140
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,726
我要走了，对不起
I have to go. I'm sorry

141
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,731
卡丝，今晚一起吃饭好吗？
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

142
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,401
好的
Yeah

143
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,969
明晚呢？    别得寸进尺
- How about tomorrow night?
- Jack, I said yes to tonight

144
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,399
我知道
I know

145
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,804
历史学家会有什么急事？
What kind of emergency
does a historian have?

146
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,414
他在上午4时20分逝世
He died at 0420 Zulu. 

147
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,748
八个半钟后他们有了新总统
81/2 hours
later, they swore in a new president

148
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,082
他是谁？    尼艾历
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov

149
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,920
别说笑，一年前我以他大作文章
You're kidding. I wrote a paper
about him a year ago

150
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,292
说他会当总统    我知道
- I said he could be the next guy.
- I know

151
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,490
没人看过那篇文章    现在有了
- Nobody read it.
- They're reading it now

152
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,703
谁？    老卡
- Who?
- Cabot

153
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,531
我来了14个月，他从未见过我... 
I've been here 14 months.
He doesn't know what I look... 

154
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,238
你就是雷积克？    是的，局长
- Are you Ryan?
- Yes, sir

155
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,018
怎么回事？是便服日吗？
What is this? "The Paper Chase"?

156
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,723
局长...     快来，我们迟到了
- Sir, my... 
- Come on, we're late

157
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,300
你这是越级挑战，所以要听好
You're about to breathe air that's way
over your pay grade, so listen

158
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:22,030
我会问你意见，记得要小心说话
You'll be asked for advice. Be sure
you know what you're tALking about

159
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,469
不懂的就直说无妨
Don't be afraid to say you don't know

160
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,770
小心措词，那可能会成为政策
Choose your words carefully.
They could become policy

161
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,676
你脱下西装褛
Hey, you. Give me your coat

162
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,215
赶快，稍后还给你
Come on, you'll get it back

163
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,421
领带
Tie

164
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,133
是情报委员会？
So, intelligence committee?

165
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,236
我在电视上看过，但没参加过
I've watched these on C-SPAN.
Never actually been to one

166
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,168
你从未在电视上看过这场面
You've never watched
one of these on C-SPAN

167
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:23,696
最重要的线报源自克里姆林宫
Our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the Kremlin

168
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:28,168
线人认为俄军不太听老尼指挥
In his opinion, Nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military

169
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,365
人人都各有想法
Everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot

170
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,441
我尊重这一点
I respect that

171
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,911
今早我太太说我又老又丑
This morning, my wife woke up
and said I was old, bALd and ugly

172
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,846
那是提问吗？主席
Is that a question, Mr Chairman?

173
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,555
我跟她说外表不是一切
I told her
appearances aren't everything

174
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,624
你同意吗？    当然同意
- Would you agree?
- I certainly would

175
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:53,093
新总统叫莱艾历吗？
Now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz.
Is that his name?

176
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,027
是尼艾历
Nemerov, sir

177
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,637
虽是线报，但据说他是个强硬派
Despite what your source says,
we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner

178
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,932
真有此事吗？
Is he a hardliner?

179
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,472
不
No

180
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,406
这个言之尚早了
It's too soon to make that assessment

181
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,240
据CNN报导
According to CNN

182
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:16,479
尼总统承诺重建俄罗斯帝国
your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the Russian empire

183
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,452
于我而言，他太大口气了
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit

184
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,957
若我在车臣，那我还会更担心
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried

185
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,691
老尼只是说他会清除强硬派
Sir, Nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back

186
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,596
若我们不烦他，俄罗斯会更稳定
If we leave him ALone,
Russia will stabilise

187
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:36,297
我问你意见并不代表你可以开腔
When I asked for your advice, I didn't
mean that you should actually speak

188
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,806
卡局长？
Mr Cabot?

189
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:43,914
在俄国政府，了解老尼的线人
Some of our assets in the Russian
government who know Mr Nemerov

190
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,016
还没有机会更新情报
have not had a chance to report in

191
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,585
看来花多两天时间搜集更多资料
I'd like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you

192
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,188
才下定论比较好
before characterising him

193
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,327
但我仍然相信外表是可以骗人的
but I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving

194
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,788
那你是说我错了？
You're saying I'm wrong?

195
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,565
当然了，主席
Absolutely, Mr Chairman

196
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,800
我不觉得你样子很丑
I don't think you're ugly

197
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,904
刚才真失礼    参议员不爱惊喜
- I was out of line. I apologise.
- Senators don't like to be surprised

198
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,879
我会作暗示、表态，让他们适应
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then
I give them a while to get used to it

199
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,314
然后才告之真相
Then I tell them

200
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,819
我明白    好极
- I understand.
- Good

201
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,491
但老尼的事我说对了
But I'm right about Nemerov

202
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,424
你女朋友喜欢你这么固执？
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

203
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,566
什么？
What?

204
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,861
梅卡丝，第二年住院实习医生
Cathy Muller,
second year surgicAL resident

205
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,436
巴尔的摩纪念医院
BALtimore MemoriAL HospitAL

206
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,640
欢迎你加入中情局
Welcome to the CIA, sport

207
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:55,344
你的情报不够准，她不算是女友
Your intelligence is a little flawed.
I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet

208
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,888
那该是什么？    棒极了的女孩
- What exactly would you call her?
- Great. Amazing

209
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,923
她就是害怕承诺
She's just afraid to commit

210
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,754
他对承诺害怕极了
He's terrified of commitment

211
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,329
约会三次就讲承诺？真是大新闻
A man who's afraid of commitment
after three dates? Alert the media

212
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,592
我知道    他做哪一行？
- I know, I know.
- So what does he do?

213
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,203
他当过海军陆战队，因背伤退役
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back

214
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,840
现在是历史学家    闷蛋
- Now he's a historian.
- Yawn

215
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,671
不，他替一个智囊团做事
No. He works for a think tank
across the river

216
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,437
大闷蛋
Double yawn

217
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:27,642
丽达，等你今晚见过他再说
All right, Rita. Let's see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight

218
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,548
他... 
He's... 

219
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,121
英俊吗？
... cute?

220
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:37,955
手指很粗    卡丝，他有多帅？
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten

221
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,098
我不知道
Oh, God. I don't know

222
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,100
超英俊
Twelve

223
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,040
问他们从哪儿找到这个
Ask them where they found this

224
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,453
在哥兰高地
In the field, in the Golan

225
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,785
73年那儿常打仗，他们在场吗？
There was a lot of fighting there
in 1973. Did they witness it?

226
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,296
这老头说他儿子死掉了
This one says he lost his son

227
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,835
他记得有飞机被击落吗？
Does he remember,
was there a plane shot down?

228
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,241
有，以色列战机被毁
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed

229
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,820
这个不值钱
This is worthless

230
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:54,895
但我会给他四百元... 为了他儿子
But tell him I will give him $400... 
because of his son

231
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,748
多... 多谢
Thank... thank you

232
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,288
多谢
Thank you

233
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,450
叙利亚，大马士革
lt's not the sort of thing
you find lying around normally

234
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,128
你怎么找到这个？
- Absolutely not.
- How did you come by it?

235
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,200
在格拉斯哥古老大宅的阁楼
l found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in Glasgow

236
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:30,432
你这次找到值一千镑的宝物
Your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about $ 1,000

237
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:35,203
要是它比较完好，那会更值钱
even in this condition, and had she
been in better condition, even more

238
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,780
好一个发现
A jolly nice find

239
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:42,113
找到你要的，价钱五千万美元

240
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,854
年份是1973年，以色列制造

241
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:54,760
12型裂变弹

242
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,559
其实我以为找到一件花园摆设
ln fact, what l thought l'd found
was a garden ornament

243
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,811
是卡丝吗？
Hello, Cathy?

244
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,855
幸好你来电，我赶不及了
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late

245
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,687
你迟半小时来好吗？
Can you come a hALf an hour later?

246
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,528
我不能赴约，对不起
I can't make it. I'm really sorry

247
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:36,272
临时有急事    什么声音？
- lt's a last-minute work thing.
- What's that noise?

248
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,806
我在飞机上打电话给你
I'm cALling from a plane

249
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,971
我试过找你的    你要去哪里？
- This just came up. l tried to call you.
- Where are you going?

250
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,984
不便相告    积克
- I can't tell you that.
- Jack

251
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,019
你不便相告？
You can't tell me?

252
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,623
积克
Jack

253
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,589
慢着... 怎样？    你在做什么？
- Hold on. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

254
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,521
我要取消今晚的约会
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel

255
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:04,930
傻瓜，告诉她你为谁出差好了
Don't be stupid. Tell her where you're
going. Tell her who you work for

256
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,764
她会另眼相看
She'll be impressed

257
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,301
好吧，我是替中情局做事的
OK. I work for the CIA

258
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:19,280
局长要我陪他去俄国检查核武
The director asked me to go with him to
Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection

259
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,015
喂？    这藉口真烂
- Hello?
- That is so lame

260
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:28,750
我们真的去看他们有否解除核武
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure
they're decommissioning their arsenAL

261
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,762
喂？
Hello?

262
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,558
喂？
Hello?

263
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,599
真是感激不浅
Thanks. Thanks a lot

264
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,544
你好，卡比利
Zdravstvuyte, William Cabot

265
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,345
尼总统
President Nemerov

266
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,765
幸会，总统先生
Pleasure, sir

267
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,165
这是赖太太
May I present Mrs Lathrop

268
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,930
总统先生
Mr President

269
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,973
伦上将    总统先生
- GenerAL Rand.
- Mr President

270
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,510
雷博士    总统先生
- Dr Ryan.
- Mr President

271
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:05,112
就是你以我为材作有趣的研究
You must be the Dr Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me

272
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,621
你不该感到意外，我们消息灵通
You should not be surprised.
We know quite a bit

273
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,993
说我在大学有很多女友大错特错
We know how wrong your report was
that I had many girlfriends in college

274
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,974
第三年识我太太，自此用情专一
I met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since

275
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:37,416
我是指大学头两年... 总统
I was referring to
the first two years... sir

276
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,223
当时你修读英文，成绩优异
Where you received
highest honors in English

277
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,593
我喜欢你
I like you

278
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,135
那么我也一样
Well, in that case, so do I

279
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,909
抱歉打扰你进行检查的工作
I apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour

280
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,209
但我有个口信给霍总统
but I have a message
for President Fowler

281
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,013
你大可以给他电话
You could just call him on the phone

282
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,351
我想由他的老朋友转告口信
I would like him to hear it from you,
his friend of many years

283
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,550
我要亲自见你
who received it personally from me

284
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:21,528
让你看到我的表情和身体语言
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as I spoke it

285
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,360
我明白的
I understand

286
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,031
车臣是我国的内政
Chechnya is an internAL affair

287
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,730
我们的做法与你们无关
What we do there should be
none of your concern

288
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,743
我会传这口信，但他该不会同意
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree

289
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,404
本国有人想借此来削减我的势力
Some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me

290
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,312
我国却有人说
Some people in my country say

291
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,455
车臣之战正是你的弱点所在
your war in Chechnya
is exactly your weakness

292
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,018
车臣全国满是罪犯、坏蛋
Chechnya is a nation of criminALs

293
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,219
每天都作懦夫所为，伤害百姓
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens

294
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,489
这问题不用贵国担心
It is none of your concern

295
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,195
我们担心政局的稳定性
Stability is our concern

296
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,429
我们担心车臣是否太平
Peace in Chechnya is our concern

297
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,268
还容我直说... 
And, if I may speak frankly... 

298
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,440
我们也担心你对俄军的控制力
... your control over your military
concerns us too

299
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:24,525
你来这儿... 就如搞人家的老婆
For you to get involved here, it's... like
sleeping with another man's wife

300
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,224
而你所建议的是事后... 
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward

301
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,664
他们能相安无事，和平共处
they can all live together
under the same roof

302
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,909
但关键是戴了绿帽的丈夫买了枪
But what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun

303
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,685
会面顺利    老尼身旁的是谁？
- That went well.
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?

304
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,451
古东尼    前苏联特务？
- Anatoli Grushkov.
- OId KGB?

305
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,791
他是老臣子，没人敢动他分毫
He's been around since Brezhnev.
Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him

306
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,990
因为他知道尸体葬在哪里？
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

307
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,101
也许是他亲手下葬的
He probably buried them himself

308
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,611
我们有阿尔扎马斯科学家的名册
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas

309
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,587
列明他们的身分、专长
Who's who, what their expertise is

310
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,486
阿尔扎马斯十六区
Arzamas-16 is home

311
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,027
是俄国实验物理学科研所之乡
to the All-Russian Scientific Research
Institute of ExperimentAL Physics

312
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,328
也是我国首个原子弹的出生地
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb

313
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,771
不少伟大科学家还在这里工作
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do

314
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,772
自1995年... 
Since 1995

315
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,640
我们已拆除逾一万个核武装置
we have dismantled
over 10,000 nuclear devices

316
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:31,420
多年来我们千方百计想进来这儿
We tried so hard to get in here
over the years

317
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,091
我派了三个人来
I sent three people

318
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,917
他们都为此牺牲
They all died trying

319
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,980
T血上写着什么？
What does the T-shirt say?

320
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:12,788
我是炸弹专家，见我跑... 跟着跑
"I am a bomb technician. If you
see me running... try to catch up."

321
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,998
好的
OK

322
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,630
抱歉打岔，但我要问一件小事
Sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing.
I'm sure it's nothing

323
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,437
这个说今天该有17位科学家当值
According to this, there are
17 senior scientists on duty today

324
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,315
我只数到14位
I only count 14

325
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:38,418
三位博士，分别姓米、奥、史的
Doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky

326
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,047
他们都不在这里
They don't seem to be here

327
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,527
这个我会查清楚
I will make inquiries

328
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,856
米博士病了，奥博士放假
Dr Milinov is out sick.
Orlov is on vacation

329
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,626
史博士... 很不幸已过世了
Spassky, I'm grieved to say,
was killed

330
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,860
上周开车上班时遇上意外
driving his car to work
just this past week

331
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,275
我们继续吧？
We move on, shall we?

332
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,243
这边走
Please

333
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,649
真棒，这一切你都记得一清二楚
Very impressive. You ALmost seem
to have that information memorised

334
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,653
早料到你会问这个
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan

335
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,661
以色列  海法

336
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,253
我们九点半落机，叫他来会合
We touch down at Andrews at 2130.
Tell him to meet me there

337
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,092
局长，那三位没出现的科学家
Sir? Those three missing scientists

338
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,495
姓米的擅长造雷管
Milinov's expertise is detonators

339
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,637
姓史的善于造核子实
Spassky's expertise
is the nuclear core

340
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,500
姓奥的是个数学家
Orlov is a mathematician

341
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:08,509
擅长计算裂变弹的炸药用量
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb

342
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,444
要造核弹就要找这三个人
The exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb

343
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,551
老古说...     老古是个大话王
- Grushkov said... 
- Grushkov's a liar

344
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,245
姓米的没病，姓奥的没放假
Milinov is not sick.
Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation

345
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:24,019
撞车死掉的史博士根本不懂开车
and Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive

346
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,531
他们不知道这三人的下落
They have no idea
where these guys are

347
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,334
但你却无所不知
I'm dying to ask you how you know

348
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,203
是克里姆林宫的线报
Secure source inside the Kremlin

349
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,277
代号斯纳加
Codename Spinnaker

350
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,473
我们互通情报
He gives me stuff, I give him stuff

351
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:51,087
打开秘密渠道，以免灾难发生
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster

352
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:55,350
说起灾难，你联络了女友没有？
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

353
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,961
不，我不知道该怎样解释
No. I don't know how to get out of this

354
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,929
请她出席周日晚白宫的记者晚宴
All right. Invite her to the White House
correspondents dinner Sunday night

355
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,637
那是城中的盛会
It's the hottest ticket in town

356
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,967
好主意，我如何入场    相信我
- Sounds great. How do I get in?
- Trust me

357
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,490
在车上再见
I'll see you at the car

358
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,599
还喜欢你的文职工作吗？
Still loving your desk job?

359
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,633
是的
Yeah, I am

360
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,210
你的俄语还管用吗？
How's your Russian?

361
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,074
还管用，为什么？
Still works. Why?

362
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:56,977
俄国科学家失踪，要找他们下落
Three Russian nuclear scientists are
missing. I need to know where they are

363
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,756
我不再做这种工作了
I wasn't doing this any more

364
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,691
我只是想要这些资料，约翰
I just need information this time,
Johnny

365
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,492
指令在机上，十一点半起飞
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330. 

366
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,591
祝旅途愉快
Have a nice flight

367
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,239
周日晚八点，希尔顿酒店
Sunday night, 8.00, at the Hilton. 

368
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,907
请帖本是勒约翰的
The
tickets are in the name of John Clark

369
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,645
你有礼服吧？    有的，局长
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah, yes, sir

370
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,961
我的妻子茱莉来自新泽西
My beautiful wife, Julie, is from
New Jersey. 

371
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,588
有15张选举团选票
15 electorAL votes

372
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,069
大家都知道她是半个犹太人
And is, as you know, hALf-Jewish

373
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,570
所以我们把佛州25张票平分
so we'll take Florida's
25 electorAL votes and divide by two

374
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,736
这酒店很棒    很华丽
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah. Beautiful

375
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,680
丽达曾入住这酒店... 说很不错
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was... nice

376
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,214
也许晚宴结束后... 
Maybe after dinner we can... 

377
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,790
我们在这里租一间房
... we can get a room here

378
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,223
我已订了房间
I ALready did

379
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,090
你没有    我有
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did

380
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,596
我曾在多个场合抽过大麻
... I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana

381
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,438
加州，54张选举团选票
California, 54 electorAL votes

382
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,247
莫斯科时间六点钟，俄军向车臣
At 0600 Moscow time, the Russians
launched a massive artillery strike

383
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,648
首都格罗兹尼施以猛烈炮击
against Grozny,
the capitAL of Chechnya

384
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:15,622
炮弹含有实验性化武神经性毒气
The shells contained an experimentAL
chemicAL weapon, a nerve agent

385
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,523
依图片所示，20分钟后毒气扩散
Saturation, you can see
on the sat photos, took 20 minutes

386
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,257
方圆12哩内的所有人都会... 
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles

387
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:28,370
欲救无从，出现大脑麻痹的症状
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late-stage cerebrAL pALsy

388
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,063
老天    死了多少人？
- Oh, my God.
- How many dead?

389
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,841
该有八成人
Best guess, 80%

390
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:40,813
老尼发动历来最大型的生化战
Nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemicAL warfare

391
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,749
谈对策吧    最糟的是毫无对策
- Let's tALk response.
- The worst thing we can do is nothing

392
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:49,654
若他得逞，下次会是核战吧？
If he gets away with chemicAL weapons,
what's next? BiologicAL, nuclear?

393
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,559
除了以毒攻毒，还有什么法子？
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's the strongest response?

394
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,461
派出和平部队    车臣没有主权
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign

395
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:02,639
他们想建立地位，我们如其所愿
They requested recognition, so we
give it. Not fulI diplomatic, provisionAL

396
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:07,640
于是车臣要求协助，我们就派军
Then the Chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers

397
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,303
怎样去那儿    从土耳其飞过去
- How do you get them in there?
- We fly them in from Turkey

398
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,415
飞越美国领空？
- Over Armenian air space?

399
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,281
他们不会介意打俄国
- To screw Russia? They won't complain

400
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,255
动手吧，还老尼一点颜色
Let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it

401
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,524
比利？
Bill?

402
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,362
雷博士    是的，局长
- Dr Ryan.
- Yes, sir

403
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,589
你有何高见？
What do you think?

404
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,138
守旧派会建议
ConventionAL wisdom suggests

405
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,242
老尼沿用旧有方法，老调重弹
that Nemerov is playing
the traditionAL Russian role:

406
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,403
要有野心，扩展势力，威吓全球
be aggressive, flex your muscles,
dare the world to stop you

407
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,107
但老尼不吃这套    他是强硬派
- But Nemerov isn't conventionAL.
- He acts like a hardliner

408
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,719
无意冒犯，我不同意这看法
With respect, I don't think he is one

409
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:55,381
他刚攻打别国首都，所以你错了
He just gassed the capitAL of another
country. With respect, you're wrong

410
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,823
为何浪费时间？
- So what are we wasting our time for?

411
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,760
若不是他下令的呢？
- What if he didn't order the attack?

412
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,999
若不是他下令攻车臣呢？
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

413
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:11,531
如果是掌权的上将在搞鬼呢？
What if it was a... a rogue generAL?

414
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,872
或是党军不满赶不走市内的叛兵
Or a military unit frustrated they
couldn't get the rebels out of the city?

415
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,211
你有实据支持此说还是在胡扯？
Have you reason to believe he didn't
order it, or are you just floating this?

416
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,377
你不能肯定
You don't know

417
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:33,254
该是这样，我敢说他没下令施袭
I don't think he did it, sir.
I would bet he didn't do it

418
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,166
请高级官员多留一会儿？
Will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes, please?

419
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,355
俄罗斯新任总统尼艾历... 
Russia's newly-installed president,
Alexander Nemerov

420
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:12,025
刚开始发表演说，以下是直播
has just begun to address the state.
We join him in progress

421
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,802
十年来我们一直对抗... 
For ten years now,
we have contended... 

422
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,036
麻烦你开大声点？
Excuse me. Could you turn that up?

423
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,412
伤害无辜的俄罗斯百姓
... toward innocent Russian citizens

424
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,851
终于... 
Finally... 

425
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,549
每一个国家都有权自卫
... every nation has a right
to defend itself

426
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,156
这种恐怖活动必须被遏止
This terrorism must end

427
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:44,497
轰炸车臣... 是我的决定
The bombing of Chechnya... 
was my decision

428
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,396
做得好，醒目仔
Nice going, ace

429
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,885
是谁做的？
Who did it?

430
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,489
皮上将、苗上将，共产老头不悦
GenerAL Pildysh, GenerAL Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists

431
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,522
混蛋
Bastards

432
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,787
解除其军职    我会亲自杀他们
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself

433
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,227
使他们消失就是
Just disappear them

434
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:19,732
处决他们会显得我不是大权在握
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control

435
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:25,169
现在表现内疚比表现无能为佳
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent

436
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,145
我们的俄国朋友受到影响吗？
How is our Russian friend
affected by this?

437
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:39,788
没有，我仍然支持这个计划
I am not affected.
I remain devoted to our little plan

438
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,192
以你的收费，我才不感到意外
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised

439
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,853
美国佬呢？    马先生相信我们
- And the American?
- Mr Mason is a believer

440
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,796
我已多存了一点钱进他的户口
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him

441
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:56,473
为什么？    他不会有太长的命
- Why?
- He won't live long enough to get it

442
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,667
货呢？    一周前从海法寄出
- Where is the package?
- It left Haifa a week ago

443
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,473
早就说这些东西可以致命
I'm told these things can kill you

444
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:11,417
但是事情有变
But so much has changed

445
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:19,251
也许在新形势上该用... 新方法？
Perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider... a different approach?

446
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,499
也许试着令俄罗斯融入欧洲
Maybe try to bring Russia
more into Europe

447
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,706
更接纳我们的想法？
more into our way of thinking?

448
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,240
这个我们早已讨论过
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau

449
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,572
而且你也同意不那么做
and with your concurrence, rejected it

450
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,943
也许我们这次太鲁莽
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty

451
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,278
也许计划...     怎样？
- Perhaps our plan is... 
- Is what?

452
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,621
进行得不顺利
Not perfectly conceived

453
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,468
你疯了吗？全世界的右翼组织... 
Are you crazy? All over
the world, right-wing parties

454
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:03,470
民族主义者、纳粹、反犹太国家
nationalist movements,
Nazis, Aryan Nations

455
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,802
首次并肩合作
all working together for the first time

456
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,808
这还不算顺利？
Is that not perfect?

457
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:21,413
我尊重朋友们的意愿和判断
Well, I respect the will and judgment
of my friends

458
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,253
但这周发生的事令我... 
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown... 

459
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,399
对这计划失去信心
... uncomfortable with this plan

460
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:34,126
所以我必须... 请辞了
So I must... beg your leave

461
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,871
各位再见
Gentlemen

462
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,576
哈夫会送你出去
Herr Haft will help you out

463
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,750
你的颈巾
Your scarf, monsieur

464
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,297
马里兰，巴尔的摩

465
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,209
小心开这个，否则会害死人
Watch it with that thing.
You're gonna kill somebody

466
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,943
你好吗？阿马
Yo, what's up, Mason?

467
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:54,380
我一直想问你在哪里弄这个纹身
You know, I ALways wanted to ask
you...  Where'd you get that tat, man?

468
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,751
海军
The navy

469
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,322
海军？我也曾当过海军
The navy? I was in the navy

470
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,762
在医务船六年，你呢？
HospitAL ship, six years. You?

471
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,430
八个月
Eight months

472
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,435
你退役了？
Oh. You wash out?

473
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,575
好吧，兄弟，晚安
All right, brother.
You have a good one

474
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,717
好的，兄弟
Yeah, brother

475
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,183
大日子来临了，多谢

476
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:41,192
没发觉其他国家会以我们为榜样
... not realising the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us... 

477
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,890
车臣遭受空前残暴的袭击
The unprecedented attack
on Chechnya

478
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,037
显示俄政府新班子面对不稳之局
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in Russian policy

479
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,006
西方需作出最强硬鲜明的反应
lt demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the West

480
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:59,975
北约和平部队正前往车臣
NATO forces are on their way to
Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers

481
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:05,953
为这个大灾难的受害者提供援助
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous... 

482
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,153
早料到会如此
I expected this

483
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,056
是吗？
Really?

484
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,168
你会怎么做？
What will you do?

485
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,600
没什么
Nothing

486
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,537
我们什么都不做
We will do nothing

487
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,175
照片拍了四个钟
These are four hours old

488
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,874
俄军第12、15、2坦克团
 Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments

489
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,313
为何有调动？
Why haven't they moved?

490
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,545
老尼不会这么笨    但他已表态
- Nemerov's too smart to move them.
- He speaks

491
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:44,022
他有近两万部坦克，北约无得比
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 19,000
tanks. No way NATO can match that

492
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,560
所以他才不会调动坦克
That's why he's not gonna move them

493
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:50,756
这就像下棋，要事先部署好
It's like chess.
He's thinking three moves ahead

494
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:55,267
北约说我们只能用核武克制他
The NATO playbook says we can only
stop him with tacticAL nuclear weapons

495
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,999
他才不会为此引发核战
And he won't risk a nuclear war
over this

496
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:05,579
他该是有所暗示，他没攻击车臣
I ALso think he's sending us
a message. He didn't bomb Grozny

497
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,677
俄罗斯，阿尔扎马斯十六区

498
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,529
打扰了，请问史老太太在哪儿？
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky

499
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,255
在走廊尽头那边
At the end of the corridor

500
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,532
毕业后我没见他了
I haven't seen Sasha since university

501
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:36,940
你是他的助教？我却记不起你
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you

502
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:41,743
他知道我在这区，叫我来探望你
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you

503
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:49,322
他说带我去西方    所费不菲
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money

504
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,758
这儿赚不到钱，可去别处赚
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't

505
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,933
他有一份秘密工作
He has a secret job

506
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,730
替政府做事？
For the government?

507
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,995
替有钱的笨蛋做事
For imbeciles with money

508
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:08,069
同一番废话，做这个，别做那个
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that

509
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,508
他们还叫他别联络母亲
They even told him
not to call his mother

510
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,776
混蛋
The pigs

511
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:17,545
我随时归西，他却不能来电话
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother

512
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,986
但我的儿子好孝顺
But my Sasha, he called

513
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,319
昨晚才来过电话
Just last night

514
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,529
阿勒取得她的号码
Clark got us her number

515
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:34,626
安全局追查得到电话从这儿打出
 NSA traced
calls to that number back to here

516
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:40,002
克列缅兵格水库的前苏联基地
It's an abandoned Soviet army base
on the Kremenchug reservoir

517
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,309
三个俄国科学家在乌克兰干嘛？
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

518
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,915
该是在制造核弹
A fair guess, they're building a bomb

519
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,750
老尼有无数核弹，为何建这个？
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.
Why would he build a secret one?

520
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,858
为了否认一切
Deniability

521
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:03,099
秘密造一个，然后偷运去车臣
Build one nobody knows about, he can
drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer

522
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,996
无法追查，瞒天过海
No way to track it, no way to trace it

523
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,437
他可以引爆核弹，然后矢口否认
He could set it off and say,
"I didn't do it."

524
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,335
无意冒犯，但这说不通
With respect, I don't think
that adds up

525
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:18,947
说得通，只是你不喜欢这结果
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to

526
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,547
铀腐蚀的热度
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay

527
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:59,518
这个腐蚀严重，幸好你有戴手套
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves

528
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:10,164
有人想抽一根美国烟吗？
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

529
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,169
你这疯子
You're crazy

530
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,036
我出去吸烟
I'm going out

531
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,809
要更换炸药块
The explosive blocks
must be replaced

532
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,609
配置经过精密计算的系统
Machined to a thousandth
of a millimetre

533
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,651
细小至千分之一毫米
in a mathematically determined
configuration

534
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:36,223
可造核弹吗？    首先要分析... 
- Do we have a bomb?
- First we must analyse the yield... 

535
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,554
可造核弹吗？
Do we have a bomb?

536
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,890
可以
Yes

537
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,571
可造核弹
Yes, we do

538
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,248
这是一个... 考验
This is a... a test

539
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,825
接电话吧
Answer it

540
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,891
快去    真的要我接？
- Answer it.
- Are you sure?

541
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,163
喂？
Hello?

542
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,206
是的
Yes

543
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,846
是的，局长
Yes, sir

544
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,482
我要出去一会儿
I have to go outside for just a second

545
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,491
好吗？我马上回来
OK? I'll be right back

546
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,185
很快回来
I'll be right back

547
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:06,415
我负责写报告    你有当兵经验
- Sir, I write reports.
- I reviewed your military records

548
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:10,882
懂得自卫    对，但我不是特务
- You can take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that

549
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,853
你要做我的耳目，不是做特务
I'm not asking you to be an operations
officer, just my eyes and ears

550
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,357
我不能亲自出马
 I can't go

551
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,422
那么... 这行动未经批准
So... this isn't sanctioned

552
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:30,702
这个交给阿勒，拿他的情报回来
I want you to give this to Clark,
see what he finds out, bring it home

553
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,406
是的，局长
Yes, sir

554
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,239
积克... 
Jack... 

555
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,314
我们从未有过这番对话
... we never had this discussion

556
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,511
什么对话？
What discussion?

557
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:52,218
乌克兰，克列缅兵格水库

558
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,232
阿勒... 三天前
OK. Clark...  So this is
three days ago

559
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,307
这儿有车，这两处有守卫
It shows vehicles here.
Guards here and here

560
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,307
我也该买一部这个
I gotta get one of those

561
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:15,080
红外线卫星在34小时前拍到这个
Now, the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago

562
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,552
显示这两处有守卫
That shows guards here and here

563
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,253
我甚至不用电邮
I don't even have e-mail

564
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,862
检查站有两人，军营有二至五人
There are two at the checkpoint,
between two and five in the barracks

565
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,362
两人有武器，而我们会在这里
and two with the package,
which we believe to be here

566
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:34,059
没问题，给我两个人和麻醉枪
No problem. Give me a couple
of guys, some tranquilliser darts

567
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,204
六分钟就可以离开
we can be out in six minutes

568
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,000
有问题的    什么问题？
- There is a problem.
- What's that?

569
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,645
这是昨天的情形，一个守卫都无
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all

570
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,415
那为何是个问题？
Why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?

571
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:51,349
两个原因，糟的是看不见敌人
For two reasons. Either we can't
see them, which is bad

572
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,784
更糟的是他们已走，我们来迟了
or worse, they left, and we're too late

573
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,889
快换衫
Suit up

574
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,721
什么？    你不能穿成这样
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that

575
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:05,862
不，我是分析员，不做特务工作
No, no. I'm an anALyst.
I don't go on missions

576
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,560
放心，007，这只是侦察工作
Relax, 007. It's not a mission.
It's just a recce

577
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,537
随你怎么说，我只负责写报告
OK, fine, whatever you call it.
I don't do that. I just write reports

578
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,304
那就为此写报告，换衫
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up

579
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,811
阿勒，不行
Clark, no

580
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,040
阿勒，不行
Clark... no

581
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:28,218
老卡说你代我出席记者晚宴
So, Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner

582
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:33,286
好玩吗？我从未见过那种大场面
Have a good time?
I've never been to one of those

583
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,431
其实我满怀期待赴会的
I was actually looking forward to it

584
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,187
不，我不会进去
Clark, no. I'm not going in there

585
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:02,620
当然，你留在这里帮我看这只艇
Goddamn right. You're gonna stay here
and make sure no one steALs my boat

586
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,623
马上就回来
Be right back

587
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,540
糟了
Damn

588
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,335
海法

589
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,071
老天
Oh, Jesus

590
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,678
真是的，入境处没通知你们吗？
Oh, God. Immigration didn't
call you guys, huh?

591
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,045
抱歉，会说英语吗？
I'm sorry. You speak English?

592
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,586
我不会说乌克兰话
I don't speak much Ukrainian

593
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,381
别误会，我是美国公民有证件... 
It's not what you think. I'm an
American citizen. I have my papers... 

594
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,888
好了，不出示证件
OK. No papers

595
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,622
请你把抢放下
Please. Just put the gun down

596
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,131
电筒？你想我把它放下？
The light? You want
me to put the light down?

597
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,166
别胡来，我会把电筒放下
OK. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down

598
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,868
好了，我把电筒放下
Here we go, I'm putting it down

599
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,051
开枪，积克
Shoot him, Ryan

600
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,393
快开枪
Shoot him

601
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:40,059
趁他未猜出我说什么，快开枪
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying

602
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,968
叫他们脱鞋    什么？
- Get their shoes.
- What?

603
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,670
叫他们脱鞋
Tell them to take their shoes off

604
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:06,585
你会说乌克兰话    你不懂？
- You speak Ukrainian.
- Yeah. You don't?

605
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:18,740
他们喷油的东西该有雪柜那么大
Whatever it is they were spray painting
was big, about the size of a fridge

606
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:22,035
印痕很深，所以我们知道三件事
The imprint it left was deep.
So we know three things

607
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:26,909
它很重，有辐射性，还不见了
It was heavy, something was
radioactive, and now it's gone

608
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,011
其中一人说英语？    南非人
- One of them spoke English?
- South African

609
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:35,247
那他在乌克兰跟三个俄国科学家
So, what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine

610
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,791
和一个以色列货箱有何关系？
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

611
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,165
我会去海法找老卡    事不宜迟
- Tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa.
- I have a feeling you better hurry

612
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:57,076
不少人认为20世纪是共产主义
Most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle

613
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,908
和资本主义之争
of communism versus capitalism

614
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,382
而法西斯主义只是昙花一现
and that fascism was but a hiccup

615
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,689
如今我们更有体会
Today we know better

616
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,383
共产主义徒劳无功
Communism was a fool's errand

617
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,690
马克斯的追随者不见影踪
 The
followers of Marx, gone from this earth

618
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,388
但希特勒的信众则日益增强
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive

619
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:21,793
不过希特勒生不逢时
Hitler, however,
had one great disadvantage

620
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,530
当时法西斯主义像病毒般散播
He lived in a time when fascism,
like a virus

621
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,175
好比爱滋病病毒
like the AlDS virus

622
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,006
要有强大的受体以便散播
needed a strong host in order to spread

623
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,083
德国正是这个受体
Germany was that host

624
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:37,719
可是即使德国强大，但还是失败
But strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail

625
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,514
这世界太大了
The world was too big

626
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,523
幸好世界改变了
Fortunately, the world has changed

627
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:49,164
全球通讯、有线电线、互联网
Global communications,
cable TV, the internet

628
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,095
如今世界变小了
Today the world is smaller

629
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,465
而病毒不用强大受体帮助扩散
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread

630
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,365
这种病毒... 
This virus... 

631
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,203
可在空气中散播
... is airborne

632
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:08,582
还有一点，别让人家说我们疯狂
One more thing.
Let no man call us crazy

633
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,848
他们说希特勒疯狂，其实他是笨
They called Hitler crazy, but Hitler
wasn't crazy. He was stupid

634
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,616
你不用跟美俄对敌
You don't fight Russia and America

635
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,592
令美俄打起来就是
You get Russia and America
to fight each other

636
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,857
令他们互相残杀
and destroy each other

637
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:04,005
有何发现？    乌克兰出口贸易
- What did you find?
- Ukraine's exports are online

638
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,141
我查过这两周的运货单
I pulled up the shipping manifests

639
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:11,143
那货箱在十天前送抵基辅机场
The only crate that size was picked up
at Kiev InternationAL ten days ago

640
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,144
再运去加那利群岛
and flown to the Canary Islands

641
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,443
空军有核武评估小组，叫他们... 
The air force has a nuclear
assessment team. Call them... 

642
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:20,884
那货箱上了货机，送去东岸了
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter,
headed for the East Coast

643
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,987
什么？    巴尔的摩，送来这儿
- What?
- Baltimore. lt's coming here

644
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:39,105
飞船外景色一流，球赛快将开始
lt's a great view from the Budweiser
blimp as we count down to game time

645
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,868
赛前活动多姿多采
We'll have the pre-game festivities

646
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:46,378
而全国头号球迷也快将到场
as well as the arrival of the nation's
number one football fan in a moment

647
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:51,782
誓要达成目标
Then conquer we must

648
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:56,322
全因这是正义的使命
For our cause it is just

649
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:01,719
我们以此为座右铭
And this be our motto

650
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:06,095
相信上帝
ln God is our trust

651
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:10,965
满布星号的旗帜
And the star-spangled banner

652
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:20,081
永远飘扬
Forever shall wave

653
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:26,050
在自由的国土上... 
O'er the land of the free... 

654
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,153
快联络值勤官！
Get me the duty officer!

655
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:37,231
勇者之乡
Home of the brave

656
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,972
各位，有请美国总统
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States

霍罗拔！
Robert Fowler!

658
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,413
要出场了
Showtime

659
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,315
可恶
Shit

660
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,124
15码罚球，第一个死球
15 yard penalty, first down

661
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,762
打得好！
That's the way!

662
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,639
混帐
Shit

663
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,160
喂
Hello

664
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,388
喂？    局长！
- Hello?
- Sir!

665
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,362
喂？    局长！
- Hello?
- Sir!

666
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,735
该死！
Shit!

667
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,349
卡比利    是积克
- Cabot.
- It's Ryan

668
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,761
什么事？    核弹已送来
- What?
- The bomb is in play

669
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:53,765
搜索队20分钟后在码头跟我会合
The AFRAT team are meeting me at
the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it

670
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,494
什么码头？    巴尔的摩
- What docks?
- BALtimore

671
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,470
什么？你说什么？    巴尔的摩
- You're breaking up. What did you say?
- Baltimore

672
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:04,737
我待会给你电话    巴尔的摩
- I'm losing you. I'll call you back... 
- Baltimore

673
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,616
局长！
Sir!

674
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,753
欢迎莅临巴尔的摩球场

675
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,207
阿尊、红组、绿组，快走！
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!

676
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,015
快送总统走！
Move it! Let's go!

677
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,758
赶快！快走！
Move! Go, go, go, go! Move!

678
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,504
怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

679
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:07,108
俄国佬制造了核弹，还送来这儿
Some Russian scientists made a
nuclear bomb. It's arrived in BALtimore

680
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,870
快疏散观众    趴下来！
- Get those people out of the stadium.
- Stay down!

681
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,864
总统突然被护送离场
The President has been taken
off the field

682
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,767
407号    劳驾
- 407.
- Thanks, JJ

683
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:29,513
显然发生了大规模的爆炸
Clearly something has happened
of tremendous proportions

684
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:35,095
起因不明，但空中有一大团云... 
We have no word as to what but
there is an enormous cloud over... 

685
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,160
快走！
Go, go, go!

686
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,971
总统先生，你没事吧？
Mr President! Are you all right?

687
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,371
他被困在车内，走开
He's stuck. Get out of the way

688
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,176
总统先生，你没事吧？
Mr President, are you all right?

689
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,981
你没事吧？我们是海军陆战队
Are you all right, Mr President?
This is the marines, sir

690
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,854
丹尼，过来帮忙
I need your help, Danny

691
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,259
艾华，快拿担架来！
AIvarez, get me a stretcher, now!

692
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,793
你拿担架来
You got the stretcher?

693
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,378
你拿担架来    不用了
- You got the stretcher?
- No, I don't want one

694
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,447
快走... 
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

695
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,241
快走！
Move it!

696
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,722
快走！
Move it!

697
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,135
赶快！行了！起飞！
Go, go! Close them off! Go on up!

698
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,796
总统先生... 
Mr President... 

699
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:54,560
美国发生核爆，请你马上来
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now

700
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,660
什么？
What?

701
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,138
不知谁在搞鬼，但肯定不是我们
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us

702
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:06,576
继格罗兹尼... 你希望不是我们做
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us

703
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,273
正草拟一份声明让你作强烈否认
We are drafting
a strong deniAL for you

704
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:12,147
还要表示慰问的
And a statement of sympathy

705
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,846
尤里... 下令三军作好戒备
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert

706
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,523
是积克！
Hey! It's Ryan

707
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,469
你在哪里？    巴尔的摩市外
- Jack, where are you?
- Somewhere outside BALtimore

708
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,605
老卡救了总统    他在哪儿？
- Cabot got the President out.
- Where is he now?

709
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,037
他会留在飞机上
They're taking him airborne, on NAOC

710
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,770
上头认为应该是俄军做的好事
They think it might be the Russians

711
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:23,084
不是，我要找老卡，帮我联络他
It wasn't the Russians. I gotta tALk to
Cabot. Patch me through to the plane

712
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,411
他不在机上
Cabot's not on the plane

713
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,853
他下落不明，一小时后你再来电
 We don't
know where he is. Call back in an hour

714
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:32,288
时间无多，总统随时准备还击
We don't have an hour. Fowler's
gonna want to hit back now

715
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:38,926
要赶快向他证明这不是俄军做的
Listen. We have to prove it wasn't the
Russians before he's convinced it is

716
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,101
你可以回来兰利吗？
Can you get back to Langley?

717
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:46,605
没时间，辐射评估小组在哪里？
There's no time. The radiation
assessment team, where are they?

718
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:47,709
市区南面的斯谭拿隧道
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city

719
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,404
市区南面的斯谭拿隧道

720
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:53,904
正在吹盛行风，东、北还有落尘
The prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north

721
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,175
你留在南面就较安全
As long as you stay south you're OK

722
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:02,422
你没事吧？    你说呢？
- Mr President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

723
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,854
有多少伤亡？    不知道
- How many casuALties?
- We don't know

724
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:10,225
核弹怎么来的    雷达侦测不到
- How the hell did it get there?
- We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up

725
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:14,061
老卡呢？他在哪里    我不知道
- Well, how is Cabot? Where is he?
- I don't know

726
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,136
那你知道什么？    我一无所知
- What do you know?
- I don't know, all right? I don't know!

727
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,966
我一无所知！
I don't know!

728
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:36,124
康达没上机    派搜索队去找
- GenerAL, Kondor is not on board.
- Send the AFRAT team

729
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:40,461
总统，我建议进入二级紧急状态
Mr President, I recommend
we move to DEFCON-2

730
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:42,220
我们的情报如何？
Where's our intelligence?

731
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,695
俄国空军防御处于最高戒备状态
Russian air defences
are at their highest level

732
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,631
他们或怕遇袭，我拉不开这张椅
Maybe they're afraid of being attacked.
I can't get this goddamn chair open!

733
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,201
准备起飞
We're about to take off

734
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,999
不知是谁搞鬼    应该是俄军... 
- We don't know who did it... 
- We think the Russians... 

735
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,573
该是？    进入二级紧急状态吧
- You think?
- Sir, DEFCON-2

736
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,679
我们在揣测...     都是废话！
- We're groping in the dark... 
- This is too much goddamn bulIshit!

737
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,315
还不够证据
And not enough fact

738
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,403
弹坑有100至150码阔
The blast crater is about
100, 150 yards wide

739
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,038
这核弹威力不是太大
which suggests a low-yield device

740
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,209
比落在广岛的原子弹还要小
quite a bit smaller
than the Hiroshima bomb

741
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:32,437
球场周围四分一平方哩之地被毁
A quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone

742
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:37,017
外围的大厦没倒塌，但损毁严重
Beyond that, buildings remain, heavily
damaged, for another quarter mile

743
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:41,019
离核爆区越远，破坏越小
The damage tapers off the farther
you get from Ground Zero

744
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,696
都宾
Dubinin

745
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:56,837
哈夫去了美国，现在就靠你了
Herr Haft has left for America.
Now we are counting on you

746
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:02,671
我保证我物有所值
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig

747
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,846
立正！
Attention

748
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,176
你们也知道美国发生核爆
You've heard of the bomb in the USA

749
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:11,648
但你们不知道15分钟前
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

750
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:16,119
美国发射洲际弹道导弹攻莫斯科
an American ICBM hit Moscow

751
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:23,355
我们要打美军在北海的航空母舰
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea

752
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,057
快准备出动
Man your aircraft

753
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,548
灰烬没有辐射性
The ash isn't radioactive. 

754
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,923
盛行风把落尘吹向大海
The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea

755
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,925
上尉，中情局雷积克
Captain. Jack Ryan, CIA

756
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,031
冼罗娜，你要在外边等
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside

757
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,895
把你对核弹所知的都告诉我
I need to know all you know
about the bomb

758
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:07,041
我们在采集样本，明天会有公布
We're collecting samples. Get in line
and we'll have the report out tomorrow

759
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,042
上尉，我要知道核弹从哪儿来的
Captain, I need to know now
where this bomb came from

760
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:15,808
或是它不是从哪来，否则没明天
or even where it didn't come from
or there may not be a tomorrow

761
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:19,212
混帐，阿韦，你在哪里？
Shit. Wesson, where are you?

762
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,412
离核爆区四分之一哩
About a quarter mile from Ground Zero

763
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:26,686
已尽力而为，脚板快被烤熟了
This is about as far as we'll go.
My feet are sizzling

764
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,955
辐射度接近装备所能抵御的上限
I'm getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear

765
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:33,692
小队马上撤退    收到
- OK. Cut the rover loose and get out.
- Roger that

766
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:48,475
装核弹的货箱在码头该有人签收
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped
in. Somebody had to sign for it at port

767
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:52,380
海关定有记录，老卡在哪里？
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name. Where's Cabot?

768
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,215
不知所踪，我们在查看各医院
No one knows.
We're checking the hospitals

769
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,914
找过纪念医院？    他不在那里
- Have you tried MemoriAL?
- He wouldn't be there

770
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,289
不，我是指医院没... 
No, I mean...  Is it still... 

771
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,830
那是卡丝工作的医院
It's Cathy's hospitAL

772
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,695
医院没被炸毁，但电话失灵
As far as l know it's still there,
but the phones are down

773
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,429
请你继续追查，麻烦你
All right. Can you keep checking?
Thanks

774
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,707
他们本可以发射巡航导弹
They could have launched
a cruise missile

775
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,884
不肯定是俄军所为    但也许是
- We don't know that this is Russia.
- We don't know it's not

776
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,518
若他们要我们知难而退
If they were sending us a message

777
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,612
那该会说这是他们做的
they'd want us to know it was them

778
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:32,692
除了他们想故弄玄虚，声东击西
Except they could inspire
the confusion we're going through now

779
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,987
总统先生，准备好通讯了
Mr President, we're uplinked

780
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:44,498
尼总统，美国发生严重核爆事件
President Nemerov, there's been a
major nuclear event in the United States

781
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,206
死伤惨重
Loss of life is severe

782
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,035
这绝不是意外    这绝不是意外
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident

783
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:52,645
我们还不知道核弹从哪儿来... 
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't... 

784
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:58,514
我们还没确定核弹的来源... 
We have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon. Rest assured... 

785
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,453
我们还没确定核弹的来源
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon

786
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:08,758
但可保证我国定将严惩真凶
But rest assured those responsible
will be deALt with most severely

787
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:13,256
他在试探我们
He's fishing

788
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,436
给他回覆
Send our reply

789
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,464
这么快有回应
Whoa, that was a little fast

790
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:22,802
请接受俄国人民最深切的慰问
"Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people."

791
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:26,310
若是蓄意施袭，诚是空前的暴行
"If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent."

792
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,540
是哪个疯子所为？目的何在？
"What madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose?"

793
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:33,083
敬请相信俄国与此暴行绝无关连
"You must believe that Russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act."

794
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,746
是预谋，他早有此着
It's canned.
He prepared that in advance

795
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:42,263
尼总统，如今我们无理由怀疑
President Nemerov, we've no reason
to suspect Russian involvement... 

796
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,931
俄国与此事有关
... at this time... 

797
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:49,861
但我们会竭力自卫，免再受袭击
... but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression

798
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,504
他认为是我们做的
He thinks we did this

799
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,940
我们必须显示军力
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons

800
01:21:57,145 --> 01:22:02,742
让他们明白攻打俄国就是找死
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide

801
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,545
加强戒备
Increase the alert status

802
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:46,987
接收到间断的讯号，方位020
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar, bearing 020

803
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,129
哪儿？
Where?

804
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,300
没有了
Now it's gone

805
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,468
这儿，但讯号微弱
There. It's a weak signAL

806
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,670
有敌机来袭
TAO, inbound contact

807
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,011
相同方位有多架敌机
Multiples on the same bearing

808
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,386
注意！    敌机迅速来袭
- Vampire, vampire!
- Fast movers inbound

809
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,993
有七、八、九架敌机！
I got seven, eight, nine of them!

810
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:49,351
导弹是从俄军战机发射的
The missiles definitely came
from Russian aircraft

811
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,924
母舰还保得住，但不能执行任务
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are out

812
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,498
我没下令攻打母舰
I ordered no such attack

813
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,328
请保持冷静，先让我们调查清楚
You must not respond to this action
until we investigate all possibilities

814
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,799
先让我们调查清楚
"... until we investigate all possibilities."

815
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,030
正如车臣事件？
Like you did in Chechnya?

816
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,540
尼总统，谁在控制你的军队？
Mr President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

817
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:15,039
是你们在广岛投掷原子弹
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima

818
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:18,219
是你们在长崎投掷原子弹
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki

819
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,215
别拿车臣事件来教训我
Do not lecture me on Chechnya

820
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:25,187
拿车臣事件来教训我
"... lecture me on Chechnya."

821
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:32,265
事实上现在我们已跟俄国开战
Mr President, we are now at a
de facto state of war with the Russians

822
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:42,799
昨天勒约翰在海法，定要找到他
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday.
We have to find him right away

823
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,876
看看钆的含量读数
Wow.
Look at that gadolinium reading

824
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,640
质量数很高
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge

825
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,750
快联络迪伦，我会等
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold

826
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:55,389
就在这儿，萨凡纳河
There it is. Savannah River

827
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,815
没错    什么没错？
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, what?

828
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,687
那边有钆的问题
They had a gadolinium problem

829
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:04,695
汉福的做法不对，产生太多i
Hanford does it another way,
and generate too much promethium

830
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,390
慢着，你可否解释清楚一点？
Hold on. Can you translate that
into English?

831
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,673
68年2月铀来自河上这间工厂
This plutonium came from the DOE
plant at Savannah River, February '68

832
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:17,333
源自K反应堆，还知道是哪部分
from K reactor. We even know
which part of K reactor

833
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:22,073
这是我们造的铀？    美国产品
- Wait. This is our plutonium?
- Made in the USA

834
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,619
迪伦，我一定要找到老卡
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot

835
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,358
你想说服我们发动第一击？
Are you advocating we launch
a first strike?

836
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:41,524
不是！已经有第一击，事已至此
It is not a first strike! There's ALready
been a first strike, and a second

837
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,034
你还不明白    我不明白
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't get it!

838
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,902
为何要用核弹？这不合理
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable

839
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,202
悉尼，混帐！
Sidney, goddamn it!

840
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,141
他们打沉我们的航空母舰！
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

841
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,977
他们准备开战，老尼又废话连篇
Their missile silos are hot.
We're getting bulIshit from Nemerov

842
01:25:57,218 --> 01:26:02,053
别忘了是谁先动手，他们要我死
Let's not forget how this started.
They tried to kill me, remember?

843
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,225
所以别劝我讲理！
Don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!

844
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,957
请来大厦旁边的鉴别分类营
Please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building

845
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:17,138
我们协助你找伤者
We will help you find
who you are looking for

846
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:20,330
但我们的血包供应不足
but we are low on blood supply

847
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,767
局长？
Sir?

848
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,170
局长？
Sir?

849
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,772
你好
Hi

850
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,971
什么？
What?

851
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,743
总统？    他平安无恙
- President?
- The President's fine

852
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,648
他没事，局长... 
He's fine. Sir... 

853
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:11,184
那核弹，铀元素
The bomb. The plutonium... 

854
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,690
太太    什么？
- Wife.
- What?

855
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,692
太太
Wife

856
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,628
你太太？她没事，在华盛顿
Your wife? I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC

857
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,735
核爆范围不是... 
The blast radius wasn't that... 

858
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,030
那么大
那么大
... it wasn't that wide.
... it wasn't that wide

859
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:31,969
局长，听我说
Sir, listen to me

860
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,906
那些铀是我们的
The plutonium was ours

861
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:42,017
阿勒去追查军火商，我找不到他
John Clark's in Haifa to track down
the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him

862
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:44,521
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do

863
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,496
女... 女朋友
Girl... girlfriend

864
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,267
她... 
She... 

865
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,971
她在巴尔的摩工作，所以... 
She works in BALtimore, so... 

866
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,935
我不清楚
... I don't know

867
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,543
斯纳加
Spinnaker

868
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:07,738
什么？    斯纳加
- What?
- Spinnaker

869
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,549
局长？
Sir?

870
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,753
比利？
Bill?

871
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,888
我们查到接收货箱的人的地址
Yeah. We found the receiver address
for the crate

872
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:56,461
巴尔的摩港口，你可以去码头吗
Port of Baltimore.
Can you get to the docks?

873
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,896
找捷运货仓，收货人姓马
Find the Transcon warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason

874
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:03,796
对不起，我急需这部车
Sorry, I need this truck

875
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:21,486
老尼大怒，或有政变，美国收手

876
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:39,903
拜托
Come on

877
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:56,482
回覆

878
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:05,792
老卡已死，这是积克

879
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:14,505
68年被偷的铀，现在在哪里？

880
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:15,642
传送

881
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,607
混帐
Shit

882
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:29,346
斯纳加：以色列

883
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:37,890
以色列偷了铀？

884
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,431
斯纳加，不，是你们

885
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:42,603
还把它送给他们

886
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:26,171
总统，我们想到另一个对策
Sir, we've come up
with another ALternative

887
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:31,477
反攻发动袭击母舰的空军基地
A conventionAL attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated

888
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:35,519
有限度的还击    不用核武
- It's a measured response.
- Non-nuclear

889
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:39,682
够强烈吗    灵巧弹和F16战机
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-16s

890
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,623
我们绝不能示弱
Can't afford for them to see us as weak

891
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,766
要让他们知道我们绝不好惹的
They've got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level

892
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,570
他们会明白这一点
I think they'll get that message

893
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,642
动手吧
Hit 'em

894
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:13,393
鹰巢，这是一号，我们瞄准目标
Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired. Target is lit

895
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:31,510
不作反击就等于坐以待毙
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack

896
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,671
诺福克和金斯湾的潜艇已出动
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea

897
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:41,412
载有D3三叉式导弹，第一击武器
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon

898
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:44,147
老霍不会疯得发动第一击
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike

899
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,485
也许他不认为这是第一击
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike

900
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:50,630
他们出动轰炸机，我们就没选择
Once their SteALth bombers go up,
we will have no choice

901
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:52,662
这会是个徵兆
That will be the sign

902
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,233
怎么说服他别出动轰炸机？
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

903
01:32:55,436 --> 01:33:00,601
我们该...     导弹处于高度戒备
- Maybe we should... 
- Bring our missiles to highest alert

904
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:04,335
那他们一定是疯了才会施袭
They'd be crazy to attack then

905
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,274
请各位注意
Can I have your attention?

906
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:11,110
发电机失灵
The generator has gone out

907
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:16,255
四处是玻璃碎，别乱动，我们... 
There's broken glass everywhere. Stay
where you are. We will get back to... 

908
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:20,484
好了，别乱动，我们会照料你们
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are.
We'll get you one by one

909
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:38,637
你听见吗？手脚有知觉吗？
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you feel your arms and legs?

910
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:41,076
9%静脉注射和吗啡滴注
A 9% IV and morphine drip

911
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,047
先生，我们会照顾你
Sir, we're gonna take care of you

912
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,252
这个伤者怎么样？
What have you got?

913
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:48,456
要是救不了的，应该怎么做？
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

914
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,014
要是救不了的，应该怎么做？
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

915
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:52,054
尽力而为
Whatever we can

916
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,463
什么事？
What?

917
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:03,227
卡比利死了
Bill Cabot died

918
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:09,876
我很难过
I'm really sorry

919
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:13,940
不会是这样的
This can't be happening

920
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:32,697
部长，兰利有电话来
Sir, we have a call from Langley

921
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,764
劳驾
Thank you

922
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:40,300
阿贝    这是雷积克
- Becker.
- This is Jack Ryan

923
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,738
太好了，是老尼的辩护者
Great. The Nemerov apologist

924
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:48,007
那核弹不是老尼的，我了解他
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy

925
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:51,646
车臣事件你也这么说，写报告吧
You said that after Grozny.
Put it in your report

926
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:53,251
那些铀... 
The plutonium... 

927
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:11,468
没想到这儿会出现辐射污染
Seems unusuAL to find
radiation poisoning here

928
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,765
这是前所未见的
I have never seen such a thing

929
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:18,468
所以我们在网上公布此事来求助
That is why we published the case
on the internet, to seek help

930
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:22,740
他说起因是什么？    他不肯说
- How did he say it happened?
- He will not tALk about it

931
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:35,990
其他人感染辐射令你病倒了？
Was anyone else exposed
to the materiALs that made you sick?

932
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:45,063
嘉先生，我不是警察
Mr Ghazi, I'm not the police

933
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:50,237
我是医生，我会保守秘密
I'm a physician. I assure you
anything you say stays between us

934
01:35:56,884 --> 01:36:00,615
我朋友和我找到一个核弹
My friend and I find bomb

935
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:06,820
把它卖给一个军火商
We sell to a man
who buys such things

936
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:13,059
是这个人吗？
Was it this man?

937
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:23,134
其他人也许接触过这核弹
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb

938
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:26,303
我们要救他们
We must help them

939
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:41,824
我... 快要死吗
I am... going to die?

940
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,360
是吗？
Yes?

941
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:49,032
是的
Yes

942
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:05,410
他叫奥森
His name is OIson

943
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,883
住在大马士革
He live in Damascus

944
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:32,210
行了，收到资料了
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all

945
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:38,350
核武攻斯普林斯可破坏北美空防
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD

946
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:42,044
那他们就不能够还击
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack

947
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:45,452
斯普林斯有多少人口？
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

948
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:49,927
三、四十万人
Three or four hundred thousand

949
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:53,998
总统先生，用核武攻美国
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans... 

950
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,362
就等于向他们宣战
... would be to cross a threshold

951
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:02,975
他们早已这么想，我们等什么？
They think we ALready have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

952
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:08,073
不是我惹的祸我阻止不了
I cannot stop what I did not start

953
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:13,345
总统先生，你要下令采取行动
Mr President, we need you
to initiate snapcount

954
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,189
然后呢？
What happens then?

955
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:20,792
用核武摧毁他们陆上的导弹基地
We prepare to take out their land-based
missiles with a nuclear strike

956
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:25,591
炸毁他们的潜艇或地上的飞机
find and kill their subs, knock out
the planes they have on the ground

957
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:30,259
还出动战机攻击已在空中的敌军
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they ALready have in the air

958
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,032
胜算有多大？
What are our chances?

959
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:35,602
大卫？
David?

960
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:41,880
我们会令老尼陷于困境
Odds are we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle

961
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:45,711
他剩下的核弹最多有几百个
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes

962
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,285
那是我们找不到的
the ones we can't find

963
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:53,358
它们较小型，易运送，没那么准
Mostly the... smaller, more mobile,
less accurate kind

964
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,154
而它们的目标会是我们的城市
All those can do is target our cities

965
01:38:56,363 --> 01:39:00,732
但他心知我们一定会以眼还眼
But he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities

966
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:10,204
我毕生想做一个总统
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president

967
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,912
任期就此结束
This is my presidency?

968
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:22,444
他会留三百个核弹以备不时之需
Sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor

969
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:26,558
这晚他应该会暂时就此罢手
I think he'll push back from the table
and call it a night

970
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:34,060
我下令采取行动，准备用核武
I'm giving the order for snapcount.
Maximum readiness

971
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:48,582
奥森收到斯拿4500万的汇款
OIson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler

972
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:48,911

OIson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler

973
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:53,018

Dillon, find out who Dressler is.
Jack, I want you out of there

974
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:56,348
我在码头    调查这个斯拿
- l'm at the docks.
- Look for the name Dressler

975
01:39:56,590 --> 01:40:00,390
积克你快走... 给巴市警局这地址
No. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the
BALtimore PD, give them the address

976
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:03,392
等警察来    我会再联络你
- Wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back

977
01:41:28,215 --> 01:41:30,240
斯拿是什么人？
Who's Dressler?

978
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:36,718
斯拿在哪里？可恶！
Where is he, goddamn it?

979
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,586
斯拿在哪里？
Where is Dressler?

980
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:42,387
警察！举高双手！
Police! Put your hands up!

981
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:45,030
斯拿在哪里？    你是雷积克？
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

982
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:48,929
斯拿在哪里？    放手
- Where's Dressler, goddamn it?
- Let him go!

983
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:52,162
斯拿在哪里？快说？
Where's Dressler? Where is he?

984
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:58,169
兰利说你需要帮助
Langley said you might need help

985
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,575
我要去国防部    我可以帮你忙
- I gotta get to the Pentagon.
- I think I can help you with that

986
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:24,032
总统先生
Mr President

987
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,332
他们的轰炸机已离开阿维艾诺
Their SteALth bombers
have left Aviano

988
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:32,602
他们有所行动
That is the sign

989
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:36,180
快把它们击落
Shoot them down

990
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:42,313
愿主保佑
God protect us

991
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:47,087
他们的战机紧急起飞，时间无多
Mr President, they're scrambling
their fighters. We're out of time

992
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,994
大卫！    他心脏病发
- Dave!
- He has a heart condition

993
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,100
快找医生    总统先生
- Get a doctor.
- Mr President

994
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:57,270
你的药呢    我说叫医生来
- Where's your nitro?
- I said get a doctor!

995
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:00,668
总统先生    扶他去我的房间
- Mr President.
- Take him to my quarters

996
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:03,733
上校，拿系统密码机来
Colonel, bring in the launch codes

997
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:23,821
斯拿是奥地利商人，是亿万富翁
Dressler's an Austrian manufacturer,
billionaire

998
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,522
他父亲在纽伦堡被处决
His father was executed at Nuremberg

999
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:28,166
他买到国会议席
He bought a seat in parliament

1000
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:31,294
但因说了拥护纳粹言论而被撵走
 and got
booted out for saying pro-Nazi things

1001
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:33,063
快让我跟总统说清楚
Rudy, get me through to the President

1002
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:36,504
不行，他们正采取核武行动
I can't do it, Jack.
They're in the snapcount

1003
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,678
没法联络他们    废话
- There's no way in.
- BulIshit

1004
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:18,642
让我帮你    不，卡上有泥巴
- I can do that for you, sir.
- No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it

1005
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:21,718
给我看，现在高度戒备    我知
- Can I see it? We're on high alert.
- I understand

1006
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:24,652
先生，把卡放下    退后
- Sir, put the card down.
- Back off

1007
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:27,156

you to take a step back! Put... 

1009
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:46,504
上将，中情局的雷积克来了
GenerAL, there's a Dr Ryan

1010
01:44:46,713 --> 01:44:49,238
他要求进入NMCC，他独自来的
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted

1011
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,440
他想怎样？    见你
- What's he want?
- You, sir

1012
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:57,590
我要传达卡局长的口信给总统
I have a message from Director Cabot
that I need to transmit over the hotline

1013
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:00,282
谁批准你这样做？    没有人
- What's your authorisation?
- I don't have one

1014
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:03,088
卡局长呢？    他已死了
- Where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir

1015
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,322
我要传口信
- I need to get this information sent

1016
01:45:05,432 --> 01:45:08,128
要先得批准，带他走
- Not without authorisation. Get him out

1017
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:13,898
上将！总统根据错误情报下决定
Wait! GenerAL! The President is basing
his decisions on bad information!

1018
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:17,338
若你不理我，你和我的家人
If you shut me out,
your family and my family

1019
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:21,503
和2500万家庭会在半小时内丧命
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes

1020
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:32,088
我的职责是给决策者准确的情报
My orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions

1021
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:35,386
我只是想传达情报
I just need to send some information

1022
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:39,488
总统为什么要听你说？
What makes you think
the President will listen to you?

1023
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,461
他没此必要
He doesn't have to

1024
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:48,000
轰炸机有多接近？
How close are the bombers?

1025
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:55,006
它们进出波兰上空
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland

1026
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:03,783
出动导弹兵团
Activate the missile regiments

1027
01:46:11,064 --> 01:46:14,727
系统在你下令后一分钟才启动
The launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order

1028
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:19,065
下令前，要先核对身分
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed

1029
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:27,806
我的号码是... 
Mine is the...  My number is... 

1030
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:31,816
数下来... 第三个号码
... the third one... third number down
from the top

1031
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:34,713
你的命令是什么？
Your orders, sir?

1032
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:37,423
出击    抱歉，总统？
- Strike.
- I'm sorry, sir?

1033
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:40,024
我下令出击
I give the order to strike

1034
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,596
要马上作两人授命，下令出击
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed

1035
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,968
罗拔，看在老天份上
Bob, for the love of God

1036
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:50,966
动手好了
Just do it

1037
01:46:56,009 --> 01:47:00,139
国务卿奥悉尼，第四个号码
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down

1038
01:47:09,656 --> 01:47:12,989
已作了两人授命，下令出击
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule

1039
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:17,459
出击的命令已确定，启动系统
NMCC, strike order has been
confirmed. Start the sequence

1040
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:20,394
热线有动静    早已给他们机会
- We've got activity on the hotline.
- They've had their chance

1041
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,862
不，有人在跟老尼通话
No, somebody's tALking to the Kremlin

1042
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:32,306
说“美国是恐怖袭击的受害者”
It says, "America has been the victim
of a terrorist attack."

1043
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:37,039
你应该想像得到我方有不少揣测
As you can imagine, there has
been much confusion here... 

1044
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:39,447
人心惶惶
... and fear

1045
01:47:39,686 --> 01:47:42,712
但我们知道不是俄国动武
But we know the weapon
was not Russian

1046
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:46,357
“但我们知道不是俄国动武”
"But we know the weapon
was not Russian."

1047
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,118
怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

1048
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:58,299
照我说的打
Type exactly what I say

1049
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:01,100
你究竟是谁？
Who are we tALking to?

1050
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:07,736
积克，我跟局长在莫斯科见过你
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with
Bill Cabot. 

1051
01:48:07,881 --> 01:48:09,405
今天他在巴尔的摩死了
He died today in BALtimore

1052
01:48:09,616 --> 01:48:12,676
中止通讯    已启动核武系统
- Cut him off.
- Launch sequence has begun

1053
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:14,386
两个月前
Two months ago

1054
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:18,249
新法西斯主义者斯拿买了原子弹
a neo-fascist named Dressler bought
an A-bomb on the black market

1055
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:22,155
中止通讯    无法中止系统操作
- Cut him off.
- The system can't be cut off

1056
01:48:22,362 --> 01:48:24,387
那快找人阻止他
Then get someone to stop him

1057
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:26,759
他雇用三个俄罗斯... 
- He paid three disaffected Russian... 

1058
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,868
科学家修复原子弹
- "scientists to make the bomb active."

1059
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:31,970
然后把它送来美国，一个姓马的
"He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason"

1060
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:36,768
是他搞鬼，令我们两国起纷争
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course

1061
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:41,307
胡说八道，他是中情局
This is madness. He is CIA

1062
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:44,746
我们绝不能听信他们的间谍
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy

1063
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:48,921
听多一点没害处吧？
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

1064
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:55,688
你想我怎么做？
What are you asking of me?

1065
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:05,966
就此罢手
Back down

1066
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:14,107
有什么可保证霍总统也会收手？
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

1067
01:49:15,448 --> 01:49:17,006
没有保证
None

1068
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:23,386
看见吗？他在浪费时间
You see? He is wasting time

1069
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,820
我们得出击，时间无多
We must launch now.
We have only moments

1070
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:32,459
我知道你跟巴尔的摩的核爆无关
Sir, I know you had nothing to do
with the BALtimore bomb

1071
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:37,126
你也知道，但你还是要攻打我们
and you know you didn't, but you're
still about to launch a nuclear strike

1072
01:49:37,337 --> 01:49:40,670
说够了    这都是恐惧之故
- Yes, sir. That's all, Dr Ryan.
- This is about fear

1073
01:49:40,874 --> 01:49:43,104
害怕你们的导弹，我们的潜艇
Fear of your missiles,
fear of our subs

1074
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,278
害怕做弱者，害怕犯错
Fear of being weak,
of making a mistake

1075
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:49,642
害怕对方率先制造这些烂核弹！
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place!

1076
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,381
没通讯了
It stopped

1077
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:58,821
他们中止了他的通讯
They cut him off

1078
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:01,259
他们会出击
They are going to strike

1079
01:50:01,461 --> 01:50:04,555
准备启动核武系统
Prepare the launch orders now

1080
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:21,042
30秒后发射
30 seconds to launch

1081
01:50:21,214 --> 01:50:23,375
老天... 总统先生？
Oh, my God. Mr President?

1082
01:50:29,856 --> 01:50:31,153
我下令... 

1083
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:33,053
俄国战略部队撤消战备状态

1084
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:36,490
暂时我们会保持在防卫戒备状态
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment

1085
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:39,460
但是已撤退攻击部队
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn

1086
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,792
“若你照这样做”
"If you match this, 

1087
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:44,336
“我建议双方撤消备战状态”
I propose a phased
mutuAL stand down over five hours."

1088
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:48,464
关闭核武系统
Stop the launch sequence

1089
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:52,406
这是莱上将，马上关闭核武系统
Lasseter here. Flash override.
Stop the sequence!

1090
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:57,109
撤走战机，进入三级紧急状态
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON-3

1091
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:01,219
找人问积克我可以用电话了吗？
And would somebody ask Mr Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

1092
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:33,075
你还在这儿
You're still here

1093
01:52:22,368 --> 01:52:24,734
美国

1094
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:46,381
俄罗斯

1095
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:49,447
没有什么比我们今周所做的
There is no more fitting memoriAL
for those who perished in this tragedy

1096
01:54:49,649 --> 01:54:51,844
更能悼念这次惨剧的受害者
than the steps we've taken this week

1097
01:54:52,085 --> 01:54:54,076
以求多国通力合作
toward a multinational campaign

1098
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:58,347
大规模销毁破坏力强大的军备
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction

1099
01:54:59,692 --> 01:55:01,557
我们有此目标
We embarked on this course

1100
01:55:01,661 --> 01:55:05,028
全因吸取了重大的教训
 because
we have learned, at too great a cost

1101
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:08,598
明白到若我们动用最强大的武器
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed

1102
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:12,737
那不是因为愤恨，而是恐惧之故
they will be fired not in anger,
but in fear

1103
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:14,270
雷博士
Dr Ryan

1104
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:17,473
古先生
Mr Grushkov

1105
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:21,507
今天... 是个大好日子
It is... a lovely day

1106
01:55:23,383 --> 01:55:24,873
对
Yeah

1107
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:30,178
抱歉，这是...     梅医生，幸会
- I'm sorry, this is... 
- Dr Muller. How do you do?

1108
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:33,555
幸会
Nice to meet you

1109
01:55:35,194 --> 01:55:37,594
为何我不为此感到意外？
Why am I not surprised
you know her name?

1110
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:43,097
我们的朋友比利以为我是个间谍
Our friend William thought
I was a spy

1111
01:55:43,303 --> 01:55:45,931
当然他无法证实这个
Of course, he could never prove it

1112
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:49,970
他从未说过你们是朋友
He never told me you were friends

1113
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:53,578
也许他跟你不太熟络
Maybe he didn't know you well enough

1114
01:55:56,249 --> 01:55:58,979
他说他有个俄罗斯线人
He told me he had a source in Russia

1115
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:03,279
“打开秘密渠道”？
"To keep the back channels open?"

1116
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:07,283
“以免灾难发生”
"In hopes of staving off disaster."

1117
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:11,827
甘尼迪说过我们最大的共通之处
Kennedy said,
"Our most basic common link"

1118
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:15,762
就是同居住于这地球上
"is that we all inhabit
this small planet. "

1119
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,998
呼吸相同的空气
"We all breathe the same air. "

1120
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:25,134
大家都重视儿女的将来
"We all cherish our children's future...  "

1121
01:56:25,645 --> 01:56:28,307
还有我们生有尽时
"... and we're all mortal. "

1122
01:56:29,182 --> 01:56:34,347
我会好怀念... 跟比利合作的日子
I will miss... so very much
tALking to William

1123
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:37,789
我也是
Me too

1124
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:42,183
也许日后有机会
Perhaps from time to time

1125
01:56:42,428 --> 01:56:45,056
我们可以合作
you and I can tALk

1126
01:56:45,264 --> 01:56:47,596
乐意之至
Yeah, I'd like that

1127
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:51,633
这是什么？
What is this?

1128
01:56:52,805 --> 01:56:56,673
庆祝你们订婚的小礼物
A modest gift for your engagement

1129
01:56:58,945 --> 01:57:00,674
他... 今早才向我求婚
He... he just asked me this morning

1130
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,576
我们还没告诉任何人
We haven't told anybody about it

1131
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:07,513
你怎么可能知道？
How... how could you possibly know?
