1
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,479
- Name?
- Horowitz, Salomon.

2
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,819
- Schneider, Sarah.
- Birnbaum, Olga?

3
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,243
- Over there. Over there!
- Come here!

4
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,580
- Isak Hudes.
- Hudes, Isak.

5
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,874
Zucker, Helena.

6
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,502
Zucker, Helena!

7
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,505
- Hirsch, Salomon?
- Mandel, Maria.

8
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,092
- Hauptman, Chaim!
- Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

9
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,095
- Feber, Ludwig!
- Feber, Ludwig.

10
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,265
Elsa Bauman.

11
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,767
-Josef Klein.
- Klein.

12
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,813
- Davidowich, Ignacy.
- Paula Biffer. - Nadel, Rachela.

13
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,566
- Steiner, Gertruda.
- Steiner, Hilda.

14
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,896
- Jerzy, you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

15
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,334
Let's get together, please.

16
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,254
Smile. Good!

17
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,078
Yes, sir.

18
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,957
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

19
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:19,254
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say they are from?

20
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,424
You can say
they are from me.

21
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:47,282
- From the gentleman.
- Where?

22
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,040
Do you know him?

23
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,628
-Find out who he is.
-Yes, sir!

24
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,510
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight...

25
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,429
...but I know you won't.

26
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,767
You embarrass me.

27
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,361
What's he doing?

28
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,740
Stay here.

29
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,495
How are you doing?

30
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:38,125
You'd leave a woman
alone at the table in a place like this?

31
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,461
Sweetheart, you're the picture
of loneliness.

32
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,633
What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

33
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,303
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

34
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,597
- And for the lady?
- Pernod!

35
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,393
"There's a wood sale
in Green Forest... "

36
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,437
"... a wood sale!"

37
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,274
"Wood is being sold in the Green Forest. "

38
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,985
Come to the table, girls!
Drink with us!

39
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,447
"Left around the corner,
right around the corner... "

40
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,200
"... there is wood sale everywhere. "

41
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,369
Come to us!
Merry us!

42
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:23,962
"The whole trunk costs only one taler.
one taler. "

43
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:29,009
"The whole trunk costs only one taler,
one taler. "

44
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,890
- Thank you.
- I'll tell you what I mean by cooperative.

45
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,477
Two days after the law is passed
that all Jews have to wear the star...

46
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,771
...the Jewish tailors are
turning them out by the gross in a variety...

47
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,981
...of fabrics
at three zloty each.

48
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,650
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

49
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,612
- I have an excellent German Riesling, 1937.
- French!

50
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,990
- A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
- No, I'm sorry.

51
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,535
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

52
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,079
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

53
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,039
- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

54
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,542
- Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37?
- Yes.

55
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,628
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that. "

56
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,464
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

57
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,258
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

58
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,053
But this storm is different. This is not
the Romans. This storm is the SS.

59
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,057
"If God wants to honor you... "

60
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,853
"... then he'll send you world wide. "

61
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:28,360
"If god wants to honor you
then he'll send you world wide. "

62
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,947
"Faleri, Falera... "

63
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,909
"... Faleri
Falera-ha ha ha!"

64
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,580
"Faleri, Falera!"

65
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,166
"He sends you away world wide"

66
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,713
-Martin?
-Yes, sir!

67
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,966
Who is that man?

68
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,761
That's Oskar Schindler!

69
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,182
"Faleri, Falera
ha ha ha!"

70
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,894
"He sends you away world wide. "

71
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,439
"Faleri, Falera!"

72
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,066
"He sends you away world wide. "

73
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,235
To Krakow!

74
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,900
<i>Attention, all Jews!</i>

75
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,612
<i>From now on, Jewish art...</i>

76
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:58,075
<i>...meat preparing is forbidden.</i>

77
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,496
<i>Announcement for all Jews!
From now on...</i>

78
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,600
- Rabbi...
- Private property cannot be confiscated.

79
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,686
- How long are the schools going to be closed?
- I do not know the answer..

80
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,064
- Article 47: Pillage is formally prohibited.
- You don't know anything!

81
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,024
- I am familiar with the Hague Convention.
- Religious...

82
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:35,404
They come into our house
and tell us we don't live there any more.

83
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,240
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

84
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,576
Please!
I only know what they tell me.

85
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,704
And what they tell me
changes from day to day!

86
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,207
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

87
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,377
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

88
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,213
- What are they going to do about it?
- They will shoot you.

89
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,384
- Why don't you stop this silly talk?
- Itzhak Stern!

90
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,679
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

91
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,350
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

92
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,645
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

93
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,159
There's a company
you did the books for, on Lipowa Street.

94
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,661
Made what?
Pots and pans?

95
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,831
By law, I have to tell you, sir,
I'm a Jew.

96
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,835
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

97
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,342
- A good company, you think?
- Modestly successful.

98
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,594
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you?

99
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,514
I was just
the accountant.

100
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,474
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

101
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,142
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

102
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,770
...you could make other
things, couldn't you?

103
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,733
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

104
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,071
Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now it's great.

105
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,073
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

106
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,952
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

107
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,955
Like what?

108
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,249
I'm sure you'll do just fine,
once you get the contracts.

109
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,334
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

110
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,129
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

111
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,925
Finding the money
to buy the company, that's hard.

112
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,802
You don't have any money?

113
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:26,139
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

114
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,142
Jews, yeah.

115
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,770
Investors.
You must have contacts...

116
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,772
...in the Jewish business community
working here.

117
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,650
What community?
Jews can no longer own businesses.

118
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,736
- That's why this one's in receivership.
- But they wouldn't own it.

119
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,990
I'd own it. I'd pay them
back in product- pots and pans.

120
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,159
- Pots and pans!
- Something they can use.

121
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,828
Something they can
feel in their hands.

122
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,122
They can trade it on the black market,
do whatever they want.

123
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,833
Everybody's happy!

124
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,337
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

125
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,427
Let me understand.

126
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,138
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

127
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,808
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

128
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,935
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

129
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,313
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

130
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,567
That's what I'm good at.
Not the work, not the work.

131
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,069
The presentation!

132
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,383
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

133
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,930
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

134
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,433
Tell them they should be.

135
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,986
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

136
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:09,368
<i>All Jews!
From now on, it's forbidden...</i>

137
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,926
I've got a client who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

138
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,220
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

139
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,305
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

140
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,767
- Wicks, for lamps.
- You have a truckload of wicks?

141
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,894
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?

142
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,896
9 by 12, 9 by 14.

143
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,108
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

144
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,573
-What?
- You don't recognize this?

145
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,075
-It's shoe polish.
-In metal containers?

146
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,118
You asked for shoe polish.

147
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,413
In metal containers.
This is glass, it's not what I asked for.

148
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,455
What's the difference?

149
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,541
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

150
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,295
My client sold it to his client,
who sold it to the German Army.

151
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:06,800
Only by the time it got there, because
of the freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

152
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,302
This is not my problem.

153
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,095
- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

154
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,640
- This is not my problem.
- All right!

155
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,144
The German Army wants
to find out where it came from.

156
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,189
- I am going to make sure they find out.
- Now it's your problem.

157
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,858
You be quiet!

158
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,653
Metal containers.

159
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,072
Hello!

160
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,535
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

161
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,996
Nice shirt.

162
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,374
Do you know
where I can find a nice shirt like that?

163
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,425
Like this?

164
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,720
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

165
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,516
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

166
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,148
Do you have any idea
how much a shirt like this costs?

167
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,068
Nice things cost money.

168
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,541
How many?

169
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,962
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

170
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,757
- This won't be a problem.
- From time to time.

171
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,302
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

172
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:17,014
- Name? Address?
- Fill in the forms!

173
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,933
Go on, go on!
Don't push each other!

174
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,061
- You come here!
- Stay there!

175
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,111
<i>Attention! Attention!
All Jews are enforced...</i>

176
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,698
<i>...to live in the Jewish district.</i>

177
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:21,119
<i>Not getting the residence
from the registry office...</i>

178
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:26,041
<i>...will be against decree 44/91
and judged through the military court.</i>

179
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,964
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing?

180
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:40,138
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

181
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:44,142
Goodbye,Jews!
Goodbye,Jews!

182
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,480
<i>Goodbye, Jews!</i>

183
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:53,277
<i>Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!</i>

184
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,883
Oh, my God!

185
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,845
Oy, God!
Oh, my God!

186
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,937
Oh, my God!

187
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,863
It could not be better.

188
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,533
- It could be worse.
- How? Tell me.

189
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:45,329
How on earth
could it possibly be worse?

190
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,081
<i>Good morning!</i>

191
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,553
- Hey, Goldberg.
- Poldek.

192
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:05,933
- What's this?
- Uh, the Jewis assembly has its own police now.

193
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,644
- You don't say.
- Coordination service!

194
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,396
I'm a policeman now,
could you believe it? It's hard to believe.

195
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,482
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

196
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,609
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

197
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:19,321
Look, maybe I could put in
a good word for you with my superiors.

198
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:23,784
- Your superiors?
- Come on, they're not as bad as everyone says.

199
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,120
Well, they're worse than everyone says,
but it's a lot of money.

200
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,790
A lot of money!

201
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,626
Give me my housing assignment.

202
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:37,130
- Come on.
- You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

203
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,676
You look like a clown, you know?

204
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,391
He's a very important man.

205
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,393
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

206
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:53,313
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen...

207
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,858
...please!
Sir?

208
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,113
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

209
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,156
- Two hundred.
- ... 200 kilos of enamelware a month...

210
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:05,534
...to begin in July
and to continue for one year.

211
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,454
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

212
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,499
- Not good enough.
- It's not good enough!

213
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,626
Not good enough?

214
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,881
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough! "

215
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,675
A couple of months ago
you'd be right, not anymore.

216
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,845
Money's still money.

217
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:30,642
No, it is not!
That's why we are here.

218
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,685
Trade goods...

219
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,271
...that's the only currency
that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

220
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,774
Things have changed, my friend.

221
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,528
Did I call this meeting?

222
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,697
You told Mr Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

223
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,033
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

224
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:51,121
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

225
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:55,918
Forget the whole thing.
Get out!

226
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,634
How do we know
that you will do what you say?

227
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,302
Because I said I would.

228
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,554
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

229
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,974
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

230
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:33,163
Five, six, seven...

231
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,708
...eight, nine...

232
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:53,183
The standard SS rate for Jewish
skilled labourers is seven marks a day...

233
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,061
...five for unskilled and women.

234
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:59,231
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

235
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,942
The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

236
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,446
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.

237
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,116
- Are you listening?
- What was that about the SS?

238
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,451
The rate? The what?

239
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:14,788
The Jewish worker's salary,
you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

240
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,082
- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

241
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,334
- It's less than what I would pay a Pole.
- It's less?

242
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,462
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

243
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,132
Poles cost more.

244
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,344
Why should I hire Poles?

245
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,599
An enamelware factory,
over at, Lipowa Street.

246
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,685
It, uh, it, um...
It's owned by a German.

247
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:40,314
But it's outside the ghetto,
so you can barter for extra goods...

248
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,107
...for eggs, I don't know
what you need...

249
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,901
...with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

250
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:47,613
Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the...

251
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,323
I'm healthy!

252
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,326
Bring your sister, okay?

253
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,002
You need to convince them you have
a trade, something valuable to the war effort.

254
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,463
- Like what?
-I'm a musician. - What if you don't?

255
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,925
- Your name goes on a list.
- Your name is on the list, they put you on trucks...

256
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,093
- No, no, no, that's not true.
- You're a musician?

257
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,888
- Yeah.
- I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

258
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:17,768
- I'm not going to hide like some animal.
- There are places to hide.

259
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,857
The next!

260
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,653
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

261
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:30,447
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow...

262
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,449
Blue card!

263
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:39,957
I'm gonna get the necessary papers
because this card is no good any more.

264
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,668
You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

265
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,296
They are no good.
You'll have to leave the line now...

266
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,968
...then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein,
to say that you are an essential worker.

267
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,304
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

268
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,598
Pharmacist.
Just there, look!

269
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,350
<i>Guess who is here?</i>

270
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,186
Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

271
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,897
- Enjoying the lines?
- Need some shoe polish?

272
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,483
In metal container maybe!

273
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:11,405
Not essential? I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

274
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,782
No blue card, sir.
Stand over there.

275
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,618
Move. Next!

276
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,580
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

277
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:25,878
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

278
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,135
He's metal polisher.

279
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,644
- It was not right?
- It's very good. He's 53 years old.

280
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,981
- It's too new.
-Thank you.

281
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,617
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.

282
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,535
How many times
have I told you?

283
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,747
Your work certificate,
you keep in your pocket at all times.

284
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,582
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

285
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,293
How many times I've told you?

286
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,047
I'm a metal polisher!

287
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,266
<i>Take the round sheet of tin...</i>

288
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,395
...dip it in soap emulsion.

289
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:30,150
<i>Then place it centrally in the press.</i>

290
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,752
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot!

291
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,214
Soup pot!

292
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,509
Grosz, Mrs Grosz, stay together.

293
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:04,518
Look, sir, I have ten work permits here
for the German enamel factory...

294
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,688
...and signed by Mr Bankier
and myself.

295
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:12,609
<i>If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.</i>

296
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:17,239
But don't touch both the electrodes
at the same time.

297
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:20,742
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

298
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,040
Roll the metal
under the press...

299
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,626
...but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

300
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,921
...to become part of the teapot!

301
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:37,801
- Occupation?
- I'm a writer. I play the flute.

302
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:41,221
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

303
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,724
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

304
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,684
He can make whatever
Mr Schindler asks.

305
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,437
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

306
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,148
Moses, give him your card.

307
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:58,280
<i>Now, dip the basin with the tongs
into the enamel solution.</i>

308
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:04,870
<i>And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip-dry.</i>

309
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,251
And whatever he asks you, allow me
just to represent you and speak for you.

310
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,128
Don't say a word!

311
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:16,757
Filing, billing, keeping
track of my appointments, shorthand.

312
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:20,844
- Typing, obviously. How is your typing?
- Uh, all right.

313
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,930
Please!

314
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,653
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

315
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:24,658
I don't know how.
They're all so... qualified.

316
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,661
You have to choose.

317
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,749
Big smile, big smile!

318
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,690
If you would,
look after my guest.

319
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:01,695
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pât? um...

320
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:05,657
...kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar...

321
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,784
...and, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

322
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,370
Get me as many
as you can find.

323
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,456
And some more fresh fruit.

324
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,501
The real rarities,
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

325
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,003
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars.
The best.

326
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,338
And dark unsweetened chocolate...

327
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,757
...not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

328
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,843
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

329
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:28,222
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.

330
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:33,310
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

331
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:37,231
...and, oh,
try to find nylon stockings.

332
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,778
<i>It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...</i>

333
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:48,534
<i>...the fully operational status
of German enamel factory...</i>

334
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:53,247
<i>...manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...</i>

335
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:58,752
<i>...expressly designed
and crafted for military use.</i>

336
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,547
<i>Utilizing only
the most modern equipment...</i>

337
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,677
<i>...D.E.F.'s staff of highly skilled and
experienced artisans and journeymen...</i>

338
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:10,305
<i>...deliver a product
of unparalleled quality...</i>

339
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,351
<i>...enabling me to proffer,
with absolute confidence and pride...</i>

340
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,020
<i>...a full line
of field and kitchenware...</i>

341
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:21,191
<i>...unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.</i>

342
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,528
See attached list
and available colours.

343
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:28,782
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval...

344
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:32,703
...looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association...

345
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:35,914
...I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

346
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,042
...and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

347
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,546
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

348
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:45,382
Nine hundred,
no, make it ten for Wednesday.

349
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:50,429
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's
factory on Tuesday of next week.

350
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:08,572
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life... "

351
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:13,243
"... a good doctor,
a forgiving priest... "

352
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:16,079
"... and a clever accountant. "

353
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,504
The first two,
I've never had much use for.

354
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,090
But the third!

355
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:36,517
Just pretend, for Christ's sake!

356
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,773
Is that all?

357
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,781
I'm trying to thank you.

358
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:55,035
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

359
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,457
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

360
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:05,420
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

361
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,257
You're welcome.

362
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,685
Get out of here!

363
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:36,076
<i>Klonowska, who is it?</i>

364
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,547
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

365
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,311
You know something?
You would like her.

366
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,396
- Oskar, please!
- What?

367
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,857
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.

368
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,651
It doesn't work that way.

369
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,375
You've done well here.

370
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,380
You look wonderful.

371
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,721
- Be careful of the step, miss.
- Mrs Schindler, Marek.

372
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:54,112
- It's not a charade, all this?
- Charade? How could it be a charade?

373
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,906
- The clothes, the car, the apartment.
- Wait a minute.

374
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:59,159
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

375
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,410
Oskar!

376
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:05,582
My father, at the height of his success,
had 50. I've got 350.

377
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,254
350 workers on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

378
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,381
To make pots and pans?

379
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:16,343
To make money.
For me!

380
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,270
Does anyone ask about me?

381
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:33,068
Back home?
Everybody. All the time.

382
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,870
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

383
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,790
"Oskar Schindler"
they'll say.

384
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,460
"Everybody remembers him. "

385
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:54,756
"He did something extraordinary. "

386
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,970
"He did something
no one else did. "

387
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:06,226
"He came here with nothing,
a suitcase...

388
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:12,399
"... and built a bankrupt
company into a major manufactory. "

389
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:15,652
"And left with
a steamer trunk... "

390
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:20,324
"... two steamer trunks
full of money. "

391
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,578
"All the riches of the world. "

392
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,209
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

393
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,670
You're wrong, Emilie.

394
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,798
There's no way I could have
known this before but...

395
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,676
...there was always
something missing.

396
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,847
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

397
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,683
Something was missing.

398
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,354
Even if I'd known what it was,
there's nothing I could have done about it...

399
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:55,025
...because you can't
create this thing.

400
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,364
And it makes all the difference
in the world between success and failure.

401
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,033
Luck?

402
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:08,372
War!

403
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:35,524
Should I stay?

404
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:39,444
It's a beautiful city.

405
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:44,700
I asked you if I should stay.

406
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,495
It's up to you.

407
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:57,087
Promise me, Oskar.
No doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

408
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:02,551
...I'm anyone other
than Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

409
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,014
Goodbye, darling.

410
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,784
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

411
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,745
We're doing well?

412
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,163
- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

413
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,457
- Yes.
- Any reason to think next month will be worse?

414
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,335
The war could end.

415
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,389
- What?
- There is a machinist outside...

416
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,559
...who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

417
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:57,814
Every day he comes. He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

418
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:06,073
Mr Lowenstein!

419
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:16,083
I want to thank you, sir...

420
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:18,836
...for giving me
the opportunity to work.

421
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,880
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

422
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:26,301
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me...

423
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:31,056
...but I am essential
to the war effort, thanks to you.

424
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,141
That's great.

425
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,477
I work hard for you.

426
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:39,940
- I'm sure you do.
- I'll continue to work hard for you.

427
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,984
That's great. Thanks.

428
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,444
- God bless you, sir.
- All right.

429
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:48,282
You are a good man.

430
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,786
- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did.

431
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,415
- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on.

432
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,627
God bless you!

433
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,267
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

434
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,896
This is for the major, sir.

435
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:21,940
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.

436
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,735
- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again.

437
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,404
Go. Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

438
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:31,450
- Did you notice that man had one arm?
- Did he?

439
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:38,373
- What's his use?
- Very useful.

440
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:44,338
- How?
- Very useful! Success!

441
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,826
<i>You'll be given brooms and shovels...</i>

442
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,913
<i>...each of you will grab one
and start cleaning the street.</i>

443
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:20,999
We'll be late for work.

444
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:35,556
You shouldn't
think of them as yours, Oskar.

445
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,558
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

446
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,435
...don't give a damn
about production.

447
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,606
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

448
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,067
...that Jews
be made to shovel snow.

449
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,611
<i>It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.</i>

450
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,780
<i>You know it and I know it.</i>

451
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:54,074
<i>Jews shoveling snow!</i>

452
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,912
<i>It's got a, um,
ritual significance.</i>

453
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:04,001
- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker.

454
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,795
- Essential worker?
- Yes.

455
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,343
- I work for Oskar Schindler.
- Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

456
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:16,847
- A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless!
- Yes, yes.

457
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:20,934
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

458
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,188
<i>I work for Oskar Schindler.</i>

459
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:28,317
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

460
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:36,200
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

461
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,203
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

462
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:42,998
- Would it do any good?
- Of course not!

463
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,504
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office came to lunch...

464
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:52,883
...and he told us that to believe
the Jewish skilled worker had a place...

465
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:57,679
...in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

466
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:05,896
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

467
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,941
He was a metal press operator.

468
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:15,072
Quite skilled.

469
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,144
Mr. Director!

470
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:48,605
Shit. I don't believe it.

471
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,899
Stern, is that you?

472
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:55,153
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

473
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:59,116
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

474
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,285
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

475
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,581
<i>Given name first,
then your surname.</i>

476
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:08,250
<i>Do not bring
your baggage with you.</i>

477
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,211
<i>It will follow you later.</i>

478
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:14,631
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

479
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,508
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

480
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:20,596
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

481
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,015
Stern?

482
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:28,770
- He's on the list.
- He is?

483
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:31,732
- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him.

484
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:34,610
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list.

485
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,571
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

486
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,741
- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list.

487
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:44,912
- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber.

488
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,039
Tauber!

489
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,959
Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

490
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,754
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

491
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,714
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

492
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,883
...and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

493
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,594
-Attention! The train is about to leave.
-Is he on the list?

494
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:04,890
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

495
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:10,729
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

496
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:13,690
- What is your name?
-Close and secure all doors.

497
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,194
- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

498
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,655
- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

499
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,740
- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

500
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:23,951
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

501
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:26,370
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

502
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:29,081
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

503
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,876
...Southern Russia
before the end of the month. Good day.

504
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:37,965
Stern!

505
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:39,967
- Stern!
- Stern!

506
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,052
Itzhak Stern!

507
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,103
Stern!
Itzhak Stern!

508
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,897
- Stern! Stern!
- Itzhak Stern!

509
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:58,652
-Stern!
-Sir!

510
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,906
- Stern!
- Herr Direktor!

511
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,868
My apologies.

512
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:08,871
- Stop the train! He's here!
- I apologize.

513
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:13,917
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

514
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:30,225
Sign here. Initial there.

515
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,688
Makes no difference to us,
you understand. This one, that one.

516
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,065
It's the inconvenience to the list.

517
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,903
- It's the paperwork.
- I somehow left my work card at home.

518
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:44,740
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

519
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:48,911
- ... I'm sorry, it was stupid!
- What if I got here five minutes later?

520
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:51,705
Then where would I be?

521
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:45,736
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

522
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:50,073
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know...

523
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,163
...only to discover I was broke and
sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

524
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,874
- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh.

525
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,585
You are living behind walls.

526
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:06,757
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

527
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,468
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

528
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,763
I like it here.
There's a kind of, I don't know...

529
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:15,140
...ancestral squalor to it all.

530
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:17,392
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more.

531
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:19,603
- I'm smart!
- Oh, yes, you're smart!

532
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,980
- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance.

533
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:26,693
Today, today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

534
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,571
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

535
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,448
When's the last time
we did this?

536
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,034
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

537
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,454
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

538
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,790
No one took my business
away from me.

539
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:41,917
You don't really have
a business to take.

540
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,294
There's nowhere down from here.

541
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,630
This is it.
This is the bottom.

542
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:50,676
The ghetto is,
liberty!

543
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,977
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

544
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:05,440
Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees...

545
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:08,402
...industrial workers and so on.

546
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:13,490
Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour...

547
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:16,326
...the elderly and infirm mostly.

548
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,829
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

549
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,290
Do you have any questions, sir?

550
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:24,751
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

551
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:29,339
We expect a labor force of
25.000 to 30.000.

552
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,759
Segregated of course.
The men in the barracks near the guarry...

553
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,470
-... the women on the other side of the wire.
-My place is where?

554
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,347
-There, sir.
-There?

555
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:40,267
-Yes, the villa.
-You call that a villa?

556
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:42,352
- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa!

557
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:46,273
- We' to turn it into the camp stables.
- It's a house!

558
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:49,401
What's that over there?

559
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,779
Playground.
Fifty-one.

560
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:57,451
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

561
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:03,207
There they are, sir.

562
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,881
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

563
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:14,760
There is an opening for a job...

564
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:18,722
...away from all this,
backbreaking work...

565
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:22,392
...at my new villa.

566
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:23,852
Uh...

567
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:30,067
...which of you has
domestic experience?

568
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:37,282
Yeah, on second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid.

569
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,786
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

570
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:48,460
I don't want
to give you my cold.

571
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,587
Uh, what's your name?

572
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:53,090
- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

573
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,967
Helen Hirsch.

574
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,721
- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch.

575
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,739
- Yes!
- Take it all down!

576
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:19,908
<i>-Back to your work!
-To work!</i>

577
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:24,121
<i>Take it down! It is not safe!</i>

578
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:27,583
She says the foundation was
poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

579
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,752
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

580
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:35,090
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

581
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:39,428
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

582
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,264
...has to be torn down
and repoured.

583
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:45,767
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

584
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,437
...at the southern end
of the barracks.

585
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,106
Subsidence, and then collapse.

586
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,942
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes!

587
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:56,445
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

588
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,906
...of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

589
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:03,452
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

590
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:14,213
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

591
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:18,342
- Shoot her.
- What?

592
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:22,971
Commander!
I'm only trying to do my job.

593
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,640
Yeah, I'm doing mine.

594
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,184
Sir, she's foreman
of construction.

595
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,686
We are not going to have arguments
with these people.

596
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,772
Okay!

597
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:37,152
No!
Shoot her here, on my authority!

598
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:52,960
-It will take more than that.
-I'm sure, you are right!

599
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:04,388
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

600
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:08,725
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

601
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:23,073
<i>Today is history.</i>

602
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:26,994
<i>Today will be remembered.</i>

603
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:34,877
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder about this day.

604
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:40,591
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

605
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,260
Six hundred years ago...

606
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:47,139
<i>...when elsewhere they were putting
the blame for the Black Death...</i>

607
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:50,893
...Kazimiers The Great,
so called...

608
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:54,271
...told the Jews
they could come to Krakow.

609
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,940
- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

610
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:00,152
- Not that fat. No, less.
- They trundled their belongings into the city.

611
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:03,071
- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled...

612
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:07,868
<i>...they took hold.
They prospered...</i>

613
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:13,040
<i>...in business, science,
education, the arts.</i>

614
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:16,126
<i>They came here with nothing.</i>

615
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:18,378
<i>Nothing!</i>

616
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:22,090
<i>And they flourished.</i>

617
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:27,888
<i>For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.</i>

618
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:31,183
<i>Think about that.</i>

619
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,310
<i>By this evening...</i>

620
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:37,606
<i>...those six centuries
are a rumour.</i>

621
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:41,193
They never happened.

622
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:45,280
Today is history!

623
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:08,011
Get off and line up
in a two row!

624
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:11,431
Come on, quicker!

625
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:19,606
I think we will start,
with Ghetto B.

626
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,409
- All right?
- Start from both sides?

627
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,203
- No, no! I would like you to start there.
- The right side?

628
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:35,873
-And then move around.
- All right!

629
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:42,754
<i>Label them clearly.
They will follow you later on.</i>

630
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:47,301
<i>Leave your luggage!</i>

631
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:51,013
<i>Label them clearly.</i>

632
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,683
<i>They'll follow you later on.</i>

633
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,394
- Open up!
- Lakoom.

634
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,462
<i>Come down!</i>

635
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,699
<i>Jews, all out!</i>

636
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:02,334
<i>Put on something warm
and come out.</i>

637
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,801
<i>To Chodi Square!</i>

638
00:59:19,852 --> 00:59:23,313
Gold, Chaim!
Go to Chodi Square.

639
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,650
- Gold, Chaim!
- Yes, Chaim Gold.

640
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:29,152
Shoot him!

641
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,873
<i>Put on something warm
and go to Chodi Square.</i>

642
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:44,084
No baggage!
No baggage!

643
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:48,380
<i>-Go through.
-No baggage! No baggage!</i>

644
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:51,175
Hey, little boy.
How old are you, huh?

645
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,220
Huh, what's your name?
What's your name, huh?

646
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,848
I said, no luggage!

647
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,309
Don't pack, no luggage!

648
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,562
Go to Chodi Square!
Leave your luggage here!

649
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:06,607
- Blue card!
- Chodi Square!

650
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,609
What's this bag doing here?

651
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,737
Everybody to Chodi Square!

652
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:32,216
We're getting out through the sewers.
I have to check if they're clear.

653
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:34,968
- Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger...
- I can't go in the sewers.

654
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,264
I told you
I won't go in the sewers.

655
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:45,771
You can go. Yes, you can.

656
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,691
I won't go in the sewers.

657
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:04,915
-Move!
-Over there! Over there! Move!

658
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:07,251
Your card, Jew?

659
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,419
Your papers, Jew?

660
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:12,381
Your papers, Jew!

661
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,926
That line!

662
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:17,636
Your papers?

663
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:21,098
I'm not going up
because of your goddamn papers!

664
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,561
Your goddamn papers!

665
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,998
Why are you shooting?
Are you crazy?

666
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,709
In this traffic,
you could have shot me!

667
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,961
The bullet passed me by so close!

668
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,922
-Sorry!
-Now you say sorry? You're crazy!

669
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:57,259
<i>Stay away! Stay away!</i>

670
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:05,017
<i>Don't talk, don't talk!
Just go to the trucks!</i>

671
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,020
<i>Keep on walking, keep on walking!
Don't talk!</i>

672
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:19,907
<i>Come here, you fuckin' Jew!</i>

673
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,451
<i>Stand still!
I said, stand still!</i>

674
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:22,636
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

675
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,348
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

676
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:35,524
You can join her,
or join the line.

677
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,698
- Women to the left!
- Wilhelm! - Rose!

678
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,242
-Men to right.
-Women to the left!

679
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,370
- Women to the left.
- Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

680
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:56,837
Women to the left,
and men to the right.

681
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:02,050
Your government
is in the wrong country!

682
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:10,017
Mama! Mama!

683
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:00,234
Mila!

684
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,511
Oh, God, Danka!

685
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,602
- You have a blue card.
- Blue card doesn't matter any more.

686
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:38,981
- They are cleaning out the ghetto.
- There's not enough room for you.

687
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:42,776
What are you talking about? We tried it
before. There's more than enough room.

688
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,863
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!

689
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:50,409
Look at the space in there.
Now look at me. You are just scared.

690
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,744
I can fit the girl, but not you.

691
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:55,289
- Mama, I'm coming out!
- Stay where you are.

692
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,541
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

693
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,668
<i>Mama!</i>

694
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,316
Commander!

695
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:23,984
Very good saluting.

696
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:27,988
I respectfully report I've been given orders
to clear the bundles from the road.

697
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:31,033
So there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

698
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:36,663
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

699
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,521
Mrs. Dresner?

700
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:02,648
Yes.

701
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:05,025
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

702
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,277
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

703
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:11,907
No, get under the stairs. They'll be done
searching soon. You'll be safe there.

704
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,369
- Please hide! Please!
- Warmed by the sun.

705
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:17,871
Hide under the stairs!

706
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,501
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

707
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:26,630
- Okay, then we're going to the next block.
-Understood!

708
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:36,139
- Danka!
- Mama!

709
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,730
Hello, Adam.

710
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:45,983
Hello, Danka.

711
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:55,909
Come with me.
I will put you in the good line.

712
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,914
Do you know the saying,
"An hour of life is still life"?

713
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:05,252
You are not a boy any more.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

714
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:45,769
Oh, please, let's go.
Let's go, please!

715
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:47,938
Come on!

716
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,800
Mark it...

717
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:00,928
...mark it!

718
01:12:27,764 --> 01:12:31,852
- What is it? Is it Bach?
- No, no. It's Mozart.

719
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:33,979
- Mozart?
- Yes!

720
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:57,211
- Can we still manage today?
- No way!

721
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,967
We can't manage it.

722
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:07,554
I wish this fucking
night were over.

723
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:49,221
<i>Appeal!
Line up! In rows of five!</i>

724
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:52,099
<i>Line up!</i>

725
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:56,687
<i>Line up!</i>

726
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:01,733
<i>Come on, in rows of five!</i>

727
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,152
Caps off!

728
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,573
Sort the names!

729
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:11,326
Those who're announced will raise
their hands and shout a clear "Yes"!

730
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,121
<i>Yes!</i>

731
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:17,791
<i>Yes!</i>

732
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,128
- Keller, Fanni!
- Yes!

733
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:25,674
- Adalbert, Hermann!
- Yes!

734
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:28,135
- Faber, Dorothea!
- Yes!

735
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:31,638
- Goldstein, Pola!
- Yes!

736
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:35,142
-Warmberger, Markus!
-Yes!

737
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:39,313
Edelstein, Max!

738
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,833
Disband!

739
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:05,547
The worst is over.
We are workers now.

740
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,790
<i>No excuses!</i>

741
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:47,714
Oh, God, Amon!

742
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:56,640
<i>Go to your barracks immediately!</i>

743

<i>Come here, come here!</i>

744
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:44,104
<i>Come on, come here!</i>

745
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:50,068
Amon, you're
such a damned fuckin' child!

746
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,613
Wakey, wakey.

747
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:05,876
- Make coffee.
- Make it yourself.

748
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:25,437
<i>The SS will manage
certain industries itself inside Plaszow.</i>

749
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:27,898
<i>A metalworks, brush factory...</i>

750
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:31,151
<i>...another for reprocessing
jewish clothing from the ghettos...</i>

751
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,779
<i>...for use by
bombed-out families back home.</i>

752
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:37,199
But it's private industry like yours
that stands to benefit most...

753
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:39,993
...by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

754
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:42,621
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

755
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,164
Good to see you, my friend.

756
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:47,251
- Oskar Schindler.
- Leo John.

757
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,757
- Franz, good to see you.
- Hello, Oskar. Glad you could join us.

758
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:57,427
- My pleasure. Julius.
- How are you? You lost weight.

759
01:17:57,511 --> 01:18:01,390
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

760
01:18:01,473 --> 01:18:04,142
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

761
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:09,273
- We started without you.
- Fine. I miss anything good?

762
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:12,609
I was explaining to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch...

763
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:15,529
...some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

764
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:18,240
I meant the food.

765
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:24,329
Since your labour is housed on-site,
it's available to you at all times.

766
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,082
You can work them
all night if you want.

767
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:31,628
Your factory policies, whatever they've
been in the past, they'll continue to be.

768
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,839
They'll be respected.

769
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:38,177
I have to know, where do you get a suit
like that? What is that? Is that silk?

770
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,220
Of course!

771
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:44,600
Yeah, it's, it has a nice sheen
about it.

772
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:46,560
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

773
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:50,397
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man
who made it is probably dead.

774
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,066
I don't know.

775
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,820
<i>I go to work the other day.</i>

776
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,989
<i>Nobody's there.</i>

777
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:02,743
<i>Nobody tells me about this.
I have to find out. I have to go in.</i>

778
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:06,413
<i>Everybody's gone.</i>

779
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:08,582
No!

780
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:11,585
No!

781
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:16,840
They're not gone.
They're here.

782
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:22,012
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

783
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:24,932
Every worker that is shot costs me money.
I have to find somebody else.

784
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:25,807
I have to trade them!

785
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:28,977
We are going to be making so much
money that none of this is going to matter.

786
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:32,523
It's bad business.

787
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,369
Thank you.

788
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,996
Leave the bottle.

789
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:51,458
Take that.

790
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:55,170
Lena, thank you.

791
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:07,891
Scherner told me
something else about you.

792
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:12,104
Yeah? What's that?

793
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:16,942
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude. "

794
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:20,445
That it's not some vague thing with you...

795
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:23,782
...like it is with others.

796
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:27,327
You want to stay where you are.

797
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:30,539
You've got things
going on the side.

798
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,708
Things are good.

799
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:37,337
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

800
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:41,884
I can understand all that,
you know? I know you.

801
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:49,266
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

802
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:57,983
Do you have any idea what is involved?
The paperwork alone?

803
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:02,571
You've got to build the fucking thing. Getting
the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

804
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:06,366
Then the engineers show up, they stand
around, they argue about drainage, foundations...

805
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:11,830
...codes, exact specifications, fences 4
kilometres long, 1,200 kilograms of barbed wire...

806
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:15,167
...6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators...

807
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,835
...three cubic metres
of air space per prisoner.

808
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:21,089
I'm telling you, you want to shoot
somebody. I've been through it. I know.

809
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:24,927
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

810
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:30,140
You could make things
easier for me.

811
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:35,103
I'd be grateful.

812
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,984
<i>Clear the road!</i>

813
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:55,040
<i>Keep moving!
Keep moving!</i>

814
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:04,007
<i>-Keep moving!
-Turn left!</i>

815
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:12,933
Where's Stern?

816
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:20,148
Goldberg and Chilowicz,
make sure I see my cut...

817
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:23,735
...from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp...

818
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:27,155
...leaving you to take care
of my main account...

819
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:30,534
...the Schindler account.

820
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:34,746
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

821
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,749
But independence costs money.

822
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,669
This you understand?

823
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,092
Look at me!

824
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,899
Don't forget
who you are working for now.

825
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,494
<i>- Yes!
- Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard!</i>

826
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,332
<i>Yes!
Now, girls, everyone.</i>

827
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,837
- We need more wine.
- More wine!

828
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:27,466
<i>Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.</i>

829
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:47,027
- What happens in life...
-Cheers, cheers!

830
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:52,032
Thank you, Mr. Director.

831
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:54,117
Cheers, Mr. Director!

832
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:01,750
- What are you doing?
- What? Scratching my head.

833
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:06,296
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps make them keep their distance.

834
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,882
- Do you have lice?
- Do you have your notebook?

835
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:12,594
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays
of our SS friends' wives and children.

836
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:15,013
Don't forget to send something.

837
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:18,642
Record pay-offs to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Armaments...

838
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:21,186
- Slowly, Stern, slowly.
- The Armaments Board...

839
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:25,732
...Governor General's Division of the
Interior and Chief of Police as "fees"...

840
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:27,901
...and make them
on the first of each month...

841
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:30,404
...as opposed to individual pay-offs
to our SS contacts.

842
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:32,531
The list is
in the lower drawer of my desk...

843
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:35,659
-... which you...
-"First of month... "

844
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:38,412
SS contacts: List, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle...

845
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:42,875
...as cash contributions to legitimate
charities sent to each official's office.

846
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:46,378
Dealings with our black market contacts,
listed as suppliers...

847
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:49,423
-... in the legitimate ledger, are more complicated.
- Forget it!

848
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:53,927
- What do you mean, you can't forget it!
- It gives me a headache!

849
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:04,062
- I couldn't get you out of here.
- I'll be all right.

850
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:08,483
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

851
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:12,154
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

852
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:17,576
Here,
put these in your pocket.

853
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:19,703
Come on!

854
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:28,212
Mr. Director, don't let things fall apart.
I've worked too hard.

855
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:41,183
Thanks for...
Good luck!

856
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:05,415
Attention! Caps off!

857
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:18,136
-Work!
-Back to work!

858
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:36,363
-What are you making?
-Hinges, sir!

859
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:42,244
Yeah, I've got some workers coming in
tomorrow. Where are they from again?

860
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:44,413
Yugoslavia, Mr. Commander!

861
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:47,040
I've got to make room.

862
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:52,963
- Make me a hinge.
- Yes, sir!

863
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:27,414
Keep going, you're doing well.

864
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:29,583
Says he's doing well.

865
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:38,926
Oh, that's very good.

866
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:42,763
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

867
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:46,475
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

868
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:51,104
.. since I think, what,
about 6.00 this morning?

869
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:56,276
Yet such a small pile of hinges.

870
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:28,392
- Oh, Christ.
- May I try that, sir?

871
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,644
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

872
01:28:30,727 --> 01:28:34,064
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.

873
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:36,650
- Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
- Yeah, come on.

874
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,903
What did I just say?
Here.

875
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:43,991
Mr. Commander!

876
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:49,580
I beg to report that my heap
of hinges was so unsatisfactory...

877
01:28:49,621 --> 01:28:53,667
...because the machines
were being recalibrated this morning.

878
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:58,589
I was put on to shoveling coal.

879
01:29:22,446 --> 01:29:24,531
Strange, huh?

880
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:26,575
Yeah!

881
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:34,541
Thank you, Muek.

882
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:38,337
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

883
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,297
- Squad leader!
- Oh, for me?

884
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:44,092
-Oh, thank you very much, Mr Director.
-Mr. Director!

885
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:46,720
Mr. Director!

886
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,850
Mr. Director!

887
01:29:53,727 --> 01:29:54,895
<i>He was making hinges slowly.</i>

888
01:29:54,937 --> 01:30:00,192
So the man can turn out a hinge in
less than a minute. Why the long story?

889
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:32,015
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome!

890
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:39,064
- Nobody knows who stole the chicken?
- Tell him about the chicken.

891
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:43,944
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

892
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,613
Save yourselves.

893
01:30:46,697 --> 01:30:49,116
<i>Tell him about the chicken.</i>

894
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,884
Still nobody knows?

895
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,316
It was you!
You committed this crime!

896
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:24,818
- No, sir.
- But you know who, though.

897
01:31:24,902 --> 01:31:27,154
- Yes.
- Who?

898
01:31:28,197 --> 01:31:30,282
Him!

899
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:37,664
- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

900
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:44,338
Sir, thank you.

901
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:53,263
- Thank you again, Mr. Director!
- You're welcome again.

902
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,849
It's an honour to work
for such a great company.

903
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:56,892
It's great to have you!

904
01:31:56,975 --> 01:32:00,604
I promise to learn everything there's
to know about enamelware production.

905
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:02,189
That's great!

906
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:18,121
- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

907
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:20,916
She wants to speak
to Mr. Director.

908
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:42,646
Yes.

909
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,695
He won't see you.

910
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,935
Please, sit down.

911
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:28,275
- Pernod? Cognac?
- Uh, no. No, thank you.

912
01:33:29,193 --> 01:33:32,738
So, what can I do for you?

913
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:39,328
They say that no one dies here.

914
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:42,998
They say your factory is a haven.

915
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:46,960
They say you are good.

916
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:52,174
Who says that?

917
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:54,426
Everyone.

918
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:03,227
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

919
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:06,897
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since the ghetto massacre.

920
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,565
My parents are in Plaszow.

921
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:13,153
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

922
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:16,907
They are older people. They are killing
older people now in Plaszow.

923
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:21,286
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

924
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:24,081
...I don't have any money.

925
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:27,626
I, I borrowed these clothes.

926
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,839
I'm begging you.

927
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:35,759
Please, please
bring them here.

928
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:38,345
I don't do that.

929
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:42,140
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

930
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:45,727
Whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

931
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:48,313
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

932
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:52,901
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

933
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:57,114
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God!

934
01:35:06,707 --> 01:35:09,459
People die.
It's a fact of life.

935
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:13,172
He wants to kill everybody? Great!
What am I supposed to do about it?

936
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:16,008
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

937
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,052
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

938
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:22,890
His place is a haven,
didn't you know? It's not a factory.

939
01:35:22,973 --> 01:35:25,225
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

940
01:35:25,309 --> 01:35:28,020
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

941
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:31,565
...and people with
no skills whatsoever!

942
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:35,903
You think
I don't know what you're doing?

943
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:39,573
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

944
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:42,367
- Are you losing money?
- That's not the point!

945
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:47,748
- What other point is...
- It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

946
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:54,254
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.

947
01:35:54,338 --> 01:35:57,591
You have to think of it
in his situation.

948
01:35:58,008 --> 01:36:00,594
He's got this
whole place to run.

949
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:03,388
He's responsible
for everything here, all these people.

950
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:06,808
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

951
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:10,854
And he's got the war
which brings out the worst in people.

952
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:14,441
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

953
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:21,281
But in normal circumstances he
wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

954
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:24,826
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which...

955
01:36:25,661 --> 01:36:28,622
He's a wonderful crook.

956
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:33,085
A man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies, making money...

957
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:35,462
Killing!

958
01:36:35,546 --> 01:36:38,298
He can't enjoy it.

959
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:41,468
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

960
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:44,596
...from a work detail
outside the wire.

961
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,350
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

962
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:52,396
He shot the man to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right of him.

963
01:36:52,437 --> 01:36:56,358
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

964
01:37:01,446 --> 01:37:03,949
Twenty-five!

965
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:11,540
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Nothing, nothing.

966
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:13,959
We're just talking.

967
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:27,556
"Perlman. "

968
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:31,268
Perlman!

969
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:34,146
Husband and wife.

970
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:38,442
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

971
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:54,583
Have Goldberg bring them over.

972
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,880
<i>Caps off!</i>

973
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:02,090
<i>Ready for inspection!</i>

974
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:53,934
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

975
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:57,855
Mr. Director, I was just
helping Lisiek to find something...

976
01:38:57,938 --> 01:39:00,941
...to clean the stains
from the Commander's bathtub.

977
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:03,944
- Go clean it.
- Pardon me, Sir!

978
01:39:07,531 --> 01:39:10,868
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

979
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:13,829
You know who I am?

980
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,215
I'm Schindler.

981
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:28,844
Of course. I, I have heard and...

982
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:32,181
...you have been here before.

983
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:36,727
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

984
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:40,314
- Go on, take it.
- I get extra food here.

985
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:45,819
Well, if you don't want to eat it,
trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

986
01:39:47,905 --> 01:39:50,282
Why not build yourself up?

987
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:58,707
My first day here, he beat me...

988
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:02,794
...because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

989
01:40:05,839 --> 01:40:10,511
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

990
01:40:10,594 --> 01:40:13,305
...he asked me where they were.

991
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:20,395
For his dogs, you understand?

992
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:26,735
I said to him, I,
I don't know how I say this.

993
01:40:26,818 --> 01:40:30,322
I never could say it now,
I said to him...

994
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:33,825
..."Why are you beating me?"

995
01:40:36,078 --> 01:40:39,748
He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

996
01:40:39,831 --> 01:40:44,086
...is because you ask
why I beat you. "

997
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:48,590
I know your sufferings, Helen.

998
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:53,428
It doesn't matter.

999
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:58,100
I have accepted them.

1000
01:40:58,183 --> 01:41:00,435
Accepted them?

1001
01:41:02,271 --> 01:41:04,022
One day he will shoot me.

1002
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:06,942
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1003
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:10,696
I know. I see things.

1004
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:14,283
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I...

1005
01:41:14,366 --> 01:41:18,287
and we saw the Commander
come out of the front door and...

1006
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:23,208
...and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and...

1007
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:28,213
...and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1008
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:31,633
...shot a woman
who was passing by.

1009
01:41:32,718 --> 01:41:35,971
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1010
01:41:36,054 --> 01:41:39,725
Just-Just a woman
on her way somewhere, you know.

1011
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:43,520
She was no fatter or thinner...

1012
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:46,023
...or slower or faster
than anyone else...

1013
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:51,236
...and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1014
01:41:54,615 --> 01:41:58,076
The more you see
of the Commander...

1015
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,415
...the more you see there is
no set rules that you can live by.

1016
01:42:03,707 --> 01:42:09,588
You can't say to yourself,
"If I follow these rules, I will be safe. "

1017
01:42:12,007 --> 01:42:16,261
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you too much.

1018
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:20,557
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you wear the star.

1019
01:42:20,641 --> 01:42:25,979
He doesn't want anyone else
to know, it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1020
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:35,739
He shot the woman from the steps
because she meant nothing to him.

1021
01:42:36,073 --> 01:42:42,204
She was one of a series
neither offending or pleasing him.

1022
01:42:44,665 --> 01:42:47,835
But you, Helen!

1023
01:42:51,713 --> 01:42:57,010
It's all right.
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1024
01:43:01,932 --> 01:43:03,809
Thank you!

1025
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:10,482
Here!

1026
01:43:16,363 --> 01:43:18,824
Right, the wine!

1027
01:43:25,747 --> 01:43:29,501
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1028
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:40,679
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1029
01:43:40,762 --> 01:43:43,515
I send you
good stuff all the time.

1030
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:47,519
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1031
01:43:47,603 --> 01:43:50,355
You know, I look at you...

1032
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:52,941
...I watch you!

1033
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:56,695
You're never drunk.

1034
01:43:57,738 --> 01:44:00,407
Oh, that's...

1035
01:44:00,574 --> 01:44:03,577
...that's real control.

1036
01:44:03,744 --> 01:44:06,121
Control is power.

1037
01:44:06,955 --> 01:44:09,458
That's power.

1038
01:44:13,086 --> 01:44:17,174
Is that why they fear us?

1039
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:21,929
We have the fucking power to kill,
that's why they fear us.

1040
01:44:22,137 --> 01:44:25,933
They fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1041
01:44:26,016 --> 01:44:28,185
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1042
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:30,896
We have him killed,
and we feel pretty good about it.

1043
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:35,234
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1044
01:44:36,318 --> 01:44:39,238
That's not power, though.

1045
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:44,076
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1046
01:44:46,411 --> 01:44:51,583
Power is when we have
every justification to kill...

1047
01:44:51,667 --> 01:44:54,253
...and we don't.

1048
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:57,130
You think that's power?

1049
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:02,219
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something...

1050
01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:03,887
...he's brought in
before the emperor...

1051
01:45:03,971 --> 01:45:08,100
...he throws himself
down on the ground, he begs for mercy.

1052
01:45:08,183 --> 01:45:11,728
He knows he's going to die.

1053
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:17,901
And the emperor, pardons him.

1054
01:45:18,318 --> 01:45:22,531
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1055
01:45:25,033 --> 01:45:28,036
I think you are drunk.

1056
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:32,082
That's power, Amon.

1057
01:45:32,165 --> 01:45:36,128
That, is power!

1058
01:45:43,177 --> 01:45:47,097
Amon the good!

1059
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:52,060
I pardon you!

1060
01:45:59,318 --> 01:46:00,444
What do they want?

1061
01:46:00,527 --> 01:46:03,906
I don't know, but they're in my office
right now reviewing our books.

1062
01:46:03,989 --> 01:46:07,326
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1063
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:10,078
...that the auditors
are reviewing my books?

1064
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,831
- Or have you done your job properly?
- You needn't be alarmed.

1065
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:15,125
I needn't be alarmed!

1066
01:46:19,505 --> 01:46:22,508
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Do you know how much this saddle is worth?

1067
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:25,969
Do you know how much it costs?

1068
01:46:29,973 --> 01:46:31,975
All right!

1069
01:46:33,644 --> 01:46:35,729
All right!

1070
01:46:39,066 --> 01:46:42,778
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1071
01:46:51,995 --> 01:46:54,831
<i>Barracks one, eleven...</i>

1072
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:57,459
<i>...fifteen and thirty-two...</i>

1073
01:46:57,543 --> 01:47:00,671
<i>...apply to inspection area.</i>

1074
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,327
She was smoking on the job.

1075
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:38,250
Tell her not to do it again.

1076
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:56,435
I have to report, sir...

1077
01:47:56,852 --> 01:48:01,231
...I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1078
01:48:04,484 --> 01:48:08,655
- What are you using, Lisiek?
- Soap, Commander.

1079
01:48:10,574 --> 01:48:13,577
Soap? Not lye?

1080
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:26,507
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1081
01:48:48,362 --> 01:48:51,073
I pardon you!

1082
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:45,938
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1083
01:50:46,021 --> 01:50:48,732
...I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me...

1084
01:50:48,815 --> 01:50:51,902
...if I intone the blessings.

1085
01:51:44,329 --> 01:51:46,665
So...

1086
01:51:47,708 --> 01:51:51,044
...this is where you come
to hide from me.

1087
01:51:51,336 --> 01:51:54,673
I came to tell you...

1088
01:51:54,965 --> 01:52:01,722
...that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook and a well-trained servant.

1089
01:52:01,722 --> 01:52:06,143
I mean it. If you need a reference
after the war...

1090
01:52:06,226 --> 01:52:11,565
...I'd be, I'd be happy
to give you one.

1091
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:13,901
It must get lonely down here
when you're..

1092
01:52:13,984 --> 01:52:19,031
...listening to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1093
01:52:25,245 --> 01:52:27,497
Does it?

1094
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:31,668
You can answer.

1095
01:52:33,587 --> 01:52:38,008
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking:

1096
01:52:38,091 --> 01:52:41,094
"What does he want to hear?"

1097
01:52:46,266 --> 01:52:51,396
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1098
01:52:53,106 --> 01:52:55,692
Yes, you're right.

1099
01:52:55,776 --> 01:52:59,196
Sometimes
we're both lonely.

1100
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:02,282
Yes. I...

1101
01:53:03,534 --> 01:53:06,578
...I mean...

1102
01:53:12,793 --> 01:53:16,213
...I would like so much to...

1103
01:53:16,296 --> 01:53:20,843
...reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1104
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:25,013
Wh- what would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1105
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:28,100
...what would be wrong with that?

1106
01:53:28,183 --> 01:53:31,895
I realize that you're not
a-a person in the...

1107
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:36,149
...the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1108
01:53:36,567 --> 01:53:39,820
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know, maybe what's...

1109
01:53:40,028 --> 01:53:43,407
...what's wrong isn't...

1110
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:46,076
...it's not us!

1111
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,579
It's, no, it's this!

1112
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:55,169
I mean, when they
compare you to...

1113
01:53:55,252 --> 01:53:59,423
...to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1114
01:54:02,134 --> 01:54:04,636
...I just, uh...

1115
01:54:07,181 --> 01:54:10,142
No, no, you,
you make a good point.

1116
01:54:10,225 --> 01:54:13,645
You make a very good point.

1117
01:54:21,028 --> 01:54:24,406
Is this the face of a rat?

1118
01:54:26,575 --> 01:54:30,704
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1119
01:54:32,289 --> 01:54:35,501
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1120
01:54:50,432 --> 01:54:55,604
I feel for you, Helen.

1121
01:55:11,453 --> 01:55:14,581
No, I don't think so.

1122
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:19,419
You're a Jewish bitch!

1123
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:25,175
You nearly talked me into it,
didn't you?

1124
01:55:29,596 --> 01:55:32,182
Bravo!

1125
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:57,958
-Bravo!
- Cheers! Cheers!

1126
01:56:06,466 --> 01:56:12,848
On behalf of the, of the workers, sir,
I, I wish for you a happy birthday.

1127
01:56:12,931 --> 01:56:14,558
Happy birthday!

1128
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:16,185
Well, the staff, please.

1129
01:56:16,268 --> 01:56:20,272
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1130
01:56:38,707 --> 01:56:43,212
Thank you very much.
Tell them "Thank you" from me.

1131
01:56:58,435 --> 01:57:03,023
The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

1132
01:57:03,106 --> 01:57:07,277
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1133
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:11,323
One was marked "Cloak Room"
and the other "Valuables. "

1134
01:57:11,406 --> 01:57:13,825
And there they
were made to undress.

1135
01:57:13,909 --> 01:57:18,455
A Jewish boy handed them pieces
of string to tie their shoes together.

1136
01:57:18,956 --> 01:57:21,208
They shaved their hair.

1137
01:57:21,291 --> 01:57:26,213
They told them it was needed to make
something special for U-boat crews.

1138
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:30,551
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1139
01:57:30,634 --> 01:57:34,721
...to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors...

1140
01:57:34,805 --> 01:57:38,725
...and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room"

1141
01:57:38,809 --> 01:57:41,019
SS gave them soap.

1142
01:57:41,103 --> 01:57:46,859
They told them to breathe all the time
because it's good for disinfecting.

1143
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:50,279
And then they gassed them.

1144
01:57:50,445 --> 01:57:53,615
Mila, why soaps?

1145
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:55,617
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1146
01:57:55,701 --> 01:57:59,454
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1147
01:57:59,538 --> 01:58:01,999
- I just don't believe it.
-Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1148
01:58:02,082 --> 01:58:04,126
- I don't believe it either.
- I cannot believe it.

1149
01:58:04,209 --> 01:58:07,671
-I didn't say I believed it. I said I heard it.
-From who?

1150
01:58:07,754 --> 01:58:10,507
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1151
01:58:10,591 --> 01:58:15,262
You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.

1152
01:58:15,512 --> 01:58:18,682
- Yes!
- It doesn't make any sense.

1153
01:58:18,765 --> 01:58:20,851
We're their workforce.

1154
01:58:20,934 --> 01:58:24,688
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?

1155
01:58:24,771 --> 01:58:29,693
To go to all this trouble
of assembling a workforce only to...

1156
01:58:29,776 --> 01:58:33,197
No, it can't be true.

1157
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:36,408
We are very, very
important for them.

1158
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:39,536
Yes, we do now!
Goodnight.

1159
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:43,165
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

1160
01:58:51,632 --> 01:58:54,259
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

1161
01:58:54,343 --> 01:58:56,720
<i>Everyone who is alive...</i>

1162
01:58:56,803 --> 01:59:00,349
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1163
01:59:00,432 --> 01:59:04,895
- Attention, attention!
- We have to go to the roll-call area!

1164
01:59:04,978 --> 01:59:06,730
- Everyone who is alive...
The list makers are here.

1165
01:59:06,772 --> 01:59:09,483
- ... is to come to the roll-call area.
- There is going to be a selection.

1166
01:59:09,525 --> 01:59:13,987
<i>Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...</i>

1167
01:59:14,071 --> 01:59:17,991
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1168
01:59:32,506 --> 01:59:34,132
-Gentlemen!
-Gentlemen!

1169
01:59:38,095 --> 01:59:40,222
100.000 Hungarian is coming.

1170
01:59:42,349 --> 01:59:46,270
<i>All stand in a single row!</i>

1171
01:59:46,353 --> 01:59:50,440
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1172
01:59:50,524 --> 01:59:53,110
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1173
01:59:53,193 --> 01:59:56,113
Morning.
What's going on?

1174
01:59:56,196 --> 01:59:59,116
It's another
semi-annual physical.

1175
02:00:00,993 --> 02:00:05,789
- There!
-I've got another shipment coming in of...

1176
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:08,000
What are they this time?

1177
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:10,043
- Hungarians.
- Oh, yeah, Hungarians!

1178
02:00:10,127 --> 02:00:14,673
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1179
02:01:12,523 --> 02:01:14,149
Look alive, Rebeka.

1180
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:16,318
<i>Quicker!</i>

1181
02:01:36,964 --> 02:01:39,550
That's my mechanic.

1182
02:01:39,842 --> 02:01:43,303
Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1183
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,203
No, no, no!
Wait, go away. She can work.

1184
02:02:49,286 --> 02:02:52,998
Come here. Look,
separate the sick from the healthy.

1185
02:02:53,081 --> 02:02:55,459
Those who can work
and those who can't. She can work.

1186
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:59,838
You can work, you can come.

1187
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:41,129
<i>On your feet!
On your feet!</i>

1188
02:04:24,923 --> 02:04:30,345
Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

1189
02:04:30,429 --> 02:04:35,434
- Go back to the barracks.
- Return to the barracks.

1190
02:04:41,023 --> 02:04:43,150
<i>Go back to the barracks!</i>

1191
02:04:46,653 --> 02:04:49,281
Oh, my God!

1192
02:05:11,303 --> 02:05:15,724
- Olek? Olek?
- Danka?

1193
02:05:15,807 --> 02:05:20,771
Olek? Olek?

1194
02:05:20,854 --> 02:05:24,316
Olek! Olek!

1195
02:05:30,572 --> 02:05:33,492
- Olek?
- Danka?

1196
02:05:33,575 --> 02:05:35,494
- Danka?
- Olek?

1197
02:05:35,577 --> 02:05:38,622
Back to the barracks!
Go back to your barracks!

1198
02:05:39,248 --> 02:05:42,709
- I didn't see him!
- They're hiding. I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1199
02:05:42,793 --> 02:05:46,338
I know Danka. She knows a good place.
She took all of them together.

1200
02:05:46,421 --> 02:05:49,132
<i>Back to the barracks!</i>

1201
02:06:08,694 --> 02:06:14,366
Find your own hiding place. There's
no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1202
02:06:37,848 --> 02:06:41,602
Get out. This is our place.
Get out!

1203
02:07:04,666 --> 02:07:08,003
- Oskar!
- Amon! Gentlemen!

1204
02:07:08,086 --> 02:07:11,423
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1205
02:07:11,507 --> 02:07:14,301
- Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch!
- Oskar!

1206
02:07:14,384 --> 02:07:17,137
They're running a little late.
It's taking longer than I thought.

1207
02:07:17,221 --> 02:07:20,098
- A drink?
- Something cold. Bowle.

1208
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:22,768
The Bowle!

1209
02:07:24,436 --> 02:07:27,648
Oh, another beautiful day.

1210
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:43,247
The loading of the
transport wagons is finished.

1211
02:07:43,247 --> 02:07:45,666
We can start!

1212
02:07:45,749 --> 02:07:48,210
Water! Water!

1213
02:07:48,293 --> 02:07:51,380
Water, water!

1214
02:07:58,804 --> 02:08:01,682
- To your health!
- Oh, thank you.

1215
02:08:07,563 --> 02:08:12,818
What do you say we get your fire hoses out
here and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1216
02:08:15,779 --> 02:08:17,948
Indulge me!

1217
02:08:19,408 --> 02:08:21,159
- Hujar!
- Yes, sir!

1218
02:08:21,243 --> 02:08:25,289
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1219
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:32,004
<i>In the windows.
That's it, that's it.</i>

1220
02:08:32,087 --> 02:08:36,216
<i>On the roof. That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.</i>

1221
02:08:39,303 --> 02:08:42,973
Come on. Come on.

1222
02:08:43,056 --> 02:08:44,975
That's it, more, more!

1223
02:08:49,897 --> 02:08:53,150
That's it, that's it.
More, more!

1224
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:56,904
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1225
02:08:56,987 --> 02:09:00,741
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!

1226
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:04,328
Come on, try and
reach the far end. Look out!

1227
02:09:04,411 --> 02:09:07,414
<i>Water!- More water!</i>

1228
02:09:11,043 --> 02:09:13,629
I've got some 200 metre
hoses back in Emalia.

1229
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:15,631
I have 20 metres
at home in my garden.

1230
02:09:15,714 --> 02:09:17,883
We can reach the cars at the end.

1231
02:09:17,966 --> 02:09:20,427
What? What?

1232
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:27,601
- Hujar!
- Yeah, sure.

1233
02:09:46,119 --> 02:09:48,413
Don't forget the roof!

1234
02:09:48,497 --> 02:09:51,291
On the roof
on the other side.

1235
02:09:51,375 --> 02:09:55,712
<i>Water!</i>

1236
02:09:58,173 --> 02:10:01,009
Lieutenant,
every time the train stops...

1237
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:02,803
...you open the doors,
you give them water, yeah?

1238
02:10:02,886 --> 02:10:06,098
- Okay!
- Okay!. This car! This car!

1239
02:10:30,622 --> 02:10:33,959
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1240
02:10:34,042 --> 02:10:38,839
- You should be aware of that.
- We will have to risk regret.

1241
02:10:38,922 --> 02:10:43,302
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1242
02:11:18,587 --> 02:11:20,506
What about you?

1243
02:11:20,589 --> 02:11:24,176
I violated
the Race and Resettlement Act.

1244
02:11:24,384 --> 02:11:28,514
Though I doubt anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1245
02:11:28,597 --> 02:11:31,934
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1246
02:11:35,604 --> 02:11:38,524
Did your prick fall off?

1247
02:11:57,084 --> 02:12:00,295
<i>He likes women.</i>

1248
02:12:01,296 --> 02:12:05,425
He likes good-looking women.

1249
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:10,347
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1250
02:12:12,891 --> 02:12:15,978
I mean,
he has so many women.

1251
02:12:16,061 --> 02:12:18,188
And they love him.

1252
02:12:18,272 --> 02:12:21,275
Yeah, they love him.
I mean, he is married, yeah, but he's...

1253
02:12:22,609 --> 02:12:26,488
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1254
02:12:26,572 --> 02:12:30,284
But you didn't see this girl.

1255
02:12:30,367 --> 02:12:33,787
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof...

1256
02:12:33,871 --> 02:12:36,164
...she was very good-looking.

1257
02:12:40,127 --> 02:12:42,629
They cast a spell on you,
you know, the Jews.

1258
02:12:42,713 --> 02:12:45,048
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1259
02:12:45,132 --> 02:12:49,094
They have this power. It's like a virus.
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1260
02:12:49,178 --> 02:12:51,388
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1261
02:12:51,471 --> 02:12:54,474
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1262
02:12:54,558 --> 02:12:58,020
It's a matter of money?

1263
02:12:58,228 --> 02:13:00,814
You're offering me a bribe?

1264
02:13:02,316 --> 02:13:07,946
A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1265
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,281
Heil Hitler!

1266
02:13:13,744 --> 02:13:15,996
Hello, Amon!

1267
02:13:19,541 --> 02:13:21,210
Sit down!

1268
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:27,132
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1269
02:13:27,216 --> 02:13:29,468
You should kiss us, not them.

1270
02:13:29,551 --> 02:13:33,430
God forbid you ever get
a real taste for Jewish skirt.

1271
02:13:33,514 --> 02:13:36,934
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1272
02:13:37,559 --> 02:13:41,855
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1273
02:13:41,939 --> 02:13:44,775
It's policy now.

1274
02:13:45,567 --> 02:13:49,530
<i>Yeah, beautiful, good!</i>

1275
02:13:55,244 --> 02:13:59,456
-Again, yes!
-Good!

1276
02:14:30,529 --> 02:14:31,780
<i>Come on faster!</i>

1277
02:14:31,864 --> 02:14:35,784
<i>Be quick!</i>

1278
02:14:35,868 --> 02:14:38,203
<i>Move your ass!</i>

1279
02:14:40,163 --> 02:14:41,498
It could be done quicker!

1280
02:14:41,582 --> 02:14:43,917
<i>Hurry up, don't sleep!</i>

1281
02:14:44,001 --> 02:14:48,130
<i>Only the whole pieces,
leave the small parts!</i>

1282
02:14:53,969 --> 02:14:55,554
What's going on here?

1283
02:14:55,637 --> 02:14:57,931
You can do it with your hands,
quick!

1284
02:14:58,724 --> 02:14:59,892
Come here!

1285
02:14:59,975 --> 02:15:02,436
Only the whole pieces,
leave the fucking small parts!

1286
02:15:12,529 --> 02:15:16,491
<i>Now you better make it quick,
get rid of this shit!</i>

1287
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,505
That's it! Immortals!
Immortals are all around!

1288
02:15:34,218 --> 02:15:36,136
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

1289
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:39,389
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1290
02:15:39,473 --> 02:15:43,894
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1291
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:48,190
The party's over, Oskar. They're closing
us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1292
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,650
-When?
-I don't know.

1293
02:15:49,733 --> 02:15:50,984
As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1294
02:15:51,068 --> 02:15:55,280
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1295
02:16:15,717 --> 02:16:18,428
- I've been talking to Goeth.
- I know the destination.

1296
02:16:18,512 --> 02:16:21,181
These are the evacuation orders.

1297
02:16:21,265 --> 02:16:24,268
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1298
02:16:24,351 --> 02:16:27,479
That's not what
I was going to say.

1299
02:16:27,563 --> 02:16:31,358
I made Goeth promise me
he'll put in a good word for you.

1300
02:16:31,441 --> 02:16:34,820
Nothing bad is going to happen to you
there. You'll receive special treatment.

1301
02:16:34,862 --> 02:16:38,866
The directives coming in from Berlin
mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.

1302
02:16:38,949 --> 02:16:43,287
- I'd like to think that's not what you mean.
- Preferential treatment, alright?

1303
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:48,375
- Should we invent a whole new language?
- I think so.

1304
02:16:50,544 --> 02:16:53,255
You're staying, I take it.

1305
02:16:56,425 --> 02:17:01,847
- In Krakow? What on earth for?
- What for? You have a business to run.

1306
02:17:02,472 --> 02:17:04,600
Of course, you'll have
to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.

1307
02:17:04,683 --> 02:17:08,353
They cost a little more, but...

1308
02:17:10,063 --> 02:17:12,858
What are you going to do?

1309
02:17:15,652 --> 02:17:18,780
You ran my business.

1310
02:17:21,533 --> 02:17:23,702
No, I'm going home.

1311
02:17:23,785 --> 02:17:30,000
I've done what I came here for. I've got
more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1312
02:17:39,801 --> 02:17:45,849
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

1313
02:17:48,936 --> 02:17:52,397
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1314
02:17:55,943 --> 02:17:59,530
I think I better have it now.

1315
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:39,004
I don't understand.
I mean, you want these people?

1316
02:19:39,087 --> 02:19:41,673
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.

1317
02:19:41,757 --> 02:19:44,760
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1318
02:19:44,843 --> 02:19:46,345
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1319
02:19:46,345 --> 02:19:47,679
It's good business.

1320
02:19:47,763 --> 02:19:49,556
It's good business
in your opinion.

1321
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:54,394
Look, you've got to move them,
the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1322
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:57,689
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1323
02:19:57,773 --> 02:20:01,026
- Look, Amon, it's good for me...
- You're not telling me something.

1324
02:20:01,109 --> 02:20:03,904
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1325
02:20:03,987 --> 02:20:06,073
- You're not telling me something.
- It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1326
02:20:06,156 --> 02:20:08,700
- That's right.
- It's good for the army.

1327
02:20:08,784 --> 02:20:11,328
- You know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1328
02:20:11,411 --> 02:20:13,747
- Artillery shells.
- Everyone is making artillery shells.

1329
02:20:13,830 --> 02:20:15,666
- Tank shells, they need that.
- Tanks shells, yeah!

1330
02:20:15,749 --> 02:20:18,293
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy, except me.

1331
02:20:18,377 --> 02:20:21,380
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1332
02:20:21,463 --> 02:20:24,466
If I'm making a hundred,
you've got to be making three.

1333
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:27,928
And if you admit to making three,
then it's four actually. But how?

1334
02:20:28,011 --> 02:20:31,765
- I just told you.
- You did, but you didn't.

1335
02:20:33,851 --> 02:20:36,061
Yeah, all right, don't tell me.

1336
02:20:36,144 --> 02:20:40,399
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1337
02:20:40,482 --> 02:20:45,237
Look, all you have to do
is tell me what it's worth to you.

1338
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:47,990
- What's a person worth to you?
- No, no, no, no.

1339
02:20:48,073 --> 02:20:51,535
What's one worth to you?

1340
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:03,422
Poldek Pfefferberg,
Mila Pfefferberg...

1341
02:21:03,505 --> 02:21:06,049
...and uh...

1342
02:21:06,842 --> 02:21:08,510
...uh, Stagel, Stagel...

1343
02:21:08,594 --> 02:21:10,137
- Paul.
- Paul! Paul Stagel.

1344
02:21:10,637 --> 02:21:12,848
Doctor...

1345
02:21:14,057 --> 02:21:17,853
- The investors. I want all of them.
- Yes, sir.

1346
02:21:17,936 --> 02:21:20,814
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1347
02:21:20,814 --> 02:21:23,942
Fischer, Ismail.

1348
02:21:24,026 --> 02:21:27,613
- Josef Scharf.
- One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1349
02:21:27,696 --> 02:21:30,240
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1350
02:21:32,701 --> 02:21:36,830
The children,
all the children!

1351
02:21:40,584 --> 02:21:42,711
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1352
02:21:42,794 --> 02:21:47,341
- How many?
- 400, 450.

1353
02:21:49,384 --> 02:21:52,137
More, more!

1354
02:21:57,559 --> 02:21:59,311
Good morning.

1355
02:22:15,327 --> 02:22:20,666
- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1356
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:29,758
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha.
Yes? Nacha.

1357
02:22:29,842 --> 02:22:31,677
Nacha, that's right.

1358
02:22:31,844 --> 02:22:33,679
And Wolf.

1359
02:22:33,762 --> 02:22:36,139
How many?

1360
02:22:37,766 --> 02:22:41,436
- 600.
- More!

1361
02:22:42,646 --> 02:22:43,939
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1362
02:22:44,022 --> 02:22:46,733
- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

1363
02:22:46,817 --> 02:22:50,070
Come on, Julius, I know about
the extra food and clothes you give them.

1364
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:52,781
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach...

1365
02:22:52,823 --> 02:22:55,117
...we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

1366
02:22:55,117 --> 02:22:56,285
-Oskar!
-We could relocate them...

1367
02:22:56,326 --> 02:22:59,830
...in something like safety,
in Moravia.

1368
02:23:00,205 --> 02:23:02,040
I don't know.

1369
02:23:03,917 --> 02:23:06,628
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1370
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:07,588
Too many!

1371
02:23:07,671 --> 02:23:12,509
For every one you smoke,
I smoke half.

1372
02:23:12,885 --> 02:23:14,803
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1373
02:23:14,887 --> 02:23:18,223
- No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
- I will not accept that.

1374
02:23:18,307 --> 02:23:19,933
No!

1375
02:23:29,985 --> 02:23:32,696
- How many? How many?
- 850, give or take.

1376
02:23:32,821 --> 02:23:37,659
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1377
02:23:47,294 --> 02:23:51,465
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1378
02:23:55,636 --> 02:23:59,556
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1379
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:04,311
You just told him how
many people you needed and...

1380
02:24:06,605 --> 02:24:09,316
You're not buying them?

1381
02:24:11,193 --> 02:24:14,404
You're buying them? You're
paying him for each of these names?

1382
02:24:14,488 --> 02:24:17,950
If you were still working for me,
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1383
02:24:18,033 --> 02:24:21,328
It's costing me a fortune.

1384
02:24:21,828 --> 02:24:25,749
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1385
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:49,773
You...

1386
02:24:55,404 --> 02:24:59,575
The list is an absolute good.

1387
02:24:59,658 --> 02:25:02,995
The list... is life.

1388
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:09,501
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1389
02:25:09,585 --> 02:25:13,505
Oskar, there's a clerical error here
at the bottom of the last page.

1390
02:25:13,589 --> 02:25:16,341
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1391
02:25:16,425 --> 02:25:20,888
I'll never find a maid as well trained as her
at Brinnlitz. They are all country girls.

1392
02:25:22,431 --> 02:25:23,849
No!

1393
02:25:32,858 --> 02:25:34,526
No!

1394
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:36,820
- One hand of twenty-one.
- No!

1395
02:25:36,904 --> 02:25:39,740
- If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
- No!

1396
02:25:39,823 --> 02:25:43,619
- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No!

1397
02:25:43,702 --> 02:25:46,914
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1398
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,250
- I can't wager Helen in a card game.
- Why not?

1399
02:25:50,334 --> 02:25:51,418
Wouldn't be right.

1400
02:25:51,418 --> 02:25:53,212
She's just going to
Auschwitz Number Two, anyway.

1401
02:25:53,212 --> 02:25:55,464
- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

1402
02:25:55,547 --> 02:25:59,968
I'd never do that to her. No, I want her
to come back to Vienna with me.

1403
02:26:00,052 --> 02:26:03,096
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1404
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:07,684
- I want to grow old with her.
- Are you mad?

1405
02:26:07,768 --> 02:26:14,066
- Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.
- No, of course I can't.

1406
02:26:14,483 --> 02:26:17,069
That's what I'd like to do.

1407
02:26:17,152 --> 02:26:23,116
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man,
is the next most merciful thing.

1408
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:28,205
I shall take her into the woods and shoot
her painlessly in the back of the head.

1409
02:26:37,339 --> 02:26:41,760
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1410
02:26:41,927 --> 02:26:44,304
Was it 14,800?

1411
02:26:44,388 --> 02:26:47,808
<i>Jews of Schindler, to these tables!
Say your names clearly.</i>

1412
02:26:47,891 --> 02:26:51,270
- We are the family Dresner.
-Juda, Jonas...

1413
02:26:51,353 --> 02:26:53,689
...Donata and Chaja.

1414
02:26:53,772 --> 02:26:57,442
- We are Rosners. Henry, Manci...
- And Leo.

1415
02:26:57,526 --> 02:27:00,904
- And our son.
- I am Olek.

1416
02:27:00,988 --> 02:27:02,489
Maria Mischel.

1417
02:27:02,573 --> 02:27:05,409
Chaim Nowak.

1418
02:27:05,534 --> 02:27:07,870
Wulkan, Markus.

1419
02:27:07,953 --> 02:27:10,330
Michael Lemper.

1420
02:27:11,206 --> 02:27:13,375
Itzhak Stern.

1421
02:27:13,667 --> 02:27:16,712
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1422
02:27:17,254 --> 02:27:19,548
- Rosalia Nussbaum.
- Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1423
02:27:20,007 --> 02:27:22,426
Jakob Levartov.

1424
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:25,762
- Farber, Rosa.
- Farber, Andrzej.

1425
02:27:25,846 --> 02:27:28,640
- Sara.
- Friehof, Fischel.

1426
02:27:29,975 --> 02:27:31,852
Mietek Pemper.

1427
02:27:31,935 --> 02:27:34,438
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1428
02:27:34,521 --> 02:27:37,024
Horowitz, Dolek.

1429
02:27:38,233 --> 02:27:40,194
Adam Levy.

1430
02:27:40,277 --> 02:27:42,529
Marcel Goldberg.

1431
02:27:42,613 --> 02:27:46,074
Klipstein, Isak David.

1432
02:27:46,158 --> 02:27:48,076
Altmann, Eduard.

1433
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:50,245
Grunberg, Miriam.

1434
02:27:50,329 --> 02:27:52,414
Luftig, Eliasz.

1435
02:27:52,497 --> 02:27:54,541
Hilmann, Eduard.

1436
02:27:54,625 --> 02:27:56,877
Erna Rothberg.

1437
02:27:57,085 --> 02:28:00,005
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1438
02:28:00,297 --> 02:28:03,050
Helen Hirsch.

1439
02:28:04,134 --> 02:28:07,262
The worst is over.

1440
02:28:07,763 --> 02:28:11,892
<i>Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1441
02:28:11,975 --> 02:28:16,855
<i>Be careful! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1442
02:28:16,939 --> 02:28:21,443
<i>Watch your step! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1443
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:03,986
Wonderful Olek, wonderful.

1444
02:29:04,027 --> 02:29:08,824
You know how we make
ice into water?

1445
02:29:09,491 --> 02:29:11,785
Olek, get another one!

1446
02:29:50,073 --> 02:29:53,285
<i>Position yourselves
all in a single row!</i>

1447
02:29:53,493 --> 02:29:58,332
You'll be pleased with the level
of efficiency I get from these workers.

1448
02:29:59,666 --> 02:30:01,835
Budzyn, under my command...

1449
02:30:01,919 --> 02:30:04,838
...was the envy of every other commandant
in the labour camp system.

1450
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,423
- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me!

1451
02:30:06,465 --> 02:30:09,676
...they would have rather been
somewhere else.

1452
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:26,985
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1453
02:30:27,069 --> 02:30:30,822
...and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1454
02:30:30,948 --> 02:30:33,659
I know you've had
a long journey.

1455
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:36,995
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1456
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:42,501
...where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1457
02:30:42,584 --> 02:30:45,170
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1458
02:30:54,596 --> 02:30:57,641
- Beans in chunt?
- Beans are the best part.

1459
02:30:57,683 --> 02:30:59,935
I don't like beans.

1460
02:31:00,018 --> 02:31:03,939
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1461
02:31:04,022 --> 02:31:06,900
That's not the way
you make chunt.

1462
02:31:10,654 --> 02:31:13,907
- Eggs in chunt?
- Yes!

1463
02:31:16,076 --> 02:31:18,954
- I don't like chunt.
- No, you don't.

1464
02:31:18,996 --> 02:31:24,126
- What do you like?
- I like caviar!

1465
02:31:24,209 --> 02:31:25,627
One day on the fire...

1466
02:31:25,627 --> 02:31:27,713
-Oh, yes!
-One day...

1467
02:32:32,945 --> 02:32:34,821
Position yourselves
in front of the wagons!

1468
02:32:36,406 --> 02:32:39,743
You've got to stay together.

1469
02:32:39,826 --> 02:32:44,122
Leave the wagons!
Leave the wagons!

1470
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,376
I said, leave the wagons!

1471
02:32:48,752 --> 02:32:51,171
<i>Bagaze zostawic!</i>

1472
02:32:53,507 --> 02:32:55,592
<i>Faster! Quick! Quick!</i>

1473
02:32:55,676 --> 02:32:57,928
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

1474
02:33:00,514 --> 02:33:02,432
Move it!

1475
02:33:07,229 --> 02:33:11,108
Come on, out!
Hurry up, out!

1476
02:33:11,149 --> 02:33:17,406
Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five...

1477
02:33:17,489 --> 02:33:19,408
<i>Out!</i>

1478
02:33:19,491 --> 02:33:21,910
<i>Get out!</i>

1479
02:33:21,994 --> 02:33:24,872
<i>Quicker, get out!</i>

1480
02:33:28,625 --> 02:33:31,253
<i>All of you, out!</i>

1481
02:33:32,171 --> 02:33:35,924
- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?

1482
02:33:38,844 --> 02:33:40,512
<i>Move the line!</i>

1483
02:33:41,013 --> 02:33:43,015
<i>Get out!</i>

1484
02:33:47,728 --> 02:33:51,148
<i>- Quick! Get out!
- Faster!</i>

1485
02:33:53,734 --> 02:33:55,777
<i>Quicker!</i>

1486
02:33:55,819 --> 02:33:58,155
<i>Come on, be quick!</i>

1487
02:33:58,238 --> 02:34:01,742
Mama, where are we?

1488
02:34:02,326 --> 02:34:05,537
- 17, 18, 20-
- They're in Auschwitz.

1489
02:34:05,621 --> 02:34:09,541
The train was never routed here.
A paperwork mistake.

1490
02:34:17,883 --> 02:34:20,344
<i>Take off your shoes!</i>

1491
02:34:33,273 --> 02:34:36,193
<i>Quicker, quicker!</i>

1492
02:34:39,571 --> 02:34:41,073
<i>Take off your clothes!
Hurry up!</i>

1493
02:34:41,198 --> 02:34:43,867
<i>Hurry up! Stay in a row
and take off your clothes!</i>

1494
02:34:45,410 --> 02:34:47,079
<i>Quicker!</i>

1495
02:35:01,844 --> 02:35:04,805
<i>Quicker!</i>

1496
02:35:04,888 --> 02:35:08,183
<i>Take off your clothes quickly!
Hurry up!</i>

1497
02:35:11,937 --> 02:35:14,022
SHOWERS AND DISINFECTION

1498
02:35:15,315 --> 02:35:17,276
<i>Go in, hurry up!</i>

1499
02:35:20,279 --> 02:35:21,738
Quicker!

1500
02:35:21,864 --> 02:35:24,616
<i>Go to the showers, quickly!</i>

1501
02:35:26,702 --> 02:35:30,956
<i>Quicker! Quicker!</i>

1502
02:38:01,106 --> 02:38:03,025
Eyes on the necks!

1503
02:38:05,736 --> 02:38:08,488
Hands on the shoulders!

1504
02:38:08,572 --> 02:38:11,783
<i>- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight.</i>

1505
02:38:11,825 --> 02:38:17,331
- Cough for me, mother.
- They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.

1506
02:38:17,623 --> 02:38:20,125
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1507
02:38:20,209 --> 02:38:24,046
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1508
02:38:25,923 --> 02:38:28,467
- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir.

1509
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:30,761
- Sir?
- Good morning.

1510
02:38:30,844 --> 02:38:33,805
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.

1511
02:38:33,889 --> 02:38:37,601
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

1512
02:38:37,684 --> 02:38:41,188
- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow.

1513
02:38:41,271 --> 02:38:45,651
- Enamelware.
- A pot maker.

1514
02:38:46,109 --> 02:38:48,320
How old are you, mother?

1515
02:38:52,533 --> 02:38:58,330
You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour...

1516
02:38:58,539 --> 02:39:00,832
...Mr. Schindler.

1517
02:39:00,916 --> 02:39:03,752
I remember earlier this year,
IG-Color ordered...

1518
02:39:03,836 --> 02:39:09,675
...a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

1519
02:39:09,758 --> 02:39:13,679
The train came in
through the archway...

1520
02:39:13,762 --> 02:39:19,393
...and the officer in charge
of the selection went immediately to work...

1521
02:39:19,476 --> 02:39:22,187
...and sent 2,000 of them...

1522
02:39:22,229 --> 02:39:25,816
...straight away
to "special treatment".

1523
02:39:26,525 --> 02:39:32,114
It is not my task to interfere with
the processes that take place down here.

1524
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:38,370
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG-Color?

1525
02:39:38,453 --> 02:39:41,748
Allow me to express the reason.

1526
02:39:50,215 --> 02:39:53,719
I'm not making
any judgement about you.

1527
02:39:53,719 --> 02:39:56,305
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1528
02:39:56,346 --> 02:40:00,142
...we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1529
02:40:02,769 --> 02:40:05,480
I could have you arrested.

1530
02:40:05,564 --> 02:40:10,861
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1531
02:40:13,238 --> 02:40:17,159
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1532
02:40:17,242 --> 02:40:22,539
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1533
02:40:36,094 --> 02:40:39,306
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1534
02:40:39,389 --> 02:40:41,767
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1535
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:45,771
New ones.
These are fresh.

1536
02:40:49,525 --> 02:40:53,529
- The train comes, we turn it around.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1537
02:40:53,612 --> 02:40:55,155
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1538
02:40:55,531 --> 02:40:58,283
I want these.

1539
02:41:00,827 --> 02:41:04,498
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1540
02:41:11,255 --> 02:41:15,509
That's right.
It creates a lot of paperwork.

1541
02:41:15,592 --> 02:41:19,596
Zoldinger, Ernestina!
Waldergrun, Hilda!

1542
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,890
Waldergrun, Leonora!

1543
02:41:21,974 --> 02:41:25,352
Laast, Anna!
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1544
02:41:25,394 --> 02:41:28,981
Dresner, Ruth!
Dresner, Danka!

1545
02:41:29,064 --> 02:41:32,776
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1546
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:38,866
Hirsch, Helen! Grosz, Chaja Sara!
Seelenfreund, Estella!

1547
02:41:53,714 --> 02:41:55,883
<i>Move it!
Move it, quick!</i>

1548
02:41:55,966 --> 02:42:00,512
<i>- Faster! Faster!
-Come on!</i>

1549
02:42:02,139 --> 02:42:05,017
<i>Quick, quick!
Faster!</i>

1550
02:42:06,935 --> 02:42:11,023
<i>- Faster!
-Hurry up!</i>

1551
02:42:19,323 --> 02:42:22,409
No! No! No!

1552
02:42:36,757 --> 02:42:40,469
No! No! No!

1553
02:42:44,181 --> 02:42:46,475
No! No! No!

1554
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:52,523
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1555
02:42:52,606 --> 02:42:57,402
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

1556
02:42:57,528 --> 02:43:00,155
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!

1557
02:43:00,864 --> 02:43:03,408
Essential girls!

1558
02:43:05,577 --> 02:43:09,998
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1559
02:43:10,082 --> 02:43:13,502
How else am I to polish the inside of
a 45 millimetre shell casing?

1560
02:43:13,585 --> 02:43:17,422
You tell me.
You tell me!

1561
02:43:18,841 --> 02:43:23,011
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1562
02:45:17,292 --> 02:45:21,547
Under Department "W" provisions...

1563
02:45:21,630 --> 02:45:26,009
...it is unlawful
to kill a worker without just cause.

1564
02:45:26,093 --> 02:45:29,096
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund...

1565
02:45:29,179 --> 02:45:33,475
...I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1566
02:45:33,559 --> 02:45:36,520
If you shoot without thinking...

1567
02:45:36,603 --> 02:45:40,858
...you go to prison, I get paid.

1568
02:45:40,941 --> 02:45:43,277
That's how it works.

1569
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:48,532
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1570
02:45:49,283 --> 02:45:54,079
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1571
02:45:54,162 --> 02:45:59,293
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will
no longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1572
02:45:59,376 --> 02:46:03,046
...without my authorization.

1573
02:46:07,843 --> 02:46:12,598
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1574
02:46:13,223 --> 02:46:15,350
Come on, come!

1575
02:46:15,976 --> 02:46:18,061
<i>Oh, boy! I haven't seen
something like that since years.</i>

1576
02:46:18,145 --> 02:46:21,023
Come on, boys, come!

1577
02:46:46,715 --> 02:46:52,638
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again...

1578
02:46:52,721 --> 02:46:55,057
...I promise.

1579
02:47:01,772 --> 02:47:05,526
- This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant.
- You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1580
02:47:05,567 --> 02:47:08,237
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

1581
02:47:08,278 --> 02:47:10,239
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

1582
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:12,950
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1583
02:47:13,033 --> 02:47:15,619
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1584
02:47:15,702 --> 02:47:18,705
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1585
02:47:18,789 --> 02:47:19,706
- Madam.
- Hello!

1586
02:47:19,748 --> 02:47:20,666
What is it?

1587
02:47:20,707 --> 02:47:23,502
We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1588
02:47:23,585 --> 02:47:25,754
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings!

1589
02:47:25,838 --> 02:47:28,507
Apparently all of them
have failed quality control tests.

1590
02:47:28,507 --> 02:47:29,550
That's to be expected!

1591
02:47:29,633 --> 02:47:32,845
Start-up problems. This isn't pots
and pans. This is a precise business.

1592
02:47:32,928 --> 02:47:34,888
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

1593
02:47:34,930 --> 02:47:39,101
Sure, so would I, so would you. I wouldn't
worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1594
02:47:39,142 --> 02:47:43,605
There's a rumour you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

1595
02:47:43,647 --> 02:47:48,402
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1596
02:47:49,528 --> 02:47:51,905
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1597
02:47:51,989 --> 02:47:54,074
- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference...

1598
02:47:54,074 --> 02:47:55,117
...whether they're made here
or somewhere else.

1599
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:56,618
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

1600
02:47:56,618 --> 02:47:57,995
You'll lose a lot of money.

1601
02:47:58,078 --> 02:48:01,373
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory ever produces...

1602
02:48:01,456 --> 02:48:06,837
...a shell that can actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.

1603
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:09,965
- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

1604
02:48:23,395 --> 02:48:27,941
How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!

1605
02:48:30,110 --> 02:48:32,863
Good, Mr. Director.

1606
02:48:34,031 --> 02:48:36,283
Sun's going down.

1607
02:48:38,535 --> 02:48:40,621
Yes, it is.

1608
02:48:41,872 --> 02:48:45,959
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1609
02:48:46,043 --> 02:48:48,003
Is it?

1610
02:48:51,465 --> 02:48:56,470
What's the matter with you?
You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1611
02:48:56,553 --> 02:48:59,389
Shouldn't you?

1612
02:49:05,395 --> 02:49:10,526
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come!

1613
02:50:25,184 --> 02:50:28,270
<i>What?</i>

1614
02:50:28,353 --> 02:50:33,275
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1615
02:50:33,358 --> 02:50:36,528
...that I don't know about?

1616
02:50:39,489 --> 02:50:41,992
No!

1617
02:50:46,288 --> 02:50:50,334
Why?
Am I broke?

1618
02:50:53,295 --> 02:50:55,464
Well...

1619
02:50:56,381 --> 02:51:02,763
<i>Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a. m...</i>

1620
02:51:02,846 --> 02:51:06,808
<i>...at General Eisenhower's
headquarters...</i>

1621
02:51:06,892 --> 02:51:09,561
<i>...General Jodl...</i>

1622
02:51:09,686 --> 02:51:13,774
<i>...signed the Act
of Unconditional Surrender...</i>

1623
02:51:13,857 --> 02:51:19,905
<i>...of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe...</i>

1624
02:51:19,988 --> 02:51:24,076
<i>...to the Allied
Expeditionary Force.</i>

1625
02:51:24,076 --> 02:51:28,247
<i>And simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.</i>

1626
02:51:28,997 --> 02:51:32,793
<i>The German war is,
therefore, at an end.</i>

1627
02:51:32,876 --> 02:51:34,878
<i>But let us not forget for a moment...</i>

1628
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:39,216
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1629
02:51:39,299 --> 02:51:42,469
<i>...Japan, with all
her treachery and greed...</i>

1630
02:51:42,553 --> 02:51:48,058
The unconditional surrender
of Germany has just been announced.

1631
02:51:48,141 --> 02:51:52,771
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1632
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:57,067
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1633
02:51:57,150 --> 02:52:00,863
...of looking for survivors
of your families.

1634
02:52:03,323 --> 02:52:08,787
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1635
02:52:09,955 --> 02:52:12,791
After six long years
of murder...

1636
02:52:12,916 --> 02:52:18,213
...victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1637
02:52:18,297 --> 02:52:21,425
We've survived.

1638
02:52:21,508 --> 02:52:25,762
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1639
02:52:27,764 --> 02:52:29,933
Thank yourselves.

1640
02:52:31,059 --> 02:52:34,438
Thank your fearless Stern...

1641
02:52:34,479 --> 02:52:36,857
...and others among you
who worried about you...

1642
02:52:36,899 --> 02:52:40,944
...and faced death
at every moment.

1643
02:52:43,864 --> 02:52:46,533
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1644
02:52:46,658 --> 02:52:49,912
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1645
02:52:49,995 --> 02:52:52,414
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

1646
02:52:52,497 --> 02:52:56,210
I am a criminal.

1647
02:52:56,293 --> 02:53:01,298
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1648
02:53:01,924 --> 02:53:05,427
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight...

1649
02:53:05,511 --> 02:53:11,767
...after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me I have to flee.

1650
02:53:13,894 --> 02:53:17,648
I know you have received orders
from our commandant...

1651
02:53:17,731 --> 02:53:22,778
...which he has received from his superiors
to dispose of the population of this camp.

1652
02:53:22,861 --> 02:53:25,280
Now would be
the time to do it.

1653
02:53:25,364 --> 02:53:31,328
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1654
02:53:35,457 --> 02:53:39,169
Or you could leave...

1655
02:53:39,253 --> 02:53:41,547
...and return
to your families as men...

1656
02:53:41,630 --> 02:53:45,551
...instead of murderers.

1657
02:54:25,716 --> 02:54:29,887
In memory of the countless
victims among your people...

1658
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:34,183
...I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1659
02:55:28,862 --> 02:55:34,076
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1660
02:55:34,159 --> 02:55:36,495
Open wide.

1661
02:55:38,205 --> 02:55:40,290
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1662
02:55:58,851 --> 02:56:01,144
Thank you, Mr. Jereth!

1663
02:56:25,169 --> 02:56:29,464
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1664
02:56:29,548 --> 02:56:33,677
...um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1665
02:56:33,719 --> 02:56:36,305
Two and a half metres each.

1666
02:56:36,388 --> 02:56:39,600
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1667
02:56:39,683 --> 02:56:42,686
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1668
02:56:42,769 --> 02:56:46,273
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1669
02:56:46,356 --> 02:56:50,569
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1670
02:57:09,713 --> 02:57:13,967
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1671
02:57:14,051 --> 02:57:17,221
...in case you are captured.

1672
02:57:18,514 --> 02:57:21,725
Every worker has signed it.

1673
02:57:31,777 --> 02:57:33,695
Thank you!

1674
02:58:00,514 --> 02:58:02,850
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1675
02:58:02,933 --> 02:58:08,981
It says:
"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. "

1676
02:58:47,895 --> 02:58:51,398
I could have got more out.

1677
02:58:52,566 --> 02:58:55,068
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1678
02:58:55,652 --> 02:58:57,487
If I just...

1679
02:58:58,614 --> 02:58:59,698
I could have got more.

1680
02:58:59,781 --> 02:59:05,287
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

1681
02:59:05,662 --> 02:59:08,165
If I'd made more money...

1682
02:59:12,169 --> 02:59:17,007
I threw away so much money.

1683
02:59:18,967 --> 02:59:21,970
You have no idea.

1684
02:59:22,054 --> 02:59:23,055
If I had just...

1685
02:59:23,138 --> 02:59:27,351
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1686
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:30,938
I didn't do enough.

1687
02:59:31,021 --> 02:59:33,982
You did so much.

1688
02:59:37,402 --> 02:59:39,863
This car...

1689
02:59:39,947 --> 02:59:41,698
...Goeth would've bought this car.

1690
02:59:42,199 --> 02:59:46,954
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1691
02:59:49,373 --> 02:59:52,292
Ten people.

1692
02:59:53,001 --> 02:59:55,796
Ten more people.

1693
02:59:57,631 --> 02:59:59,174
This pin...

1694
02:59:59,258 --> 03:00:03,011
...two people.

1695
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:05,472
This is gold.

1696
03:00:05,556 --> 03:00:07,182
Two more people.

1697
03:00:07,558 --> 03:00:10,435
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

1698
03:00:10,477 --> 03:00:13,856
He would have given me one,
one more.

1699
03:00:16,358 --> 03:00:19,111
One more person.

1700
03:00:20,779 --> 03:00:26,159
A person, Stern,
for this!

1701
03:00:28,120 --> 03:00:32,040
I could have gotten...

1702
03:00:32,124 --> 03:00:36,920
...one more person and I didn't.

1703
03:00:37,421 --> 03:00:40,883
And I, I didn't!

1704
03:02:09,346 --> 03:02:12,140
You have been liberated...

1705
03:02:12,224 --> 03:02:15,519
...by the Soviet Army!

1706
03:02:22,943 --> 03:02:24,611
Have you been in Poland?

1707
03:02:24,695 --> 03:02:28,198
I just came from Poland.

1708
03:02:29,408 --> 03:02:32,119
Are there any Jews left?

1709
03:02:37,207 --> 03:02:39,751
Where should we go?

1710
03:02:39,835 --> 03:02:41,920
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1711
03:02:42,004 --> 03:02:45,215
They hate you there.

1712
03:02:45,591 --> 03:02:49,469
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1713
03:02:50,387 --> 03:02:53,515
We could use some food.

1714
03:02:55,142 --> 03:02:59,229
Isn't there a town over there?

1715
03:04:12,052 --> 03:04:14,805
Long live, Hitler!
