00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,250
旧金山

2
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,540
大卫森宠物店

3
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,480
- 好，麦克古德太太 - 好，丹尼尔斯小姐
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder. Oh, hello, Miss Daniels.

4
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,650
有见过这么多海鸥吗？ 想是怎么回事？
Have you ever seen so many gulls? What do you suppose it is?

5
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,780
一定是海上有暴风雨 把它们赶往内陆了
There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know.

6
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,370
我还希望会晚点过来 鸟还没送到呢
I was hoping you'd be a little late. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

7
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,530
- 但说三点的 - 我知道
- Oh, but you said 3:00. - Oh, I know.

8
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,290
我知道，我打了一早的电话
I know. I've been calling all morning.

9
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,620
丹尼尔斯小姐，有所不知
Oh, Miss Daniels, you have no idea.

10
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,460
它们很难弄到手，真的
They are so difficult to get. Really, they are.

11
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,340
我们得从印度进口雏鸟，然后…
We have to get them from India, when they're just baby chicks, and then...

12
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,340
这只不是雏鸟吧？
This one won't be a chick, will he?

13
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,800
当然不是 这只是成年的八哥鸟
Certainly not. Oh, no, certainly not. This will be a full-grown mynah bird. Full-grown.

14
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,760
- 它会说话？ - 它当然会…
And he'll talk? Well, yes, of course he'll...

15
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,230
不，得教它说话
Well, no, you'll have to teach him to talk.

16
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,400
我最好再打通电话 他们说三点会到
I guess maybe I'd better phone. They said 3:00.

17
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,230
可能是塞车吧，我联络看看
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.

18
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,820
- 能稍等一下吗？ - 还是把鸟送到我家吧
Would you mind waiting? Well, maybe you'd better deliver him.

19
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,860
我给我家的地址
Let me give you my address.

20
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,490
那好吧
Oh, well, all right,

21
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,240
但我确定他们在路上了
but I'm sure they're on the way.

22
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,000
我能打通电话吗？
Would you mind if I called?

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
请便
No. All right.

24
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,270
- 请帮个忙 - 什么？
I wonder if you could help me. What?

25
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,900
我说请帮个忙
I said, I wonder if you could help me.

26
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,900
- 是，你想找什么，先生？ - 爱情鸟
Yes. What is it you're looking for, sir? Lovebirds.

27
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,490
爱情鸟？
Lovebirds, sir?

28
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,530
是，我听说那有分很多种类
Yes. I understand there are different varieties.

29
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,910
- 是真的吗？ - 真的
Is that true? Well, yes, there are.

30
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,870
这是要给我妹妹当生日礼物的
Well, these are for my sister for her birthday, you see,

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,080
她才11岁 所以我不想买一对
and as she's only gonna be 11, I wouldn't want a pair of birds

32
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,790
过于热情的鸟
that were too demonstrative.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,170
我完全理解
I understand completely.

34
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,010
但我也不想买一对太冷淡的鸟
At the same time, I wouldn't want them to be too aloof, either.

35
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,760
当然不了
No, of course not.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,010
店里有相敬如宾的一对小鸟吗？
Do you happen to have a pair of birds that are just friendly?

37
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,890
应该有，我找找看
Oh, I think so. Now, then, let me see.

38
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,320
那些不是爱情鸟吗？
Aren't those lovebirds?

39
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,070
不，那些是红鸟
No. Those are red birds.

40
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,570
我以为它们是红雀
I thought they were strawberry finches.

41
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,200
对，我们也这样称呼它们
Yes. We call them that, too.

42
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,290
找到了，爱情鸟
Here we are. Lovebirds.

43
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,870
那是金丝雀
Those are canaries.

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,290
不觉得自己很糟糕吗？
Doesn't this make you feel awful?

45
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,790
什么很糟糕…
Doesn't what make me feel...

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,090
把这些可怜无辜的小东西 关在笼子里？
Having all these poor, little innocent creatures caged up like this?

47
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,970
我们总不能 让它们在店里飞来飞去吧
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.

48
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,130
当然不能
No, I suppose not.

49
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,470
有什么鸟类学上的原因 必须把它们隔开吗？
Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,810
有，为了保护品种
Well, certainly. It's to protect the species.

51
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,480
对，那很重要 尤其是在换毛期的时候
Yes, that's important, especially during the molting season.

52
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,230
那是特别危险的时期
That's a particularly dangerous time.

53
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,730
- 它们正在换毛吗？ - 一部分是
Are they molting now? Oh, some of them are.

54
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,320
怎么知道？
How can you tell?

55
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,990
它们会垂头丧气的
Well, they get a sort of hangdog expression.

56
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,660
我知道了，那爱情鸟呢？
Yes, I see. Well, what about the lovebirds?

57
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
你确定不看看金丝雀？
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead?

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,500
我们这周进了些很美的金丝雀
We have some very nice canaries this week.

59
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,090
好吧
All right.

60
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,260
好，我能看看吗？
All right. May I see it, please?

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,730
怎么了？
Oh, what is it? Oh!

62
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,830
抓到了
There we are.

63
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
- 好险 - 太好了
- Oh, there. - Wonderful.

64
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,470
回的金牢笼吧 梅兰妮丹尼尔斯
Back in your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels.

65
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,300
你说什么？
What did you say?

66
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,640
我只是在打比喻，丹尼尔斯小姐
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,390
- 你怎么知道我的名字？ - 小鸟告诉我的
How did you know my name? A little birdie told me.

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,890
再见，丹尼尔斯小姐、女士
Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

69
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,070
慢着，我不认识你
Hey, wait a minute. I don't know you.

70
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,780
- 但我认识 - 怎么说？
Ah, but I know you. How?

71
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,570
- 我们在法庭上见过 - 我们未曾在法庭上见过
We met in court. We never met in court or anyplace else.

72
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,490
没错，我换个说法 我在法庭看过
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.

73
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,700
什么时候？
When?

74
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,990
不记得因为的恶作剧
Don't you remember one of your practical jokes

75
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,910
使得一扇玻璃窗被打破了吗？
that resulted in the smashing of a plate-glass window?

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,540
- 我没有打破窗户 - 但是恶作剧害的
I didn't break that window. Yes, but your little prank did.

77
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,170
- 法官真该把关进大牢 - 你是谁，警察吗？
The judge should've put you behind bars. What are you, a policeman?

78
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,090
我不太相信法律，丹尼尔斯小姐 我也不太喜欢恶作剧
I merely believe in the law, Miss Daniels. And I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

79
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,800
- 那你的爱情鸟故事… - 我是真的想买爱情鸟
What do you call your lovebird story if not... Oh, I really wanted the lovebirds.

80
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,640
你明知道我不是店员，你故意…
Well, you knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,770
对，我一进门就认出了
Right. I recognized you when I came in.

82
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,230
我只是想让知道 当被整的一方是什么感受
I just thought you might like to know what it's like to be on the other end of a gag.

83
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,150
- 有什么感想？ - 我认为你是个坏蛋
What do you think of that? I think you're a louse.

84
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,860
我是 再见，丹尼尔斯小姐、女士
I am. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

85
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,910
真庆幸你没买到爱情鸟
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds.

86
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,790
我会去别的地方买，法庭上见了
Oh, I'll find something else. See you in court.

87
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,380
- 那个人是谁？ - 我不知道
Who was that man? I have no idea.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,450
他们说 八哥鸟今天下午就会送到
They said the mynah bird would be here later this afternoon,

89
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,990
若愿意再过来一趟
if you care to come back.

90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,160
不，送到我家吧
No, you'd better send him.

91
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
- 能借用电话吗？ - 请便
May I use this phone? Why, certainly.

92
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,920

Daily News? It's Melanie Daniels. Could you get me the City Desk, please?

请留步，麦克古德太太
Just a minute, Mrs. MacGruder.

我要请你帮个忙
I want you to do a favor for me.

96
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,440
不，只是个小忙
No, this is a small one.

97
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,190
给你压力？ 亲爱的查理 我怎么会给你压力？
Pressure you? Why, Charlie, darling, would I try to pressure you?

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,030
你能替我致电汽车监理所吗？
Would you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me?

99
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,360
找出这个车牌的车主
Find out who owns this license plate,

100
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,700
W-J-H-0-0-3 W-J-H-0-0-3.

101
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,410
对，加州车牌
Yes, a California plate.

102
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,540
不，我等会就过去 爸爸在办公室吗？
No. I'll stop off in a little while. Is Daddy in his office?

103
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,130
不，我不想打断会议 告诉他我晚点去找他
No, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Tell him I'll see him later.

104
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,050
谢谢你，查理
Thank you, Charlie.

105
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,050
店里有爱情鸟吗？
Do you have any lovebirds?

106
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,890
不，店里没有 但我可以替订购
Well, no, not in the shop, but I can order them for you.

107
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,060
- 多快会到？ - 什么时候要？
How soon? Well, when would you want them?

108
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,310
立刻
Immediately.

109
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,730
明天早上应该就能送到
Well, I could probably have them here by tomorrow morning.

110
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,780
- 那样可以吗？ - 当然可以
Would that be all right? That would be just fine.

米契尔班纳先生收

112

- 小姐，这是要给米契班纳的？ - 对
Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner? Yes.

113
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,830
- 他不在家 - 没关系
He's not home. That's all right.

114
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,090
如果要送小鸟给他 他要周一才会回来
He won't be back until Monday, I mean, if those birds are for him.

115
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,090
- 周一？ - 是
- Monday? - Yes.

116
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,260
我想不该把小鸟留在走廊上吧？
I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?

117
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
那…他去哪了？
Well... Where did he go?

118
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,640
博德加湾 他每个周末都会去那里
Bodega Bay. He goes there every weekend.

119
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,720
博德加湾在哪里？
Bodega Bay. Where's that?

Up the coast, about 60 miles north of here.

一百公里…
Sixty...

122
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,800
走高速公路约一个半小时的车程 走海岸公路则要两小时
It's an hour and a half by freeway, or two hours if you take the Coast Highway. Oh.

123
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,530
我愿意照顾小鸟 但我也要出远门
I'd look after them myself, but I'm going away, too.

124
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,740
很抱歉
I'm awfully sorry.

- 他住在哪里？ - 博德加湾
- Where does he live? - Right here, Bodega Bay.

132
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,740
- 博德加湾的哪里？ - 海湾对面
Yes, I know, but where? Right across the bay there.

133
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,700
哪里？
Where?

134
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,040
- 看见我指的方向了？ - 是
Now, see where I'm pointing? Yes.

135
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,380
看见那两棵大树了？
See them two big trees across there?

136
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,510
- 海湾的另一边吗？ 看见了 - 那栋白色房子？
On the other side of the bay? Yes. - And the white house?

137
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,430
- 是 - 那就是班纳家了
- Yes. That's where the Brenners live.

138
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,310
班纳家？ 班纳夫妇的家？
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

139
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,930
- 不，只有莉迪雅和两个孩子 - 两个孩子？
No. Just Lydia and the two kids. The two kids?

140
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,190
对，米契和小女儿
Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.

141
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,980
我懂了，我要怎么过去？
Oh, I see. How do I get down there?

142
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,570
沿着海湾边的路走 就能走到他们家大门口
You follow the road around the bay, and that'll take you right to their front door.

143
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,650
大门口，我能走小路吗？
The front door. Is there a back road I can take?

144
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,410
- 不，只有那条路 - 我想给他们惊喜
No. That's the only road. You see, I want to surprise them.

145
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,120
- 我不想让他们看见我 - 这样
I don't want them to see me arrive. Oh.

146
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,830
这是惊喜
It's a surprise, you see.

147
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,960
可以乘船穿过海湾 到他们家的码头
Well, you could get yourself a boat and cut right across the bay to their dock.

148
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,380
我要去哪租船？
Where would I get a boat?

149
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,470
下方的海潮餐厅
Down by the Tides Restaurant.

150
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,060
- 曾开过船吗？ - 当然
Did you ever handle an outboard boat? Of course.

151
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,480
- 我替叫船吧？ - 谢谢
Want me to order one for you? Well, thank you.

152
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
- 的名字？ - 丹尼尔斯
- What name? - Daniels.

153
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,770
好
Okay.

154
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,710
- 你能否告诉我… - 请稍等一下
I wonder if you could tell me... Yeah. Just hold it a minute, please.

155
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,880
- 小女儿的名字？ - 班纳家的小女儿？
The little girl's name? The little Brenner girl?

156
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,300
- 是 - 应该是爱丽丝吧
Yes. Alice, I think.

157
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,420
哈利，班纳家的小女儿 叫什么名字？
Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?

158
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,970
- 露薏丝 - 爱丽丝吗？
- Lois. - Alice, isn't it?

159
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,260
- 不，是露薏丝 - 是爱丽丝
No, it's Lois. It's Alice.

160
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,060
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

161
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,060
我不敢保证 如果是想问这个
Well, I'm not positive, if that's what you mean.

162
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,140
我需要她的真名
I need her exact name, you see.

163
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,650
请再稍等一下
Oh, just hold on one more minute, please.

164
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,150
这样的话，我教怎么做
In that case, I'll tell you what you do.

165
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,530
一路穿过镇上 会看见左手边有一间小旅馆
You go straight through town till you see a little hotel on your left.

166
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,740
然后右转
Then you turn right there.

167
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,450
- 记好了？ - 是
- Now, you got that? - Yes.

168
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,450
在靠近山顶处 会看见一所学校，再过去
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school, and just beyond,

169
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,910
有一间信箱是红色的房子
a little house with a red mailbox.

170
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,830
那里是安妮海沃斯老师的家
That's where Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher, lives.

171
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,250
- 可以问她班纳家小女儿的事 - 谢谢
You ask her about the little Brenner girl. Well, thank you.

172
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,970
替自己省点麻烦吧 我确定她叫爱丽丝
Save yourself a lot of trouble. Name's Alice for sure.

173
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,930
我20分钟后能搭船吗？
Can I have the boat in about 20 minutes?

174
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,890
- 电话费要多少？ - 不用了
How much for the phone calls? Oh, it's nothing.

175
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,180
谢谢
Thank you.

176
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,870
博德加湾学校

177
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,570
- 是谁？ - 我
Who is it? Me.

178
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,660
“我” 是谁？
Who's "me"?

179
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,410
- 海沃斯小姐？ - 是
- Miss Hayworth? - Yes.

180
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,710
我是梅兰妮丹尼尔斯 抱歉打扰了…
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...

181
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,210
- 有事吗？ - 邮局的人要我来找
Yes? The man at the post office sent me.

182
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,340
他说知道班纳家小女儿的名字
He said you could tell me the name of the little Brenner girl.

183
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
凯西？
Cathy?

184
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,170
她住在海湾对面那间白色房子？
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?

185
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,840
- 没错，凯西班纳 - 他很确定是爱丽丝或露薏丝
That's the one. Cathy Brenner. He seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.

186
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,140
所以这镇上的信 永远送不到对的地方
Which is why the mail never gets delivered to the right place in this town.

187
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,430
- 抱歉，要抽烟吗？ - 谢谢
I'm sorry. Smoke? Thank you.

188
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,390
找凯西有事吗？
Did you want to see Cathy about something?

189
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,610
没什么事
Well, not exactly.

190
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,450
是米契的朋友？
Are you a friend of Mitch's?

191
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,490
不算是
No, not really.

192
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,620
我20分钟前就想抽烟了
You know, I've been wanting a cigarette for the last 20 minutes.

193
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,960
但我一直闲不下来
I just couldn't convince myself to stop.

194
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,370
翻土这件事会让人停不下来
This tilling of the soil can become compulsive, you know.

195
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,880
这花园很漂亮
It's a very pretty garden.

196
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,500
谢谢 这是度过空闲时间的好方法
Oh, thank you. Well, it's something to do in your spare time.

197
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,840
在博德加湾，空闲时间可多了
There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.

198
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,010
打算久留吗？
Are you planning on staying long?

199
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,890
不，只待几个小时
No, just a few hours.

200
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,930
见过凯西后就要离开？
Then you're leaving after you see Cathy?

201
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,060
差不多
Well, something like that.

202
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,400
抱歉，我无意 把自己搞得神秘兮兮的
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.

203
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,110
这不关我的事
Actually, it's none of my business.

204
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,440
我最好该出发了
Well, I better be on my way.

205
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,490
- 非常谢谢 - 不客气
- Thank you very much. - Not at all.

206
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,030
从旧金山 沿海岸公路开车过来？
Did you drive up from San Francisco by the coast road?

207
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,330
对
Yes.

208
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,830
- 风景很棒吧 - 很漂亮
Nice drive. It's very beautiful.

209
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,040
你们在旧金山认识的？
Is that where you met Mitch?

210
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,210
对
Yes.

211
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,460
我想大家都是 在那里认识米契的
I guess that's where everyone meets Mitch.

212
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,130
海沃斯小姐，换神秘兮兮了
Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth.

213
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,220
是吗？
Do I?

214
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,470
我无意这么做 事实上，我没什么秘密
I don't mean to. Actually, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,310
或者该说我高深莫测
Or, rather, a closed one.

216
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,400
- 真漂亮，这是什么鸟？ - 爱情鸟
Oh, pretty. What are they? Lovebirds.

217
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,190
我知道了 祝好运，丹尼尔斯小姐
I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.

218
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,490
谢谢，我可以走这边吗？
Thank you. Can I get out this way?

219
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,490
右转吧 那会带回大马路上
Go right around. It'll take you back to the main road.

220
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,910
谢谢
Thank you.

221
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,880
海沃斯

222
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,470
凯西收

223
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,450
海潮餐厅- 快艇出租

224
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,740
- 丹尼尔斯小姐的船准备好了？ - 是的
Do you have a boat for Miss Daniels?
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,120
就是下方那一艘
It's the one right below.

226
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,790
- 没事吧？ - 我没事
- Are you all right? - Yes, I think so.

227
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,830
- 它怎么会攻击我？ - 那是我见过最吓人的鸟
What do you suppose made it do that? That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

228
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,340
我不知道 它似乎是故意冲向的，流血了
I don't know. It seemed to swoop down at you deliberately. Oh, you're bleeding, too.

229
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,340
我们去擦药，好吗？
Let's take care of that. Okay?

230
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,010
乖女孩
That's a girl.

231
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,520
来吧
Come on.

232
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,850
米契，怎么了？
What happened, Mitch?

233
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,150
- 海鸥攻击她 - 海鸥？
- Gull hit her. - A gull?

234
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,150
去餐厅看看吧
Let's try up at the restaurant, all right?

235
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,580
可能需要打破伤风针
Might need a tetanus shot.

236
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,790
我在去年五月出国前 打过预防针了
I had a booster before I went abroad last May.

237
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,010
海潮餐厅

238
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,070
- 怎么了？ - 你好，迪克，这位小姐受伤了
What happened? Hello, Deke. Young lady cut herself.

239
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,200
- 我该找医生吗？ - 不，应该没那么严重，我看看
Shall I call a doctor? No, I don't think it's that serious. Let's see.

240
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,870
海伦，去拿些棉花和消毒药水
Helen, get some cotton and antiseptic.

241
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,830
小姐，在外头受伤的吗？
You cut yourself outside, miss?

242
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,330
别担心，迪克 她在船上受伤的
Don't worry, Deke. She did it in a boat.

243
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,420
曾有个男人在停车场摔倒
Well, I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once.

244
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,920
眼也不眨一下就告我
Sued me before I could bat an eyelash.

245
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,380
丹尼尔斯小姐不会告人
I don't think Miss Daniels is gonna sue anybody.

246
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,090
拿去
Here.

247
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,710
- 你才是律师 - 谢谢
Well, you're the lawyer. Thank you.

248
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,640
- 那是什么？ - 双氧水
What's that? Just some peroxide.

249
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,970
我来清洗伤口
I'll clean out the cut.

250
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,520
你是律师啊
So you're a lawyer.

251
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,770
没错
That's right.

252
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,150
我通常是替人辩护 丹尼尔斯小姐，但若我要告人…
Of course, I usually defend people, Miss Daniels, but if I were prosecuting...

253
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,980
- 你在这里执业？ - 旧金山，来干嘛？
Do you practice here? Uh-uh. San Francisco. What are you doing up here?

254
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,780
- 专攻哪种法律？ - 刑法
What kind of law? Criminal.

255
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,200
所以你才想让每个人去坐牢？
Is that why you want to see everyone behind bars?

256
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,870
不是每个人
Oh, not everyone, Miss Daniels.

257
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,540
- 只有犯法和恶作剧的人 - 没错
Only violators and practical jokers. That's right.

258
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,040
抱歉
- Ow! - Oh, sorry.

259
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,960
- 刚在那里做什么？ - 你没看见爱情鸟？
What are you doing up here? Didn't you see the lovebirds?

260
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,590
是说大老远 替我送爱情鸟过来？
Oh, you mean, you came all this way to bring me those birds?

261
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
鸟是送给你妹妹的 你说她过生日
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday.

262
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,760
- 反正我原本就要过来 - 为什么？
Besides, I was coming up anyway. What for?

263
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,680
见我朋友，轻一点
To see a friend of mine. Careful.

264
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,810
抱歉，的朋友是谁？
Oh, sorry. Who's your friend?

265
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,690
安妮海沃斯，学校老师
Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher.

266
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,320
安妮海沃斯
Annie Hayworth.

267
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,650
这世界真小
Well, small world.

268
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,700
是
Yes.

269
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,580
怎么认识安妮？
How do you know Annie?

270
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,660
我们上同一所大学
We went to school together, college.

271
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,290
是吗？ 真想不到 要在这里待多久？
Did you? Imagine that. How long are you staying up here?

272
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,960
这个周末
The weekend.

273
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,140
血差不多止住了 按着伤口吧
Well, I think the bleeding's almost stopped. Why don't you hold that on?

274
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,400
- 来拜访安妮？ - 对
So you came up to see Annie, huh? Yes.

275
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,690
我想是来看我的
I think you came up to see me.

276
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,530
我为什么要来看你呢？
Now, why would I want to see you of all people?

277
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,240
我不知道 但一定是大费周章地
I don't know, but you must've gone to a lot of trouble

278
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,370
调查我是谁和我住在哪里
to find out who I was and where I lived.

279
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,370
一点都不麻烦 我只需打给我父亲的报社
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's newspaper.

280
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,120
而且我原本就要过来 我已经说过了
Besides, I was coming up anyway. I've already told you that.

281
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,170
- 很喜欢我吧？ - 我讨厌你
You really like me, huh? I loathe you.

282
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,880
你没礼貌，既自大又骄傲…
You have no manners. You're arrogant, and conceited, and...

283
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,130
我本来写了封信要给你 但我撕掉了
I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.

284
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,390
- 上头写了什么？ - 不关你的事
What did it say? None of your business.

285
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,300
我也不喜欢你的海鸥
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either.

286
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,020
- 我大老远过来… - 本来就要过来，记得吗？
I come all the way up here to... But you were coming up anyway, remember?

287
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,560
米契？
Mitch?

288
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,730
我看到你的车子 你到镇上做什么？
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?

289
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,400
- 我来签收货物 - 什么？
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Of what?

290
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,570
妈妈，这是梅兰妮丹尼尔斯 丹尼尔斯小姐，这是我母亲
Mother, I'd like you to meet Melanie Daniels. Miss Daniels, my mother.

291
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,030
好吗？
How do you do?

292
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,450
好，丹尼尔斯小姐 签收什么？
How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?

293
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,920
货物，丹尼尔斯小姐 从旧金山替我们送小鸟过来
A delivery. Miss Daniels brought us some birds from San Francisco.

294
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,580
做为凯西的生日礼物 她在哪里？
For Cathy for her birthday. Where is she?

295
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,170
她在布林梅尔家
Across at Brinkmeyer's.

296
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,550
事实上，丹尼尔斯小姐 要在这里过周末
As a matter of fact, Miss Daniels is staying up here for the weekend,

297
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,220
所以我已邀请她今晚一起用餐
so I've already invited her for dinner tonight.

298
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,310
不辞辛劳送那些鸟过来
Well, you did go to the trouble of bringing those birds.

299
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,020
没什么
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

300
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,100
- 你说鸟？ - 对，爱情鸟
You did say birds? Yes, lovebirds.

301
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,190
我知道了
Oh, I see.

302
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,320
所以我们可不能 不向道谢就让离开
So we couldn't let you get away without thanking you in some small way.

303
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,610
还没见到凯西 况且要在这里过周末
And you haven't met Cathy, and you are staying the weekend.

304
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,120
- 是，不过… - 会留下来吧？
Well, yes, but... Well, you are, aren't you?

305
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,450
- 没错，但… - 那就说定了
Certainly, but... Then it's all settled.

306
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,660
- 晚餐几点开动？ - 七点，一如往常
What time is dinner, Mother? 7:00, the same as usual.

307
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,710
- 我会去接，住在哪里？ - 当然是安妮家
I'll pick you up. Where are you staying? With Annie, of course.

308
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,800
当然了，我真笨 6点45分可以吗？
Oh, of course. How stupid of me. 6:45?

309
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,630
安妮可能另有计划 我得问问看
Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see.

310
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,220
此外，我自己知道路
Besides, I can find my own way.

311
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,100
确定？ 不会再租船了？
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?

312
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,930
- 我确定 - 那七点见了
I'm sure. 7:00, then.

313
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,770
也许吧
Maybe.

314
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,150
我们会等，头还痛吗？
We'll be waiting for you. How's your head?

315
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,190
好多了，谢谢
Much better, thank you.

316
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,360
班纳太太，我只是被海鸥弄伤
A gull hit me, Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

317
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,540
- 嗨，找到她了？ - 是
Oh, hi. Did you find her all right? Yes, I did.

318
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,880
我想问…
I was wondering...

319
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,380
那块招牌
That sign there.

320
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,760
房间出租

321
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,430
我可以在这里住上一晚吗？
Do you suppose I could have the room for just a single night?

322
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,390
我打算长期出租…
I was planning on renting it for a longer time...

323
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,510
我会很感激
I would appreciate it.

324
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,640
我找过镇上其他地方，都客满了
I've tried everywhere in town. They're all full.

325
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,140
好吧，的行李在车上？
Well, all right. Got your bags in the car?

326
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,440
我得说真是实际
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.

327
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,440
我刚在杂货店 买了一些过夜用品
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store.

328
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,320
我本来没打算久留
You see, I hadn't planned on staying very long.

329
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,450
我知道 发生了出乎意料的事？
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected come up?

330
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,370
对，能借用的电话吗？ 我想打电话回家
Yes. May I use your phone? I'd like to call home.

331
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,670
炉子上有咖啡
I just put some coffee on the stove.

332
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,920
它们都不停止迁徙的？
Don't they ever stop migrating?

333
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,230
好！
Hi!

334
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,480
好！
Hi!

335
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,990
- 丹尼尔斯小姐？ - 是
Miss Daniels? Yes.

336
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,490
小鸟好漂亮！
Oh, they're beautiful!

337
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,530
跟我想要的一样 那是一只公鸟和一只母鸟吗？
They're just what I wanted. Is there a man and a woman?

338
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,580
- 我都分不清楚 - 应该是
I can't tell which is which. Well, I suppose so.

339
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,250
- 好，安妮没安排计划？ - 没有
Hello there. Annie had no plans, huh? No.

340
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,250
很好，我们很高兴能过来 饿了吗？
Fine. We're very glad you could come. You hungry?

341
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,590
- 相当饿了 - 晚餐快煮好了
- Reasonably. - Dinner's just about ready.

342
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,710
我们刚去看鸡
We've been out back looking at the chickens.

343
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,010
它们好像有点不对劲
Something seems to be wrong with them.

344
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,010
那些鸡没有不对劲，米契
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch.

345
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,760
- 我去打电话给佛莱德布林梅尔 - 那又能怎样？
I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now. What good's that gonna do?

346
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,760
鸡都不吃饲料
The chickens won't eat.

347
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,180
是他卖饲料给我的，不是吗？
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

348
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,310
买者自负，妈妈 “货物既出恕不退换”
Caveat emptor, Mother. "Let the buyer beware."

349
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,890
你站在谁那边？
Whose side are you on?

350
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,270
- 我只是在引述法条 - 别管什么法条了
Merely quoting the law, dear. Never mind the law.

351
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,700
这不会太久，丹尼… 喂，佛莱德？ 我是莉迪雅班纳
This won't take long, Miss... Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.

352
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,950
- 我没打扰到你吃晚饭吧？ - 喝一杯吗？
- I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I? - How about a drink?

353
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,960
- 好的，谢谢 - 佛莱德，你卖给我不好的饲料
Thank you, I'd love one. Fred, that feed you sold me is no good.

354
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,830
鸡饲料
The chicken feed.

355
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,290
品质不好，鸡都不吃
Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it.

356
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,630
鸡随时都是饿的
They're always hungry.

357
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,550
我到家后，开了一袋饲料 它们连碰都不碰
I opened a sack for them when I got home, and they just wouldn't touch it.

358
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,890
你懂鸡，我也懂 鸡不吃饲料
You know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat,

359
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,220
那一定就是饲料有问题，就这样
there's something wrong with what they're being fed. That's all.

360
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,980
不，它们不是挑嘴鸡
No, they're not fussy chickens.

361
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,480
谁？ 跟他有何关系？
Who? What's he got to do with it?

362
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,320
- 这是你父亲？ - 请坐
Is that your father? Mmm-hmm. Please sit down.

363
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,650
佛莱德，我不管 你卖了多少袋饲料给他，我的鸡…
Fred, I don't care how many sacks of feed you sold him. My chicken...

364
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,320
我知道了
Oh, I see.

365
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,410
丹佛西特
Dan Fawcett.

366
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,250
今天下午？ 那证实了我的话！ 你卖给我们的饲料…
This afternoon? Well, that just proves what I'm saying! The feed you sold us...

367
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,260
我最好去问问他
Well, maybe I'd better go over and see him.

368
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,220
你不会以为这是什么传染病吧？
You don't think there's something going around, do you?

369
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,680
才不是！
No, never!

370
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,350
不，佛莱德 它们没生病，只是不吃饲料
No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat.

371
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,360
我会去找他，也许他…
Well, I'll try to go over and see him. Maybe he...

372
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,070
好吧，谢谢
All right. Thanks.

373
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,450
丹佛西特稍早也打过电话
He had a call from Dan Fawcett a while ago.

374
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,460
他的鸡也不吃饲料
His chickens won't eat either.

375
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,960
如所说，妈妈 布林梅尔先生卖的饲料不佳
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

376
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,710
不，凯西 他卖给佛西特先生的是另个牌子
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.

377
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,550
米契，你觉得是鸡生病了吗？
You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?

378
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,100
我还是搞不懂 怎么知道我想要爱情鸟
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.

379
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,980
哥哥告诉我的
Your brother told me.

380
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,900
跟米契在旧金山认识的？ 没错吧？
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco? Is that right?

381
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
不算是
No, not exactly.

382
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,990
米契在旧金山认识很多人
Mitch knows a lot of people in San Francisco.

383
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,900
当然，他们多半是罪犯
Of course, they're mostly hoods.

384
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,910
- 凯西！ - 妈，他是最先承认的人
Cathy! Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.

385
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,660
他大半天都待在法院里的拘留室
He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

386
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,040
凯西，在民主国家 人人都有公平受审的权力
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial.

387
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,880
- 哥的工作… - 妈，别说了！
Your brother's practice... Oh, Mom, please!

388
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,170
我知道民主那套狗屁 但他们还是罪犯
I know all that democracy jazz. They're still hoods.

389
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,470
他的一位委托人 朝老婆的头开了六枪
He has a client now who shot his wife in the head six times.

390
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,640
六枪！能想像吗？
Six times! Can you imagine it?

391
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,770
开两枪就很夸张了 不觉得吗？
I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?

392
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,360
- 他为什么杀她？ - 他当时正在看球赛转播
Why did he shoot her? He was watching a ball game on television.

393
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,440
- 什么？ - 他老婆把电视转台
What? His wife changed the channel.

394
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,860
- 明天会参加我的生日会吗？ - 不会
Are you coming to my party tomorrow? I don't think so.

395
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,410
我得回旧金山
I have to get back to San Francisco.

396
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,950
- 不喜欢我们？ - 亲爱的，我当然喜欢
Don't you like us? Oh, darling, of course I do.

397
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,870
- 不喜欢博德加湾？ - 我还不知道
Don't you like Bodega Bay? I don't know yet.

398
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,460
米契很喜欢这里 他每个周末都过来
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know,

399
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,460
虽然他在市区有间自己的公寓
even though he has his own apartment in the city.

400
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,880
他说旧金山就像桥墩上的蚁丘
He says San Francisco's like an anthill at the foot of a bridge.

401
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,470
旧金山偶尔是有点忙乱
I suppose it does get a little hectic at times.

402
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,850
若决定来我的生日会 别说是我告诉的
Well, if you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it.

403
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,100
这本该是一场惊喜派对
It's supposed to be a surprise party.

404
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,310
他们设计了很复杂的计划
You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out,

405
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,820
我下午会去蜜雪儿家玩
where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon,

406
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,820
但蜜雪儿的妈妈会说她头痛
and Michele's mother will say that she has a headache.

407
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,990
我是否愿意让她带我回家？
Would I mind very much if she took me home?

408
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,110
我一到家之后 所有的小孩都会跳出来！
Then when I get home here, all the kids will jump out!

409
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,120
不来吗？ 拜托来嘛？
Oh, won't you come? Won't you please come?

410
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,920
我没办法
I don't think so.

411
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,710
- 米契，她很迷人，不是吗？ - 是
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch? Hmm? Yes.

412
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,030
非常漂亮
Certainly pretty. Mmm-hmm.

413
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,260
- 你跟她认识多久了？ - 我说过了，我们昨天才认识
How long have you known her? Now, I told you, dear, we met yesterday.

414
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,510
- 在鸟店里 - 在鸟店里
In a bird shop. In a bird shop.

415
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,520
她是鸟店的店员？
She was selling birds?

416
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,810
不，我只是让她相信 我以为她是店员，然后…
No, no. I just led her into believing that I believed she was, and then...

417
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,110
过程很复杂
Well, it's all very complicated.

418
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,190
但她确实买了爱情鸟 还大老远开车过来
But she did buy the lovebirds, and then drove all the way out here.

419
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,780
- 妈妈 - 怎么？
- Mother. - Yes?

420
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,610
上哪间法学院？
Where did you go to law school?

421
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,240
抱歉
Forgive me.

422
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,870
我只是对那样的女孩很好奇
I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.

423
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,790
她很有钱吧？
She's very rich, isn't she?

424
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,120
应该是
Yeah, I suppose so.

425
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,460
她的父亲 是旧金山最大报社的合伙人
Her father's part owner of one of the big newspapers in San Francisco.

426
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,670
你还以为 他能让她的名字不见报
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print.

427
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,840
她时常登上报纸的八卦专栏
She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

428
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,670
我知道
Yes, I know.

429
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,260
她就是去年在罗马 跳进喷水池的人，对吧？
She is the one who jumped into a fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

430
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,930
是
Yes.

431
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,220
我是有点老古板
I supposed I'm old-fashioned.

432
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,310
我知道那里的天气很温暖，但…
I know it was supposed to be very warm there, but...

433
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,900
事实上，报纸写说 她当时是一丝不挂
Well, actually, the newspapers said she was naked.

434
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,860
我知道，妈妈
Yes, I know, dear.

435
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,780
这当然不关我的事 但你带这样的女孩…
Of course, it's none of my business, but when you bring a girl like that...

436
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,110
- 妈妈？ - 是？
Darling? Yes?

437
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,870
我能自己应付梅兰妮丹尼尔斯
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

438
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,910
只要你知道 你要的是什么就好，米契
Well, as long as you know what you want, Mitch.

439
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,920
我很清楚我要什么
I know exactly what I want.

440
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,630
- 能自己开车回去？ - 当然
Be able to find your way back all right? Oh, yes.

441
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,220
- 我能再见吗？ - 旧金山离这里很远
Will I be seeing you again? San Francisco's a long way from here.

442
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,970
我一周有五天待在旧金山 而且我时间很多
I'm in San Francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands.

443
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
我想见
I'd like to see you.

444
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,270
我们可以一起去游泳 妈妈告诉我喜欢游泳
Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.

445
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,070
- 令堂怎么知道我的兴趣？ - 我们都读同一篇八卦专栏
How does Mother know what I like to do? I guess we read the same gossip column.

446
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,530
那个啊，罗马
Oh, that. Rome.

447
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,450
我很喜欢游泳 我们应该处得来
Yeah, I really like to swim. I think we might get along very well.

448
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,870
以防你有兴趣知道 我是被推进喷水池的
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.

449
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,200
全身赤裸？
Without any clothes on?

450
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,200
我当时衣着整齐 写那篇报导的报社
With all my clothes on. The newspaper that ran that story

451
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,910
刚好是我父亲的竞争对手
happens to be a rival of my father's paper.

452
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,040
只是可怜无辜 被牵连的受害者？
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstances?

453
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,880
我不可怜也不无辜
I'm neither poor nor innocent,

454
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,040
但事实是…
but the truth of that particular...

455
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,550
事实是 跟一群狐群狗党混在一起？
The truth is, you're running around with a pretty wild crowd, isn't it?

456
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,460
那倒是真的 但我被推进喷水池
Yes, that's the truth, but I was pushed into that fountain,

457
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,950
也是事实
and that's the truth, too. Uh-huh.

458
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,180
真的认识安妮海沃斯？
Do you really know Annie Hayworth?

459
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,720
不，我来到这里才认识她
No. At least I didn't until I came up here.

460
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,720
- 所以们不是同学？ - 不是
- So you didn't go to school together? - No.

461
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,270
- 不是来看她？ - 不是！
- And you didn't come up here to see her? - No!

462
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,810
- 说谎！ - 对，我说谎
- You were lying! - Yes, I was lying.

463
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,440
有写信给我也是骗人的？
What about the letter you wrote me? Is that a lie, too?

464
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
我真的有写
No, I wrote the letter.

465
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,900
- 内容是什么？ - 上面写：亲爱的班纳先生
Well, what did it say? It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.

466
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,650
“我想你需要这对爱情鸟 它们能改善你的人品”
"I think you need these lovebirds after all. "They may help your personality."

467
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,820
- 就这样 - 但撕掉了？
- That's what it said. - But you tore it up?

468
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,120
- 对 - 为什么？
- Yes. - Why?

469
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,040
因为这似乎太愚蠢了
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

470
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,620
- 跟跳进罗马的喷水池一样 - 我解释过了！
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome. I told you what happened!

471
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,790
以为我会相信？
You don't expect me to believe that, do you?

472
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,920
我才不在乎你信不信！
Oh, I don't give a damn what you believe!

473
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,460
- 我还是想见 - 为什么？
- I'd still like to see you. - Why?

474
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,050
应该会很有趣
I think it might be fun.

475
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,510
那在罗马也许是个好理由 但现在不是了
That might've been good enough in Rome, but it's not good enough now.

476
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,090
- 我觉得是 - 我不觉得
- It is for me. - Well, not for me.

477
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,550
- 要什么？ - 我以为你早知道了
What do you want? I thought you knew.

478
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,100
我想要一丝不挂 跳进喷水池里，晚安
I want to go through life jumping into fountains naked. Good night.

479
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,000
- 丹尼尔斯小姐，是吗？ - 是
Miss Daniels, is that you? Yes.

480
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,290
嗨
Hi.

481
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,800
怎么了吗？ 伤口开始痛了？
Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?

482
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,170
不，让我烦恼的不是伤口
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

483
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,510
- 要喝点白兰地吗？ - 若有的话，我想喝
Would you like some brandy? If you have some, I'd love it.

484
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
我去拿 请坐，丹尼尔斯小姐
I'll get it. Why don't you sit down, Miss Daniels?

485
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,230
想要穿件毛衣或盖件被子吗？
Oh, would you like a sweater or something, a quilt?

486
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,560
不用了，谢谢
No. No, thank you.

487
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,480
- 叫我梅兰妮就好 - 没问题
Won't you call me Melanie? All right.

488
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,160
谢谢
Thank you.

489
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,120
这里的晚上偶尔会有点冷
Gets a bit chilly here at night sometimes,

490
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,460
尤其是靠近海湾的地方
especially if you're over near the bay.

491
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,750
今晚过得如何？
Well, how did your evening go?

492
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,590
见到莉迪雅了？
Did you meet Lydia?

493
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,590
还是希望我换个话题？
Or would you rather I changed the subject?

494
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,720
也好
I think so.

495
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,230
- 喜欢这个小村庄吗？ - 我恨死了
Well, how do you like our little hamlet? I despise it.

496
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,520
这里对一般游客没什么魅力
Well, I suppose it doesn't offer much to the casual visitor,

497
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,610
除非对山坡上 一整排的小木屋有兴趣
unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside.

498
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,860
得花点时间习惯
It takes a bit of getting used to.

499
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,860
- 安妮，是哪里人？ - 旧金山
Where are you from originally, Annie? San Francisco.

500
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,070
那怎么会来到这里？
How did you happen to come up here?

501
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,120
很久以前 有个朋友邀请我到这里过周末
A friend invited me up for a weekend a long time ago.

502
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,040
我想也没什么理由好遮掩的
Look, I see no reason for being coy about this.

503
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,130
那个人是米契班纳 应该早就知道了
It was Mitch Brenner. I guess you knew that anyway.

504
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,800
跟我猜的一样
I suspected as much.

505
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,050
不用担心
Well, you needn't worry.

506
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,260
我们老早就分得一干二净
It's been over and done with a long time ago.

507
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,640
安妮，班纳先生跟我之间 什么都没有
Annie, there's nothing between Mr. Brenner and me.

508
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,180
没有吗？
Isn't there?

509
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,890
也许没有吧
Well, maybe there isn't.

510
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,650
或许米契跟任何女孩之间 都未曾有过什么
Maybe there's never been anything between Mitch and any girl.

511
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,570
什么意思？
What do you mean?

512
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,740
我也喝点酒好了
I think I'll have some of that.

513
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,570
我在旧金山时跟他走得很近
I was seeing a lot of him in San Francisco.

514
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,910
某个周末 他邀我和莉迪雅见面
Then one weekend, he invited me up to meet Lydia.

515
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,450
什么时候？
When was this?

516
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,250
四年前，他父亲过世后不久
Oh, four years ago, shortly after his father died.

517
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,580
- 当然，现在的情况可能不同了 - 不同？
Of course, things may be different now. Different?

518
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,380
莉迪雅啊
With Lydia.

519
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,510
- 她有点冷淡吧？ - 一点点
Did she seem a trifle distant? A trifle.

520
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,840
那情况可能没什么变
Well, then perhaps things aren't quite so different.

521
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,430
她的态度差点害我发疯
You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy.

522
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,980
我回到旧金山后 花了好几天想弄清楚 我到底哪里得罪她了
When I got back to San Francisco, I spent days trying to figure out exactly what I'd done to displease her.

523
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,940
- 做了什么？ - 什么都没有
Well, what had you done? Nothing.

524
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,740
我只是出现了，原因呢？ 一个善妒的女人？
I simply existed. So what's the answer? A jealous woman, right?

525
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,780
占有欲很强的母亲？
A clinging, possessive mother?

526
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,240
错了
Wrong.

527
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,870
说是恋母情结 我看倒也不是那回事
With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case.

528
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,580
那是什么原因？
Then what was it?

529
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,040
莉迪雅喜欢我 那才是最奇怪的地方
Lydia liked me. That's the strange part.

530
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,040
现在我已不再是威胁 我们竟成了好朋友
Now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.

531
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:58,550
- 那她当时为何不接受？ - 因为她害怕
Then why did she object to you? Because she was afraid.

532
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,510
害怕夺走米契？
Afraid you'd take Mitch?

533
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,930
害怕我对米契的付出
Afraid I'd give Mitch.

534
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,930
我不懂
I don't understand.

535
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,100
害怕任何女人能给米契 莉迪雅唯一能给他的东西，爱
Afraid of any woman who would give Mitch the one thing Lydia can give him, love.

536
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,730
那就算是 一个善妒和占有欲很强的女人
That adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.

537
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,860
我不这么想
No, I don't think so.

538
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,110
她并不害怕失去米契
You see, she's not afraid of losing Mitch.

539
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,490
她只害怕被抛弃
She's only afraid of being abandoned.

540
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,910
某人得告诉她 她也会因此多一个女儿
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.

541
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,990
不，她已经有个女儿了
No. She already has a daughter.

542
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,790
那米契呢？ 他都没有表示意见？
Well, what about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?

543
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,750
我能理解他的立场
Well, I can understand his position.

544
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,630
他父亲死后 他跟莉迪雅过得很辛苦
He'd just been through a lot with Lydia after his father died.

545
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,380
他可不想再重来一次
He didn't want to risk going through it all again.

546
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,050
我懂了
Oh, I see.

547
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,640
所以我们分手了 当然不是立刻
So it ended. Not right then, of course.

548
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,060
我们回到旧金山后 偶尔还是会见面
We went back to San Francisco, saw each other now and then,

549
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,640
但我们都知道这结束了
but we both knew it was over.

550
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,770
那为何搬到博德加湾？
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?

551
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,270
我想留在米契身边
I wanted to be near Mitch.

552
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,940
我知道我们分手了，但是…
Oh, it was over and done with, and I knew it, but...

553
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,030
我仍想留在他身边
I still wanted to be near him.

554
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
我还是很喜欢他
You see, I still like him a hell of a lot,

555
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,990
我不想失去这段友情
and I don't want to lose that friendship, ever.

556
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,960
喂
Hello.

557
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,210
你好
Hello.

558
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,930
不，我还没睡
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.

559
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,180
对，不久之前
Yes, just a little while ago.

560
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,140
当然，稍等
Sure. Hold on.

561
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,520
米契打来的
It's Mitch.

562
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,980
他要找
For you.

563
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,570
喂？ 对，我是梅兰妮
Hello? Oh, yes, this is Melanie.

564
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,030
很好，谢谢
Fine, thank you.

565
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,830
一点都不难 我只是沿着马路开
No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road.

566
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,750
没必要道歉
Well... there's no need to apologize.

567
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,460
我能理解
I can understand.

568
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,510
你人真好，不，我没生气
That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry.

569
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,430
我没办法，我得回旧金山
Well, I couldn't. I have to get back to San Francisco.

570
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,810
我不想让凯西失望，不过…
No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but...

571
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,360
我知道了
I see.

572
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,950
好吧，我会到场
All right. Yes, I'll be there.

573
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,120
晚安，米契
Good night, Mitch.

574
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,750
他要我明天下午 参加凯西的生日会
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.

575
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,040
我答应了
I said I would.

576
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,170
一定会很好玩
It should be fun.

577
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,920
我也会去帮忙
I'll be there, too, to help.

578
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,920
这真是没必要
Oh, it seems so pointless.

579
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,930
我要去睡觉了 今天真是漫长
Well, I think I'll go to sleep. It's been a busy day.

580
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,220
我的行李
My luggage.

581
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,880
真漂亮，在哪买的？ 布林梅尔的店？
That's pretty. Where'd you get that? Brinkmeyer's? Mmm.

582
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,400
认为我该参加吗？
Do you think I should go?

583
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,650
这要由决定
Well, that's up to you.

584
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,240
不，这得由莉迪雅决定吧？
No, it's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

585
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,910
别管莉迪雅了，想去吗？
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

586
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,200
想
Yes.

587
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,750
- 那就去吧 - 谢谢，安妮
Then go. Thank you, Annie.

588
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,670
会是谁啊
Wonder who that can be.

589
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,840
有人吗？
Is someone there?

590
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,760
- 是谁？ - 看
Who is it? Look.

591
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,770
真可怜，可能是天色太暗迷路了
Poor thing. Probably lost his way in the dark.

592
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,850
但天色不暗，安妮
But it isn't dark, Annie.

593
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,730
今晚是满月
There's a full moon.

594
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,450
凯西，非常好
Cathy, that's very good. Very good.

595
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,910
开始吧
Okay. Here we go.

596
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,060
做得好，别让他抓到了
Attagirl. Come on. Don't let him get you.

597
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,410
我不能再喝了，我还要开车
No, I really shouldn't have any more. I'm driving.

598
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,580
事实上，我想请留下来吃晚饭
Well, actually, I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner.

599
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,080
还剩下很多烤牛肉
A lot of roast beef left over.

600
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,130
- 我不行，我得回家了 - 好吧
No, I couldn't possibly. I have to get back. All right.

601
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,220
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

602
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,050
到底为什么要急着走？ 旧金山有要紧的事吗？
Seriously, why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?

603
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,680
我明天早上还得工作
Well, I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.

604
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,770
- 有工作？ - 我有很多工作
You have a job? I have several jobs.

605
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,310
- 什么工作？ - 我有各式各样的工作
What do you do? I do different things on different days.

606
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,230
比如说？
Like what?

607
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,110
我周一和周三 在机场的旅客服务柜台工作
Well, on Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid at the airport.

608
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,160
协助旅客？
Helping travelers?

609
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,410
不，是去误导他们 我以为你了解我的个性
No, misdirecting them. I thought you could read my character.

610
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,580
周二我在柏克莱大学 修读普通语义学的课程
On Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley,

611
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,750
寻找新的脏话
finding new four-letter words.

612
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,040
- 那不算工作… - 是说不必…
- That's not a job, of course... - You mean, you don't have to...

613
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,840
周四我要开会和出席午餐会
And on Thursdays, I have my meeting and lunch.

614
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,630
我猜是在地狱吧
In the underworld, I suppose.

615
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,840
恐怕要让你失望了
I shall disappoint you.

616
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,970
我们要帮助 一个韩国小男孩去上学
We're sending a little Korean boy through school.

617
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,510
我们正在为此募款
We actually raise money for it.

618
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,440
罗马的事…
You see, Rome...

619
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,060
那一整个夏天，我只顾着…
That entire summer, I did nothing but...

620
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,980
罗马很容易让人迷失
Well, it was very easy to get lost there.

621
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,700
回国之后，我认为我该开始…
So when I came back, I thought it was time I began...

622
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,070
重新寻找某些东西
Oh, I don't know, finding something again.

623
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,210
所以周一到周四 我让自己保持忙碌
So, on Mondays and Thursdays, I keep myself busy.

624
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,170
- 那周五呢？ - 周五？ 没事
What about Fridays? Fridays? They're free.

625
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,590
我偶尔会在周五到鸟店逛逛
I sometimes go to bird shops on Fridays.

626
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,680
我很高兴会去
I'm very glad you do.

627
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,760
美好天真的一天
A nice, innocent, little day.

628
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,260
当然
Oh, yes.

629
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,190
我有个泰莎姑妈 你有姑妈吗？
I have an Aunt Tessa. Have you got an Aunt Tessa?

630
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,190
我的姑妈拘谨又古板
Mine is very prim and straight-laced.

631
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,190
等她从欧洲回来后 我要送她一只八哥鸟
I'm giving her a mynah bird when she comes back from Europe.

632
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,320
八哥鸟会说话 如果这只鸟会说几个
Mynah birds talk, you know. Can you see my Aunt Tessa's face,

633
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,950
我在柏克莱学到的词 你能想像泰莎姑妈的表情吗？
when this one tells us one or two of the words I've picked up at Berkeley?

634
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,660
需要一点母亲的关爱，孩子
You need a mother's care, my child.

635
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,460
- 我不需要我母亲的爱 - 很抱歉
Not my mother's. Oh, I'm sorry.

636
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,630
你有什么好抱歉的？
What have you got to be sorry about?

637
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,890
我的母亲？ 别浪费时间了
My mother? Don't waste your time.

638
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,680
我11岁时，她抛弃我们 跟一个东部的饭店员工跑了
She ditched us when I was 11 and ran off with some hotel man in the east.

639
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,730
你知道什么是母爱？
You know what a mother's love is?

640
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,440
- 我知道 - 你是指被抛弃比较好？
Yes, I do. You mean it's better to be ditched?

641
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:19,990
不，有母亲的爱比较好 再也没见过她了？
No. I think it's better to be loved. Don't you ever see her?

642
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,120
我不知道她在哪里
I don't know where she is.

643
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,590
我还是去找孩子们玩吧
Well, maybe I ought to go join the other children.

644
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,470
开始吧，一…
All right. Here we go. One...

645
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,310
二…
Two...

646
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,140
三…
Three...

647
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,230
走吧
There you go.

648
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,700
你们看！
Look! Look!

649
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,580
嘿！不准碰我！
Hey! No touching allowed!

650
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,780
帮我把孩子们带进屋里
Help me get the children into the house.

651
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,730
进去吧
There you go.

652
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,860
米契，它们离开了吗？
Have they gone, Mitch?

653
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,320
- 离开了 - 有人受伤吗？
I think so. Is anyone hurt?

654
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,160
珍妮的脸颊被抓伤，但无大碍
Jenny got a scratch down her cheek, but it's nothing.

655
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,620
这是第三次了
That makes three times.

656
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,710
米契，这很不寻常吧？
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?

657
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:40,710
昨天在船上攻击我的海鸥 昨晚在安妮家也有一只，现在…
The gull when I was in the boat yesterday, the one at Annie's last night, and now...

658
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,380
昨晚？ 什么意思？
Last night? What do you mean?

659
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,890
有只海鸥撞上安妮家的大门 米契，怎么回事？
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch, what's happening?

660
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,180
我不知道，得回安妮家吗？
I don't know. Do you have to go back to Annie's?

661
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,770
不，我的行李都在车上
No. I have my things in the car.

662
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,520
在回去之前 留下来吃点东西吧，我会安心点
Stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.

663
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,870
- 要加芥末吗？ - 不用，谢谢
Would you like some mustard with that? No, thank you.

664
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,240
安妮为何不留下来？
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

665
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,200
她说她要回家 接她妹妹从东部打来的电话
Said something about going home to take a call from her sister in the east.

666
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,250
它们怎么了？
What's the matter with them?

667
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,590
- 这些鸟是怎么了？ - 咖啡要放在哪里？
What's the matter with all the birds? Where did you want this coffee?

668
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,750
- 放在桌上，亲爱的 - 你动作快一点，米契
Here on the table, honey. Hurry up with yours, Mitch.

669
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,550
丹尼尔斯小姐一定很想上路了
I'm sure Miss Daniels wants to be on her way.

670
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,050
今晚该留下来，梅兰妮
I think you ought to stay the night, Melanie.

671
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,100
楼上有一间多出来的房间
We have an extra room upstairs and everything.

672
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,720
晚上的路况也很糟糕
That road can be a pretty bad one at night, too.

673
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,020
若我开到圣塔罗沙
If I go across to Santa Rosa,

674
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,440
就能早一点上高速公路 不是吗？
I'll come out on the freeway much earlier, won't I?

675
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,440
对，走高速公路快多了
Yes, and the freeway is much quicker.

676
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,820
但她会碰上 返回旧金山的大量车潮
But she'll be hitting all the heavy traffic going back to San Francisco.

677
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,360
那对爱情鸟叫得好厉害
Just listen to those lovebirds.

678
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
米契
Mitch.

679
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,880
遮住脸和眼睛！
Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!

680
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,210
这是麻雀
That's a sparrow, all right.

681
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,880
- 我们知道，艾尔 - 你们当时有点灯吗？
We know what it is, Al. Did you have a light burning or something?

682
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,010
有，但灯光 不至于会从烟囱传出去
Yes, but there wouldn't have been that much light going up the chimney.

683
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,930
鸟有时会被灯光吸引 但这情况确实少见
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.

684
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,600
但我们得想个办法解决！
Well, all right, but we've got to do something about it!

685
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,980
我不懂你的意思，米契 解决什么？
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?

686
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,360
鸟入侵房子
Well, the birds invaded the house.

687
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,360
应该是它们进到屋里后 惊慌失措了，如此而已
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked. That's all.

688
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,570
我知道鸟在密闭的空间里会惊慌
All right, I'll admit a bird will panic in an enclosed room,

689
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:54,490
但它们不是不小心飞进来 而是从烟囱飞下来的
but they didn't just get in. They came in, right down the chimney.

690
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:57,120
我老婆曾在她的汽车后座上 发现一只鸟
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.

691
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,700
跟他说生日会上的事
Tell him about the party.

692
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,620
没错，今天下午 我们在家举办凯西的生日会
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.

693
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,250
- 她几岁了？ - 11岁！生日会开到一半
How old is she? Eleven! In the middle of the party,

694
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,920
几只海鸥冲向孩子们！
some seagulls came down at the children!

695
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,460
丹尼尔斯小姐 昨天才被一只海鸥攻击
Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull only yesterday.

696
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,970
是，孩子们打扰那些鸟了吗？
Yeah. Were the kids bothering the birds or something?

697
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,090
因为你要是在它们周围捣乱
'Cause if you make any kind of a disturbance near them,

698
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,220
它们就会追你
they'll just come after you.

699
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,430
艾尔，孩子们当时在玩游戏 海鸥就攻击了
Al, the children were playing a game. Those gulls attacked.

700
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,940
莉迪雅，不觉得 用 “攻击” 太严重了吗？
Now, Lydia, "attack" is a pretty strong word, don't you think?

701
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,310
海鸥不会无故攻击人类
I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people

702
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,270
懂我的意思吗？
without no reason. You know what I mean?

703
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,150
大概是孩子吓到它们了
The kids probably scared them, that's all.

704
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,030
这些鸟攻击我们
These birds attacked.

705
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,780
我承认这屋子是被搞得一团乱
You got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.

706
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,540
你也许该在烟囱口加片纱网
Maybe you ought to put some screen on top of your chimney.

707
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,830
- 需要人手帮忙清理吗？ - 不用了
You want some help cleaning up? No. I can handle it.

708
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,040
清理起来应该不难
It shouldn't be too much of a job.

709
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,090
我带凯西去睡觉
I'll take Cathy up to bed.

710
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,670
我想我该留下，你觉得呢？
I think I should stay, don't you?

711
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,260
那再好不过了
It would be nice if you could.

712
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,220
我的行李在车上
My things are in the car.

713
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,760
- 跟我来吧？ - 好
- Do you want to go with me? - All right.

714
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,270
- 米契，还需要我帮忙吗？ - 不，谢了，艾尔
Well, anything else I can do, Mitch? No, thanks, Al.

715
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,940
- 我们没问题的 - 晚安，莉迪雅
We'll be all right. Good night, Lydia.

716
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,650
确实很奇怪
Sure is peculiar.

717
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,330
米契！
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!

718
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,710
- 妈，什么事？ - 我送凯西去上学
Yes, Mother? I'm going to drop Cathy off now.

719
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:28,630
我也许会去佛西特农场看看
I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm.

720
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,040
好
Okay.

721
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,790
早安
Morning.

722
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,920
早安，乔治 佛西特先生在吗？
Good morning, George. Is Mr. Fawcett around?

723
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,420
他在，女士
I think so, ma'am.

724
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,140
今早还没看到他 但他应该在家里
Ain't seen him this morning, but he ought to be in there.

725
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,970
谢了
Thanks.

726
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,660
丹，你在家吗？
Dan, are you home?

727
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:38,060
妈妈！
Mother!

728
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,280
怎么了？ 怎么回事？
What is it, dear? What's the matter?

729
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,040
艾尔马龙副警长刚来过电话 他要我过去佛西特家
Al Malone, the deputy, just called. He wants me over at the Fawcett place.

730
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,210
圣塔罗沙的警探会赶到那里
Some detectives from Santa Rosa will be there.

731
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,630
- 没问题吧？ - 是
- Will it be all right? - Yes.

732
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,590
我只是要替母亲泡点茶
I was just taking your mother in some tea.

733
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,300
请小心点
Oh, be careful, please.

734
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,100
也小心点
And you be careful.

735
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,680
米契？
Mitch?

736
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,690
是我，班纳太太
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner.

737
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:01,190
- 我认为会想喝点茶 - 谢谢
I thought you might like some tea. Oh. Thank you.

738
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,230
米契在哪里？
Where's Mitch?

739
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,650
艾尔马龙要他去佛西特农场一趟
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

740
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,570
为什么？ 艾尔不相信我的说词？
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

741
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,450
他从农场打电话过来的
He was calling from the farm.

742
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,290
- 他看见了 - 一定是
Then he saw. Oh, he must have.

743
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,620
他们找来圣塔罗沙警方
They sent for the Santa Rosa police.

744
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,250
那又能怎样？
What good will they do?

745
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,210
凯西在学校没问题吧？
Do you think Cathy's all right at the school?

746
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,300
我确定她很安全
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

747
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,390
觉得我很可笑吗？
Do I sound very foolish to you?

748
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,390
不
Oh, no.

749
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,190
我一直看见丹的脸
I keep seeing Dan's face.

750
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,610
学校里有很大的窗户
And they have such big windows at the school.

751
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,730
丹房间里的窗户全破了
All the windows are broken in Dan's bedroom.

752
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,700
- 全部的窗户！ - 别再想那些了
All the windows! Try not to think about that.

753
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,990
我真希望我能坚强一点
I wish I were a stronger person.

754
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,460
四年前，我失去丈夫
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.

755
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,090
这糟透了 依赖别人给力量
It's terrible how you depend on someone else for strength, and then

756
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,090
但这力量突然间没了 独留一人
suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.

757
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,390
我希望偶尔也能放松
I'd love to be able to relax sometime.

758
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,980
我希望能睡得着
I'd love to be able to sleep.

759
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,860
- 凯西不会出事吧？ - 有安妮在
Do you think Cathy's all right? Annie's there.

760
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,740
她没事的
She'll be all right.

761
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,700
我通常不会这样
I'm not like this, you know? Not usually.

762
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,540
我不会处处担心我的孩子
I don't fuss and fret about my children.

763
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,630
法兰克去世后…
When Frank died...

764
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:53,300
他生前很了解孩子们 非常了解他们
You see, he understood the children. He really understood them.

765
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:57,060
他就是有办法进到他们的世界 成为他们的朋友
He had the knack of entering into their world and becoming part of them.

766
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,680
- 那是很厉害的本事 - 是
That's a very rare talent. Yes.

767
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,940
我真希望能像他一样
Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish I could be like that.

768
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,190
我好想他
I miss him.

769
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,240
即使到了现在 我偶尔早上醒来还会想着
Sometimes, even now, I wake up in the morning and I think,

770
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:21,580
“我得替法兰克煮早餐”
"I must get Frank's breakfast."

771
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,330
接着我起身 这是让人起床的大好理由
And I get up, and there's a very good reason for getting out of bed,

772
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,460
直到
until, of course,

773
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,500
我记起来
I remember.

774
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,260
我想念跟他聊天
I miss talking to him.

775
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,890
凯西还是个孩子，而米契…
Cathy's a child, of course, and Mitch...

776
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,480
米契有自己的生活
Well, Mitch has his own life.

777
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,570
我很高兴他今天留下来
I'm glad he stayed here today.

778
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,400
有他在我安心多了
I feel safer with him here.

779
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,950
- 想休息了吗？ - 不
Would you like to rest now? No.

780
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,330
不，别走
No, don't go.

781
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,580
我觉得我一点都不了解
I feel as if I don't understand you at all,

782
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,830
但我想好好认识
and I want so much to understand.

783
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,840
为什么？
Why, Mrs. Brenner?

784
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,380
因为我儿子似乎很喜欢
Because my son seems to be very fond of you,

785
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,640
而我不知道我做何感想
and I don't quite know how I feel about it.

786
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,560
我甚至不知道我喜不喜欢
I don't even know if I like you or not.

787
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:29,190
喜欢我有那么重要吗？
Is that so important, your liking me?

788
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,230
我是这么想的
Well, yes. I think so.

789
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,030
米契对我来说很重要
Mitch is important to me.

790
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,700
我想喜欢他选上的女孩
I want to like whatever girl he chooses.

791
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,030
如果不喜欢呢？
And perhaps if you don't?

792
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,960
那么除了我以外 对任何人来说都无所谓
Well, then I don't think it'll matter very much to anyone but me.

793
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,670
我想米契也会在意的
Oh, I think it would also matter to Mitch.

794
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:54,170
米契总是照自己的意思行事
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.

795
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:04,770
但是我不想被抛弃
But, you see, I don't want to be left alone.

796
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:07,690
我无法忍受被抛弃！
I don't think I could bear to be left alone!

797
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,810
原谅我
Oh, forgive me.

798
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,770
原谅我
Oh, forgive me.

799
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,440
鸟杀人的事让我好心烦
This business with the birds has upset me.

800
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,910
如果米契不在 我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.

801
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,240
班纳太太，何不试着睡一下？
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner?

802
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,660
我希望我能坚强点
I wish I was stronger.

803
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,380
觉得她会没事吗？
Do you think she's all right?

804
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,420
她在学校里不会有事吧？
Do you think she's all right at the school?

805
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,470
- 要我去接她吗？ - 我不能这样要求
Would you like me to go for her? Oh, I couldn't ask it.

806
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:43,810
- 我不介意，真的 - 是吗？
Oh, I don't mind, really. Would you?

807
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,480
- 我感觉好多了 - 我现在就去
I'd feel so much better. I'll go right now.

808
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,150
梅兰妮？
Melanie?

809
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,570
谢谢的茶
Thanks for the tea.

01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,460

站在你们的桌子边

I want the rest of you to go down the hill all the way to the hotel. Now, is that clear?

在我要你们跑之前 不准出声音
Do not make a sound until I tell you to run.

891
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,960
跑得越快越好 大家都听懂了？
Then run as quickly as you can. Now, does everybody understand?

892
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,970
懂了，海沃斯老师
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

我没有歇斯底里
No, I'm not hysterical.

897
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,130
我试着尽可能冷静地向你解释
I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how.

898
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,430
好吧，是，爸爸
All right, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.

在学校
At the school.

901
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,020
不，我没有，等等 学校叫什么名字？
No, I don't. Just a minute. What's the name of the school?

902
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:14,460
- 博德加湾学校 - 博德加湾学校
Just the Bodega Bay School. The Bodega Bay School.

903
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:19,240
我不知道有多少学生 30或40个吧
Well, I don't know how many children, 30 or 40.

904
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:24,030
不，学生出了学校 鸟才开始攻击
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school.

905
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,580
- 邦迪太太，需要什么？ - 我要换零钱，卡特先生
Help you, Mrs. Bundy? I need some change, Mr. Carter.

906
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,290
应该是乌鸦
Crows, I think.

907
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,290
我不知道
Well, I don't know, Daddy.

908
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,630
乌鸦跟黑鸟有什么差别吗？
Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?

909
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,340
- 差别可大了，小姐 - 谢谢
There is very definitely a difference, miss. Thank you.

910
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,090
它们是不同的鸟，爸爸
They're different, Daddy.

911
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,840
我认为这些是乌鸦
Well, I think these were crows.

912
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,220
对，好几百只
Well, yes. Hundreds of them.

913
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,890
它们攻击孩子，攻击他们！
Yes, they attacked the children. Attacked them!

914
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,730
我不知道何时 但我现在走不开，爸爸
Well, I don't know when, but I simply can't leave now, Daddy.

915
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,190
好，再见
All right. Yes. Good-bye.

916
01:16:56,270 --> 01:17:00,070
它们都属雀形目，但品种不同
They're both perching birds, of course, but quite different species.

917
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,660
乌鸦的学名为短嘴鸦
The crow is Corvus brachyrhynchos,

918
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,120
黑鸟的学名则是蓝头黑鹂
and the blackbird is Euphagus cyanocephalus.

919
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,450
谢谢
Thank you.

920
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,960
- 你有佛西特农场的电话吗？ - 这本册子上有
You have the number at the Fawcett farm? Right here in this book, miss.

921
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,290
邦迪太太 我认为是乌鸦或是黑鸟
I can't see that it makes any difference, Mrs. Bundy.

922
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,500
都没有差别
Crows or blackbirds,

923
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,000
如果它们攻击学生 那事态就严重了
if the school was attacked, that's pretty serious.

924
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,010
我认为这两种鸟
I hardly think that either species

925
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:24,260
都没有足够的智慧 能发动一场集体攻击
would have sufficient intelligence to launch a massed attack.

926
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,760
它们的头颅太小…
Their brainpans are not big enough to...

927
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,510
我刚从学校过来，女士
I just came from the school, madam.

928
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,980
我对它们的头颅一无所知，但…
I don't know anything about their brainpans, but...

929
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,560
但我知道
Well, I do. I do know.

930
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,270
我正好对鸟类学有兴趣
Ornithology happens to be my avocation.

931
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,480
鸟类不是凶猛的生物
Birds are not aggressive creatures, miss.

932
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:43,570
它们为这世界增色 反而是人类…
They bring beauty into the world. It is mankind, rather, who...

933
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,660
山姆！三份南方炸鸡
Sam! Three southern fried chicken.

934
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,660
全搭配烤马铃薯
Baked potato on all of them.

935
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,200
请找米契班纳
Yes, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?

936
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,620
好，我等
Yes, I'll wait.

937
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,670
反而是人类坚持要
It is mankind, rather, who insists upon

938
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,380
让生物难以活在地球上
making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet.

939
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,710
- 如果没有鸟类… - 邦迪太太，不明白
Now, if it were not for the birds... Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand.

940
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,880
这位小姐说学生被鸟攻击了
This young lady said there was an attack on the school.

941
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,010
- 不可能！ - 米契？
- Impossible! - Oh, Mitch?

942
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,180
好险我找到你了
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

943
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,760
- 可怕的事… - 世界末日到了！
Something terrible has... It's the end of the world!

944
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,220
两杯血腥玛丽，迪克
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

945
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,730
学校出了什么事？
What actually happened at the school?

946
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:16,270
有一群乌鸦攻击学生
Bunch of crows attacked the school kids.

947
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,110
世界末日到了 因此主耶和华
It's the end of the world. "Thus saith the Lord God

948
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:23,740
对高山、丘陵、河流和山谷
"unto the mountains and the hills, "and the rivers and the valleys.

949
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,490
说道
"Behold I, even I,

950
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,490
我必让你们遭遇刀害
"shall bring a sword upon you,

951
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,410
“我必摧毁你们的邱坛”
"and I will devastate your high places."

952
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,410
以西结书第六章
Ezekiel, chapter six.

953
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,830
灾祸降临于清早起床
"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning,

954
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,460
“就追求烈酒之人”
"that they may follow strong drink."

955
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:41,420
以赛亚书第五章 世界末日到了
Isaiah, chapter five. It's the end of the world.

956
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:45,470
我不认为 几只鸟会造成世界末日
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.

957
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,840
- 这不是几只鸟而已 - 我不知道博德加湾
These weren't a few birds. I didn't know there were many crows in Bodega Bay

958
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,760
在这个时节会有这么多乌鸦
this time of year.

959
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,390
乌鸦会固定留在它的栖息地里
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range.

960
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,900
事实上，在圣诞节期间 我们计算过有…
In fact, during our Christmas count, we recorded...

961
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,230
邦迪太太 你们算过有多少只海鸥？
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?

962
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:03,480
休尔斯先生，哪种海鸥？ 海鸥有分很多种
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.

963
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,740
危害我渔船的那种
The ones who've been playing devil with my fishing boats.

964
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,740
- 海鸥也给你带来麻烦？ - 上周攻击我的一艘船
Have you had trouble with gulls? One of my boats did, last week.

965
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,580
这位小姐周六才被海鸥攻击
This young lady was hit by a gull only Saturday.

966
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,740
迪克，我还在等血腥玛丽
Deke, I'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys.

967
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,080
马上来
Coming right up.

968
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,120
能否请他们小声点？
Could you ask them to lower their voices, please?

969
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,540
他们吓到孩子了
They're frightening the children.

970
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,290
一大群海鸥几乎弄翻了我的船
A whole flock of gulls nearly capsized one of my boats.

971
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,300
差点扯下船长的手臂
Practically tore the skipper's arm off.

972
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,970
- 你吓到孩子了，小声点 - 好
You're scaring the kids. Keep it low. All right.

973
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,890
他也吓到我了
Yeah, well, he's scaring me, too.

974
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,390
你的意思是这些…
Are you trying to say that all these...

975
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,310
不，这不可能，赛巴斯汀
Nah, that sounds impossible, Sebastian.

976
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:38,980
迪克，我只是说出 我的船遇到什么事
Deke, look, I'm just telling you what happened to one of my boats.

977
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,810
海鸥想要你船上的鱼，休尔斯先生
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes.

978
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,270
请你用点逻辑
Really, let's be logical about this.

979
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,610
那攻击学生的乌鸦呢？
What were the crows after at the school?

980
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,740
认为它们想要什么？ 是…
What do you think they were after? Miss...

981
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,660
丹尼尔斯 我想它们要的是孩子们
Daniels. I think they were after the children.

982
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,370
目的呢？
For what purpose?

983
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,460
- 杀了他们 - 为什么？
To kill them. Why?

984
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,330
我不知道原因
I don't know why.

985
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,750
我不这么认为
I thought not.

986
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,800
丹尼尔斯小姐，自始祖鸟开始
Birds have been on this planet, Miss Daniels,

987
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,590
鸟类在一亿四千万年前 就出现在地球上
since Archaeopteryx, 140 million years ago.

988
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,720
它们等了那么久 才跟人类宣战
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time

989
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,470
不是有点奇怪吗？
to start a war against humanity?

990
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,930
- 没人说这是战争 - 威士忌加水
No one called it a war. Scotch, light on the water.

991
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,890
跟休尔斯先生 似乎就是这个意思
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.

992
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,730
谁说到战争了？ 我只是说有海鸥…
Who said anything about a war? All I said, some gulls...

993
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:25,730
- 再来点咖啡？ - 不了
- Want some more coffee? - No.

994
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,740
…攻击我的船
...came down on one of my boats.

995
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,030
如所说的 它们要的可能是鱼
They could have been after the fish, just like you said.

996
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:32,910
船长应该要射死它们
- The Captain should have shot at them. - Huh?

997
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:36,490
海鸥是食腐动物 多数的鸟类都是
Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are.

998
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,120
拿起枪 让它们在地球上消失吧！
Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the Earth!

999
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:43,210
- 那是不可能的 - 为什么？
That would hardly be possible. Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

1000
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,670
因为当今世界上
Because there are 8,650 species

1001
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,470
有8650种鸟类，卡特先生
of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.

1002
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:53,340
光是美国估计就有
It is estimated that 5,750,000,000 birds

1003
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:55,350
五十七亿五千万只鸟
live in the United States alone.

1004
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,350
世界五大洲…
The five continents of the world...

1005
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:00,310
杀光它们！ 除掉这些麻烦的动物
Kill them all. Get rid of the messy animals.

1006
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:03,520
…可能就有超过一千亿只鸟
...probably contain more than 100 billion birds.

1007
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,320
- 世界末日到了 - 那些海鸥一定是想吃鱼
It's the end of the world. Those gulls must have been after the fish.

1008
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,240
- 当然！ - 孩子们，快把饭吃完
Of course! Hurry up, children. Finish your lunch.

1009
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,030
妈妈，鸟会吃掉我们吗？
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

1010
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,870
我们也许太过小题大做了
Hell, maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this.

1011
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:19,290
几只鸟确实很反常 但没理由相信…
Admittedly, a few birds did act strange, but that's no reason to believe that...

1012
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:23,540
我说过了，这不止是几只鸟 有海鸥、乌鸦、雨燕…
I keep telling you, this isn't a few birds. These are gulls, crows, swifts...

1013
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:26,840
我没听说过 不同种类的鸟会聚集在一起
I have never known birds of different species to flock together.

1014
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,420
那是无法想像的
The very concept is unimaginable.

1015
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,720
如果真的发生了 我们根本没机会！
Why, if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!

1016
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,050
我们怎么可能斗得过它们？
How could we possibly hope to fight them?

1017
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,220
我们不可能赢 说得对，邦迪太太
We couldn't, you're right. You're right, Mrs. Bundy.

1018
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,470
发生什么事了？
What's the matter? Something wrong out here?

1019
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,350
我们正在打仗，山姆
We're fighting a war, Sam.

1020
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,640
打仗？ 跟谁打？
A war? Against who?

1021
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:47,230
- 跟鸟打！ - 真庆幸你们以为这很有趣
Against birds! I'm glad you all think this is so amusing.

1022
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,980
你们快把孩子们吓死了
You've frightened the children half out of their wits.

1023
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,190
若这位小姐说
If the young lady said

1024
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,110
她看见学生被攻击 你们为何不相信她？
she saw the attack at a school, why don't you believe her?

1025
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,120
- 攻击？ 谁攻击学生了？ - 鸟、乌鸦
What attack? Who attacked the school? Birds did. Crows.

1026
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,530
你们只顾着争辩！
You're all sitting around here debating!

1027
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,910
你们想它们接下来会怎样？ 撞破窗户？
What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window?

1028
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,960
- 妈妈！ - 外套穿上
Mommy! Shh. Put on your coat.

1029
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,380
你们何不回家把门窗锁好？
Why don't you all go home, lock your doors and windows?

1030
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,260
- 到旧金山最快的路线是？ - 高速公路，女士
What's the fastest way to San Francisco? The freeway, ma'am.

1031
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,510
怎么走？
How do I find it?

1032
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:17,010
我也要去高速公路 可以跟着我
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.

1033
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:21,010
- 那我们马上走吧 - 我的酒还没喝完
Well, then let's leave now. Haven't finished my drink yet.

1034
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,770
我尽快赶来了，凯西在哪里？
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?

1035
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:27,600
- 她跟安妮在一起，她没事 - 艾尔，学生被攻击时
She's with Annie. She's all right. Al, why aren't you over at the school,

1036
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,860
你怎么没赶到学校？
where the attack was?

1037
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,110
因为我刚刚人在丹佛西特家
'Cause I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place, that's why.

1038
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:34,150
- 他昨晚被鸟杀死了 - 什么？
He was killed last night by birds. What?

1039
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,200
慢着，米契，你还不能确定
Now, hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.

1040
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,370
马龙先生，事实是什么？
What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

1041
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,830
圣塔罗沙警方认为是重罪谋杀
The Santa Rosa Police think it's a felony murder.

1042
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,830
他们认为是小偷闯进去杀了他
They think a burglar broke in, killed him.

1043
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:45,040
那满地的死鸟又该如何解释？
How do you explain the dead birds all over the floor?

1044
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,380
圣塔罗沙警方认为 鸟是在他被杀害后才飞进来的
Santa Rosa Police figure they got in after the old man was killed.

1045
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,000
圣塔罗沙警方 今天有到学校去吗？
Were the Santa Rosa Police at your school today?

1046
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,300
- 你要来吗？ - 冷静点，女士
Are you coming? Now take it easy, lady.

1047
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,970
这里看不见一只鸟！
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight!

1048
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,810
看看天上的鸟 它们不播种也不收获
"Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap.

1049
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:05,560
“但你们的天父喂养它们”
"Yet your heavenly Father feeds them."

1050
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,440
圣塔克鲁兹 去年也发生了这种事
Say, something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year.

1051
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,230
海鸥遮盖了整座城镇
The town was just covered with seagulls.

1052
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,860
- 请快把你的酒喝完 - 没错，我想起来了
Will you please finish your drink? That's right, sir. I recall it.

1053
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:17,450
一大群海鸥在雾中迷路
A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog,

1054
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,160
朝着光线飞进了镇上
and headed into the town where all the lights were.

1055
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,450
那也造成了不少麻烦 冲进建筑物里之类的
They made some mess, too, smashing into buildings and everything.

1056
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,790
鸟就会制造麻烦
They always make a mess.

1057
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:28,000
重点是没人为此感到不满
The point is that no one seemed to be upset about it.

1058
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,500
它们隔天早上就离开了 好像什么事都没发生一样
They were all gone next morning, just as though nothing at all had happened.

1059
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,840
- 可怜的东西 - 我要走了！你来不来？
Poor things. I'm leaving! Are you coming?

1060
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,840
来了！
All right, all right!

1061
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,510
希望你们能搞清楚这件事！
Well, hope you folks figure this thing out!

1062
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,310
世界末日到了！
It's the end of the world!

1063
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,270
我该回罐头工厂了 迪克，多少钱？
I better get back to the cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

1064
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,060
赛巴斯汀，等一下
Sebastian, hold it a minute.

1065
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,020
- 我不想大惊小怪… - 没人说你是，米契
I don't want to be an alarmist about this... No one ever said you were, Mitch.

1066
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,480
我想我们麻烦大了 我不知道这件事的起因
I think we're in real trouble. I don't know how this started, or why,

1067
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:56,780
但我知道这是真的 我们不能不管
but I know it's here and we'd be crazy to ignore it.

1068
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,820
- 不管什么？  “鸟的战争”？ - 对，“鸟的战争”
To ignore what? The "bird war"? Yes, the "bird war."

1069
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,820
鸟类攻击、瘟疫… 随怎么称呼
The bird attack, plague... Call it what you like,

1070
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,700
它们正在某处聚集 它们会回来的，我敢保证
they're massing out there someplace, and they'll be back. You can count on it.

1071
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,040
- 荒谬 - 过来一下
Ridiculous. Come here.

1072
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,540
除非我们采取行动
Unless we do something right now,

1073
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,210
除非我们疏散博德加湾…
unless we get Bodega Bay on the move, they...

1074
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,250
听着，米契
Look, Mitch.

1075
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,590
就算这是真的，就算这些鸟…
Even if this is true, even if all the birds...

1076
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:20,470
- 你不相信这是真的？ - 米契，我不相信
Don't you believe it's true? No, Mitch, frankly I don't.

1077
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:23,680
- 这没道理… - 这确实发生了，还没道理吗？
There's no reason. I... Well, it's happening. Isn't that a reason?

1078
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,220
- 我爱博德加湾… - 那就协助我
I like Bodega Bay as well as the next man... Fine, then help me.

1079
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:28,640
你是镇上的要人 若你帮我，镇民都会听话
You're an important man in this town. If you help, they all will.

1080
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,940
怎么帮？ 你想怎么做？
Help how? What do you want to do?

1081
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,940
邦迪太太提到圣塔克鲁兹的事
Mrs. Bundy said something about Santa Cruz.

1082
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,570
海鸥在雾中迷路 朝着光线飞去
About seagulls getting lost in a fog and flying in towards the lights.

1083
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,900
- 这时节不会起雾！ - 那就用人工造雾！
We don't have fog this time of year! Make our own fog!

1084
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,940
要怎么做？
How do you figure to do that?

1085
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,280
学军队使用烟雾罐
We can use smoke pots, the way the Army uses them.

1086
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,490
你们看！
Look!

1087
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,410
它们又攻击了 梅兰妮，待在这里，走吧，艾尔！
They're attacking again. Melanie, you stay in here. Come on, Al!

1088
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,750
小心！
Look out!

1089
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,240
汽油流了满地 那个男人在点烟！
Look at the gas. That man's lighting a cigar!

1090
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,870
嘿！听着！别把火柴丢地上！
Hey, you! Watch out! Don't drop that match!

1091
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,250
快离开！
Get out of there!

1092
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,090
- 先生，快跑！ - 小心！
- Mister, run! - Watch out!

1093
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,500
注意！小心啊！
Look out! Look out! Watch out!

1094
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,180
嘿！
Hey!

1095
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,190
它们为什么要这么做？
Why are they doing this?

1096
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,440
它们为什么要这么做？
Why are they doing this?

1097
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,400
别人说在来了之后 整件事就开始了！
They said when you got here, the whole thing started!

1098
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,200
是谁？ 是什么东西？
Who are you? What are you?

1099
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,540
从哪里来的？
Where did you come from?

1100
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,920
我认为这都是造成的
I think you're the cause of all this.

1101
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,460
我想是恶魔！恶魔！
I think you're evil! Evil!

1102
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,090
天啊！
Oh, God!

1103
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,600
它们离开了！
I think they're going!

1104
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,220
我们可以去安妮家接凯西了
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.

1105
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:55,390
乌鸦又来了
- The crows again. - Shh!

1106
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,560
走吧
Come on.

1107
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:35,510
不，待在这里
Oh, no. Stay here. Stay here.

1108
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,100
凯西！凯西在哪里？
Cathy! Where's Cathy?

1109
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:21,180
米契，住手！
Mitch, don't!

1110
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,880
别把她留在那里，米契
Oh, don't leave her there, Mitch.

1111
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,690
走吧
Come on.

1112
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:31,020
我们送蜜雪儿回家后
When we got back from taking Michele home,

1113
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,150
我们听见了爆炸声
we heard the explosion

1114
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:38,650
我们就到外头查看
and we went outside to see what it was.

1115
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:43,030
鸟一下子聚集过来！
All at once the birds were everywhere!

1116
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,030
她急忙把我推进屋里
All at once she pushed me inside,

1117
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,040
鸟盖在她身上！
and they covered her!

1118
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,710
安妮…她把我推进屋里！
Annie... She pushed me inside!

1119
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,310
再给我一片木板
Give me another one, darling.

1120
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:19,070
它们在那边聚集多久了？
How long have they been gathering there?

1121
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,070
大概15分钟
Oh, about 15 minutes.

1122
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,870
这似乎有个模式
Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?

1123
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:33,120
它们攻击之后就消失 接着再开始聚集
They strike, then disappear, and then start massing again.

1124
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,970
看起来没什么不同，对吧？
Doesn't look so very different, does it?

1125
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,300
像一阵烟笼罩着镇上…
A little smoke hanging over the town, otherwise...

1126
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,850
要再联络父亲吗？
You want to try your father again?

1127
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,220
不，我刚刚试过了 电话不通
No, I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.

1128
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,180
- 但我们还有电力吧？ - 有
- Still got power, haven't we? - Yes.

1129
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:57,850
米契，电台传出消息了
Mitch, I'm getting something on the radio.

1130
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,270
走吧
Come on.

1131
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:08,320
我收不到当地电台
I can't get any of the local stations.

1132
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,370
这应该是旧金山的电台
I think this is San Francisco.

1133
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:13,950
“…和一组专业团队” 结束
"...and the work of a team of professionals." End quote.

1134
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,500
今早在博德加湾 有一大群乌鸦
In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows

1135
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:20,040
攻击因防火演习 而正在离校的学生
attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill.

1136
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:23,630
一位女孩因此受到重伤 被送往圣塔罗沙的医院
One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa,

1137
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:25,970
但多数学生都很平安
but the majority of children reached safety.

1138
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:28,430
我们收到镇上 还有另一起攻击事件
We understand there was another attack on the town,

1139
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:30,680
但资讯还不完全
but this information is rather sketchy.

1140
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,680
到目前为止 还没有消息指出
So far, no word has come through

1141
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:35,270
是否还有更多攻击事件
to show if there have been further attacks.

1142
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,810
今日的国内新闻，华盛顿…
On the national scene today, in Washington...

1143
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,900
就这样？
Well, is that all?

1144
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,610
我得再拿些木头进来 绝不能让火熄灭
I'll have to get some more wood in. Mustn't let this fire go out.

1145
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,910
- 米契，你有封死阁楼的窗户吗？ - 都封好了
Did you get the windows in the attic, Mitch? Yes, I got them all, dear.

1146
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:51,240
- 你觉得它们何时会攻击？ - 我不知道
When do you think they'll come? I don't know.

1147
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,370
若有更大型的鸟 它们会冲进屋子里的
If there are bigger birds, Mitch, they'll get into the house.

1148
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,950
- 我们只得冒这个险 - 也许我们该离开
Well, it's just a chance we'll have to take. Maybe we ought to leave.

1149
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,960
现在不行！ 它们正在外头聚集
No, not now! Not while they're massing out there.

1150
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,380
- 那要何时？ - 我们再看看
When? We'll just see what happens.

1151
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,000
- 我们要去哪？ - 我不知道
- Where will we go? - I don't know.

1152
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,290
目前我们很安全
I think we're safe here for the time being.

1153
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:05,760
- 我们去捡木头 - 木头烧光了怎么办？
Let's get the wood in now. What happens when you run out of wood?

1154
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,510
- 我不知道！我们可以拆家具 - 你不知道！
I don't know! We'll break up the furniture. You don't know!

1155
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,470
你何时才会知道？ 到时我们都死了！
You don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead!

1156
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:13,890
如果你爸在的话…
If only your father were here...

1157
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:21,350
对不起，米契
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mitch.

1158
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:26,190
去煮点咖啡喝，好吗？
Make yourself some coffee, won't you?

1159
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,490
在假定总统的任务时
"In assuming the tasks of the presidency,

1160
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:34,330
“我认为少有世代…”
"I said that few generations..."

1161
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:43,420
- 它们要去哪里？ - 内陆某处
Where are they heading? Somewhere inland.

1162
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,500
- 圣塔罗沙？ - 也许吧
Santa Rosa? Maybe.

1163
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:48,720
走吧，我们去捡木头
Come on. Let's get the wood.

1164
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:30,670
- 米契，我能把爱情鸟拿进来吗？ - 不行！
Mitch? Can I bring the lovebirds in here? No!

1165
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,340
- 妈妈，它们在笼子里 - 它们也是鸟，不是吗？
But, Mom, they're in a cage. They're birds, aren't they?

1166
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,970
让它们待在厨房吧，亲爱的
Let's leave them in the kitchen, huh, honey?

1167
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,110
米契，鸟为什么要这么做？
Mitch, why are they doing this, the birds?

1168
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:36,360
- 我们不知道，亲爱的 - 它们为什么要杀人？
We don't know, honey. Why are they trying to kill people?

1169
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,490
我希望我知道原因
I wish I could say.

1170
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,490
我不太舒服，梅兰妮
I'm sick, Melanie.

1171
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:02,870
- 我想… - 我陪去
I want to... I'll go with you.

1172
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,770
它们走了
They're going.

1173
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,760
米契？
Mitch?

1174
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,440
米契！
Oh, Mitch!

1175
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,040
带凯西和莉迪雅离开这里
Get Cathy and Lydia out of here.

1176
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,920
梅兰妮！
Melanie! Melanie!

1177
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,580
Melanie!

1178
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,430
可怜的东西！
Oh, poor thing! Poor thing!

1179
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:07,720
去拿点水 绷带和消毒药水过来，快！
Listen, get some water, bandages, and antiseptic. Quickly!

1180
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,100
绷带，太可怕了
Bandages. It's terrible.

1181
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,060
凯西，拿白兰地过来
Cathy, get some brandy.

1182
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:30,160
别怕！没事了
No, no, no! No, no, it's all right.

1183
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,160
好了，没事了
No, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

1184
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:35,330
没事了
It's all right. It's all right. No.

1185
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,240
凯西，拿油灯过来
Cathy, get the lamp.

1186
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:22,300
我们得送她去医院
We've got to get her to a hospital.

1187
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:25,130
- 不行，我们没地方可去 - 旧金山
We can't, Mitch. There's no place we can go. There's San Francisco.

1188
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,590
- 我们撑不到那里 - 我们得试试
We'd never make it. We have to try.

1189
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,760
我们走海湾山路 就不必穿过镇上了
We'll go by way of Bay Hill Road. Then we don't have to go through town.

1190
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:32,760
我们不能待在这里 她需要帮助！
We can't stay here. She needs help!

1191
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:35,680
我好怕，非常害怕
I'm frightened. Terribly frightened.

1192
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,400
我不知道外面有什么东西
I don't know what's outside there.

1193
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:43,860
我们最好在 下次攻击到来之前出发
We better get started before another attack comes.

1194
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:46,700
我们开梅兰妮的车 那会比开卡车快
We'll take Melanie's car. That'll be faster than the truck.

1195
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:49,360
- 能替她包扎好吗？ - 我尽量
Can you finish the bandaging? I'll try.

1196
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,780
好
All right.

1197
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:02,130
米契？ 用车上的收音机 听听有什么消息
Mitch? See if you can get anything on the car radio.

1198
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:03,870
鸟类攻击事件目前已缓和
The bird attacks have subsided for the time being.

1199
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,040
博德加湾似乎是攻击的中心 虽然赛巴斯托波和圣塔罗沙
Bodega Bay seems to be the center, though there are reports of minor attacks

1200
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:10,170
也传出了轻微的攻击事件
on Sebastopol and a few on Santa Rosa.

1201
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,760
博德加湾周围已设满路障
Bodega Bay has been cordoned off by roadblocks.

1202
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,800
多数的镇民已设法逃出
Most of the townspeople have managed to get out,

1203
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,720
但仍有少数居民受困
but there are still some isolated pockets of people.

1204
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,180
至于下一步该怎么做 当局还没有决定
No decision has been arrived at yet as to what the next step will be,

1205
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:24,440
但已有人开始讨论 是否该派军队进驻
but there's been some discussion as to whether the military should go in.

1206
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,190
鸟类攻击似乎是阵歇性的
It appears that the bird attacks come in waves,

1207
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:28,190
中间的间隔时间很长
with long intervals between.

1208
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:31,320
攻击原因目前还不明朗
The reason for this does not seem clear as yet.

1209
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,310
你有从电台上听到什么吗？
Did you hear anything on the radio?

1210
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:26,890
没关系，来吧
It's all right. Come on.

1211
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:07,600
不，不要！
No. No!

1212
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,300
米契？
Mitch?

1213
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:41,800
待在那里
Stay there.

1214
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,060
米契，我能带爱情鸟走吗？
Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch?

1215
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,400
它们没有伤害人
They haven't harmed anyone.

01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,650
好吧，带着它们
All right. Bring them.
