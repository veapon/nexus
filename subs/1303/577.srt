00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,220
Previously on The Big Bang Theory

6
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,450
Sheldon, did you just figure out a method

7
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,350
for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

8
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,910
Did I?

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,540
Well, that can't be right.

10
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,960
No one's ever done that before.

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,810
Except me, because I just did it!

12
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,620
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

13
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,650
Sheldon and his brain-- yeah!

14
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,070
I've made a horrible mistake.

15
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,410
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,190
This table-- it's in square centimeters.

17
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,970
I read it as square meters.

18
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,440
You know what that means?

19
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,420
That Americans can't handle the metric system?

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,770
But the Chinese team found the element.

22
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,950
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

23
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,730
My calculations were wrong.

24
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,880
the greatest scientific achievement of my life

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,370
is based on a blunder.

26
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,900
I'm not a genius,

27
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,770
I'm a fraud.

28
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,840
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

29
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,180
we're forever finding something in one part of the brain

30
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,560
that we thought was someplace else.

31
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
Oh, great, now I'm worse than a fraud.

32
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,990
I'm practically a biologist.

33
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,410
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.

34
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,120
My guest today is responsible for the discovery

35
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,880
of the first stable super-heavy element.

36
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,810
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

37
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,300
Thank you.

38
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,560
Uh, the university made me come here.

39
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
I didn't want to.

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,840
Uh, big fan of the show.

41
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,950
So, I understand that you actually discovered

42
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
this element by mistake.

43
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,770
Yes.

44
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,690
And some people in the science community are calling it

45
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,940
- "The Wonder Blunder." - Who?

46
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,190
Give me their names.

47
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,220
I bet it's Wolowitz.

48
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
It's just such a fascinating story.

49
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,640
Your calculations are way off,

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,480
but they find the element anyway.

51
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,010
It's like misreading a treasure map

52
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,570
and still finding the treasure.

53
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,250
Can we talk about something else?

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,970
Do you know that I yodel?

55
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,690
That's interesting, but this could be taking you

56
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,340
down the path toward a Nobel Prize.

57
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,430
And in chemistry, no less.

58
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,730
And wouldn't that be unusual?

59
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,830
Because you're a physicist.

60
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,550
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry.

61
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,710
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

62
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,420
You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow.

63
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
It is because of bullies like you,

64
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,360
every day more and more Americans

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,710
are making the switch to television.

66
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,810
President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling.

67
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,130
You're the one who made me go on the radio.

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,160
I was expecting a professional science interview,

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,550
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock.

70
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,200
Well, if the university needs money so badly,

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,690
perhaps you should start a swear jar.

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,390
That one's worth a dollar.

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,810
I know you don't like it,

74
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,330
but every time you do an interview,

75
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,370
it raises the profile of the university.

76
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,960
That translates to funding.

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,890
Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey

78
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,710
dancing for coins.

79
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,870
Of course you're not.

80
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,690
People love trained monkeys.

81
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,120
How can you not be happy?

82
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
You're tall, thin and famous.

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,780
Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.

84
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,000
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,440
You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,330
But none of you know what this is like.

87
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,360
Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
Mmm... you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.

89
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,350
I am cleaning up.

91
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,870
Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.

92
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,860
Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.

93
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,150
Raj grew up in India.

94
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,180
Trust me, he's seen worse.

95
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
Howie.

96
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,920
I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,810
The rest of the week?

98
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,430
You said it was just gonna be a night or two.

99
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,540
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,060
- would you have said yes? - No!

101
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,250
Then you left me no choice.

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,980
I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.

103
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,570
I know, but they're tenting his building.

104
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,220
He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.

105
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,550
He's bringing Cinnamon?

106
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,570
For a whole week!

107
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,340
The nerve of some people.

108
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,530
Here comes the Embarrassment Express.

109
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,700
With stops at Fraudville...

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,220
WonderBlunderberg...

111
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,040
and Kansas City.

112
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,350
Because it's a hub.

113
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Sheldon, can I come in?

114
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,710
- Do you have cookies? - No.

115
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,850
Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in.

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,080
- Wil...? - Hey, Sheldon.

117
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,310
It's been a while.

118
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,590
Why are you here?

119
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,070
Amy said you were having a rough time,

120
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,230
and I thought maybe we could talk.

121
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,470
Is that okay?

122
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,940
Certainly.

123
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
Although...

124
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,130
right now, I'm having a rough time

125
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,840
because there's three people in my room,

126
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,760
and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,420
Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention

128
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,690
for something you wished you never did.

129
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,620
Yeah, I know a little something about that.

130
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

131
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,700
Your endless tweets are not that bad.

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,140
I remember why it's been a while.

133
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,270
Sheldon, I was actually talking

134
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,400
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

135
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
How could you not like getting attention

136
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,850
for playing Wesley Crusher?

137
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,270
You were wonderful.

138
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,210
A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory.

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,580
Who couldn't relate to that?

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
Well, not everybody felt that way.

141
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,870
A lot of people really hated the character,

142
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,110
and some of them hated me because of it.

143
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,190
I would do interviews,

144
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,130
and people would be mean to me.

145
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,170
That just happened to me.

146
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,770
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

147
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,880
feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

148
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,440
Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life

149
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,070
and moved on to bigger and better things.

150
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,220
Yeah, I'm an author now,

151
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,420
I do public speaking,

152
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,230
and I have my own web series about board games.

153
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,550
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

154
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought

155
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,550
But now,

157
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,310
it's just one small part of a pretty great life,

158
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,850
and it's a part that I'm happy is there.

159
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,020
I do see what you're saying.

160
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,350
That helps.

161
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,580
Good.

162
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,790
Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?

163
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,670
- Sure. - Okay.

164
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,050
Oh, great!

165
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,660
Now...

166
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,080
I work the controls.

167
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,330
I say "All aboard",

168
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,800
you sit quietly and watch.

169
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
Can I blow the whistle?

170
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,210
You should probably go.

171
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,590
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?

172
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,880
No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.

173
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,660
Why bother?

174
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,070
She spends half the time licking her butt.

175
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,690
And the other half licking my face.

176
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,370
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

177
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,530
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

178
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,480
Did you already have dinner?

179
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,230
No, we were waiting for you.

180
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,580
Aw, that's so sweet.

181
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,860
Yeah. So what do you feel like making?

182
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,800
Howard, the poor thing just got home from work.

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,770
Let me get you a glass of wine.

184
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,750
I'll cook dinner.

185
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,150
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest. - Don't be silly.

186
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,180
Sit. You look like you've had a long day.

187
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,990
No, she always looks like that.

188
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,400
Because she married an idiot.

189
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,680
Thank you, Raj.

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,900
Please, this is my way of thanking you

191
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,380
for letting me stay here.

192
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,520
Now, tell us all about your day.

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,810
Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting

194
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,890
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

195
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,240
Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.

196
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,020
Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick

197
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,370
from eating too many jelly beans,

198
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,650
did I tell you how to fix it?

199
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,250
No.

200
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,840
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"

201
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,140
and I rubbed your belly.

202
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
I thought of you the whole time.

203
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,450
All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.

204
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,280
Thank you.

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,540
There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans.

206
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,650
And it's when you're ten.

207
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,170
Hello, President Siebert.

208
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,680
Thank you for taking my call.

209
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,070
I just wanted you to know that you can now expect

210
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,330
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery.

211
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,520
Oh, no, no, no, no.

212
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,690
No need to thank me.

213
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,680
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

214
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,870
For your information, I have nine friends, hmm?

215
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,700
Ten if we include you.

216
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,430
Nine it is.

217
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,800
Ah, it's ten. I'll count Wolowitz.

218
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,510
Hello, friend Leonard.

219
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,870
Hey, you're in a good mood.

220
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,610
I'm in a great mood.

221
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,980
Well, you're about to be in an even better one.

222
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,670
I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure,

223
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,480
but...

224
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab

225
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,680
and I disproved it.

226
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,290
Your element does not exist!

227
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,570
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team?

228
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,520
They found it.

229
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
Yeah, it turns out someone added

230
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,200
simulated signals to the data files.

231
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,070
They faked the results.

232
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,740
- Really? - Yes!

233
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,590
Do you know what that means?

234
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,830
That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.

235
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,960
So no more interviews?

236
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
No, it's all over.

237
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,100
I can't believe it.

238
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,990
Well, you're welcome.

239
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,860
You robbed me of my greatest achievement!

240
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,220
What?!

241
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm back down to nine friends!

242
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,990
Make it eight-- I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

243
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,660
I-I don't understand.

244
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,330
All you've done since you discovered

245
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,750
this stupid element was complain.

246
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,200
I was trying to make you happy!

247
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,850
By taking away my only claim to fame?

248
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,450
Well, if you wanted to make me happy,

249
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,750
you could have told me a joke.

250
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,910
Or shown me a cute video

251
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,230
of a koala and an otter

252
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,230
becoming unlikely friends.

253
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,170
Oh, there is no winning with you.

254
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,420
And koalas and otters don't even live near each other!

255
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,690
That's what makes their friendship unlikely!

256
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,420
What's with all the yelling?

257
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,430
Leonard disproved my element.

258
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,640
Now all the attention is going to go away.

259
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!

260
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,390
That's it! I'm down to seven friends.

261
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,690
He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?

262
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,550
When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.

263
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,570
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

264
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,690
I want it more than anything in the world.

265
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,510
The-the element never existed.

266
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,450
I didn't take it away, science took it away.

267
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,610
Be mad at science.

268
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,620
Don't you dare use science against me.

269
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,880
Science is my best friend!

270
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,770
Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

271
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,010
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.

272
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,320
Actually, I get what he's saying.

273
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, yes! Nine!

274
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Welcome back, buddy.

275
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,320
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into,

276
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,290
and then they break up with you

277
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,600
and then you want them more than ever.

278
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,540
I have no idea what she's talking about.

279
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,120
but we're ganged up on you so I agree.

280
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,790
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do,

281
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,230
hide the information?

282
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,100
If I don't publish it,

283
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,140
it's just a matter of time before someone else does.

284
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,910
No, no, of course you have to publish.

285
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,770
That's your responsibility as a scientist.

286
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

287
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,560
You have no choice.

288
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,580
Fine, I'll publish.

289
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,380
Can you believe this guy?

290
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,770
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

291
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,140
How do you know I didn't do them?

292
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,750
Because once, when all the knives were dirty,

293
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,160
you cut a bagel with your keys.

294
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,030
Good morning, everybody.

295
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,160
I picked up coffee while I was out.

296
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.

297
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,540
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

298
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,290
Oh, my pleasure,

299
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,340
and don't worry about your presentation today.

300
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,390
You're gonna be great.

301
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,460
Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.

302
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,830
What presentation do I have today?

303
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,890
Just go.

304
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,420
He loves you.

305
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,130
What are you doing?

306
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,680
Are you trying to make me look bad?

307
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm just being a good house guest.

308
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
No, you're being a better husband than I am.

309
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,320
Doing the dishes, getting coffee,

310
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
knowing about her life--

311
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,160
who does that?

312
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.

313
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,910
I don't want coffee.

314
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,210
That's why I got you hot chocolate.

315
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,690
Give me that.

316
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,020
Just stop showing me up.

317
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,590
Howard, listen to me.

318
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
You're a great husband.

319
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,810
Yes, your listening skills could use some work.

320
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,090
But it's amazing how far you've come

321
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,850
given that you're an only child

322
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,970
raised by an over-protective mom.

323
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,660
Um, is this getting weird?

324
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,200
Hang on.

325
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
So, yes.

326
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,250
I just wanted to let you know that I-I posted my findings.

327
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,790
I saw.

328
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,780
And I just posted a retraction of my paper.

329
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,810
Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.

330
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,000
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,580
Not to me.

332
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,490
The only other retraction I ever had to issue

333
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,310
was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother

334
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,220
was the greatest ninja in East Texas.

335
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,180
But that was just a ploy

336
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,230
to get my face out of his armpit.

337
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,000
There he is!

338
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,100
It's my favorite superhero--

339
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
the Retractor!

340
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,250
Come on, don't give him a hard time.

341
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm sorry, Cooper.

342
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I retract it.

343
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,780
By the way, Hofstadter,

344
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,320
nice job disproving the Chinese team.

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,260
It's not a big deal.

346
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,450
It's a huge deal.

347
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,190
Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing.

348
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,660
Have you ever considered a career in retail?

349
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,510
That way you could take things back for a living.

350
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,320
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

351
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh, no, that's okay.

352
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
I can fight my own battles.

353
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,320
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

354
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,610
Is...?

355
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,690
Is that a reference to my speech impediment?

356
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,790
That's pretty hurtful.

357
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,600
I...

358
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,380
I can't control it.

359
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,100
You're right,

360
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,410
That was uncalled for.

361
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,680
I take it back.

362
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,450
Of course you do.

363
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,840
Because you're the Retractor!

364
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,030
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

365
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,020
If you're here much longer,

366
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,490
I'm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.

367
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,710
Nonsense.

368
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
You need a little fattening up.

369
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,410
You've been looking too skinny lately.

370
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,060
Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?

371
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
What are you talking about?

372
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
Remember last week, when I asked you

373
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,850
if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't?

374
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,400
How's that different?

375
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,030
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful,

376
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,500
like your friend Raj.

377
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,310
Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.

378
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,820
- Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

379
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,370
He packed me a lunch this morning.

380
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,120
And there was a note inside that said, "Go get 'em"

381
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,500
Like I don't do enough around here.

382
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,780
Now I need to pack your lunch?

383
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,500
And by the way, why do you need a note telling you

384
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,930
to "Go get 'em"? You're a grown man!

385
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,450
You should know to "Go get 'em"!

386
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,510
I do know to "Go get 'em"

387
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,310
but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support

388
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,060
when I'm going and getting them!

389
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,980
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

390
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,780
Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.

391
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,610
This is stupid. Why are we fighting?

392
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,530
I don't know.

393
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,850
I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.

394
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,160
You're not a lousy husband.

395
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
You're a great husband.

396
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,170
I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.

397
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,200
Are you kidding? You're the best.

398
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,630
I know what the problem is.

399
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,130
It's him!

400
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,170
Oh, what did I do?

401
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,050
You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.

402
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,470
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage

403
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,130
till you showed up.

404
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,970
Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me,

405
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,600
but I just have to say it's nice to see

406
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
the two of you on the same page.

407
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,240
Oh, it does feel good to have you

408
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,650
backing me up for once.

409
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,500
гн I back you up all the time! - That is not...

410
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,660
- He's doing it again! - What is wrong with you?!

411
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,760
I can't believe they kicked you out.

412
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,660
I can't believe they're still married.

413
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's.

414
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,920
I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.

415
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,370
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.

416
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
What's that animal doing in our apartment?

417
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,480
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.

418
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,430
I have two words for you:

419
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,040
Jurassic Park.

420
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,640
This day just keeps getting worse and worse.

421
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,200
You know, if it makes you feel any better...

422
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,170
It probably won't.

423
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,270
You're probably right.

424
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,340
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

425
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,940
Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?

426
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,700
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,620
Sheldon, I think you might find the support

428
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,220
you're looking for, if you realize that

429
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,450
relationships are a give and take.

430
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,820
She can only be there for you

431
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,910
as much as you are for her.

432
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,580
Thank you, Rajesh.

433
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,960
And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon,

434
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,980
instead of pressuring him

435
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,750
to accept intimacy on your terms.

436
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,770
You should probably go.

437
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,540
I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.

438
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,190
I'd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

439
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,100
who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element

440
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,770
only to have it disproved by my next guest,

441
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,950
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

442
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,600
Welcome to Science Friday, gentlemen.

443
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,750
- Thanks. - Thank you.

444
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,910
Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize

445
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,550
for my behavior last week.

446
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,580
It's all right.

447
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,340
Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?

448
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,220
No.

449
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,650
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

450
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,020
Can you walk us through the process

451
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,190
you used to disprove his theory?

452
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,700
- Well... - I believe I can answer that.

453
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,030
He asked me.

454
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,080
Fine.

455
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,980
As I was saying...

456
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,650
You're telling it wrong. Ira...

457
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,660
to really understand the story here,

458
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,340
you have to start at the very beginning:

459
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,200
A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named...

460
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,380
- Sheldon... - That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

461
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,380
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

462
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,340
leading to his first scientific breakthrough--

463
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,690
the doggie death-ray.

464
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,920
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

465
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,120
because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.

466
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I mean, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

467
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,140
if it's okay with you.

468
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,700
What a surprise.

469
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,660
Did-did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?

470
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,230
Actually, I didn't invite you.

471
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,630
You came in, you took a seat,

472
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,660
and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.

473
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,970
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.

474
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,610
Well, that seems like a snooze.

475
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,290
Even for public radio.

476
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,700
You know, if we did a shot every time

477
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,050
they said something embarrassing,

478
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,280
this would be one hell of a drinking game.

479
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,070
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

480
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,140
You know, I don't just say smart things about science.

481
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,520
I also yodel.

482
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,560
I'll get the vodka.
