1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,940
(train whistle blowing)

2
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,637
(sirens blaring)

3
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,808
Spare some change?

4
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,401
- (glass shatters) - (car alarm goes off)

5
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,284
- (man grunts) - Man: Come on!

6
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,703
Hit that fucker or something!

7
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,081
You boys wanna make my money, you better get more rowdy than this.

8
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,125
Hey! Hey you!

9
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,878
You wanna get in on this? Come on.

10
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,463
$10. $10.

11
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,174
Come on!

12
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,176
Ah, fuck you then!

13
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,095
You'll never make money without me.

14
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,222
All right. All right, let's see some blood.

15
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,391
(groans)

16
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,520
That's it. That's it.

17
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,997
- Man: God damn it! - (woman screams)

18
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,625
- (gunshot) - Help me, they're coming after me!

19
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,085
Please!

20
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,795
Lady, please. Please untie me.

21
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,255
- Get this off me! - No no.

22
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,091
They're gonna fucking kill me. You've gotta help me here!

23
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,594
- Please! - My God, no!

24
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,097
Get this off my neck. Get back, don't leave me!

25
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,142
- Fuck! - (tires screeching)

26
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,526
You! Please! You've gotta help me here.

27
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,571
If you don't help me, my head is coming off my fucking body.

28
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,490
Please just untie me, that's it.

29
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,202
(screeching tires)

30
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,092
Oh brother of mine.

31
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,010
Look at you now. (laughs)

32
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,930
Boys, this isn't a joke anymore.

33
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,891
You weren't planning on leaving town without saying goodbye,

34
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,270
- were you? - Yeah, we've been looking all over for you.

35
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,146
I was getting worried. (laughs)

36
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,190
I'm your uncle. I've known you since you were fucking babies!

37
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,318
This cocksucker gave me the shittiest Christmas presents.

38
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,070
I hate Christmas.

39
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,781
You fucking brats! Fuck off!

40
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,741
Drake, stop this. We're family!

41
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,368
It's the rules, Logan.

42
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,037
You're our lucky contestant. (laughs)

43
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,042
No, please. Don't put me in there!

44
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,044
Show him how to play, boys.

45
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,339
Slick, you were always my favorite nephew, I swear to God I mean that.

46
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,801
Get your feet in that fucking death hole!

47
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,262
Fuck! (yells)

48
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,349
(yells)

49
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,226
(laughing)

50
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,981
Ivan, my boy, I want everybody here to appreciate this.

51
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,985
Time to get the show on the road boy-o.

52
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,737
- (gunshots) - (crowd screaming)

53
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,822
All right, you fucking androids.

54
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,325
My father's got something he wants you all to see.

55
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,493
And I swear...

56
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,705
anybody looks away for even a second,

57
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,082
I'll make them wish they were fucking aborted.

58
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,170
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Drake Show.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,173
Tonight's special episode is gonna be filled

60
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,175
with thrills and chills

61
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,302
and my own personal favorite...

62
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,179
lots and lots of that red shit

63
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,099
that flows inside all our bodies!

64
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,271
- Ivan?! - Cheer, you fuckers!

65
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,607
(crowd screams)

66
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,817
- (cheering) - Thank you.

67
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,361
(Logan groans)

68
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,987
How can you watch and not do anything?

69
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,405
They're going to fucking kill me here!

70
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,282
Somebody say something! Don't just stand there!

71
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,409
- (groans) - You know,

72
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,037
ever since our mother brought Logan home from the hospital,

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,247
I knew he was a fucking coward.

74
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,457
(muffled clamor)

75
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,918
I'll leave town!

76
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,337
You'll never fucking see me again.

77
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,130
Just please. I can't feel my legs, Drake.

78
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,715
He wants mercy from the Drake.

79
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,509
From the Drake?!

80
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,719
And he should know better than anybody!

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,180
Mercy ain't my style.

82
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,681
What do you want from me?

83
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,393
Logan is no longer my brother.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,270
Our relationship has been severed.

85
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:42,067
And now he's all alone in the world,

86
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,821
with nothing but a barbed-wire noose

87
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,449
around his neck. (laughs)

88
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,160
You can't let him do this! It's not just my life he's ruining.

89
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,829
Please! Help me!

90
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,664
Please!

91
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,749
You should have started begging a long time ago.

92
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,001
I have never enjoyed listening to you

93
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,170
as much as I do right now.

94
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,047
You're a fucking animal, Drake!

95
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,508
You're a shitty fucking weird little animal.

96
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,260
The way I see it,

97
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,179
I'm a fucking miracle worker,

98
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,307
because I am going to make it rain!

99
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,018
- Gun it, Slick! - (laughs)

100
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,521
- (screeching tires) - (yells)

101
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,319
(screams, moaning)

102
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,579
(laughing)

103
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,001
Well, can you feel your legs now? Can you, huh?

104
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,378
A little something else you wanted to say to me?

105
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,297
Hmm? (laughs)

106
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,425
Well, thanks for tuning in, ladies and gentlemen.

107
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,385
Who knows, maybe next time

108
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,597
one of you will be our lucky contestant.

109
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,599
- (crowd clamors) - Enjoy the ride,

110
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,686
my favorite fucking uncle. (laughs)

111
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,938
Go the fuck home, everybody!

112
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,734
And don't forget to wash your dicks! (laughs)

113
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,573
- (murmuring) - (woman crying)

114
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,369
(screeching tires)

115
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,204
$49.99.

116
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,625
(sighs) God!

117
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,415
Ugh.

118
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,348
(coin clangs)

119
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,189
(laughing)

120
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,068
Woman: I dare you to lick his dick.

121
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,737
- (group laughing) - (spits)

122
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,783
(woman hollering) Whoo! Whoo!

123
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,788
(groans, screaming)

124
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,581
You bastards!

125
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,417
Let me go, bastard! Freak!

126
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,795
Bastard! (screams)

127
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,975
(car approaching)

128
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,502
- (rock music playing) - (screaming)

129
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,588
(muffled screaming)

130
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,806
(cheering)

131
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,192
(groans, chokes)

132
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,279
- (shouts) - (groans)

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,574
Hey Slick, you gotta check this out, man.

134
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,243
It's fucking awesome. (groans)

135
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,912
(screaming)

136
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,250
Hey, where the fuck are you going?

137
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,878
Business with Dad.

138
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,936
(laughs)

139
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,984
- (man laughs) - Ah!

140
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,069
Hey Otis, what are you playing?

141
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,947
Ah! I-I forgot, Slick. I spent all my money at the arcade.

142
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,325
You owe me money.

143
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,243
- You're burning me, Otis! - (whimpers)

144
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,454
Let me call my mom. I can get my allowance early.

145
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,166
Ooh, that must be some hell of an allowance, huh? (laughs)

146
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,252
Come on, man, he's a kid.

147
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,088
- (whimpers) - Let it slide.

148
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,764
- What did you say to me? - You heard me.

149
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,308
- Let it slide. - Shh shh shh.

150
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,853
The only thing I'm gonna let slide

151
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,815
is my dick in your pussy.

152
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,947
- (whimpers) - Hey, Otie.

153
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,115
- Where you going? - Don't hurt me, lvan!

154
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,492
- Shut the fuck up! - (rips)

155
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,911
(screams, cries)

156
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,124
- Did that hurt? - No.

157
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,627
Do you wanna know how to never feel pain again?

158
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,587
No, I don't want any more!

159
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,881
- (crying continues) - Does everybody wanna know

160
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,718
how to never feel pain again?

161
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,303
Come on, Otis!

162
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,932
- Have at it! - (groans, chokes)

163
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,526
(screams, cries)

164
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,130
You know how I can tell I'm making you wet?

165
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,340
(groans) No.

166
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,093
Because you're making my dick thirsty.

167
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,517
(grunts, scoffs)

168
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,769
What are you supposed to be?

169
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,980
Some kind of badass murderer or something?

170
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,108
Why? Does that frighten you?

171
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,904
If you've got money to spend, nothing frightens me.

172
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,158
Baby, I've got all kinds of money with your name written all over it.

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,244
Well, what are you waiting for?

174
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,829
Let's go.

175
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,831
Awesome.

176
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,349
(sighs)

177
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,392
Nobody messes with you, do they?

178
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,770
Not if they give a fuck about living.

179
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,523
(snickers) So how many people have you killed?

180
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,485
What am I? A mathematician?

181
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,820
- Woman: You're too sexy for that? - You're fucking right.

182
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,281
Are we gonna fuck or what?

183
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,994
(grunts)

184
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,999
- (door clanks open) - (motor running)

185
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,339
- What the hell? - That's your ride, bitch.

186
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,758
- Come on. - This was not our fucking deal!

187
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,969
I'm paying you good money. You're gonna love this!

188
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,681
Let the girl go, punk!

189
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,933
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

190
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,895
Slick: Huh.

191
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,690
And who the fuck are you?

192
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,942
Put the knife away, kid.

193
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,695
Or I'll use it to cut welfare checks

194
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,822
from your rotten skin.

195
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,449
Well, you better cut one to Mother Teresa

196
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,828
so you can give it to her while she's finger-banging you in hell.

197
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,164
- (yelling) - Shut your filthy mouth!

198
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,960
Mother Teresa is a goddamn saint!

199
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,133
Serves you right.

200
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,593
What did you think?

201
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,929
He was gonna put a ring on your finger?

202
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,530
(phone rings)

203
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,785
(ringing continues)

204
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,082
Lock him up with the sodomites

205
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,212
and get me the goddamned chief of police now.

206
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,343
(sighing angrily)

207
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,935
Good day, sir.

208
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,188
No, please take a seat.

209
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,567
I don't think I've seen you around here before.

210
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,320
Let me guess... you rode in on the rail?

211
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,073
- That's right. - Aha.

212
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,659
So I understand you've been having a little bit of difficulty

213
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,244
with one of our young men.

214
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,413
(sighs)

215
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,957
I think you're gonna need a lot of dump trucks.

216
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,126
Dump trucks?

217
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,920
I-I don't follow you.

218
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,964
You get out there, get all the criminals, put 'em in dump trucks,

219
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,343
take 'em to a landfill site and bury them.

220
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,345
Put 'em in the ground!

221
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,347
I'm not too sure

222
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,682
I know what you're trying to say here, sir.

223
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,143
What I'm trying to say is

224
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,063
that people don't go bad like they do here.

225
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,357
(whispers) Yeah.

226
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,026
Look, if I'm being honest,

227
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,403
I can't argue with anything you say.

228
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:38,074
Crime in this city has become an embarrassment.

229
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,994
I've been suspecting some of my boys are working with Drake.

230
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,997
Can't see things getting this much out of hand

231
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,834
unless some of my officers are giving that maniac

232
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,086
a free rein.

233
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,881
So thank God for honest people like yourself.

234
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,676
You better get those officers and send them packing,

235
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,220
and start this whole operation all over again.

236
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,265
Between you and me,

237
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,851
I'd love to bring a wrecking ball down on Drake.

238
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,478
And he might as well be king around here.

239
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,233
Kings fall. You ought to read a history book, Chief.

240
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,111
Now I gave you this little bastard. Put him away for life.

241
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,698
Well, we're certainly gonna see what we can do about that.

242
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,037
By the way, did anybody officially welcome you to town yet?

243
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,081
- They never do. - Ah.

244
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,876
Well, welcome to Fucktown!

245
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,044
(laughs)

246
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,630
- (groans) - Hold still, you slimy maggot!

247
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,090
(laughs)

248
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,383
(rips)

249
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,469
- (mutters) - Get off me!

250
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,890
These two are the princes of Fucktown! (laughs)

251
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,143
- Any idea what we should do to him, Slick? - Yeah, hold him still.

252
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,479
(yells) You're a damn kid.

253
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,274
I'm gonna carve a billboard into his chest.

254
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,235
You better get that knife away from me!

255
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,779
- (groans) - Ivan: Easy, Slick.

256
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,489
I think you might be hurting him. (laughs)

257
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,911
Jesus. God, boys, whatever happened to delicacy and finesse?

258
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,914
This is so you'll never forget what you are.

259
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,253
I thought this was a police station.

260
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,714
Not a fucking circus.

261
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,218
I just wanted to help.

262
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,347
Ah-hh. (groans)

263
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,393
(laughing)

264
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,605
And don't forget, you fucking piece of shit,

265
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,982
that everyday is garbage day

266
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,236
for street trash like you.

267
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,987
Yes.

268
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,573
(groans)

269
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,581
(chattering)

270
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,297
Man in car: Hey.

271
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,342
You're so hot you make me want to cut my dick off

272
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,761
- and rub it all over your titties. - (snickers)

273
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,765
Why don't you just calm down and tell me what you're looking for?

274
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,934
I was hoping to keep it a surprise.

275
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,561
I've had enough surprises tonight.

276
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,147
Quit wasting my time. What's it gonna be?

277
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,276
Come on, Abby, I'm a regular.

278
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,820
Abby: Nothing about you is regular.

279
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,239
Hey, look, I'm the one with the money

280
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,242
and you're the one selling your hole.

281
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,787
- I know that, sweetie, - Yeah.

282
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,706
I'd love to take your money.

283
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,250
- Why don't you just tell me what you're after? - (woman groans)

284
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,546
Fuck it. Just give me the regular plus 10%.

285
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,256
Okay.

286
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,843
I'm gonna make you love the taste of my rot!

287
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,221
What the fuck? Get the fuck off me, you fucker!

288
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,851
(tires screeching)

289
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,276
Oh my God.

290
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,279
(whispers) Help me.

291
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,387
I could use a drink right now.

292
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,059
Do you mind?

293
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,355
I really appreciate you helping me out today.

294
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,483
If it wasn't for you, who knows,

295
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,902
I'd probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.

296
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,488
I see you have an empty picture frame here.

297
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,365
(snickers)

298
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,658
Why don't you put...

299
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,996
a picture of your family in there,

300
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,623
or a dog or a cat.

301
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,001
I don't really have anything worth remembering.

302
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,753
(cork pops)

303
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,298
Right.

304
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,808
(groans)

305
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,397
You seem like a smart and intelligent girl.

306
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,067
You should be teaching,

307
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,488
tell people about beautiful things and miracles.

308
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,157
You're obviously not from here.

309
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,451
I'm not from anywhere.

310
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,996
Yeah, well, I fuck for a living.

311
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,583
And believe me, I don't have a lot of other options.

312
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,044
Right.

313
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,046
Well, I wouldn't know about that shit.

314
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,506
Hey, take it easy.

315
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,342
I think I'm okay now.

316
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,970
I just...

317
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,305
tell my brain

318
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,349
when I know I'm hurting,

319
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,561
I just say, "I got nothing for you, buddy.

320
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,813
Nothing to make it go away,

321
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,649
so just go to hell."

322
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,360
And he goes.

323
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,280
He's like a brother to me now

324
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,868
and brothers fight sometimes.

325
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,536
(snickers)

326
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,372
Well,

327
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,083
I think it's time to put you and your brother to bed.

328
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,172
Abby: Come on.

329
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,592
No, I'm not gonna stay here.

330
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,427
I'm gonna go. It's all right.

331
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,345
No no, it's okay.

332
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,972
I want you to.

333
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,974
It's a good one.

334
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,143
Come on.

335
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:46,442
Well, I don't even remember when I slept in a real bed.

336
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,488
I am tired.

337
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,531
I didn't get your name.

338
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,576
It's Abby.

339
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,411
Here.

340
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,331
Put this on so you don't get blood on my sheets.

341
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,791
Oh, thank you.

342
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,923
Oh,

343
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,300
I like that.

344
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,262
(sniffs) This is good.

345
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,264
Thank you.

346
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,391
Well, Abby, can I...

347
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,437
tell you something about bears?

348
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,606
Sure.

349
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,775
(mutters) All right.

350
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,448
The bear is a solitary animal.

351
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,576
They like their space.

352
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,539
They live in a magic circle.

353
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,542
They don't mind if you're like a mile away,

354
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,337
but if you get inside their circle,

355
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,381
they will maul you.

356
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,551
If a bear's claw would ever strike your face,

357
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,805
it would take your whole face right off your skull...

358
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,474
your eyes, your nose, your lips,

359
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,101
everything.

360
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,061
And you would die from it.

361
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,438
Wow. (snickers)

362
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,482
I didn't know bears could be so vicious.

363
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,236
They are wild animals.

364
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,949
There's something else about bears

365
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,951
not many people know.

366
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,204
If a bear gets hooked

367
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,164
on the taste of human blood,

368
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,084
he becomes a man killer.

369
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,714
He'll go on a rampage

370
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,800
and has to be destroyed.

371
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,596
(sighs)

372
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,974
And that's...

373
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,686
why you should never hug a bear.

374
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,106
(snickers softly)

375
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,626
(harmonica playing)

376
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,716
(pop music playing)

377
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,677
(woman shouts) What?! What?!

378
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,304
Give me my fucking money!

379
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,139
You give me my money!

380
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,515
You fucking little bitch!

381
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,477
I'll shove that money up your...

382
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,062
- Move, bitch! - (shouting continues)

383
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,482
Do your hustle.

384
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,484
Make you feel it.

385
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,695
- (wicked laughter) - Boy: Help!

386
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,157
Don't let him take me!

387
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,785
Help me, someone. Help!

388
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,298
(man laughs) Beautiful.

389
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,218
Beautiful. I love your work.

390
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,137
(coughs)

391
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,181
(laughs)

392
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,474
Hey!

393
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,768
Back for that $10,

394
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,397
eh, dirtbag?

395
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,941
(man coughs)

396
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,110
You're right.

397
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,612
(grunts)

398
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,949
Yeah! (laughs)

399
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,534
Beautiful.

400
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm only giving you 20 for that one, buddy.

401
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,834
Now get down on your knees.

402
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,794
Go on.

403
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,297
- Down you go. - (sighs)

404
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,095
Now I want you to start chewing the glass.

405
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,555
What?

406
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,643
I want you to start eating that glass.

407
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,771
Go on. Don't even bother looking at this

408
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,565
until you start chewing.

409
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,734
Go on.

410
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,779
That's it. (laughs)

411
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,781
That's it.

412
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,330
(crunches)

413
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,583
Oh, now smile for the camera.

414
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,128
(laughs) Holy shit.

415
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,881
This is fucking gold!

416
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,716
(laughs)

417
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,343
Now...

418
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,805
pick it up with your mouth.

419
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,767
(whispers) That's it.

420
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,351
Oh oh oh.

421
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,563
(laughing)

422
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,108
Good dog. You earned your money today.

423
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,860
Yeah.

424
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,908
(yawns softly)

425
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,828
(sighs)

426
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,831
Ah.

427
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,759
Yeah, you heard me right, I want four big fucking dogs.

428
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,887
Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. And shave them first.

429
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,267
Lady... lady, I don't trade for babies.

430
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,520
If you're looking for jewelry, you gotta cough it up.

431
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,029
(snickers softly)

432
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,912
Hmm.

433
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,087
(snickers)

434
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,716
All right, everyone!

435
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,511
This is a goddamn fucking robbery!

436
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,805
- (man laughs) - (woman screams)

437
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,518
- (screaming) - (child crying)

438
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,397
Okay, this guy, this guy...

439
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,108
he is a great babysitter!

440
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,943
Don't worry about Junior.

441
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,321
I'll look after him! (laughs)

442
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,699
Give me the fucking money or I'll slit her goddamn throat!

443
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,243
- Okay okay. - What are you waiting for?!

444
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,079
Fucking kill her! Kill the fucking baby!

445
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,666
Salesman: Here it is, here it comes. There it is. All right.

446
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,418
(screaming continues)

447
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,797
Old man, you've got five seconds to give me what I want

448
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,050
or I will end her life.

449
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,010
Put your hands in the cash register!

450
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,887
Give me more, you piece of shit!

451
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,222
- That's it. That's it. That's everything. - One!

452
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,891
- No. - Two!

453
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,019
- Faster, come on! - Three!

454
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,022
No! (screaming)

455
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,040
Come on! Four!

456
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,292
Just fucking kill her already!

457
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,838
- (whacks) - I'm gonna sleep in your bloody carcasses tonight!

458
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,222
- (grunts) - Jesus Christ!

459
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,733
You vultures...

460
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,569
circle this city

461
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:13,448
tearing off the flesh from everything that is innocent.

462
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,492
- (clicks) - (sobs)

463
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,287
Please don't shoot me. I didn't even hurt her.

464
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,623
I want you out of this city...

465
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,376
you and your grave-robbing friends.

466
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,962
Spread the word.

467
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,839
(pants, screams)

468
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,009
- No! - (gunshot)

469
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,224
Pay guns!

470
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,768
Keep the change.

471
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:49,359
Oh fuck!

472
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,366
- (gunshot) - (screams)

473
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,163
(whimpering)

474
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,210
- Where's the tape? - Leave me alone, man.

475
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,088
- Take it out. - (whimpering continues)

476
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,133
Now you put it in your mouth

477
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,926
and eat it!

478
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,559
(muffled talking)

479
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,937
(screams)

480
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,981
Stupid fucking bitch!

481
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,941
Stop wasting your time doing homework.

482
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,069
Get up on the block and make me some money.

483
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,822
Come on, baby.

484
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,991
Show daddy you ain't mad at me and give me a kiss.

485
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,121
Hobo: Listen. Go home to someone who loves you.

486
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,832
- Now! - (screams)

487
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,045
And you... you're fucked.

488
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,215
- (screaming continues) - (gunshot)

489
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:03,183
- (groaning) - (man laughing)

490
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,894
Man: Fuck 'em.

491
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,062
Read 'em and fucking weep!

492
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,773
You can have the fucking bitches. (laughs)

493
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,778
- Happy Valentine's Day, you fucking sluts! - (whimpering)

494
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,697
(screaming)

495
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,283
(Hobo pants softly)

496
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,703
(panting continues)

497
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,706
- Kill him! Fucking kill him! Kill him! - (gun clicks)

498
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,709
(pants faster)

499
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:34,714
(laughs)

500
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:38,218
(all laughing)

501
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,104
(cocks gun)

502
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,982
- Hallelujah. - (women screaming)

503
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,610
- (cocks gun) - (screaming continues)

504
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,829
(Santa moaning)

505
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,832
I'm gonna come down both your chimneys

506
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,835
and give you a big present.

507
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,045
(moans)

508
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,800
Jerk on this, you child-molesting shitlicker.

509
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,969
Ah!

510
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,687
(gunshot)

511
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,398
Night watches and other anticrime groups

512
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,026
have been springing up all throughout the city,

513
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,320
and their inspiration is this brave,

514
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,530
yet still unidentified homeless man

515
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,868
who has been delivering justice one shell at a time.

516
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,621
- (gunshot) - Man: Fuck!

517
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,623
- (man screaming) - A shotgun?!

518
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,709
This town is impressed by a homeless man

519
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,253
- with a fucking shotgun?! - Ow!

520
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,381
- (women laughing) - Where's the creativity in that?

521
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,138
So what happened to you? School bully get your lunch money?

522
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,182
I don't want to talk about it.

523
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,560
Look, Slick, don't make me mad. Tell me who did this to you.

524
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,771
I don't know. Some bum.

525
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,106
Some bum!

526
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,401
Have you been watching the fucking news lately? Huh?

527
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,529
Don't worry, Dad, we carved that fucker up.

528
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,323
You carved him up.

529
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,450
Somebody does this to your brother

530
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,162
and you treat him like a jack-o'-lantern. Put your head on the table.

531
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,414
Head down now!

532
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,791
- (man yells) - Don't worry, son.

533
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,126
Everybody gets knocked out once in a while.

534
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,836
Really?

535
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,421
Have you ever been knocked out?

536
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,799
- (women laughing) - Fuck no.

537
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,009
I'm the Drake. Who's gonna fuck with me? (laughs)

538
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,805
I'm Slick! No one's supposed to fuck with me either!

539
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,975
Listen, you've got a lot of potential...

540
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,559
way more than your brother.

541
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,186
Head down.

542
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,189
Maybe even more potential than me eventually,

543
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,151
but first you've got to learn to think bigger.

544
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,820
Bigger?

545
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,447
I'll crucify him to a homeless shelter.

546
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,866
That's revenge. Don't look for revenge.

547
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,202
Look for people's fear.

548
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,372
Okay, fear. I'll cut a hole in his body.

549
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,834
I'll make them watch as I spread his intestines out all over the street.

550
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,879
Well, you be ugly, you be hateful when you do that,

551
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,840
some will fear you...

552
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,175
Slick, I wanna fear you,

553
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,011
but I don't.

554
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,595
You've got to show me

555
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,056
that you can scare the shit out of everybody!

556
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,476
So why don't you unlock that imagination of yours

557
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,105
and give them a show that is so fierce

558
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,065
that everybody in this town

559
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,985
will remember your name forever.

560
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,904
What should I do?

561
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,365
Well,

562
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,285
you need to figure that out for yourself,

563
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:55,123
but I can give you one sweet morsel of advice.

564
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:59,336
When life gives you razor blades,

565
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,630
you make a baseball bat

566
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,632
covered in razor blades.

567
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,426
Hyah!

568
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,185
(laughing)

569
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,068
- (school bell ringing) - (kids clamoring, laughing)

570
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,662
(disco music playing)

571
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,427
Do you kids like school?

572
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,473
Hey, I asked you a question.

573
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,267
Do you kids like school?

574
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,895
- All: Yeah! - What about ice cream?

575
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,398
- Do you kids like ice cream? - Yeah!

576
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,567
- Huh? And bicycles! Yeah. - Yeah!

577
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,694
And hobos?

578
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:10,490
- Yeah! - I hate hobos.

579
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,868
(kids screaming)

580
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,829
â™?Burn baby burn! â™?
 581 00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,497 â™?Disco inferno â™?
 582 00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,915 â™?Burn baby burn â™?
 583 00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,292 â™?Burn that mother down... â™?
 584 00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,336 (screaming continues)

581
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,214
â™?Disco inferno... â™?
 586 00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,135 Reporter: After a horrific act of arson this afternoon,

582
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,179
a school bus was found burning.

583
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,932
There were an undisclosed number of children onboard.

584
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,767
And there were no survivors.

585
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,395
Again, we regret to inform you

586
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,896
that only the charred bodies

587
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,691
of many many burnt children

588
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,444
remain.

589
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,990
- (gasping) - Hey, all you kids out there.

590
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,451
How are you doing today? Good?

591
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,035
(laughs) Great. Guess what?

592
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,164
I've got something very very special

593
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,040
to share with you today. Are you ready?

594
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,417
Yeah yeah, come on up to the screen, kids.

595
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,419
Let go of your mommy and daddy's hands.

596
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,173
- Come, come on, it's okay. - Get as close to the TV as you can.

597
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,467
- Do you see this?! - (gasping)

598
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,553
This is what you get if you wanna follow a beggar instead of the Drake!

599
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,431
Now it's time to play a new game.

600
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,433
It's called gutter tag.

601
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,227
- (whimpers) - It's very very easy.

602
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,189
And every single one of you gets to play!

603
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,900
All you homeless people, you're it.

604
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,819
Everyone else, you get to kill them...

605
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,071
all of them. Otherwise...

606
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,573
We're going to kill the rest of your children!

607
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,408
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, one more thing

608
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,745
before you continue on your busy day:

609
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,832
I want that Hobo's head on my wall.

610
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,876
And whoever brings him to me,

611
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,713
gets all my broads!

612
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:53,051
(laughs) Oh, you're gonna like 'em!

613
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,471
(moaning)

614
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,474
- (tone) - (gasps)

615
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,445
Grab your guns, boys! Grab your fucking guns.

616
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,865
We've got homeless to kill. So let's go make some dead bodies.

617
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,409
At least he's only shooting the dirty cops.

618
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,037
We're all dirty cops.

619
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,686
- Man: Get him! - Man #2: Get him!

620
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,654
- (motor revving) - (clamoring)

621
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,245
(laughs)

622
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,316
(cheering)

623
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,366
(distant screams)

624
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,418
(slow pop music playing)

625
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,253
You uh...

626
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,797
you ever sleep with a prostitute, kid?

627
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,216
No, sir.

628
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,136
Fuck, she's so hot.

629
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,264
I'd eat the peanuts out of her shit.

630
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,183
(laughs)

631
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,020
(laughs) Come on, what the fuck is wrong with you?

632
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,189
This conversation is disgusting.

633
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,191
Well, you can't beat your wife

634
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,360
like you can beat a whore.

635
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,404
See, that's what I love about them.

636
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,493
Tell you what, we'll go splits on this one.

637
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,578
You're joking, right?

638
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,750
(sirens blaring)

639
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,678
Hey, hey, Abby.

640
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,805
Fuck,

641
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,557
I love the smell of your asshole.

642
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,269
Why don't you get in here and take me for a ride?

643
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,689
My legs are closed for the night.

644
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,732
Maybe we should get back to work.

645
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,819
Yeah, you get back to the fucking station.

646
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,863
Get the fuck out of here!

647
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,867
Come here, baby!

648
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,836
(panting)

649
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,552
- No! - Baby doll.

650
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,679
I am gonna break your legs off

651
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,598
- to get at your sweetness. - (sobbing)

652
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,642
- Don't hurt me. I'll do anything! - (unzips fly)

653
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,730
That's not even a fucking option.

654
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,773
Now I'll tell you what... you make sure

655
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,651
that I enjoy what you give me

656
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,319
and I'll make sure

657
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,823
that you can still crawl home when I'm done.

658
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,658
(sobbing)

659
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,453
Oh, come on now. I know you want it.

660
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,163
- No! - (zips fly)

661
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,666
You little fucking whore.

662
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,630
Step away from the girl.

663
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,257
I'm a cop!

664
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,510
- Don't do anything fucking stupid! - Shut up!

665
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,804
Look at her.

666
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,848
What do you see?

667
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,892
I don't know, man.

668
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,936
She's... she's just a fuck tube.

669
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,442
She is a teacher!

670
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,694
(shrieks)

671
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,865
She despises you.

672
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,453
And so do I!

673
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,750
Stop! Stop!

674
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,920
What are you doing?

675
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,923
Let me walk you home!

676
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,467
Why are you out so late? It's dangerous!

677
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,427
Why are you doing this?

678
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,513
- (clamoring) - Shit.

679
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,017
Man: I heard a gunshot! Come on, let's go!

680
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,020
- (groans) - What are you doing? You can't kill them.

681
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,733
I'm cleaning the streets from the shit.

682
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,777
And the smell makes me sick.

683
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,780
They're not bad people. They're just scared.

684
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,115
You're not afraid of what they'll do to us

685
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,159
- when they come here? - (pants)

686
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,912
We have to figure something out.

687
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,510
(all shouting)

688
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,723
He shot him! The Hobo shot him!

689
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,976
He's back there!

690
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,626
Mom, I need my allowance early this week.

691
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,378
I just do!

692
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,341
- Okay, come on. Come on. - (insect buzzes)

693
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,019
You're pretty sick, you know that?

694
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,439
Come on, we gotta go.

695
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,567
(groans)

696
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,027
(yells)

697
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,946
Damn it! Ah!

698
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,910
I gotta go, Mom.

699
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,372
Where the hell were you going

700
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,917
- when you left here? - When?

701
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,005
Come on, man, I let you sleep in my bed.

702
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,840
Tell me where you went.

703
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,179
I just wanted to buy a lawnmower.

704
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,681
Wait,

705
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,225
you wanted to buy a lawnmower?

706
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,937
Oh, yeah. After all those years living

707
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,521
in box cars and on the streets,

708
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,858
I thought I might start up my own business.

709
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,486
That's what we'll do.

710
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,947
I've got my own slogan.

711
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,157
You grow it, I cut it.

712
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,825
You grow it, we cut it.

713
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,328
We'll get out of this town and go somewhere

714
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,246
where they have nice big lawns to mow.

715
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,707
This isn't the only place grass grows.

716
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,834
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

717
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:28,589
First I gotta wash this guy's asshole off my face.

718
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,472
(motor revving)

719
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,100
Slick! Slick!

720
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,103
Slick, they're in there! Do you need any backup?

721
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,814
- I could join your gang. - Shut up, Otis. Now fucking beat it!

722
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,066
- You're pissing me off. - (laughs)

723
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,866
Jesus Christ. Ivan, you're going to ruin your fucking skates.

724
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,953
I ruin everything! (laughs)

725
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,914
Let's fuck.

726
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,130
Macaroni, beans, I don't know.

727
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,299
- What would you take? - Why are you in such a rush?

728
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,720
You just shot a fucking cop.

729
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,888
Everybody wants to kill you.

730
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,558
Oh, all right.

731
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,977
We need a blanket. It's gonna get cold at night.

732
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:27,189
- And uh, some matches. - I don't have much money.

733
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,027
All right.

734
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,198
Don't worry about the money. We'll hop on a train.

735
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,910
We'll get a job somewhere and we'll start saving up.

736
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:43,873
No no. No no no. No TV. We've gotta travel light.

737
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,042
Right. Fuck TV!

738
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,210
- (shatters) - None of this shit.

739
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,839
Just take what you need.

740
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,180
Okay, I think I'm ready.

741
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,392
Okay, I'm ready too.

742
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,145
(footsteps approaching)

743
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,903
Hah, whoo!

744
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,405
It's a beautiful day for a skate rape!

745
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,241
(softly) Is there another way out?

746
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,121
Whoo!

747
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,000
(groans)

748
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,046
Do you fucking see me?!

749
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,674
Do you fucking hear me?!

750
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,134
(screams)

751
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,178
Do you fucking...

752
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,555
feel me?

753
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,017
(groaning)

754
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,269
Why don't you get up, beggar,

755
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,021
and beg me for your fucking life?

756
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,606
- Hyah! - (groans)

757
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:55,027
Do you fucking fear me?

758
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,072
Fuck you! (screams)

759
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,116
(grunts softly)

760
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,993
- My face! - (screaming continues)

761
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,665
Don't kill that fuck without me.

762
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,793
Turn that whore into a baby factory. (laughs)

763
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,169
- Ah! - (groans)

764
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,015
Hit me again, motherfucker! In my fucking face!

765
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,856
I'm gonna wash this blood off with your blood.

766
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,191
- Get away from me! - Yeah?

767
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,985
No! (sobs)

768
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,863
(screams)

769
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,656
(cries) Don't kill me. Don't.

770
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,324
But I love murder.

771
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,826
(screams)

772
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,286
Come on, Grandpa, play with me.

773
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,663
Fucking play with me, Grandpa.

774
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,666
(gasps)

775
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,252
Fuck. (grunts)

776
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,463
Yeah! Now we're getting rowdy! (laughs)

777
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,508
Hyah!

778
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,135
(laughs, gasps)

779
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,179
(groans)

780
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,307
(muffled screaming)

781
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,692
(softly) Abigail.

782
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,073
(screaming)

783
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,617
Shh shh shh.

784
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,873
You!

785
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,919
Do you know me?

786
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,672
(screaming)

787
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,595
He made me come! Oh my God!

788
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,224
Slick, what the fuck is going on in there?

789
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,310
You better be killing that fucking hobo!

790
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,397
- Get the fuck out of here, lvan. - Now!

791
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,274
Bro?

792
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,196
All right, you scum carving fuck.

793
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:06,075
- I'm sorry. Please. - I'm gonna make you regret a whole lot of living

794
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,993
and teach you some respect!

795
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,370
All right, man, you win. You win.

796
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,830
Just tell me what you want. My dad owns this fucking town.

797
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,541
I bet there's not one human being in this town

798
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,252
whose life you haven't ruined.

799
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,462
Please please, don't shoot my dick off, okay?

800
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,756
I'm young. I've got too much fucking left to do.

801
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,967
- Please! - Goddamn it, boy!

802
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,760
No-oo!

803
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,930
(groans, crying)

804
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,977
I'm gonna get you to a doctor!

805
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,146
(crying continues)

806
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,233
(panting)

807
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,402
- (rings) - Just give me the fucking phone.

808
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,988
- What? - Dad.

809
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,865
(groaning) My bo... my whole body hurts, Dad...

810
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,826
- everywhere. - Slick?

811
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,327
Where are you? What happened?

812
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,997
He shot my dick off!

813
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,250
Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you.

814
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,502
I'm not gonna make it, Dad.

815
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,754
I'm dying. I'm dying.

816
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,840
Slick boy, you...

817
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,801
you're... you're tough. I'm... I'm so proud of you.

818
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,845
You're the toughest kid I know.

819
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,014
Thank you.

820
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,771
Hey Dad...

821
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,403
you were a pretty rad father.

822
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,281
Slick.

823
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,491
Slick?

824
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,952
Slick!

825
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,122
(screaming)

826
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,301
- Hobo: You. - (gasps)

827
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,262
Fix this girl.

828
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,392
- Now! - (gasps)

829
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,894
(alarm blasts)

830
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,481
(grunts)

831
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:04,777
- Woman: Stop! You can't do that! - Just fix her!

832
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,612
Shit!

833
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,991
(groaning)

834
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,332
Summon the Plague.

835
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,212
Tell them to bring me that hobo.

836
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,353
Man: Check the vitals.

837
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,896
Woman: Blood pressure declining rapidly.

838
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,198
Stay with us honey. Come on, stay with us.

839
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,784
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right.

840
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,335
- (nurse whimpering) - (rapid beeping)

841
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,965
- (monitor flatlining) - She's fucking dying!

842
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,801
- Come on! Stay with me! - (man grunts)

843
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,430
Live! Live, you fucking whore!

844
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,098
(loud grunting)

845
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,392
(engine starts)

846
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,562
Come on!

847
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,898
(chokes, gurgles)

848
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,364
That's it. Come on. Stay with me.

849
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,118
- Stay with me. - (Abby coughs)

850
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,173
(thunderclap)

851
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,513
(respirator hissing)

852
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,240
Hey you.

853
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,452
(softly) Welcome back.

854
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,914
It's good to see you.

855
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,002
I wanted to give you something.

856
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,302
They're beautiful.

857
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,805
Just to make sure you don't forget me.

858
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,852
Where are you going?

859
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,148
I have to get back to work.

860
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,276
Please don't.

861
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,447
You should put them in your classroom.

862
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,660
They'll be good by the window.

863
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,996
(sighs)

864
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,793
You know I'm not really a schoolteacher, right?

865
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,797
- (sighs) - You do,

866
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,091
right?

867
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,094
Yeah.

868
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:21,014
But everybody...

869
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,559
ought to have a dream.

870
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:33,610
You can't solve all the world's problems with a shotgun.

871
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,615
(softly) It's all I know.

872
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,618
(sighs)

873
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,665
(motorcycles approaching)

874
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,313
(screaming)

875
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,285
(baby coos)

876
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,386
(cooing continues)

877
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,598
(whispers) Yeah.

878
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:48,685
(snickers) A long time ago...

879
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,731
I was one of you.

880
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,529
You're all brand new and perfect...

881
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,949
no mistakes, no regret.

882
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,495
People look at you

883
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,790
and think of how wonderful your future will be.

884
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,793
They want you to be something special,

885
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,796
like a doctor

886
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,923
or a lawyer.

887
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,968
I hate to tell you this,

888
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,931
but if you grow up here, you're more likely

889
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,394
to wind up selling your bodies on the streets

890
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,146
or shooting dope from dirty needles

891
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,148
- in a bus stop. - (baby crying)

892
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,984
And if you're successful,

893
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,695
you'll make money

894
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,240
selling junk to crackheads.

895
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,536
And you won't think twice about killing someone's wife

896
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,996
because you won't even know

897
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,625
what was wrong in the first place.

898
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,002
(babies crying louder)

899
01:01:56,170 --> 01:02:00,340
Or maybe...

900
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,428
you'll end up like me...

901
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,433
a hobo with a shotgun.

902
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,978
I hope you can do better.

903
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,983
(whispers) You are the future.

904
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,034
(silent)

905
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,746
That's it!

906
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,834
I am sick and tired

907
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,753
of you fucking junkies!

908
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,467
(both screaming)

909
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,853
Whoa.

910
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,943
(screaming)

911
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,494
(choking)

912
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,414
Oh. (groaning)

913
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,546
What's going on?

914
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,007
(grunts)

915
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,637
(groaning)

916
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,850
(choking)

917
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,317
(gasps)

918
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,027
(choking)

919
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,703
(gasps)

920
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,581
(babies crying)

921
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,168
(softly) Abby!

922
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,881
(screeches)

923
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,137
Abby?

924
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,431
(whispers) Abby, come on.

925
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,769
Ah! Oh!

926
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,772
(muffled screaming)

927
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,609
(screams)

928
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,406
(grunts)

929
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,663
(Hobo groans)

930
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,958
(screeches)

931
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,846
(thunder rumbling)

932
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,395
(shrieking)

933
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,906
Psst.

934
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,908
(shrieking continues)

935
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,202
You got a match?

936
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,466
Mm. (blows)

937
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,902
Ah, the Plague. You guys fucking rock!

938
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,697
(low monstrous voice) Do you want to see him?

939
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,949
(sighs) No, I trust you guys.

940
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,995
(sniffs) I can fucking smell him from here.

941
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,496
Take him to the truck.

942
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:27,459
You know, I almost feel sad for you.

943
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,337
You're in the shadow of your brother.

944
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:37,719
And you're just a little tiny thug.

945
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,973
A thug?!

946
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,976
Listen, you homeless piece of shit,

947
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,063
I'm the only son Drake has left!

948
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,981
And you know what that means?

949
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,442
That means I run the fucking show!

950
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,360
I'm gonna show everybody.

951
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,613
They're gonna fear the fuck out of me!

952
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,949
In fact, they're gonna make comic books

953
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,911
out of my hate crimes!

954
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,955
I promise you when I get out of here,

955
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,459
I'm gonna bite your face off.

956
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,544
(laughs)

957
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,089
That's funny 'cause I promised myself

958
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,217
I would bash your fucking teeth in

959
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,594
and make a chainsaw out of them.

960
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,180
(coughs) Fucker.

961
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,190
(grunts)

962
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,159
(people shouting)

963
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,539
Hold it right there, lady.

964
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,416
What the hell do you think you're doing?

965
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:35,378
You want to know if I'm homeless so you can kill me?!

966
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,089
Yeah, are you?

967
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,136
Some people got a bed to sleep on

968
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:47,182
where they can crawl under the covers and have a good night's rest.

969
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,059
But other people, they don't got beds at all.

970
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,563
Instead, they gotta find an alleyway or a park bench

971
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,649
where some fucker's not gonna stab them.

972
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:59,569
Just 'cause they don't got beds doesn't mean they're homeless.

973
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,573
'Cause guess what, they've got the biggest home of any of us.

974
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,784
- (sirens blasting) - It's called "the streets"!

975
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,205
And right now we're all standing in their home,

976
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:14,542
so maybe we should show them some goddamn respect.

977
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,170
If this is their home,

978
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,130
they've got a right to keep it clean, don't they?

979
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,175
Sometimes on the streets

980
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,261
a broom just ain't gonna fucking cut it.

981
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:28,139
- That's when you gotta get a shotgun! - (all gasp)

982
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,893
So if you want to kill me, go ahead.

983
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,729
But I'll warn you: From where I'm standing,

984
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,900
things are looking real fucking filthy!

985
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,578
(drums playing)

986
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,418
Ladies and gentlemen,

987
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,045
welcome back

988
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,506
to the Drake Show!

989
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:05,301
(cheering)

990
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:12,308
Yeah! That's how you cheer, you fucking creatures.

991
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,311
- Whoo! - Thank you, thank you.

992
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,480
Thank you, everybody.

993
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,024
Tonight I have a special treat

994
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,110
for you all... the culmination

995
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,738
of one of the bloodiest spectacles we have ever witnessed.

996
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,075
Everybody, please a round of applause

997
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:32,161
for the team that made this possible...

998
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:35,373
- the Plague! - (cheering)

999
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,880
Now

1000
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,134
I want you all to meet our special guest,

1001
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,594
a man I'm sure you've all heard about.

1002
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,723
Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado,

1003
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,559
let's bring on the man of the hour,

1004
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:58,146
the one responsible for the death

1005
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,148
of my favorite son.

1006
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,567
And here he is,

1007
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,653
a worthless homeless

1008
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,156
piece of shit.

1009
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,034
Get your hands off me, demons!

1010
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,744
You're crushing my smokes.

1011
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,746
When God lost His son,

1012
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,165
He knew He'd get him back in a few days.

1013
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,125
He didn't have to mourn, not for a single second.

1014
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,170
But I know I can't get my son back.

1015
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,672
So what does that make me,

1016
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,342
when I know more about pain

1017
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,054
than the most powerful being in the universe?

1018
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,140
You're a fool

1019
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,309
and a shitty father.

1020
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,232
Take him to the glory hole.

1021
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,902
(cheering)

1022
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:52,700
Look up at all those people.

1023
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,827
I'm their god.

1024
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,872
They fear me more than anything.

1025
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,916
And that fear

1026
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,044
is what saves their lives every day.

1027
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,546
If I want something from them, I take it.

1028
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,799
If they try to fight back, I kill them.

1029
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:11,052
- Fucker. - They live to please me.

1030
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,096
Because if they don't,

1031
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,972
I'd cut off their fucking heads!

1032
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:18,101
- (cheering) - (yells)

1033
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,150
Well, now you look scared.

1034
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,112
Drake,

1035
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,155
eventually,

1036
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:35,660
evil will turn against evil.

1037
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,246
It'll wipe itself out...

1038
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,248
(engine revs)

1039
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,626
...leaving nothing but wreckage

1040
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,379
and fucked-up memories.

1041
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,882
- (monster mutters) - (groans)

1042
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:54,429
Every time I find somebody like you

1043
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,556
who wants to be a hero,

1044
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:59,183
who wants to fuck with me and stop my show,

1045
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,018
I send 'em

1046
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:04,522
straight to hell.

1047
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,650
(engine whirring)

1048
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,488
What the...

1049
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,324
Let him go, Drake,

1050
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,285
or I'll chop your boy to pieces.

1051
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,370
Abby.

1052
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,955
I mean it!

1053
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,374
I'll mulch this fucker in the ground.

1054
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,335
What do you think?

1055
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,796
Replaceable.

1056
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,090
(chuckles) Dad,

1057
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:34,510
I'm the only son you have left. Quit fucking around.

1058
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,221
Sorry, boy,

1059
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:40,600
but you've just never had that much potential.

1060
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,812
- (cheering) - (Drake laughs)

1061
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,191
No one upstages the Drake!

1062
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,735
(screaming)

1063
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,071
Do you see what I mean, folks?

1064
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,408
I provide you with nothing but the highest-quality,

1065
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,243
adrenaline-filled

1066
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,705
family entertainment!

1067
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,957
(screaming continues)

1068
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,547
- (screams) - (engine revs)

1069
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,217
(laughs)

1070
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:25,520
Okay, Rip, let's get us some Hobo head!

1071
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,813
(cheering)

1072
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,066
- Mm. Ooh! - (screeching tires)

1073
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,282
- Ah. - (booing)

1074
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,954
- Let's go home. - Get this off me.

1075
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,790
- (screams) - You wanna be the star of this show?

1076
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,458
Well, I'll make you shine.

1077
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,420
You take your dirty hands off her, you bastard!

1078
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,256
I'd love to just shoot her but my audience,

1079
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:56,634
they expect more. (laughs)

1080
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,303
- Get your hands off me! - Settle down, honey.

1081
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,347
This will be the best trick you ever gave.

1082
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,599
- Stop! - Oh yeah.

1083
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,643
(screams)

1084
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,854
- Let's start with a nose job, huh? - No!

1085
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,149
(screaming)

1086
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,776
Bleed, baby baby.

1087
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,698
(gasping)

1088
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,126
- Whoa. Ah! - (screaming continues)

1089
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,726
- Get me out of this hole! - How?

1090
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,979
- Uh, pull my hair! - What?

1091
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,316
My hair. Pull it. Pull it!

1092
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:55,359
(Abby groans)

1093
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,236
Harder. Harder!

1094
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,990
(screaming)

1095
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,117
(paints)

1096
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:11,459
- Untie me. - (sobbing)

1097
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,503
(groans)

1098
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,214
(rumbles softly)

1099
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:19,508
Demon's coming back.

1100
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,678
(Hobo grunts)

1101
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,275
She killed Grinder.

1102
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,279
Now she must take his place in the Plague.

1103
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,702
She's not going anywhere, buddy.

1104
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,431
Listen to me.

1105
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:10,226
You can't fall asleep now.

1106
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,228
You hear me?

1107
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:15,314
(breathing heavily)

1108
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:23,489
Listen,

1109
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,242
there's one more thing I have to do.

1110
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,411
No. I just...

1111
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:31,247
(sobs) I just wanna go to the zoo and...

1112
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,708
and see the bears with you.

1113
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,252
(sniffles)

1114
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:41,924
Don't... don't leave.

1115
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,468
Don't leave.

1116
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:47,555
Bears don't belong in a zoo.

1117
01:18:56,773 --> 01:19:00,693
(Drake groans) Stupid fucking bitch.

1118
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:03,320
I'm gonna get to find her.

1119
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,699
(mutters, laughs)

1120
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,910
I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna kill her

1121
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,913
and I'm gonna cut his fucking nuts off

1122
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,624
and stick 'em up his fucking mouth!

1123
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,752
(groans)

1124
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,757
Show's over.

1125
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,176
You know,

1126
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,011
except for killing my son,

1127
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:31,557
you made my town a lot more interesting.

1128
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,059
You're so fucking crazy.

1129
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,853
I would have been your biggest fan,

1130
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,689
- you worthless street rat. - (sirens blaring)

1131
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,651
(screeching tires)

1132
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,282
Drop the fucking gun,

1133
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,910
you cocksucking garbage bag.

1134
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,915
Come on, come on, go, move move.

1135
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,960
Flank to the right, sir.

1136
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,295
Man: They're gonna shoot him!

1137
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,964
Put it down and walk away.

1138
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,091
It's your only chance to leave alive!

1139
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,805
You wanna die for a town

1140
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,932
that never gave a fuck about you?!

1141
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:15,476
(sighs)

1142
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,856
- (snickers) - You'll never beat the Drake.

1143
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:23,734
This town worships me.

1144
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,403
Boys, if he shoots, kill the fucker.

1145
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:28,405
(all shout)

1146
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,616
Whoa, what the fuck are you doing!

1147
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,910
Get back inside, everybody.

1148
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,497
- (shouting continues) - Put your weapons down!

1149
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,085
I said put those fucking weapons down!

1150
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,712
(man yelling) Back the fuck up!

1151
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,216
Okay, get rid of these fucking animals now.

1152
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:52,388
You fuckers!

1153
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,769
You and me are going on a car ride to hell.

1154
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,940
You're gonna miss me.

1155
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,527
You're riding shotgun.

1156
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,945
(shrieks) No-oo!

1157
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,122
