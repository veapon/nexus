1
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,569
Come on! Come on, kid!

2
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,153
The fuck?

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,406
Look at me. Fuck!

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,784
Come on, Oleg, stay with me.

5
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,495
Come on. Come on!

6
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,794
Come on, kid.
We're gonna make it.

7
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,045
We're gonna crash!

8
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>Yeah, mon.</i>

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>Sweet like cola wine.</i>

10
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,492
<i>Come on,
we count the hundreds only.</i>

11
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,996
<i>Jeez.</i>

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,586
<i>Why don't they finish it?</i>

13
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>We're good.</i>

14
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,101
<i>What you have there?</i>

15
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,522
<i>It's all looking very good.</i>

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,232
Nobody fucking move!

17
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,275
- Eat the floor, fucker!
- Down on the ground!

18
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,277
- Get down!
- Now, you cocksuckers!

19
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,529
You heard him! Get down!

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,447
You're makin' the biggest
fuckin' mistake--

21
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,615
Shut up!

22
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,450
Down, motherfuckers, down!

23
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,953
Everybody,
eat the fuckin' floor!

24
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,120
Fucker!

25
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,166
Now, very fuckin' carefully,
reach into your jackets...

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,753
and take out whatever you're packin'
and slide it under the bed!

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,838
Fuck you.

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,799
Come on, all of you!
Move it! Come on, fuckheads!

29
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,052
Keep it moving! Now!

30
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,388
You better spend it
real quick, shitbags.

31
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,557
You ain't long
for this fuckin' world.

32
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,476
Yeah, right. I'll be sure
to have a mai tai on you.

33
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,647
All of you goombah fucks.

34
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,108
Come on.
I'll have one on you, too.

35
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,276
Go, go! Come on!

36
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,569
Come on! Move, move, move!

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,653
- Hurry!
- Fuckin' move!

38
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,821
Get going! Move!

39
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,198
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Come on!

40
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,451
Come on! Now!

41
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,332
Motherfucker!

42
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,093
No, man.

43
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,514
You fuckers!
You motherfuckers!

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,975
We don't give a fuck
about these niggers.

45
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,436
Now, you spill Perello blood...

46
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,855
you're deep-6 invested.
Walk clean.

47
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,940
Piss on Perello blood!
Fuck him!

48
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,569
Shit!

49
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,613
God damn it!

50
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,699
I don't think so.

51
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,660
Son of a bitch!

52
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,287
Motherfucker! Fuck you!

53
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,299
Fuck!

54
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,510
Come on!

55
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,470
Get up, you fuck!

56
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,804
Come on!

57
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,993
Guys, let's blow this cunt!

58
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,662
What a fuckin' pussy!

59
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,081
What? Where you goin',
you fuck?

60
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,041
We can work this out!
Let's talk!

61
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,085
Fuck you!

62
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,840
Shut the fuck up!

63
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,386
Where the fuck you reachin'?

64
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,888
- Please--
- Tell you what...

65
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,391
have a mai tai on me...

66
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,315
Fuck me. He's a cop.

67
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,986
A fuckin' cop?!

68
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,821
Motherfucker!

69
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,532
Get the shit,
and let's go! Now!

70
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,741
Hurry the fuck up!

71
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
Fuckin' dirty mooks.

72
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,084
Cocksuckers!

73
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,795
Is there one fuckin' honest cop
in this fuckin' city?

74
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,797
Joey.

75
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,800
Give me your gat.

76
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,929
Take this shit
and get rid of it.

77
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,973
And do me a favor--
don't fuck it up.

78
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,312
No!

79
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,070
Give, loser punk!

80
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,489
Never...dickwad!

81
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,828
Sorry. You OK?

82
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,790
Shit.

83
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,126
I didn't mean to do that.

84
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,358
Call now.

85
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,444
Hey, boss.

86
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,988
What are you doing there?

87
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,949
Whacking off
to the E! Channel again?

88
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,441
I just want to smell you.
Stay just like that.

89
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,151
You didn't call,
you son of a bitch.

90
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,130
Let me guess.

91
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,590
Those are my pearls
you've been promising?

92
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,551
No. No, it's nothing.
Just a little recycling.

93
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,053
Joey, come on.
You are looking for trouble...

94
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,722
'cause if Tommy ever found out
about that--

95
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,517
Just remember it's just our little
insurance policy, all right?

96
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,227
'Cause there's no way in hell
I'm gonna be thinkin'

97
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,189
about gettin'
some of this right here...

98
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,690
lookin' at you through
some glass window.

99
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,692
There's no fucking way.

100
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,559
No, Joey, come on.
No, no, no...

101
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,061
No. No!

102
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,230
Come on, baby.
Baby, look. Look at me.

103
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,564
- What?
- Nicky's around.

104
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,732
No, Nicky's busy.

105
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,150
Come on, I'll be quick
and real quiet. Come on.

106
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,778
Quiet? I don't think so.
Quick, I can believe.

107
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,571
You know somethin', Mrs. G?

108
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,615
- What?
- You're bad.

109
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,576
Yeah, yeah... Sure.

110
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,371
- I got a rep.
- Yeah? You got a rep.

111
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,748
- Yeah, some things--
- You got a crazy rep.

112
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,877
Teresa likes to make it
on washing machines.

113
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,088
On select occasions, yeah.

114
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,591
- No, no.
- What?

115
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,802
My sauce! My sauce is bubbling!

116
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,011
Wait, that's how I like it!

117
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,721
Yeah.

118
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,306
Fuck! Come on!

119
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,892
Hey! You use language
like that...

120
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,562
you ain't gettin'
no after-dinner dessert.

121
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,981
Go find Nicky.

122
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,024
I think he's up
in the bedroom with Oleg.

123
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,693
Why's he always
with that Russkie kid?

124
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,194
Don't he have no other friends?

125
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,446
Joey, you know, they get along.

126
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,407
It's fine. What do you want?

127
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,451
I don't want him going over there
no more, that's what I want.

128
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,828
I know. He knows.

129
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,664
He knows.

130
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,669
I'll go get him.

131
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,678
Yo, Nick.

132
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,138
Dinner.

133
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,108
Shit.

134
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,154
Come on.

135
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,824
Get down.

136
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,839
Dinner.

137
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,341
Can Oleg stay?

138
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,385
Babe, it's already been
3 times this week.

139
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,096
I'm sure his mom would like
to have him home for a change.

140
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,099
It's OK. I'm not even hungry.

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,143
I'll see you tomorrow.
Go Razors.

142
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,188
You, go wash up.
Those hands are scary.

143
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,777
- Good night, Oleg.
- Good night, Mrs. Gazelle.

144
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,700
He's not even up there.

145
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,785
They turned the damn basement
into a sports complex again.

146
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,995
Well...

147
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,705
Come on, T, how many times
am I supposed to tell him?

148
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,583
Joe, what do you want?
They're just boys. They--

149
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,012
Dad, I won't do it again,
I swear.

150
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,889
Don't you expect me
to make book on that.

151
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,182
Now go get your grandfather.

152
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,850
I just washed my hands.

153
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,395
All right.

154
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,569
Hey, Nick.

155
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,656
Razors and Blues Friday night?

156
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,991
120 yellow, pal.

157
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,493
No way!

158
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,622
It's gonna be a total deathmatch
between Chester and Erlich.

159
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,416
- They're going home in body bags!
- Red ice!

160
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,962
Hey... can Oleg come?
He's never been to one game, and--

161
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,464
No. No, not this time.

162
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,090
Sal can only score me
a pair of tickets.

163
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,759
Maybe next time, though.

164
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,679
Go get your grandfather.

165
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,988
Get up.

166
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,573
Get up.

167
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,620
Come on.

168
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,748
Come on, man.

169
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,333
Make it different this time.

170
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,797
Get up.

171
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,093
Get up.

172
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,476
I said, get up!

173
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,728
What is this?

174
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,814
Wolfgang Puck.
It's your favorite.

175
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,233
It's thick-crust...

176
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,193
you damn blyad.

177
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,488
I cut off crust for you.
It'll be better.

178
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,159
Bring me another Moskova.

179
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,170
Hey.

180
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,796
Hey.

181
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,925
Come here.

182
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,679
Come here.

183
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,099
Come.

184
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,770
Watch this.

185
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,065
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

186
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,985
I don't like cowboys.

187
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,987
Come on.

188
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,989
It's the Duke.

189
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,158
Come. Sit.

190
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,796
When I was growing up
in Kishinev...

191
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,008
we had no VHS,
no DVD back then.

192
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,178
I remember...

193
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,723
I did a job for
this friend of my father.

194
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:53,101
I pickpocketed a key
off this apparatchik.

195
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,563
The man gave me as a reward...

196
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,900
this children's projector.

197
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,278
It came with 3 films--

198
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,989
Speedy Gonzales,
Tarzan of the Apes...

199
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,283
and John Wayne in The Cowboys.

200
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,245
I watched that thing...

201
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,997
a thousand times.

202
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,501
Anzor, it's getting cold.

203
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,678
I was 9 years old.

204
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,764
I didn't know how long
movies were supposed to be.

205
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:34,810
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 10 minutes long.

206
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,897
No John Wayne getting shot.

207
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,110
Because it was for kids,
they left that part out.

208
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,778
I didn't know this...

209
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,616
until I arrive in America...

210
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:54,830
and see it on TV
for the first time.

211
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,290
I hate it.

212
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:01,253
I want my 8-millimeter back.

213
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,923
Because on that one,
the Duke lives.

214
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,345
Some things were better
in the old place.

215
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:14,433
Not too many. Some things.

216
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,853
Let me show you
from the beginning.

217
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,401
No, no...

218
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,904
Go forward.

219
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,031
This part's better.

220
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,535
Without the Duke?

221
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,295
Where are you going?!

222
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,672
You don't walk out on the Duke!

223
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,558
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work...

224
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,269
and she wants to get him tested.

225
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,481
Wait, she wants to get him tested?
Tested for what?

226
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:06,151
I think maybe...
attention disorder or something.

227
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,528
I'm not fucking A.D.D.

228
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,113
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

229
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,281
What's wrong with "A.D.D."?

230
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,617
The other one, smart-ass!

231
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,786
And he don't use that word, period!

232
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,329
I don't want to be on medication.

233
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,747
You can't make me take it,
'cause I won't.

234
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,582
No, no, Nick. You know what?
Don't even worry about.

235
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,919
There's no way in hell anybody's
gonna put you on meds, OK?

236
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,212
T, why don't you tell
that teacher...

237
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,172
to come down to the rink
and watch him wax that puck?

238
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,799
That's perfect concentration
every time.

239
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,300
That's different, Joe.

240
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,929
We're just--we're just trying
to find out what's going on with you.

241
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,973
OK? Buddy, she said
some great things, too.

242
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,516
She said--she said
that he's very bright.

243
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,601
She said he's very creative.

244
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,396
You left that part out before.
I like that part.

245
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,439
I got potential.

246
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,246
What are you doing?

247
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,748
You takin' a collection
down there?

248
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,107
He must eat.

249
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,279
The little prick...

250
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,698
insults the Duke.

251
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,369
He don't eat in this house.

252
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,417
You hear me,
you little snotface?!

253
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,336
Stay in your room!

254
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,880
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

255
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,132
Faggot!

256
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,801
He's a growing boy.

257
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,777
What did I fucking say, suka?

258
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,279
He has to eat, Anzor.

259
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,614
Please.

260
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,325
Who puts food
on this fucking table?

261
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,665
Not you, blyad.

262
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,750
I'm the big man of this house.

263
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,878
When I say the little shit
don't eat, he don't eat.

264
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,839
Anzor.

265
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,676
John Wayne was a faggot.

266
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,638
So, Vicki Goletto
told me she saw you...

267
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,473
walking hand-in-hand
with Jeannie's daughter.

268
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,599
The fat one?

269
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,396
That sounded like a gun.

270
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,234
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

271
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,696
Shit! Get down!

272
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,156
Get down! You OK? You OK?!

273
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,575
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

274
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,326
Stay here. Motherfucker.

275
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,619
Motherfucker!

276
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,371
I'm gonna kill
that fuckin' piece of shit!

277
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,457
- Where are you going?
- You Russian piece of shit!

278
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,625
Gun.

279
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,671
Shoot my fuckin' house.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

280
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:13,922
Dad, wait!

281
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,674
Get back in the house.

282
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,177
Get back in the house!

283
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,678
Get back in now! Go!

284
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,392
Stay right here.
Don't you move, son, OK?

285
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,352
You fuckin' piece of shit.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

286
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,354
- Nicky, get inside.
- Fuckin' piece of shit!

287
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,856
Joe! Joe!

288
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,900
What's the matter with you?
I just called 911.

289
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,942
Leave it for the cops!

290
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,652
Get the kid and take him
back in the house!

291
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,070
You fuckin' piece of shit!

292
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,947
I'm gonna kill you!
Open the fuckin' door!

293
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,199
- Oleg's my friend!
- I'll kick it in!

294
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,992
- He's my friend!
- Open the door!

295
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,368
Joey, don't be a damn hero!

296
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,580
Open up! It's Joey Gazelle
from next door! Open up!

297
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,998
Open up!

298
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,002
Get back! Get back!

299
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,713
Where is he? Is he upstairs?

300
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,839
He's in--

301
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,007
- What?
- He's--

302
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,175
Listen, get down.

303
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,600
What the fuck?

304
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,061
Where's the kid?

305
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,860
Where's the kid?

306
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,488
Fuck him.
I'm the one who's shot.

307
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,989
Who is he?
Is he still in the house?

308
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,450
The little snotfuck
ran out back.

309
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,119
Oleg?

310
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,373
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

311
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,250
What are you...

312
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,544
a fucking idiot?

313
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,629
I didn't do this to myself.

314
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,216
The little prick
put a gun to me, too.

315
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,801
Look at him.

316
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,872
She used to fucking make--

317
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,624
Where'd he get the piece?
Where'd he get the fuckin' piece?!

318
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,710
- Fuck should I know?!
- What, it wasn't yours?

319
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,795
No! No way!

320
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,633
I got a.357
in the safe out back.

321
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,720
He had some fucking
snub-nosed thing.

322
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,390
Silver. Chrome.

323
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,993
This is bullshit, Nick!

324
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,453
Now you tell me!
I'm not playing around!

325
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,206
We saw where you put the gun,
but he didn't take anything--

326
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,624
not with me.

327
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,042
Well, he went back, Nicky.

328
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,587
Well, I didn't know.
I swear I didn't know.

329
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,297
Come here. Listen to me.

330
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,425
Listen to me. That piece,
that's not just any hot piece.

331
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,093
Tommy used it
to burn a dirty cop.

332
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,678
- No. Joe.
- Yeah.

333
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,597
Yeah. No, no. Listen, listen.
On top of it...

334
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,766
that kid's out there right now.
The cops are on their way.

335
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,185
If they find the gun
or they find the kid...

336
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,187
and he talks, I'm dead.

337
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,271
Fuck!

338
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,564
Calm down! Calm down.

339
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:18,607
- Yeah.
- Calm down.

340
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,775
We can get to him.

341
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,443
You can get to the gun
before the cops do.

342
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:22,986
Shit.

343
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,248
Hey.

344
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,627
Hey, so where you
gonna take him?

345
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,962
Grimley Memorial.

346
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,797
Hey, Mila, you know, I think
you should go with him, OK?

347
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,090
Nyet. Ya padazhdu.

348
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,675
Yeah, no, you should go with him.
I'm gonna go look for Oleg.

349
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,301
Me and Nicky are gonna
go find him, OK?

350
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,262
And I'll get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back, all right?

351
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,471
- All right, you should go.
- OK. Thank you, Joey.

352
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,806
- Yeah, no problem.
- I'm sorry.

353
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,099
Yeah, no problem.

354
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,185
Yeah, we're gonna find him.
Don't worry about it.

355
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,316
Fuck.

356
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,281
Come on.

357
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,914
Police officers.

358
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,499
Sir, you live here?

359
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,335
No, no. Actually, I live next door.
I heard some gunshots...

360
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,087
so I came over, you know,
to see what's going on.

361
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,297
What did you see?

362
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,384
I saw Anzor, my neighbor.

363
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,803
He was in the kitchen.
He--he's been shot.

364
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,013
He say who did it?

365
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,890
Nah. He was screaming
in Russian.

366
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,850
His wife, she asked me
to stick around for the kid.

367
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:35,976
He's out somewhere.

368
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,520
- You don't know who shot him?
- No.

369
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,606
I'm gonna need to take
a statement outside.

370
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,441
I can't have you
messing up the scene, OK?

371
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,483
All right.

372
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,027
Hey, check it out.

373
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,323
I don't see nothing inside.

374
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,617
Maybe all the way back.

375
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,493
Got it.

376
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,163
Leave it for forensics.

377
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,167
Sir, I need for you
to wait outside.

378
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,586
All right. No problem.

379
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,846
Fuckin' havin' a heart attack.

380
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,558
- I can't--I can't--
- Breathe.

381
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,770
I got to find this kid, T.
I got to find this kid tonight.

382
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,231
Nick, I need to know places,
all right?

383
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,066
I need to know hideouts.
Go to your room right now...

384
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,235
and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

385
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,528
OK.

386
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,779
I'm not fuckin' around, Nick.

387
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,531
Joe, just--
just take it easy.

388
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,907
There's no fuckin' time!

389
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,834
All right,
I want you to wait next door...

390
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,253
and the second he shows up,
call me.

391
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,925
I got to fuckin'
do something about this.

392
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,678
I can't have the kid
fuckin' talking to the cops.

393
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,556
You understand me?
The fuckin' gun is on the street.

394
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,308
This whole fuckin' goddamn thing
is about to fuckin' blow up.

395
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,935
If fuckin' Tommy
or any of those fuckin' guys...

396
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:01,770
find out about it,
I'm a dead man.

397
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:05,107
You got to fuckin' help me.

398
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,942
If I fuckin' have to.

399
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,745
Hey, grab your jacket, Nick.
We're going for a ride.

400
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,965
All right, Nick.

401
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,884
I want you to stay in the car,
all right?

402
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,802
Don't get out for anything...

403
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,929
and if I'm not back in one hour,
I want you to call your mother.

404
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,640
She'll come and get you, OK?

405
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,766
Excuse me.

406
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,685
OK, take her to burn now.

407
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:42,978
You're going to be fine.

408
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:57,951
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.

409
00:26:58,827 --> 00:26:59,953
Excuse me.

410
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,833
Who's in the other room?
Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

411
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,627
Teenager, DUI car wreck.

412
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,879
I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

413
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:12,049
Lost? He--he's dead?

414
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,258
Yeah.

415
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,718
No, wait.
He took a bullet right here.

416
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,637
No, a major trauma to chest.

417
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,973
Been in surgery all day.
Guy was a cop.

418
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,601
Wait. No. Yeah,
they did bring someone in...

419
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,019
about 40 minutes ago.

420
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,355
O.R. number 2. I think
he's gone upstairs already.

421
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,523
That's this way?

422
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,428
Can I help you...
Dr. Donaldson?

423
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,305
Yeah. The cops
are waiting outside...

424
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,891
and they need to run a match
on this bullet ASAP.

425
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,726
Well, I'll make sure
they get it right away.

426
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,413
Excuse me.

427
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,594
You looking for this?
Yugorsky, GSW, shoulder?

428
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,807
You got to help me
find him, Nick.

429
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,601
What are you gonna do to him?

430
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:46,852
I'm not gonna do nothing.

431
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,437
I just need to get my gun back
and bring him home.

432
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,565
You sure?

433
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,568
Talk to me, Nick.

434
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,198
It's this old abandoned
rec center in the park.

435
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,660
Me and Oleg would hang out
there sometimes, read comics.

436
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,912
He might be there.

437
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,853
Nice gun.

438
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,150
Lo Chan to Admitting.

439
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:43,116
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

440
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,827
I already made a statement.

441
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:49,998
I don't know
who the shooter was.

442
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,125
Fuckin' niggers
all look the same.

443
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,293
Yeah.

444
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,795
Anzor Yugorsky.

445
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,797
Any relation to Ivan Yugorsky?

446
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,465
My uncle.

447
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,300
The Czar of Brighton Beach.

448
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,010
I been to his club
a couple of times.

449
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,888
Nice joint.
He even sang a few songs.

450
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,891
He sings like a fucking toad.

451
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,768
Well, Sinatra he's not...

452
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,020
but he's a man
with a serious reputation.

453
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,107
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

454
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,652
I told you. It was just
some fucking crackhead.

455
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,363
Yeah, well, I spoke
to the officers on the scene.

456
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,198
There was no sign
of forced entry...

457
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,076
but they did find some
interesting shit out back--

458
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:29,663
6 cases of NyQuil,
and it ain't even cold season.

459
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,165
Now, what do you think a search warrant
is gonna turn up?

460
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,463
Dr. Cookson,
call Imaging Services.

461
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,717
Dr. Cookson,
call Imaging Services.

462
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,195
- Come on, where?
- It's this way.

463
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,696
Let's go.

464
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,239
Quick, come on.

465
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,035
Come on.

466
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,580
Go, go, go.

467
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,877
This way.

468
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,213
Be cool...

469
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:23,675
and let me do all the talking.

470
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,844
I'm gonna get you out of here.

471
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,554
Help you?

472
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:30,432
- Yeah.
- How much you got?

473
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,187
I got a lot.

474
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,024
Yes.

475
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,283
Oleg, it's Nicky.
Are you in there?

476
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,461
- Is this the spot?
- Yeah.

477
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,715
Now, where's the stash?

478
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,259
Last stall, motherfucker.

479
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,427
Go. Find the stash.

480
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,596
Find it.

481
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,598
Go on.

482
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,891
Find it.

483
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,476
Find it!

484
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,192
Fuck.

485
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,492
We're gonna search
this entire fuckin' park.

486
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,618
He might still be around.

487
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,753
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, white boy?

488
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,423
All right, drop it, man,
or I'll fuckin' waste the midget!

489
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,966
Come on!

490
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,261
He's just a tagalong.

491
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,430
Plug 'em, Dale!
Plug the motherfucker!

492
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,015
Fuck him up!

493
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,018
I'll fuck you up, man!
Just let my boy go!

494
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,729
Pop a cap in his ass!

495
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:01,773
Wait, motherfucker, wait!

496
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,817
Man, shoot this motherfucker!
Shoot that--

497
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,247
All right, stay right by me.
Here. Against the wall.

498
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:19,333
You stay right there. Don't you move.
You stay right there.

499
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,336
Fuck.

500
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,214
Hey, hey,
I didn't do nothing, officer.

501
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,507
I--I--I just came--

502
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,343
You put your fuckin' hands
against the stall now!

503
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,094
Put your fuckin' head down!

504
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,348
Oleg.

505
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,851
I--I told you to stay outside.

506
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,312
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside!

507
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,772
Get out of here!

508
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,273
I'm fuckin' talking to you!
Turn around. What'd you see?

509
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,277
Did you find the gun?
Did you find the silver gun?

510
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,529
Did you find
that fuckin' silver gun?

511
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,739
I--I--I don't know.

512
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,462
You want to study
for your G.E.D.? Here.

513
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,017
Look what you done
to my fuckin' ride, bitch.

514
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,353
It's just 6 weeks, baby.

515
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,021
Please?

516
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,899
I only been taking 1 class--

517
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,526
1 class, 2 hours a week.

518
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:30,487
I still got time
to be pullin' tricks.

519
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,156
3 fuckin' Gs I find you
for these fuckin' airbags...

520
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:36,618
and what do I get in return?
Fuckin' night school?

521
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,495
I'll quit.

522
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,164
I'm super-proud of you
for showing some initiative.

523
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:43,500
Maybe I'll even come
to your graduation.

524
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,712
But first you're gonna give me
back my fuckin' property!

525
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,765
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

526
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,312
You ain't even holding it right.

527
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,817
What's the matter, kid?
You got the shakes?

528
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:17,534
Now I'm gonna put a smile
on your face, boy--

529
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,536
cheek to cheek.

530
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:22,206
You're gonna be the happiest
little brat in school.

531
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,874
Say cheese.

532
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:30,547
Who's laughing now, you fucking
gray meat limp dick motherfucker?

533
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:31,924
Mack daddy!

534
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:33,884
Who's mackin' now, bitch?

535
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,177
Puñeta!

536
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,390
You got some cojones, kid.

537
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,075
Let me see your fingers, son.

538
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,374
Is this--
Hey, hey. Is this your son?

539
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,876
I'm taking care of him
tonight, OK?

540
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,795
Well, unless you have the name
and number of his doctor...

541
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,505
and I can get a prescription
over the phone...

542
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,257
you're gonna have
to take him to emergency, OK?

543
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,424
Now, if you want me
to call you a cab--

544
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,428
I don't need no fucking cab.
I need some spray shit for him.

545
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,681
Well, that spray shit happens to be
a controlled substance, ma'am...

546
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,224
so what can I tell you?

547
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,102
Keep the change.

548
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,271
I can't--This is stupid.
I can't do this.

549
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,231
Listen, why don't we
go out in the back...

550
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,191
and we talk about it, OK?

551
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,402
- Look, lady--
- I'll take care of you.

552
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,822
There's nothing I can do, lady.

553
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,156
There's nothing you can do?

554
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,366
Take him to emergency.

555
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,492
OK.

556
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,286
OK.

557
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,788
Nothing you can fucking do?

558
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,833
Get what he needs...now.

559
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,627
- It's Beclovent.
- Yeah, I know.

560
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,045
Beclovent, bitch!

561
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,047
Come on, let's just go back.

562
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,634
No. No. If he turns up,
your mom's gonna call.

563
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,930
T.

564
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,475
Sal.

565
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,853
Yeah.

566
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,068
Do girls really
get naked in there?

567
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,237
You'll find out when you're 21.

568
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,115
I've seen Mom naked.
It's no big deal.

569
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,785
Trust me on this one.
It's always a big deal.

570
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,706
Stay here.

571
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,886
Put your hands together
for the sexy redhead...

572
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,597
Galaxy.

573
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,034
What?

574
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,161
It's taken care of.

575
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,165
It's taken care of.
Lucky us.

576
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,668
Guys, sit down. Have a seat.

577
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,169
Don't be shy.

578
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,257
They make a good mai tai
for a twat bar...

579
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,259
but seriously overpriced--

580
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,386
$2 million
for a round of drinks...

581
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:23,720
and the pussy
ain't even that hot.

582
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,430
Hey, baby.

583
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,933
Jodi, I'm doing business here.
Jodi...

584
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,227
come on.
Get the fuck out of here.

585
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,895
$2 million.

586
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,857
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

587
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,233
What do you think of this?

588
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,360
The cops never found these
at the scene...

589
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:40,737
just 2 dead narcs
and 3 dead Jamaicans.

590
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,239
Ballistics is going to reveal...

591
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,740
that the slugs
that killed my partners...

592
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,578
didn't come from the Jamaicans,
so there were others involved.

593
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,371
As for myself...

594
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,081
I was never there.

595
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:55,335
Well, dead guys tell no tales.

596
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:59,047
Yeah. Why don't you ask
your pal here?

597
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,593
What the fuck you talking about?

598
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,094
You blew my partner
Stevie's balls off...

599
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,431
with a .38 snub nose,
a real distinctive piece--

600
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:11,310
stainless, polished up
like a spic's hubcap.

601
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,897
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

602
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:18,192
I think that you gave him
the gun to dump in the river.

603
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,776
Now, I'm assuming that
he never got around to it...

604
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,403
because 2 hours ago...

605
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:24,072
his next-door neighbor
took a slug in the shoulder.

606
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,408
The shooter was the guy's
10-year-old stepson...

607
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,828
who was over at Gazelle's house
2 hours earlier.

608
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,622
What the fuck
you trying to do here?

609
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,540
You trying to fuckin' play us?

610
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:35,000
Because you're wasting
our fuckin' time.

611
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,293
This is goddamn
fuckin' bullshit.

612
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:38,462
Bullshit? Bullshit?

613
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,839
This punk Anzor Yugorsky...

614
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,675
he describes the gun to me
in vivid detail.

615
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:48,388
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

616
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,432
What the fuck is this guy
talking about, Joey?

617
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:52,809
He's talking about a fuckin' shiny gun.
Big fuckin' deal.

618
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,102
There's a thousand of them
on the street.

619
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,562
It ain't the fuckin' piece.

620
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,315
Yeah? What were you doing
at the hospital...

621
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,691
when they brought Yugorsky in?

622
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,277
Sniffing around emergency?

623
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,946
You know what I figure?

624
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,405
I figure you were there
to pull a switch...

625
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,115
on the slug
they took out of him.

626
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,619
My wife asked me to go
to the hospital.

627
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:11,954
She was concerned--you know,
in a neighborly way.

628
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:12,955
She wanted me to go to see--

629
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,040
All right, you know what?
Enough bullshit.

630
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,125
I expect to find a bag
in this locker...

631
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,253
at Dominic Station by midnight.

632
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:21,463
If the bag is not there
one minute after...

633
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm taking you all down
any fuckin' way I can...

634
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,844
even if I have to
manufacture the case.

635
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:30,472
And you know I will, because I got
the toughest mob in the world.

636
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,474
I'm the law.

637
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:52,202
All right, stay put.
I'm gonna grab you a burger.

638
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,453
I'm not hungry.

639
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,206
Yeah, but you didn't finish dinner,
so I'm gonna grab you something to eat.

640
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,500
Stay here.

641
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,793
Dad?

642
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,715
Don't go in there.
Let's just go home.

643
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,675
It's gonna be all right.

644
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,180
No, it's not.

645
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,600
Hey, Frankie, how you doing?

646
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,019
- Hey, how are you?
- Yeah, it's good to see you.

647
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,437
Sit, Joe.

648
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,521
How you doing, guys?

649
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,857
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doing, man?

650
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,525
- Joey.
- I'm fine.

651
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,985
You want some coffee,
something to eat?

652
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,486
Nah, I'm good. But, listen...

653
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,197
I got my boy,
he's waiting out in the car.

654
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:29,364
I want to get him a burger
or something.

655
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:30,824
Tony, go and take care
of that, yeah?

656
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:34,203
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

657
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,413
And don't scare him.
He don't know you're coming.

658
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,877
So, Joe...

659
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,545
I just got off the phone
with Ivan Yugorsky...

660
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:44,880
about this thing
with his nephew.

661
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,549
I told you.
It's not the fuckin' piece.

662
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:52,221
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain-fried retrobate.

663
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,264
Yeah, whatever.
He's a fuckin' tweaker piece of shit.

664
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,391
And he's cooking meth
in his backyard.

665
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,393
I know I told you this already,
but it's just a matter of time...

666
00:41:58,435 --> 00:41:59,728
before he blows up the whole
fuckin' neighborhood.

667
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,398
We notice, but it's a sensitive issue
with me and you.

668
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,236
Now, I'm in bed with Yugorsky
on this gasoline deal.

669
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:10,739
Hey, it's a good deal.
I don't want to rock the boat.

670
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,408
Fuck that.
Fuck those Russian cunts!

671
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:18,372
Pa, it's the fuckin' narc
that's got his dick in our ass.

672
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,582
Hey...

673
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:23,126
calm down, Tommy.

674
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:27,214
You see, Joe, the tweaker's
got it in his head...

675
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,882
that maybe you were looking...

676
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,551
to knock him out
of the cooking business...

677
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:34,221
and help the boy out.
Made a piece available to him.

678
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,600
I would never use a kid
to do something like that.

679
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:40,310
Never.

680
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:43,188
All right, all right, look.

681
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,941
I made a personal reassurance
to Yugorsky...

682
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,068
that I would have
my entire crew in the street...

683
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,778
out looking for that kid.

684
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,657
Now, in the interest
of professional harmony...

685
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,993
I think we all want
to get our stories straight.

686
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,453
You agree, don't you, Joe?

687
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,335
One hamburger,
and you're out of my life.

688
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,420
That's it.

689
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:07,796
Oleg.

690
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,261
Shit.

691
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,929
Hey, kid...

692
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,222
how you doing?

693
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,141
Your old man sent this stuff
out for you.

694
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,851
Thanks.

695
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:22,436
Ain't it a little late
for you to be out?

696
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,688
I got twins your age.
They're in bed by now.

697
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,274
What are you, like, 9?

698
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:28,901
10...

699
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,444
and a half.

700
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:32,321
I got to go to the bathroom.

701
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:44,291
Hey, Joey...

702
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,668
looks like your kid
don't listen too well.

703
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,840
It must run in the family.

704
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,677
Hey, Nicky, get over here.

705
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,513
Get over here.

706
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:04,228
What the hell you doing?
I thought I told you to wait in the car.

707
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,521
I had to go to the bathroom.

708
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,525
How you doing, Nicky? You want
you want some gummy bears?

709
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:13,487
Hey, Nicky,
you wouldn't by chance...

710
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:17,324
know where your friend
got that gun, would you?

711
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:18,617
No.

712
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,203
I have to go to the bathroom.

713
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,454
OK.

714
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,498
Nicky, you go to the bathroom.

715
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,297
Have you decided yet?

716
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,716
I have a bus to catch in--

717
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,218
Cuando?

718
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,636
I'll have a cheeseburger
and a coke.

719
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:41,515
I got to go to the bathroom.

720
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:43,308
Don't worry. We're gonna
take care of the cop, OK?

721
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,018
- I know.
- OK.

722
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,404
Where is it?

723
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:11,920
Hey, Nicky.

724
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,757
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm almost done.

725
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:17,217
Well, hurry up in there.
Come on, we got to go.

726
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:18,886
- Razors.
- Razors.

727
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,516
Get over there
and wash your hands.

728
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,059
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

729
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:40,240
Fuck.

730
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,912
Hey, sweetie, how you doing?

731
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:45,954
Good, hon.

732
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:49,499
All right, Nick, listen to me.
I want you to think really hard...

733
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,834
about where your friend
might be right now...

734
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,336
because the others,
they're looking for him...

735
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:53,795
and if they
find him first, I'm--

736
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,131
- They won't find the gun.
- What did you say?

737
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,175
What did you say?

738
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,264
Don't you mess with me, Nicky.

739
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,141
I want you
to fuckin' talk to me now.

740
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,143
Just promise me
you won't hurt him.

741
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,686
Nick, I don't have time
for this shit right now.

742
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,355
- Now fuckin' tell me.
- Promise!

743
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:14,525
Promise you what? What, what?
I promise. I swear to God.

744
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:15,859
I'm not gonna fuckin'
hurt your friend.

745
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:19,112
Now, just come on. Just tell me.
Just tell me what you know.

746
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,133
Come on.

747
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:49,184
This one here?

748
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,151
Man.

749
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:31,810
Come on, where is it, Nick?

750
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,145
I thought you said
you put it in there.

751
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,521
Well, I did.
I put it right there.

752
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,607
Then where is it? I thought
you said you put it in the tank.

753
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:37,733
I put it in here.

754
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,237
Shit. Which one
did you put it in, Nick?

755
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,823
Which one did you put it in?

756
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,331
God damn it, Nicky.

757
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,875
Why'd you lie to me?
Why did you lie to me?

758
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,126
I didn't.

759
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:59,213
Why did you lie to me?!
Why did you lie to me?!

760
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,256
I'm not fucking lying!
I put it in there!

761
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:04,676
You just fuckin'
killed me, Nick.

762
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,720
You just fucking killed me.

763
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,598
You come here.

764
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,433
Now, I want you to keep
an eye open, right?

765
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:54,643
If you see anybody come...

766
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,603
I want you to cough really loud,
all right?

767
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,617
You're like a broken record.

768
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,286
I'm telling you.
You got to see this.

769
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,079
You better not be
jerking my chain.

770
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,914
What are you doing here, kid?

771
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,749
I was looking for the bathroom.

772
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,918
See? Even the kid thinks
it's a shithole back here.

773
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,420
Shut up, Ralphie.

774
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,713
All right, just...

775
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,423
you go on out
through that door there...

776
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,133
turn left, go all the way
down to the end...

777
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:28,385
turn left again,
and you're there.

778
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,095
You got it?

779
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,768
Which door?

780
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,732
Come here, kid. I'll show you.
Come here, kid.

781
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,151
Hey, Yolanda.

782
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,485
- Come on.
- Wait up.

783
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:46,737
Where you going
with my cheesecake?

784
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,990
No, this is for
paying customers, not you.

785
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:54,453
Manny.

786
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,163
Where are you? Here.

787
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:01,001
There. I got your number, fucker.

788
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:14,932
Forget it. I ain't dragging
your butt across no state lines.

789
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,853
Look, papa,
why don't you just go home?

790
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,689
I bet you things are not as bad
as you think they are.

791
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,032
Come on, papa.

792
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,329
Motherfucker!

793
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:38,789
Be careful what you say!

794
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,999
Get down! Over here.

795
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,545
Run! Run, little man, run!

796
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:49,091
Hey!

797
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,467
Let go!

798
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,636
Get off! Get off!

799
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,929
Get off!

800
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:18,412
Do you know these guys?

801
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:28,547
Yeah.

802
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:29,840
Baby?

803
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:32,176
Where the hell are you?

804
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,927
Taking care of things.

805
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:35,262
Well, forget about it...

806
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,848
because they picked up Oleg at
a bus station with some hooker.

807
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,059
Who picked him up? The cops?

808
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,144
Yeah.

809
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,521
Jesus Christ.
This is fuckin' bullshit.

810
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:45,981
- Hey...
- Fuck!

811
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,025
Hey! You got Nicky with you?

812
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:49,443
Yeah, he's right here.

813
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,403
Then stop using your mouth
around him...

814
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:54,531
and bring my son home now.

815
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:56,074
Yeah.

816
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,160
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
I'm bringing him home right now.

817
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,380
Do you mind?

818
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,466
I'm feeling kind of parched.

819
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:16,178
Big game Friday night.

820
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,347
I bet you're excited about that.

821
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:20,182
It's gonna be red ice...

822
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:22,142
and plenty of
blue shirt body bags.

823
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:23,685
Am I right?

824
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,356
Look...

825
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,191
I could help you, kid--

826
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,026
you and your mom, if need be.

827
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:35,197
Now, I could get that prick
out of your life, lock him up.

828
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,824
I could do that. I'm a cop.

829
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:41,328
All you have to do is tell me
where you found the gun...

830
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,748
and where you stashed it.

831
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,125
That's it. What do you say?

832
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,003
You let me help you.

833
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:56,009
Get out of here, Mila.

834
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,762
You know, go to a shelter.

835
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,765
I mean,
I can get you an address.

836
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:04,017
You don't understand.

837
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,313
I belong to him.

838
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,608
No. No...

839
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:14,027
I don't understand.

840
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:20,200
I was prostitute in Moscow.

841
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:26,373
Yugorsky Escort Service
offered to bring girls over...

842
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:30,169
with promise of big bucks.

843
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,754
We would owe $50,000--

844
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,048
you know, pay back through work.

845
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,219
I take offer...

846
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:42,598
not tell them I'm pregnant.

847
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,058
When they find out...

848
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,646
they insist I have an abortion.

849
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,732
I told them no.

850
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,070
They sent Anzor to kill me.

851
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,574
Anzor's not a killer.

852
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,161
He's not hard man...

853
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,580
like big Yugorsky.

854
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,084
He thinks...

855
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:14,880
he thinks he's,
you know, John Wayne.

856
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:20,093
Must do right thing.

857
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,263
He goes against his uncle.

858
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:27,601
He tells big man Yugorsky
he will pay off my debt.

859
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,563
His uncle refuses...

860
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:34,107
tells him...

861
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:39,112
he will send others to kill me
to set example.

862
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:44,326
So, Anzor make me wife.

863
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:48,121
Big man Yugorsky
can't kill his nephew's wife.

864
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:56,338
But he tells Anzor
to leave Little Odessa.

865
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,298
He's no longer...

866
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,593
working for Yugorsky family.

867
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,304
Yeah.

868
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,600
I'm gonna get you
the name of a shelter.

869
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,321
You OK?

870
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:24,116
This ain't right, Joe.

871
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,827
He don't need to be
put through this.

872
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:29,162
Nick, I'm proud of you.
You done good, all right?

873
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,216
Look, I'm gonna head up
to Community Hills.

874
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,593
The cops don't got
the gun yet...

875
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:45,596
but I may have a line on it,
so I'm gonna go over there.

876
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,514
I'm scared, Joe.

877
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:51,268
I am pissed at you,
and I am scared--

878
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,353
equal measures.

879
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,695
Be careful.

880
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

881
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,335
Just got word.
The cops picked up the kid.

882
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,128
Anything you still
want to tell us?

883
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,963
Tell you what?
There's nothing to tell.

884
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,798
Where you headed, Joe?

885
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,969
I was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

886
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,805
In all the excitement,
I forgot to do it, so...

887
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,394
Yugorsky's gonna call us
when he talks to the kid.

888
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,564
Don't go too far.

889
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,359
Later, Joe.

890
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,236
Yeah, see you.

891
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,239
Hey, T...

892
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,949
lookin' fuckin' good.

893
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,875
He keeps giving me
this bullshit story...

894
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:00,546
about finding the gun in some
abandoned locker in school.

895
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:03,465
What do you want me to do?
The little fucker shot me.

896
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,967
He ain't gonna
spill dick to you.

897
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:08,345
You know, I don't think
I'm being clear enough here.

898
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:10,264
You know what I mean?

899
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:14,893
Let me be crystal clear.

900
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:17,354
You get the boy
to give up Gazelle...

901
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:19,648
or I'm closing shop
on your tweaker ass...

902
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,608
and I'm taking you down
fuckin' hard.

903
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,110
Understand me?

904
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,827
Hey, cowboy.

905
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,829
Want to go get some ice cream?

906
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,556
Yo, we got good shit, daddy.

907
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:59,605
Get the fuck away from my car.

908
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,738
Hey. Hey,
I'm looking for Manny Perez.

909
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,406
He--he's not here. No!

910
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,869
Manny? Where the fuck is he?

911
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,245
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

912
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,330
Where is he?!

913
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:17,539
He's not here!

914
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,082
You better not
fuckin' lie to me!

915
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,543
Where the fuck is he?
Where is he?

916
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:22,961
- OK, OK.
- Where is he?

917
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,588
He's at Armando's.

918
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,714
Armando's.

919
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,966
- He's at Armando's.
- Yes. He's at--

920
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,635
Get the hell out of the way.
You stay right there.

921
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:36,934
What's your name?
What's your name?

922
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:39,144
Conchita.

923
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,523
Now, you listen to me, Conchita.
You listen to me real good.

924
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,316
- I don't want to hurt Manny.
- OK.

925
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:45,776
All right?
I don't want to hurt him...

926
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,653
but he has something
that belongs to me--a gun.

927
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:48,946
Do you know anything
about a gun?

928
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:49,947
- No, no.
- No.

929
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,033
No. It's block 5, number 602.
That's where he is.

930
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,160
OK. Now, listen to me.

931
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,162
We are now on what we call
the honor system.

932
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:58,413
You comprende?
You understand what I'm saying?

933
00:58:58,455 --> 00:58:59,456
- Sí.
- OK.

934
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,333
- You don't call Manny.
- OK.

935
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,211
You don't tell Manny I'm coming.
You don't warn him for anything...

936
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,838
because if you do,
I'm gonna come back here!

937
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:17,391
I can be an asshole.

938
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,562
You've made your point.

939
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:25,232
You showed some balls.

940
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:31,196
I like that.

941
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:35,742
But now it's time to be smart.

942
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:42,082
You tell me
what I want to know...

943
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:43,876
and I'm gonna reward you--

944
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,753
Razors season tickets.

945
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:51,633
I'm sorry.

946
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,677
It's OK.

947
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:56,138
I told you, we're cool.

948
00:59:56,138 --> 00:59:57,639
Just tell me.

949
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,308
I'm sorry I missed.

950
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,895
You little shit.

951
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:09,443
Tell me where
the fuckin' gun is.

952
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:12,154
You tell me,
or I will fuckin' kill you.

953
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,157
Fuck!

954
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,912
Oleg!

955
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:28,462
Oleg!

956
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,299
Oleg!

957
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,306
Where are you?

958
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:40,974
You little shit!

959
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:47,564
Oleg!

960
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,608
I'll find you!

961
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,575
I'm gonna kill you, you...

962
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:02,329
You're only making it
worse on yourself!

963
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:04,498
Do you hear me?

964
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,843
Jeez, Edele,
I think we picked up a stray.

965
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:19,304
Indeed.

966
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,139
Hello there.

967
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:22,266
Hi.

968
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:25,686
And who might you be?

969
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,104
You know, I think we should get
another ice cream cone.

970
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:29,857
I think you're right, Papa Bear.

971
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,327
Hey.

972
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,079
Hey, are you Manny?

973
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:47,082
Manny? Nah. He's upstairs.
What you want with him?

974
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:48,667
Business.

975
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,086
If he owes you any money,
forget about it.

976
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:53,088
I just cleaned the cabron out.

977
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,508
Yeah? Who is it?

978
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,343
It's Conchita.

979
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,054
- Conchita.
- La Conchita.

980
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,560
Faces on the fuckin' table!

981
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,145
Heads down and fuckin' hands
behind your head!

982
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,230
You move,
and I will fuck you up!

983
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:12,524
I will fuck you up!
Don't you move, partner.

984
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:14,026
Don't you fuckin' move.

985
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:15,402
I'll fuck you up.

986
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:16,778
Which one of you is fuckin' Manny?

987
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,905
Who's Manny?

988
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,283
Are you done?

989
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:22,534
- You mother--
- Pendejo!

990
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:24,953
You Manny? You motherfucker!

991
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:27,080
Don't call me pendejo,
you fuck!

992
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:30,125
I want my fuckin' gun!
I want my fuckin' snub nose!

993
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,919
You lifted it from
the fuckin' Arlington!

994
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,505
Now, where the fuck is it?
Where the fuck is it?

995
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,345
Fuck you!
Where the fuck is my gun?

996
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:57,861
<i>* Stressed out,
but I'm gonna hold out</i>

997
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,404
<i>* For the whole 9,
that's no doubt</i>

998
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,156
<i>* Till I get what's mine
I'm throwin' no doubt...</i>

999
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:04,117
Fuck!

1000
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,453
Fuck! Motherfucker!

1001
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:10,999
- Look at that.
- That's a good smile.

1002
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,251
Look at those braces.

1003
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,254
- There's a little dimple there.
- They are.

1004
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,175
Yeah, that's super cute.

1005
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:21,552
Isn't this cool?

1006
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,095
Here, come on.
Look back in the camera.

1007
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,471
Try it again.
And you push that.

1008
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:25,764
Look in there and push--

1009
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,182
My gosh. Yeah.

1010
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,017
You can't see, right?

1011
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,811
- Hey, Eric.
- That's very smart. Yeah.

1012
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:33,897
- You want to hug your sister?
- Yeah. Come on.

1013
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:35,941
Just a little bit.
Get a little closer.

1014
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,776
Come on,
you guys love each other.

1015
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,195
- You need a little hug.
- A little closer.

1016
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:42,322
- Come on.
- Extend the arm.

1017
01:03:44,157 --> 01:03:46,159
Come on. Come on, Eric.

1018
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,452
You can do it
a little better than that.

1019
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,413
I mean,
that's your sister, right?

1020
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:50,539
That's very good.

1021
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,749
You love your sister, don't you?

1022
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,126
What about you, Oleg?

1023
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:56,879
You want to be in the film
as well, don't you?

1024
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,214
My stomach hurts.
Can I go to the bathroom?

1025
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:00,674
Sure.

1026
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,595
I'll just hold on to this.

1027
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,598
You go outside,
you take a right...

1028
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,224
and then a left.

1029
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,059
Hurry up though.
You're missing out.

1030
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:16,273
Who wants to play dress-up?

1031
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:17,733
Good, dress-up.

1032
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,570
We have the Burning Rocket
and the Volts.

1033
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,560
There you are.

1034
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:38,522
I thought you needed
to go to the bathroom.

1035
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:40,148
I couldn't find it.

1036
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,068
Silly boy.

1037
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,947
I told you to take a right,
then a left.

1038
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:51,451
Come.

1039
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,203
I'll show you.

1040
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:01,295
Don't forget to wash your hands
when you're done.

1041
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:18,103
Joe?

1042
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:19,646
<i>Mrs. Gazelle?</i>

1043
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:21,773
Who is this?

1044
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,192
- Is this--
- Oleg.

1045
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:25,360
I'm sorry about taking the gun,
Mrs. Gazelle.

1046
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:27,321
Oleg, where are you?

1047
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,989
<i>I think I'm in trouble.</i>

1048
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,700
<i>Sweetheart,
I know what happened, OK?</i>

1049
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,035
I need you to be
straight up with me.

1050
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,828
Are the police listening
in on this call?

1051
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,039
<i>No, I'm not with the police.</i>

1052
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,293
I'm at Dez and Edele's apartment.
There's 2 other kids here.

1053
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:42,461
<i>What?</i>

1054
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,838
I--I think they're
gonna to hurt us.

1055
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,298
<i>Jesus.</i>

1056
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,467
Come on. No.
Is this some kind of a joke?

1057
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,053
<i>Oleg, you have caused
enough trouble today.</i>

1058
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:51,929
Where are you?

1059
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,640
<i>I don't know.
I was in the back of a van.</i>

1060
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:55,807
They brought us here.

1061
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,684
They got this room
with all these toys in it.

1062
01:06:57,726 --> 01:06:59,186
They're making a video.

1063
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,813
OK, OK. Oleg,
I need you to look around...

1064
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:03,941
for an address for me, OK?

1065
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:06,026
Is there any mail
laying around?

1066
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:08,820
I'm in the bathroom.
She's gonna come back any minute.

1067
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:12,324
Bathroom. Jesus,
I don't know, I don't know.

1068
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:13,951
I don't know.

1069
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,996
<i>I don't know.
Just call 911.</i>

1070
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,875
No. I don't want to go
back to the police.

1071
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,252
<i>Why?</i>

1072
01:07:23,794 --> 01:07:26,839
They want me to say
I got the gun from Mr. Gazelle.

1073
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:33,136
<i>Do you need
some help in there?</i>

1074
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,264
<i>I'm OK.</i>

1075
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,683
<i>It's my stomach.
I'm almost done.</i>

1076
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,811
You poor thing.

1077
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:43,355
Well, I'm right outside.

1078
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:44,857
- Oleg.
- I'm still here.

1079
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,191
OK.

1080
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:50,571
OK, so look
in the medicine cabinet.

1081
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,239
Do you see any bottles?

1082
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:56,285
Prescription bottles usually have
the address on the front label.

1083
01:07:58,245 --> 01:07:59,705
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1084
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,707
<i>Is there anything in there?</i>

1085
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,879
<i>Oleg, what--
what's happening?</i>

1086
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,468
Oleg, it's Dez.
You want to open up, please?

1087
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:15,929
Oleg.

1088
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,227
OK. Oleg?

1089
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:25,063
- Come on.
- Oleg?

1090
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,106
- Oleg.
- Oleg!

1091
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:27,274
What is--
what's going on?

1092
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:28,734
<i>Oleg!</i>

1093
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:29,943
Just open the door.

1094
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:31,945
Mrs. Gazelle, I got a bottle.

1095
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:33,405
So, now read me the address.

1096
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,742
1456 Owens Park Lane, Hoboken.

1097
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:41,330
Oleg! Let's go! Open the door!

1098
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,790
- Oleg?
- Come on! Oleg!

1099
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:46,210
Jesus!

1100
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:50,589
Wake up, wake up.

1101
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,217
We got to go get Oleg.
Come on, put your coat on.

1102
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:54,468
I thought he was in jail.

1103
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:01,308
Hey, homes.

1104
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,101
I got a busted headlight.

1105
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,145
Hey, Lester, my man.

1106
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:07,689
Who got over on you, bro?

1107
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:10,108
Some puta
who's forwarding address...

1108
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,611
is gonna be
in 10 different zip codes...

1109
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,404
all of 'em dumpsters.

1110
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:21,954
I got you covered
by tomorrow night.

1111
01:09:21,954 --> 01:09:25,123
Hey, check this out.
Is that sweet or what?

1112
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:27,376
Hey, a royal flush
put her in my pocket.

1113
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,253
300 cold puts her in mine.

1114
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,255
No, man. She's a beauty.

1115
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,465
Think I'm gonna hold on to her.

1116
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,593
500.

1117
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:39,221
I won't miss 'em--

1118
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,014
not until Cinco de Mayo.

1119
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,737
Oh, Joe. Shit!

1120
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:01,368
I'm under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever I say don't count.

1121
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,289
Do I still have to go
to school tomorrow?

1122
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,500
I don't know. We'll see.

1123
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:26,643
Remember me?

1124
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,187
Who in the fuck are you?

1125
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,939
You got something that
belongs to me, a snub nose .38.

1126
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,482
You just scored it
off of Manny in a card game.

1127
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:33,775
I need it back.

1128
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,697
Fuck.

1129
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:41,325
I want my fuckin' gun!

1130
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,368
Where the fuck are you?

1131
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,205
Don't be fuckin' stupid.

1132
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:47,706
Fuck!

1133
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,054
Fuck!

1134
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,729
You fuck!

1135
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,439
You fuck!
Where's my fuckin' gat!

1136
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,815
Help me!

1137
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:15,651
Where's my gat?

1138
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:17,486
You gonna fuckin' tell me
where my gun is now?

1139
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:19,446
Tell me where I can find it,
or in about thirty seconds...

1140
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:21,823
you're gonna have third degree burns.
You know what that means?

1141
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:24,826
No cock, asshole! You're gonna
have a fuckin' melted dick!

1142
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:26,703
I--I sold it to a pimp, Lester!

1143
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:28,705
Say, what you waitin' on?

1144
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,874
Where the fuck can I find him?
Where can I find him?

1145
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,125
I need to fuckin' know now!

1146
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,044
Buckhill Cab, Union Street!

1147
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:35,337
Ask them!

1148
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,347
Stay here. Do not move.

1149
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,526
I'm not touching it.
Get away from me.

1150
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:58,569
Fuck you!

1151
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:01,488
The little shit!
He just bit me!

1152
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:11,331
Who the hell is that?

1153
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:14,877
I'll go see. Throw me my robe.
Take the kids into the bedroom.

1154
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:38,108
- May I help you?
- I'm looking for Oleg.

1155
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:40,110
Oleg? You must have
the wrong address.

1156
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,363
No. He's a 10-year-old boy.
He's pale. He never smiles.

1157
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:45,115
He's my neighbor's kid.

1158
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:46,909
He called me
from this apartment.

1159
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,411
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1160
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:51,538
Well, he must've given you
the wrong address...

1161
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,082
or maybe you heard wrong.
There's no Oleg here.

1162
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,585
He also said that he was
being held against his will.

1163
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:58,837
That is ridiculous.
There's only my husband...

1164
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,132
and my 2 children inside--
no one else. And it's late.

1165
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:04,134
Well, I'd like to take
a little look inside...

1166
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:05,469
just to satisfy my curiosity.

1167
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,012
This is absurd.
What are you suggesting?

1168
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:08,305
That I kidnapped Oleg?

1169
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:09,723
Or you know what?
I'm just gonna call the police...

1170
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,600
and I'm gonna stand here
for the next half-hour...

1171
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:12,768
waiting for them to arrive...

1172
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,186
when all's you got to do
is just let me in.

1173
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:19,149
If you must.

1174
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:35,916
Do you mind?

1175
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,709
Go right ahead.

1176
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:42,798
The children's room
is on the right.

1177
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,341
They are asleep.

1178
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:46,385
Please, go right in.

1179
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,106
Hello.

1180
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:00,774
Don't even ask.
It's too ridiculous.

1181
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:03,944
Sorry. I'm really embarrassed.

1182
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:08,490
Excuse me, but I seriously doubt
he's hiding in there.

1183
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,795
What's through here?

1184
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:23,422
The playroom.

1185
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:32,681
You guys got your own
little Disneyland in here.

1186
01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:34,558
Well, it's all about
the children...

1187
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,936
and as you can see,
there's no Oleg.

1188
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:49,948
I really hope that you find him.

1189
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,284
You hear too many stories
these days.

1190
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:54,745
God only knows
if it were our children.

1191
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:57,539
Where are your children
photographs?

1192
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,792
- Excuse me?
- Photographs.

1193
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:05,172
No photographs.
If they were your children...

1194
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:07,925
you would have
at least one photograph...

1195
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:09,718
somewhere in this apartment.

1196
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,137
This is ridiculous. We only
just moved into this place.

1197
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,388
Everything's in storage.

1198
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,599
Now, I really must
ask you to leave.

1199
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:17,976
I insist!

1200
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,394
Oleg?

1201
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:22,481
What the hell
do you want me to do?

1202
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:26,818
You let this bitch in here
in the first place.

1203
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,988
All right? Right. OK.

1204
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:39,373
Man. This is too much.

1205
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:42,042
It's too much.
It's like some kind of a lure.

1206
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:44,753
- You're making a mistake.
- Tell her to leave, Dez.

1207
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:48,423
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

1208
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:50,425
Call 'em. Call 'em.
And be sure to mention...

1209
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:52,386
that you got 2 abducted
children in the next room.

1210
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,056
2 children who don't appear in
any photographs in this house.

1211
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:57,099
- This is insane.
- Where is Oleg?

1212
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,809
How dare you suggest that we--

1213
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,521
Where's the boy?

1214
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:05,524
Where is he?!

1215
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:20,914
God.

1216
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:24,751
You better pray he's not dead.

1217
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:32,509
Back off, you sick fuck.

1218
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:38,015
Jesus. God help me.

1219
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:41,476
Come on, come on...

1220
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:48,150
I said back the fuck up...

1221
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,361
you sick, twisted,
motherfucking cunt!

1222
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,283
Holy God.

1223
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,619
That's right.

1224
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,037
That's right. Breathe.
You're gonna be OK.

1225
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:03,540
You're gonna breathe now, Oleg.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1226
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,251
Just breathe. That's right.

1227
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:09,755
OK.

1228
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,924
Just cutting through wire.

1229
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:18,639
Back off!

1230
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,265
I said back off!

1231
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,601
I will blow you away!

1232
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:28,524
OK. OK, get up.

1233
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:29,858
OK.

1234
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,652
Go to the bedroom,
get the 2 kids.

1235
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,529
Bring them downstairs.
Nicky's there.

1236
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:35,489
All right? Wait with them. OK?

1237
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,657
Move over.

1238
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,371
Get out of his way.

1239
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:47,668
No, I've got a safe
in the bedroom.

1240
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,837
There's 100,000 cash
in there in diamonds.

1241
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,214
All you gotta do
is take the boy and walk away.

1242
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:07,521
My God.

1243
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:10,274
God.

1244
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:12,734
No.

1245
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:18,782
My God.

1246
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:20,492
My God.

1247
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,955
You sick fucks.

1248
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:27,791
You're right. We're--we're sick.
We are. We're sick.

1249
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,251
This is really great.
This is gonna help us--

1250
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:31,378
- Give me your phone.
- Please. Yeah.

1251
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,172
- What are you doing?
- She wants the phone--

1252
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,631
Who are you calling?

1253
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:42,598
911. What is the nature
of your emergency?

1254
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:45,225
I just heard shooting
across the hall.

1255
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,060
1456 Owens Park Lane.

1256
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:48,687
What is your name, ma'am?

1257
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,065
You're not serious.

1258
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:02,034
OK.

1259
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,753
Hey. Hey, listen,
one of your cabs...

1260
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,422
just picked up my brother
at Al's Automotive.

1261
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,257
Yeah, well, listen--
listen to me.

1262
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:20,344
I was supposed to pick him up,
but there's been a family emergency.

1263
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,471
So what I need you to do
is I need you to find out...

1264
01:19:22,513 --> 01:19:24,556
where the cab
dropped him off at.

1265
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:29,061
Yeah. Call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1266
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,235
Hello? Yeah.

1267
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:37,986
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1268
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:39,279
Hey, calm down.

1269
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,794
What happened to your face?

1270
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:54,962
It's nothing.

1271
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:56,463
I need to talk to you, Joe.

1272
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,298
- Later.
- No. Now!

1273
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,467
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?

1274
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,636
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?!

1275
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:06,098
I have never seen evil
before tonight, Joe.

1276
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:08,600
Real fucking evil.

1277
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:10,102
OK?

1278
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:14,815
And I know that's not what I see
when I look in your eyes.

1279
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,316
That's a lot, T.

1280
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:18,151
I'm trying to make a point here!

1281
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:20,529
No, I know the point
you're trying to make!

1282
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:23,490
I did not marry an evil man, OK?

1283
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:26,076
I did not marry an evil man.

1284
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:29,746
Shady, sleazy, mixed up with
the wrong kind of people...

1285
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:32,499
but definitely not evil.

1286
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,918
I know what you're
trying to say, T.

1287
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,962
Do you?!

1288
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:40,257
I hope so.
I have turned my back...

1289
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:43,010
on a lot of things
since we've been married.

1290
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:45,512
My eyes are wide open
on this one.

1291
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,523
Nicky, go home with your ma.

1292
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,275
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1293
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:15,375
What kind of music
do you listen to?

1294
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:19,046
You listen to that techno shit?

1295
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:22,925
You listen to rap music?
You like rap music?

1296
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,302
They don't have
what I listen to on the radio.

1297
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:26,720
Yeah, what's that?

1298
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:28,055
Kvasha.

1299
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,849
It's my mother's tape
from Russia.

1300
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:33,519
What the fuck? Kvasha?

1301
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,439
You're an American.
You weren't born in Russia.

1302
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:39,399
What are you listening
to that shit for?

1303
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:42,402
My mother said I started
in her belly in Russia.

1304
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:43,737
So I'm Russian.

1305
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:46,114
You're not a fuckin' Russian.
You're an American. You know that.

1306
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:47,824
'Cause you were born
in the United States of America.

1307
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:49,368
You're an American.
You're an American.

1308
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:51,078
Say, "I'm an American."
You say it.

1309
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,872
Say, "I'm an American."
Say, "I'm an American."

1310
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:55,082
I'm an American.

1311
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:57,960
You're an American. You were born
in the fuckin' United States of America.

1312
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:59,837
That makes you an American.

1313
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,380
Listen to this.

1314
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:05,884
This guy right here is gonna be
warming up the back seat for you...

1315
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:08,887
when you're ready to get laid.
You mark my words.

1316
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:12,307
<i>* Oh, I know
that it's getting late...</i>

1317
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:14,977
Fuckin' Kvasha. Jesus Christ.

1318
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,395
You put me through
the ringer tonight.

1319
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:17,729
You know that, don't you?

1320
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:21,900
I won't say nothing.

1321
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:23,193
Yeah, and what about the cops?

1322
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:24,611
What'd you say to them?
What did you say to 'em?

1323
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:27,948
I told them I got the gun
from Steven Monroe's locker.

1324
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:31,577
He doesn't go there no more.
Nicky told me to say that.

1325
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:33,412
Nicky told you to say that?

1326
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:34,955
Smart kid.

1327
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:37,749
He's my best friend.
We're both gonna play for the Razors.

1328
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,752
Yeah. Hello?

1329
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,796
Yeah, that was me.

1330
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:44,715
The Royal Towers?
How long ago?

1331
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:46,758
All right, thanks.

1332
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,051
All right, kid. Hold on.

1333
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:50,387
We're gonna reclaim
some stolen property here.

1334
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:13,952
Don't worry about it.

1335
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:16,288
We're just gonna sit tight
for a while.

1336
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:18,624
You know...

1337
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,504
I used to know this kid.

1338
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:28,592
His old man was
a real fuckin' piece of shit.

1339
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,138
Always drunk.

1340
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:37,309
Always smackin' him
and his mom around.

1341
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,689
This kid, he takes his licks...

1342
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,817
and he waits
this old fuckin' prick out.

1343
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:50,364
And on the morning
of his 14th birthday...

1344
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:53,825
he walks into his old man's room
with a baseball bat...

1345
01:23:57,204 --> 01:24:00,290
and he Mark McGwires the fuckin'
living shit out of him.

1346
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:06,255
After that, the old man...

1347
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:09,299
he can't even hold a spoon
without shaking.

1348
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,179
He don't remember things
too good, either.

1349
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,306
He's neutralized.

1350
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,186
Which is a good thing.

1351
01:24:22,896 --> 01:24:24,606
4 more years max.

1352
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:26,567
Maybe 3.
If you get some size early on...

1353
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,652
you'll be all right.
You just gotta hang in there.

1354
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:33,699
'Cause it's more money.

1355
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,576
It's lonely at the top.

1356
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:37,786
I'm telling you,
this corporation...

1357
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,706
Get your hands off
of Lester's property.

1358
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:44,042
- That's my property.
- I'm sorry.

1359
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:46,503
All right, you stay right there.
Don't you move.

1360
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:49,756
Stay just like that.

1361
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:50,883
Fuck.

1362
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:57,264
Jesus Christ. Not now.

1363
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:01,768
All right, let's get in the car.

1364
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:05,439
I can hide it for you.

1365
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,026
No, give it to me.
They're gonna think you got the .38.

1366
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:12,404
They're gonna frisk you.
Come on, give me the fucking gun.

1367
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:25,375
Yo, Joe.

1368
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:26,919
Who you got there?

1369
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,091
He's one of them
Christmas elves.

1370
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:34,801
I found him hitchin' a ride
on Broad Street.

1371
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:39,014
Joey's a funny fuckin' guy...

1372
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:43,560
Let me take a guess, Joey--
you were just about to call us.

1373
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:46,855
That's pretty good. You must
have telepathy or something.

1374
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:50,025
Must. Give me your piece.

1375
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,278
Think I'm fuckin' around
with you?

1376
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:56,949
How about that?

1377
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:59,368
Cocked and ready to go.

1378
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,453
What are you,
fuckin' nervous, tough guy?

1379
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:06,333
You're gonna follow us, Joey.

1380
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,587
The kid'll ride with us.

1381
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,313
Stay the fuck in the car.

1382
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:38,699
Yeah.

1383
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,785
Nah, nah.
I'm with him right now.

1384
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:43,579
Yeah, 100%.

1385
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:48,876
I fuckin' knew it.

1386
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:51,003
Nah, don't worry about it.

1387
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:53,463
I'm takin' care
of this motherfucker right now.

1388
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,805
Come on, what the fuck?

1389
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:04,141
What, are you gonna
fuckin' whack me?

1390
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,852
Come on, man,
I fuckin' told you.

1391
01:27:06,852 --> 01:27:08,520
You got any fuckin' doubts,
I'm fuckin' tellin' you--

1392
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:12,399
Shut your mouth.
Shut your fuckin' mouth now.

1393
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:15,360
You see, my old man...

1394
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:18,572
he says to me, "Nobody...

1395
01:27:19,406 --> 01:27:20,532
knows nobody."

1396
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:23,076
Man, you fuckin' put
that piece of shit away.

1397
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:25,913
I fuckin' told you,
on my fuckin' family--

1398
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,999
Fuckin' family? When I leave here,
I'm gonna fuck Teresa in the ass.

1399
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,543
That's how much I give a fuck
about your fuckin' family.

1400
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:34,630
On my fuckin' family,
it ain't the fuckin' piece!

1401
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:36,423
Now, how fuckin' far
do we go back?

1402
01:27:36,465 --> 01:27:37,925
How fuckin' long
have we known each other?

1403
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,927
Come on, what the fuck?!

1404
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:41,261
This is bullshit!

1405
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:43,722
Like I said, nobody...

1406
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:45,766
knows nobody.

1407
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:50,270
You fuckin' take
that shit off me--

1408
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,524
- Not in front of the fuckin' kid.
- What kid?

1409
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:54,900
Not in front of the fuckin'--

1410
01:27:54,942 --> 01:27:57,653
You grab this fuckin' gun
out of my hand one more time...

1411
01:27:57,694 --> 01:28:00,197
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains
all over this fuckin' place...

1412
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,616
and I'll fuck that kid up
right in front of you!

1413
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:06,662
You got that, nigger?!
Nobody knows nobody! You got that?!

1414
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,878
Shit! What the fuck?!

1415
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:17,756
Shit.

1416
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:22,928
You see, Pop reached out
to a friend of ours in the department...

1417
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:26,765
had him pull the paper
on Rydell's recent busts.

1418
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:28,350
Turns out our friend Sal here...

1419
01:28:28,392 --> 01:28:31,186
was running his own little thing
on the side.

1420
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:32,354
Hey, Sal.

1421
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,481
How's fuckin' business?

1422
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:38,527
A few weeks back,
Sal gets bagged...

1423
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:40,654
by Rydell and his partners.

1424
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:42,531
They let him walk...

1425
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:46,660
as a situated informant.

1426
01:28:46,702 --> 01:28:49,413
We just got confirmation
10 minutes ago.

1427
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:51,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get the fuck up.

1428
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:54,626
Get the fuck up.

1429
01:28:55,878 --> 01:28:56,962
Yeah.

1430
01:28:57,296 --> 01:28:58,505
Yeah.

1431
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:00,924
He's alone?

1432
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:03,677
Good. Give me
the fuckin' number.

1433
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,438
Have a mai tai on me, guys.

1434
01:29:15,814 --> 01:29:18,400
One Nike gym bag--

1435
01:29:18,442 --> 01:29:19,943
60 bucks.

1436
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:37,127
You motherfuckin'
guinea cocksuckers.

1437
01:29:38,378 --> 01:29:40,714
One Nokia cell phone--

1438
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:42,132
100 bucks.

1439
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:49,515
You have just fucked yourselves!

1440
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:51,683
One ounce Semtex--

1441
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:53,519
500 bucks.

1442
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,649
Gettin' rid of a dirty cop--

1443
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:03,987
Fuckin' priceless.

1444
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:05,531
Now...

1445
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:08,367
the jury's still out on you,
pal, so do me a favor.

1446
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,452
Get your ass in that car
and follow me.

1447
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:12,454
And hey, hey.

1448
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:13,997
Don't get lost.

1449
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:16,250
Where the fuck we goin'?

1450
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:13,348
Come on down, come on down.

1451
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:22,191
Let him go.

1452
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,239
So, Oleg...

1453
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,867
you want to see
something really cool?

1454
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:41,084
It's called a jet ice.

1455
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:43,295
Black light paint.

1456
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:46,381
You gotta do crazy shit
like this to fill the seats.

1457
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:55,933
Now, Oleg,

1458
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:59,144
this is very serious matter.

1459
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:01,939
This man--

1460
01:32:02,523 --> 01:32:05,859
he give you the gun
to shoot Anzor?

1461
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:09,071
Bullshit! He gave it to you!

1462
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:12,241
He told you to whack me!
Stop fucking protecting him!

1463
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:15,994
You shut the fuck up.

1464
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:20,624
Oleg, you listen to me.

1465
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:23,210
Where did you get gun?

1466
01:32:23,252 --> 01:32:24,920
At school.

1467
01:32:24,962 --> 01:32:27,130
I found it in a locker.

1468
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:29,716
Don't you fuckin' touch him!
You don't fuckin' touch him!

1469
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:32,135
Don't you fuckin' touch him!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1470
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:34,680
You shut the fuck up!
You turn is coming.

1471
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:36,682
Yeah?
Well, fuckin' eat me!

1472
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:39,726
You fuckin' vor cocksucking bitch!
Fuck you!

1473
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,186
What you call me?

1474
01:32:41,228 --> 01:32:43,856
Nah, you fuckin' heard me.
Fuck you, you fuckin' bitch!

1475
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:47,192
I'm impressed. You know vor.

1476
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:52,281
Vor v'zakoni.

1477
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:55,701
The Brotherhood.
If you were smart man...

1478
01:32:55,742 --> 01:32:58,620
you would learn
to fear this symbol.

1479
01:32:58,662 --> 01:33:01,373
Yeah, well, fuck you, and fuck
your brotherhood, Boris...

1480
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,250
'cause I don't have
to fuckin' answer to you!

1481
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:04,710
Fuck you!

1482
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:07,713
You gonna let him muscle me around
like this, Frankie?

1483
01:33:07,754 --> 01:33:10,757
Well, we're just trying to
establish some truth here, Joe.

1484
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:12,009
I mean, to be honest...

1485
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,969
I think the man's got
some grounds for inquiry.

1486
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:16,180
No, that's fuckin' bullshit.
I told you...

1487
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:17,681
I didn't give the kid
the fuckin' piece.

1488
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:18,932
Come on, Frankie!

1489
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:20,684
Come on!
What the fuck, Frankie?!

1490
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,936
I told you, I didn't give him
the fuckin' piece!

1491
01:33:22,978 --> 01:33:24,563
Don't you let 'em hurt
the fuckin' kid, Anzor!

1492
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:26,231
Don't you fuckin' hurt the kid!

1493
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:30,152
You fucks!
You fuckin' motherfuckers!

1494
01:33:30,194 --> 01:33:31,904
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1495
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,824
How's that feel, Joey?

1496
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:39,244
Fuck you, Tommy!

1497
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:42,956
Don't you do this, Frankie.
Don't you do it!

1498
01:33:42,998 --> 01:33:44,666
Don't you fuckin'
let 'em do this!

1499
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:50,339
I'm not fuckin' lying!
I'm not fuckin' lying!

1500
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,466
Fuck!

1501
01:33:54,343 --> 01:33:56,261
Just tell 'em
what they want to know!

1502
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,641
Fuck! I told you
I didn't know anything, Frankie!

1503
01:34:00,891 --> 01:34:02,017
Fuck!

1504
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:04,269
Fuck!

1505
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:05,979
Shit, it's a fuckin'
human hockey puck.

1506
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,481
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1507
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:10,025
You're gonna kill me?
You're gonna fuckin' kill me?

1508
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,487
Give Anzor the gun.

1509
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:14,905
Frankie, don't you fuckin'
let 'em do this!

1510
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:16,448
Kill the kid.

1511
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:19,701
Christ.

1512
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:23,080
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1513
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:28,710
Don't you let them do this,
Frankie!

1514
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:31,797
What do you want me to do?
You brought it on your goddamn self!

1515
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:34,341
No. No. Wait, no!

1516
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:35,342
Don't do it!

1517
01:34:35,384 --> 01:34:36,635
Joey...

1518
01:34:36,677 --> 01:34:39,012
I'll fuckin' talk!
I'll fuckin' tell you...

1519
01:34:39,054 --> 01:34:41,265
whatever you want
to fuckin' hear!

1520
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:42,474
No, my friend!

1521
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:44,268
First you will see
that I am serious.

1522
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:47,437
Then afterwards, believe me,
you will talk!

1523
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,481
No, come on!
Jesus Christ! I'm fuckin'--

1524
01:34:49,523 --> 01:34:51,567
Don't you--
I'll fuckin' talk!

1525
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,151
I'll tell you whatever
the fuck you want to hear...

1526
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:54,820
you fuckin' motherfuckers!

1527
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,364
Finish it!
Do it right this time!

1528
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,492
No, Anzor!

1529
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:02,327
Anzor, look at me!
Don't fuckin' do it!

1530
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:03,537
Shut up!

1531
01:35:04,872 --> 01:35:06,456
I said finish it.

1532
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:08,917
He's not your blood!

1533
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:11,962
Don't fuckin' do it.
If you do it, I swear to God...

1534
01:35:12,004 --> 01:35:13,881
you better fuckin'
swallow a bullet.

1535
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:16,550
There's no fuckin' way you're gonna
be able to live with yourself!

1536
01:35:16,592 --> 01:35:18,927
Trust me, Anzor. Don't do it!

1537
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:21,430
Say something bad about the Duke.

1538
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:24,933
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1539
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:26,351
Come on.

1540
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:28,770
Don't do it!

1541
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:30,689
Say it.

1542
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:32,941
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1543
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,596
What are you fucking doing?!

1544
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,725
Pick up the fucking gun.

1545
01:36:07,059 --> 01:36:09,645
You pick it up.

1546
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:11,563
You do it.

1547
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:17,653
Gutless piece of faggot shit!

1548
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:20,489
Come on, faggot!

1549
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:23,367
I said finish it!

1550
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:27,955
Pick it up and use it.

1551
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,626
Pick it up and do it.

1552
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:37,923
Pick it up and do it.

1553
01:36:42,594 --> 01:36:45,264
Don't you fucking
walk away from me!

1554
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:07,327
Get up...

1555
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:09,204
you fuck.

1556
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:17,754
Fucking bullshit.

1557
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:19,673
Frank! Frank!

1558
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:21,091
Fuck you, Frankie!

1559
01:37:21,133 --> 01:37:23,427
I ain't takin' the fuckin' heat
for you no more!

1560
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:26,889
It wasn't supposed
to go down this way!

1561
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:28,056
What are you talkin' about?

1562
01:37:28,098 --> 01:37:30,559
The Czar of Brighton.

1563
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:32,853
Vor whatever the fuck you are.

1564
01:37:32,895 --> 01:37:34,730
Fucking Perello
didn't like it...

1565
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:38,692
that your nephew was cookin'
a dealer in the neighborhood.

1566
01:37:38,734 --> 01:37:40,152
So he said--

1567
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:42,821
he said, "Well,
let's send him a message."

1568
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:45,073
He said, "Let's use the kid."

1569
01:37:45,115 --> 01:37:47,951
Yogi, would I put
our thing in jeopardy...

1570
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:50,787
for some 2-bit fuckin' meth lab?

1571
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:53,207
Think about it, OK?
That's number 1.

1572
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:57,252
Number 2--I don't even live
in that fuckin' neighborhood!

1573
01:37:57,294 --> 01:37:59,087
What do I care if it blows up?

1574
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:01,381
The gun--

1575
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:03,342
it was Tommy's!

1576
01:38:03,383 --> 01:38:04,635
You fuck!

1577
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:09,223
Tommy. Tommy, don't get involved
in their goddamn jackpot!

1578
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:10,599
It's all bullshit!

1579
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:12,559
He fuckin' put it
in my right hand!

1580
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:15,687
A fuckin' snub nose .38,
stainless steel.

1581
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:17,272
It was Tommy's gun!

1582
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:18,941
You motherfucker.

1583
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:21,443
I told you to get rid
of that fuckin' piece.

1584
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,529
Yeah, well,
not to my fuckin' recollection!

1585
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:25,614
He said...

1586
01:38:25,656 --> 01:38:27,533
"Interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1587
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:29,409
That's what he said.

1588
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:31,537
"Interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1589
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:34,122
Ask the kid!

1590
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:35,874
Ask the kid.

1591
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:39,503
Mister, 'cause he--
he gave me the gun.

1592
01:38:39,545 --> 01:38:44,550
He said I'd get to go to the game if--
if I shot Anzor...

1593
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:46,510
and it would make
his friends happy.

1594
01:38:46,552 --> 01:38:48,679
I'm sorry, kid.

1595
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,264
OK. OK.

1596
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:51,849
Fuck this bullshit.

1597
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,684
Fuck you, Joey!

1598
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:55,018
You fuckin' bastard!

1599
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:56,979
You're fuckin' dead, nigger!

1600
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:09,241
I'm fuckin' shot!

1601
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:11,326
You dancin' bear motherfucker!

1602
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:12,578
Fuckin' vor!

1603
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:17,082
Scumbag!

1604
01:39:17,124 --> 01:39:19,376
You Russian cocksucker.

1605
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:28,677
You son of a bitch!

1606
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:31,221
Die, you fucker!

1607
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:38,061
You die, motherfucker!

1608
01:39:39,646 --> 01:39:41,023
Where's the fuckin' gun?

1609
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:10,802
Mr. Gazelle!

1610
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:02,187
Fuck you.

1611
01:41:20,372 --> 01:41:22,666
Get off him, you fuck.

1612
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:26,170
Do you know you got my son killed,
you fuckin' scumbag?!

1613
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:30,382
Frankie, I'm glad it's you
'cause there's somethin' I've been--

1614
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:32,551
I've really been meaning
to get off my chest.

1615
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:36,847
You rat cocksucker.
All this fuckin' time?!

1616
01:41:36,889 --> 01:41:40,225
Yeah, this whole fuckin' time!
This whole fuckin' time!

1617
01:41:40,267 --> 01:41:41,894
And the only thing
we don't have...

1618
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:43,687
is your finger on the trigger,
so fuckin' do me!

1619
01:41:43,729 --> 01:41:44,897
And it's one more nail
in your coffin.

1620
01:41:44,897 --> 01:41:46,857
You got all that, do you?

1621
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:49,818
How come it took you
so fuckin' long, tough guy?

1622
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,738
How come so fuckin' long?!
Tell me!

1623
01:41:52,738 --> 01:41:55,032
You had to climb in bed
with Yugorsky, didn't you?

1624
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:56,408
I was all but out...

1625
01:41:56,408 --> 01:41:59,328
and you had to go mix up
with the fuckin' Russians.

1626
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:00,787
12 years undercover...

1627
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:02,664
and my own wife
don't even fuckin' know!

1628
01:42:02,706 --> 01:42:05,209
You cocksucker.
You don't have to worry.

1629
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:09,463
She ain't never gonna hear it
from your fuckin' lips anyhow...

1630
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:11,507
you fuckin' scumbag!

1631
01:42:12,591 --> 01:42:17,429
I'll tell her all about it
while she sucks my fuckin' dick!

1632
01:42:24,811 --> 01:42:27,439
Come on. Come on!

1633
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:29,775
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

1634
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:35,405
What are you gonna do with that,
little boy?

1635
01:42:35,447 --> 01:42:36,990
Do you know that
I had a little boy?

1636
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:40,285
My Tommy.
At one time, he was your age.

1637
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:42,120
What are you gonna do
with that, kid?

1638
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:43,497
What are you gonna do with that?

1639
01:42:43,539 --> 01:42:45,082
What are you gonna do
with that...

1640
01:42:45,123 --> 01:42:47,543
you Cheerio-bred
little motherfucker?!

1641
01:43:09,147 --> 01:43:10,983
Let's go home.

1642
01:43:45,976 --> 01:43:47,603
In position!

1643
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:50,189
All right, Johnny!
On the other side! Let's go!

1644
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:00,741
Jesus Christ, Joey.
We got shorted out.

1645
01:44:00,782 --> 01:44:01,992
We lost you back at Newark.

1646
01:44:02,034 --> 01:44:04,703
Last thing we heard, you were
headed for Little Odessa.

1647
01:44:04,745 --> 01:44:07,414
Air support
finally made your Mustang.

1648
01:44:07,456 --> 01:44:10,667
I'm taking the kid home
to his mom.

1649
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:12,169
Joey, where you going?

1650
01:44:12,211 --> 01:44:15,506
You're hurt.
We got to get you to a hospital.

1651
01:44:17,216 --> 01:44:19,009
I'm going home.

1652
01:44:32,397 --> 01:44:34,399
What are you thinking?

1653
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:36,401
I don't want to go home.

1654
01:44:36,401 --> 01:44:38,529
Well, I'm next door to you,
remember...

1655
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:41,198
and I'm gonna be
keeping my eye on you.

1656
01:44:47,704 --> 01:44:49,039
Why don't we get
some breakfast...

1657
01:44:49,081 --> 01:44:51,667
before we have to start making
with the heavy explaining.

1658
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:53,877
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1659
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:21,572
Hey, listen.

1660
01:45:21,613 --> 01:45:25,701
I'm taking Nick to the game
on Friday night.

1661
01:45:25,742 --> 01:45:28,412
Maybe we could find you
another ticket.

1662
01:45:31,123 --> 01:45:33,584
If you'd like to go, that is.

1663
01:45:45,637 --> 01:45:48,974
All right, that's good.

1664
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:50,809
You want to get some more
orange juice or something?

1665
01:45:59,026 --> 01:46:00,235
Right.

1666
01:46:02,613 --> 01:46:04,072
Well...

1667
01:46:04,406 --> 01:46:06,241
what do you say
we get out of here?

1668
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:21,632
Well, lookie, lookie...

1669
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:24,176
if it ain't
little Charlie Bronson.

1670
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:27,638
One thing about Lester...

1671
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,932
he always makes good
on a promise.

1672
01:46:29,973 --> 01:46:31,475
Hey, asshole.

1673
01:46:34,019 --> 01:46:35,521
Motherfucker!

1674
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:36,772
Shoot that fuck!

1675
01:46:37,856 --> 01:46:39,107
Fuck him up!

1676
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:40,776
Fuckin' piece of shit!

1677
01:46:40,817 --> 01:46:43,862
- Plug that asshole!
- Cocksucker!

1678
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:46,031
Shit!

1679
01:46:46,073 --> 01:46:47,950
In your face, motherfucker!

1680
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:55,666
Say hello to my little friend.

1681
01:46:56,834 --> 01:46:58,502
That's real fuckin' original.

1682
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:00,295
What are you, a fuckin' cartoon?

1683
01:47:00,337 --> 01:47:03,340
I'm a mack daddy pimp.
You know that.

1684
01:47:03,382 --> 01:47:07,469
And now I'm gonna cap your ass.
And when I'm finished with you...

1685
01:47:07,511 --> 01:47:09,471
I'm gonna take
your little punk friend...

1686
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:11,974
and I'm gonna put him
in my posse...

1687
01:47:12,015 --> 01:47:14,393
and I'm gonna pimp him out
for a couple of months.

1688
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:16,061
And then I'm gonna take
that knife of yours...

1689
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:17,855
and I'm gonna cut him
from ear to ear...

1690
01:47:17,896 --> 01:47:20,399
just like I should've done
yesterday, you fuck!

1691
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:23,068
I'm sure that sounds great to you all
in your fuckin' pimp world and all...

1692
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:24,528
but, listen, right now...

1693
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:26,238
that's not the fuckin' thing
you want to do!

1694
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,906
You want to put down
that fuckin' gun...

1695
01:47:27,948 --> 01:47:30,367
and you want to walk away,
'cause I swear to fuckin' God...

1696
01:47:30,367 --> 01:47:33,161
I'll fuckin' kill you,
you stupid fuckin' pimp bitch!

1697
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:36,790
Wrong! Only one of us
is walking out of here.

1698
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,209
- Guess who?
- Oleg, get behind me.

1699
01:47:42,045 --> 01:47:43,213
Oleg, get behind me!

1700
01:48:04,693 --> 01:48:06,403
Come on.

1701
01:48:06,445 --> 01:48:08,530
Oleg, talk to me. Come on.

1702
01:48:08,572 --> 01:48:11,366
OK, gotta make it home now.
Gotta make it home.

1703
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:12,868
Joey, please. You're bleeding.

1704
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:14,453
I got some, see? I got some.

1705
01:48:14,494 --> 01:48:16,288
Come on! Fuck!

1706
01:48:17,623 --> 01:48:19,041
Fuck!

1707
01:48:19,082 --> 01:48:20,125
Look out!

1708
01:48:37,309 --> 01:48:39,520
Mr. Gazelle, stop the car.

1709
01:48:39,561 --> 01:48:40,896
We need to get some help.

1710
01:48:40,938 --> 01:48:42,314
Come on. Got to meet T.

1711
01:48:42,356 --> 01:48:44,483
- Please, Mr. Gazelle!
- I'm coming home!

1712
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,252
Mr. Gazelle, please,
stop the car.

1713
01:49:03,293 --> 01:49:04,503
We need to get some help.

1714
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:07,256
- What's happened?
- You're hurt!

1715
01:49:07,297 --> 01:49:09,466
- We're gonna make it home.
- Stop the car.

1716
01:49:11,134 --> 01:49:12,761
You're bleeding!

1717
01:49:25,566 --> 01:49:27,067
God.

1718
01:49:27,526 --> 01:49:29,111
Oh, God.

1719
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:32,656
Nicky, stay back, stay back!

1720
01:49:37,995 --> 01:49:39,288
Mila.

1721
01:49:39,329 --> 01:49:40,873
Joey!

1722
01:49:40,914 --> 01:49:44,293
Joey, please! Stop!

1723
01:49:44,293 --> 01:49:47,796
Mr. Gazelle, come on, wake up!

1724
01:49:52,384 --> 01:49:55,637
Mr. Gazelle, wake up! Come on!

1725
01:49:55,637 --> 01:49:57,806
Stop the car, stop the car!

1726
01:49:57,848 --> 01:49:59,183
Please! Stop!

1727
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:01,268
Joe! Come on!

1728
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,853
Something's wrong! Let's go!

1729
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:08,150
Joe!

1730
01:50:10,736 --> 01:50:13,155
Oleg, wait, wait!

1731
01:50:13,155 --> 01:50:16,241
- God.
- Mom! Mom!

1732
01:50:16,283 --> 01:50:18,660
- Joe!
- Mom!

1733
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:24,833
- Fuck!
- Nicky, call 911!

1734
01:50:26,376 --> 01:50:29,129
Don't do this to me, Joe.
Don't fucking do this to me.

1735
01:50:29,713 --> 01:50:30,714
Sweetheart...

1736
01:50:30,756 --> 01:50:32,966
I loved you, OK?

1737
01:50:33,008 --> 01:50:36,762
Just remember I was always
stuck with Joey. OK?

1738
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:38,055
Only once did I lie.

1739
01:50:38,096 --> 01:50:40,516
Shut up, shut up.
Look at me, look at me.

1740
01:50:40,516 --> 01:50:43,644
Hey, baby, look me in the eye.
Joey, look me in the eyes.

1741
01:50:43,685 --> 01:50:45,687
I don't care, OK?
It doesn't matter.

1742
01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:47,898
Whatever it is, I'm gonna
kick your ass over it later.

1743
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,525
Stay with me, Joe.
Stay--look at me.

1744
01:50:49,566 --> 01:50:51,860
Look at me. I'm right here.
I'm right here for you.

1745
01:50:51,902 --> 01:50:54,279
Nicky! Nicky, come here!

1746
01:50:54,321 --> 01:50:56,198
Nicky! Nicky!

1747
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,491
He's right here.
He's right here.

1748
01:50:57,533 --> 01:50:58,575
They're coming.
They're on their way.

1749
01:50:58,617 --> 01:50:59,952
OK.

1750
01:50:59,993 --> 01:51:03,247
We're still going to the game
Friday night, right, Dad?

1751
01:51:03,288 --> 01:51:05,082
I love you, Nick!

1752
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:08,210
OK, he wants--he wants
to go to the game, baby.

1753
01:51:08,252 --> 01:51:10,838
Yeah. We're gonna
go to the game.

1754
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:12,214
We're gonna fuckin'
kick their asses, right, Mom?

1755
01:51:12,214 --> 01:51:15,342
They are going down
big fucking time!

1756
01:51:15,384 --> 01:51:17,344
You--you have a bad mouth.

1757
01:51:18,512 --> 01:51:19,888
Yep. Yep.

1758
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,434
It's not that bad. You'll be OK.

1759
01:51:24,476 --> 01:51:25,894
Joe.

1760
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:32,568
I'm right here.

1761
01:51:32,609 --> 01:51:35,404
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1762
01:51:37,072 --> 01:51:39,575
Joe. Joe!

1763
01:51:39,575 --> 01:51:41,368
Joe?

1764
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,953
Joe. God, no, don't!

1765
01:51:46,748 --> 01:51:48,083
God, no!

1766
01:51:49,126 --> 01:51:51,211
God! Joe!

1767
01:51:57,259 --> 01:51:59,761
Keep the kid outside.
I don't want him going in there.

1768
01:52:02,723 --> 01:52:04,975
Keep that boy over there.
We got to move in.

1769
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:07,603
This guy's CPT.
Come on, let's move.

1770
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:16,737
Subtitles: Arigon

1771
01:52:59,071 --> 01:53:00,364
Louise.

1772
01:53:00,614 --> 01:53:01,990
Louise.

1773
01:53:03,992 --> 01:53:06,328
Good girl. How's it going?

1774
01:53:08,789 --> 01:53:09,831
George...

1775
01:53:10,082 --> 01:53:11,500
the alternator's in the car.

1776
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:12,876
All right.

1777
01:53:18,173 --> 01:53:21,009
Don't ever ask me
to bury you again, Joe.

1778
01:53:37,276 --> 01:53:38,610
Hey.

1779
01:53:38,944 --> 01:53:40,779
So, what did they put
in that coffin really?

1780
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:41,822
What?

1781
01:53:41,864 --> 01:53:43,615
- What did they put in that coffin?
- What'd they put in the coffin?

1782
01:53:43,657 --> 01:53:44,658
Yeah.

1783
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,994
- Why? Did it seem kind of heavy?
- Yeah!

1784
01:53:47,035 --> 01:53:50,372
I don't know. I'm thinking...
probably a couple of blue shirts.

1785
01:53:50,414 --> 01:53:53,333
Must've been Lashaub and McCall.

1786
01:53:53,375 --> 01:53:55,460
- That sound good?
- And Cavin.

1787
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:56,920
And Cavin?
You want some of this, too?

1788
01:53:56,962 --> 01:53:57,963
For sure, Marishka.

1789
01:53:58,005 --> 01:53:59,631
Marishka?
You want some of this, too?

1790
01:53:59,673 --> 01:54:01,049
I'm gonna check
the both of you right now...

1791
01:54:01,091 --> 01:54:02,718
right in this house.
How about that?

1792
01:54:02,968 --> 01:54:04,553
Grab his head.
