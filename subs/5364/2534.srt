我有忙不完的工作
I just have a lot coming up at work

40
00:03:05,81 --> 00:03:08,48
所以不能信口_河

Yeah. We're on the same page.

43
00:03:12,42 --> 00:03:15,65
我也不想在此r定下,就明v
I'm not looking for a relationship right now, either. Let's just say that.

44
00:03:15,66 --> 00:03:18,37
不管你想怎,我都意…
Whatever you wanna... I can do...

45
00:03:18,44 --> 00:03:22,37

I'd rather just... I like simple... I'm not like other girls.

46
00:03:22,39 --> 00:03:25,80
我不喜g"我的男友吧",除非你f"好"
I'm not like, "Be my boyfriend!" Unless you were like, "Yeah!"

47
00:03:25,82 --> 00:03:27,92
反倒喜g"也S吧"
Then I'd be like, "Maybe."

48
00:03:28,02 --> 00:03:30,25
是不要吧
Mmm. But let's not.

49

真擂,我真的要s走了
Wow, this is so awkward. I really want you to leave,

51
00:03:45,91 --> 00:03:50,97
不得不出言不d
but I don't know how to say it without sounding like a dick.

52

55
00:04:58,38 --> 00:05:00,22
- 他到我了 - 我也是
- He scares me. - Me, too.

56
00:05:00,24 --> 00:05:01,76
但他是^佳的右
But he's an excellent motivator.

57
00:05:01,78 --> 00:05:02,76
]e
That's true.

58
00:05:02,84 --> 00:05:04,81

因橐葬岷孟穸家不到了
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

76
00:05:43,59 --> 00:05:44,68
我在芝加哥住很久了啊
Mmm. I've been in Chicago a lot.

77
00:05:44,69 --> 00:05:47,02
我知道,睡在小道道的Ce
I know. Sleeping at Dougie's house.

78

Well, it's just closer to work.

79
00:05:48,76 --> 00:05:50,76
跟他的戆?
How is it going with him anyway?

80
00:05:51,14 --> 00:05:53,01
不缘,我是指^得去

81
00:05:53,14 --> 00:05:55,02
只是X得他最近u行uh
but I just feel like he's been distant lately.

82
00:05:55,10 --> 00:05:56,85
我也不清楚…
And I don't know...

83
00:05:57,44 --> 00:05:59,40
他都叫我"老兄"
He calls me "dude" a lot.

84
00:05:59,48 --> 00:06:00,61
e想太多
That doesn't mean anything.

85
00:06:00,77 --> 00:06:02,07
我X得]事的
I think everything is fine.

86

昨晚在忙什N?
What did you do last night?

90
00:06:11,28 --> 00:06:13,66

00:06:13,75 --> 00:06:16,50
我跟泰德小片刻
I hung out with Ted for a little bit.

92

I knew it! We had fun.

93
00:06:19,79 --> 00:06:21,81
- 真的很_心 - @我就不懂了
It was fun. Here's what I don't like about it.

94
00:06:21,84 --> 00:06:23,43
每次^他之後都很自悔
You hate yourself after you see him, every time.

95
00:06:23,46 --> 00:06:27,42
每次到@,就一副屎面

96
00:06:25,46 --> 00:06:27,22
And then we go through this, and then you feel like shit,

97
00:06:27,43 --> 00:06:28,95
好像不去
and it's almost like you're doing it

98
00:06:28,96 --> 00:06:30,82
就Σ黄鹱约
because you feel bad about yourself.

99
00:06:30,84 --> 00:06:34,34
他很晚才打o我,去就f聊
He called me late, and we hung out.

100
00:06:34,36 --> 00:06:37,85
又]什N大不了,重c是玩的很_心
It wasn't a big deal. And you know what? It was fun.

101
00:06:38,13 --> 00:06:40,22
跟他上床
Ew! You had sex with him.

102
00:06:40,31 --> 00:06:44,36
我^了成人之夜
We had an adult sleepover.

103
00:06:44,82 --> 00:06:48,97
有"他"塞在嘴e^一夜?
Ooh. Did you let him sleep over in your mouth?

104
00:06:49,91 --> 00:06:51,50
- 安妮 - Σ黄
Annie! I'm sorry!

105
00:06:51,51 --> 00:06:55,85
- 太不可思h了 - 他一直把它靠在我旁
You're unbelievable. He kept putting it near my face.

106
00:06:55,87 --> 00:06:56,96
男人都@Π?
They do that, don't they?

107
00:06:57,08 --> 00:06:58,67
有何必要?好我服
Why do they do that? Let us offer.

108
00:06:58,68 --> 00:06:59,60
要是我不服…
If we don't offer...

109
00:06:59,62 --> 00:07:00,85
把它巴走的
Please. You're supposed to slap it away.

110
00:07:00,87 --> 00:07:02,67
我o能榱
I couldn't.

111
00:07:04,18 --> 00:07:06,85
- 不想瞪著它看 - ]e
You don't want to look right at it.

112
00:07:06,87 --> 00:07:06,88

No.

113
00:07:06,92 --> 00:07:09,97
太唐突了,就好像…
It's too aggressive. It's like...

114
00:07:10,05 --> 00:07:11,43
"你好"
"Hello."

115
00:07:11,45 --> 00:07:12,76
烙印在我X海e
That's my impression.

116
00:07:12,77 --> 00:07:13,86
MX子的B蛋?
Those are the balls?

117
00:07:13,88 --> 00:07:15,57
,我也想D移心思
Yeah. I'm trying to make it round,

118
00:07:15,59 --> 00:07:18,38
但我就是瞿l
but I can't because I have elbows.

119
00:07:19,64 --> 00:07:20,69
因樗太辣了
He is so hot, though.

120
00:07:20,85 --> 00:07:25,03
我明白形容他惹人鄣幼
Look, I know you say he's cute and all that stuff,

121
00:07:25,11 --> 00:07:27,10
但事後都很狼N,知道?
but it makes you feel like shit, you know?

122
00:07:27,15 --> 00:07:29,25
分明就是"女王不挑"
You're a total catch, and any guy

123
00:07:29,28 --> 00:07:31,48
任何男人都能打芳心
would be psyched to be your man.

124
00:07:31,49 --> 00:07:33,71
找一
You should just make room

125
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:36,25

126
00:07:36,33 --> 00:07:38,33
知道,他很真\
You know what? He's honest!

127
00:07:38,41 --> 00:07:40,16
他一五一十地f
He told me that we are what we are

128
00:07:40,29 --> 00:07:42,04
我只是玩玩,我也欣然接受
and we're just having fun. And I like that.

129
00:07:42,12 --> 00:07:46,34
他敢X,那王八蛋
He also told you that you need dental work. He's an asshole.

130
00:07:47,71 --> 00:07:51,22
我不需要看牙X
I don't need dental work.

131
00:07:51,42 --> 00:07:52,79
]e
You're right.

132
00:07:52,81 --> 00:07:54,14
我的牙X]有}
There is nothing wrong with my teeth.

133

00:08:04,40 --> 00:08:07,49
我今天不想去工作
I don't want to go to work today. Mmm-mmm.

137
00:08:07,57 --> 00:08:09,66
看看泰瑞打淄o我了
Let's see how many times Terry's called me.

138
00:08:09,73 --> 00:08:10,74
HH15通!
Oh! Only 15!

139
00:08:11,07 --> 00:08:12,07
泰瑞你知道?
You know what, Terry? I don't want

140
00:08:12,09 --> 00:08:14,84
我不想去拿你的猴子台,抱歉了!

141
00:08:14,86 --> 00:08:16,41
猴子台?
Monkey lamps?

142
00:08:16,49 --> 00:08:20,57
真想永hx_那神精病老
Ugh. I cannot wait to never work for a psychopath again.

143
00:08:20,87 --> 00:08:21,96

00:34:24,89 --> 00:34:28,24
但是改是要谋举|,本性y移
But, I mean, we are changing from who we are, which we always stay as.

What? That does not make any...

700
00:36:55,54 --> 00:36:57,27
- 但… - 因橛O殡[私的热
But, because of the deep personal details

But I feel like, personally, the Paris theme's

773
00:40:05,58 --> 00:40:08,46
巴黎主}有c像在炫耀
a bit, "Been there, done that."

774
00:40:08,48 --> 00:40:09,70
我X得可以再加
I just feel like we can top it.

775
00:40:09,78 --> 00:40:11,15

We should throw some ideas around.

776
00:40:11,24 --> 00:40:13,46
看看有]有想到其他主}
See if anyone else has a theme they had in mind

777
00:40:13,53 --> 00:40:15,48
或者有不同的想法
or something they'd been thinking of.

Lillian doesn't know, so it's, "Surprise! We're going to fight!"

784
00:40:34,59 --> 00:40:36,89
然後把她打到挫屎
We beat the shit out of her.

785
00:40:36,97 --> 00:40:38,76
^τ郎y忘
She's not going to forget that.
