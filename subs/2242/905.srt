-I know you will. -You go here.

135
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,678
-公主枕头？ -谢谢
-Princess pillow? -Thank you.

136
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,655
-没问题 -好
-You bet. -Okay.

137
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,152
(SIGHS)

138
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,856
我好了
I'm ready.

139
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,833
很久很久以前
Once upon a time,

140
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:56,295
在还没有电邮、手机与真人秀之前
before e-mails and cell phones and reality television shows,

141
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:57,635
美国青年民主党员

142
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:02,475
确切来说是1992年 在威斯康辛州的一个叫麦迪逊的小镇
in 1992 to be exact, in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin,

143
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,106
住了位名叫威廉海约的青年
there lived a young man named William Hayes.

144
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:08,777
-嘿，  威尔，老兄，  新年快乐 -嘿，  你也是
-Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year. -Hey, yeah, you, too.

145
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:14,085
这名青年深爱著他在大学的女友
Now, this young man was deeply, deeply in love with his college sweetheart.

146
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,385
就叫她…
Let's call her...

147
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,086
-艾蜜莉！ -艾蜜莉！
-Emily! -Emily!

148
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,222
艾蜜莉！
Emily!

149
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:21,259
-嘿 -嗨
-Hey. -Hi.

150
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,357
10、9、8…
ALL: Ten, nine, eight...

151
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:29,531
嘿，猜猜再过4秒后 谁会是全世界最幸福的人？
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy on planet Earth in about four seconds?

152
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:30,903
你
You.

153
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,669
…2、1！
ALL: ...two, one!

154
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:34,677
新年快乐！
Happy New Year!

155
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,679
他们是金童玉女
They were a perfect couple.

156
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:39,682
除了要真正了解这青年
Except to really understand how this young man

157
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,911
最后为何娶了你母亲 你必须要先知道
ended up marrying your mother, you'll also need to know

158
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:46,649
他怀抱著一个又大 又令人难为情的梦想
that he had a very big, incredibly embarrassing dream.

159
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,350
请起立
All rise

160
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,024
向美国总统致敬
for the President of the United States of America,

161
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,622
威廉
William

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,558
马修
Matthew

163
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,894
海约
Hayes.

164
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,973
你想当总统吗？
(CHUCKLING) You wanted to be President?

165
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,437
我只是，  我不懂你为何要在纽约 帮柯林顿做事
I'm just, I don't understand why you have to work for Clinton in New York.

166
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,379
你为何不能在麦迪逊替他卖命呢？
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?

167
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,508
因为这不需要人，  他们需要我去纽约
Well, because they don't need me here. They need me in New York.

168
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:18,884
他们需要他，  小艾，  威尔太帕 我不敢相信你要让他去
They need him, Em. Will's the man. I can't believe you're letting him go.

169
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,855
你没听说过纽约的女孩子吗？
I mean, don't you know about New York girls?

170
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,290
除了长相超辣之外 她们完全不介意一夜情
Besides being incredibly hot, they have no problem with casual sex,

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,453
我可是非常赞同
which by the way, I totally respect.

172
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,793
-万一给查理说中了呢？ -查理从来没说对过
-What if Charlie’s right? -Charlie’s never right.

173
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,823
-他是个智障 -我很担心纽约会改变你
-He's functionally retarded. -I am worried New York's gonna change you.

174
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:33,927
-改变也可能是好的 -如果我们一起改变
-Change can be good. -If we change together.

175
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,700
那我们就一起改变啊
So, we'll change together.

176
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:39,640
好吗？不过就去纽约两个月 我一下就回来了
Okay? It's two months in New York. I'll be back before you know it.

177
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,234
况且，  我们还有计划，  对吗？
Besides, we have a plan, right?

178
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,576
另一件事是我不敢相信 你竟然敢把艾蜜莉跟我留在这
The other thing I can't believe is that you'd risk Ieaving Emily here with me,

179
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:48,675
我得实说，  我对你一直有好感…
'cause I gotta tell you, I've always had a thing for you...

180
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,820
况且我完全没有道德可言
And I have absolutely no scruples.

181
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,852
等等！我差点忘了 你要把这个给夏曼
Wait! I almost forgot. You have to give this to Summer.

182
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:59,188
她是我在纽约唯一认识的女生
She's the only girl I know in New York.

183
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,524
-我希望你会会她 -夏曼哈德尼？
-I want you to meet her. -Summer Hartley?

184
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,723
-对 -她的名字？
-Yes. Yes. -That's her name?

185
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,527
她是我在剑桥当交换学生时认识的
She was on my exchange program at Cambridge,

186
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,899
所有的男生都想跟她上床 你看到她时或许也会这么想吧
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her, and you probably will, too.

187
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,130
或许你该寄给她
Maybe you should mail it to her.

188
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:09,365
-可能好些 -不
-That might be a better idea. -No.

189
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,428
是什么？
What is it?

190
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,840
一样我很久以前就该给她的东西
Something I should have sent her a long time ago.

191
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:17,039
我爱你，  威廉海约
I love you, William Hayes.

192
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,551
(CAR HORN HONKING)

193
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:22,043
好吧，  快走、快走，  好好做
Okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.

194
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,720
艾蜜莉听来像是个好妈妈
Emily sounds like she would make a good mom.

195
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:28,587
-我只是不确定她是不是我妈 -为什么？
-I just don't know if she's my mom. - Why not?

196
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,955
大家都知道
Everyone knows that the girlfriend

197
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,927
在故事最初的女朋友一定会被甩
in the beginning of the story always gets dumped.

198
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:36,261
这表示夏曼哈德尼可能是我妈
Which means maybe Summer Hartley is my mother.

199
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:54,811
我永远忘不了那天
I'll never forget that day.

200
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,685
我来到了梦寐以求的城市
There I was, arriving in the city I always dreamed about

201
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,883
来为我深信的竞选活动尽一份力
to work on a campaign that I believed in with all of my heart.

202
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,450
更何况，  我深信在几个小时后
And on top of that, I was positive that in just a few hours,

203
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:08,498
活动的负责人就会发现 我有多么的优秀
the campaign manager would realize how brilliant I was.

204
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,055
然后我将负责写讲稿
And then I'd be writing speeches,

205
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,260
然后负责研发战略，  不久后…
and then I'd be coming up with strategy, and before long...

206
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:13,700
威尔海约？
GARETH: Will Hayes?

207
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,635
-嘿，  盖瑞斯亨德逊 -你是盖瑞斯
-Hey. Gareth Henderson. -You're Gareth.

208
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,173
-你好吗？ -幸会，  我们走吧，  海约
-Hey, how are you? -Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.

209
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:22,507
我带了我的履历表还有一些 我帮史威尼议员写的演讲
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

210
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,538
很好，  我在空档时 一定会好好拜读一番
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these in my abundant spare time.

211
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,710
在那之前，  这些咖啡与培果订单
In the meantime, here's a sample of the coffee and bagel order

212
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,549
需要补齐
I'll need filled immediately.

213
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,179
等等！
Wait!

214
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,553
你要我去买咖啡？
You want me to get coffee?

215
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:37,525
每人都有某时期要买咖啡 现在轮到你了，  快点
At some point in our lives, we all get coffee. Your time's now. Come on.

216
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:38,822
海约，  我们还在走
We're still walking, Hayes.

217
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,557
咖啡早上十点要到 不然亚瑟会杀了我！
Have the coffee here by 10:00, or Arthur's gonna kill me!

218
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,600
就表示我就得杀了你 我以前可是下过手，  海约
That means I'm gonna have to kill you. I've killed before, Hayes.

219
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:47,660
-你应该要知道 -这是什么？
-You should know that. -What is this?

220
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:49,329
这是手机
That is a cellular telephone

221
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,705
让我可随时随地为了任何事找到你
so I can get a hold of you wherever, whenever, for whatever.

222
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,802
-谁帮我拿些阿斯匹灵好吗？ -小心点！
-Can somebody get me an aspirin, please? -Watch it!

223
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,040
欢迎你加入，  海约！
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!

224
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,376
-嗨 -什么？嗨
-Hi. -What? Hi.

225
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:06,354
4周后，  纽约的选民
ARTHUR: Four weeks from now, voters of New York State

226
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,086
将选出下一届的民主党总统候选人
will select their next Democratic nominee for President.

227
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,420
若比尔柯林顿赢了
Now, if Bill Clinton wins,

228
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,898
我要你们知道那将是
I want you to all understand that it's gonna be as a direct result

229
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,925
在座每一个人的心血所产生的结果
of the commitment and the energy of every person in this room.

230
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,405
我是说真的，  那是事实
And I mean that. That's just a fact.

231
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:25,566
这工作就是如此重要
Now, that's how important the work is.

232
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:28,634
在座的每一位…
That each and every one of you is...

233
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,640
(WILLIAM SCREAMS)

234
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,808
(CRASHING)

235
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,872
我在这做什么？
(SHOUTING) What am I doing here?

236
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:35,945
新来的
It's the new guy.

237
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,919
-嘿 -嘿，  那是送卫生纸的人吗？
-Hey. -Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?

-可以给我一包摩利红烟吗？ -三块两毛五
-Can I get a pack of Morley Red, please? -3.25.

239
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,858
三块两毛五？ 在威州麦迪逊才卖两块一毛五
3.25? These are $2.15 in Madison, Wisconsin.

240
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,301
那你就回麦迪逊啊
So go back to Madison.

241
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,931
-记得写信 -没错，  记得要写信
-Don't forget to write. -That's right. Don't forget to write.

242
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,305
等等！停止！
Hold it! Stop. Stop right there!

243
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,075
你曾抽烟？
You smoked?

244
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,839
不，  是啦
No. Yeah.

245
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,549
但我本来不打算跟你说的
But I didn't mean to tell you that.

246
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:12,378
听著，  我那时很年轻并很蠢 我很多年没抽了
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid, and I haven't smoked in years.

247
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:13,581
我发誓
I promise you.

248
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,854
还有什么应该跟我说的？
Is there anything else you should tell me?

249
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,327
大概没有吧
Probably not.

250
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,770
-能帮我影印十份吗？ -跟那叠放在一起
-Can I get 10 copies? -Put them on the pile.

251
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:30,305
不，  是亚瑟要的 我15分钟前就该拿到了
No, they're for Arthur. I need them like, 15 minutes ago.

252
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,500
你若不介意的话…
So if you wouldn’t mind...

253
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,400
你是送卫生纸的那家伙
You're the toilet paper guy.

254
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:37,935
-慢著，  那是谁？ -那是艾波
Wait. Who's that?  That's April.

255
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,774

Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy,

256
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,842
但你也可称我为送培果与咖啡的家伙
but feel free to call me the bagel-and-coffee guy.

257
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,755
会计部的陶德叫我克莉丝朵 我很确信那是女生的名字
Or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal, which I'm pretty sure is a girl’s name.

258
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,851
-几份？ -请印十份
-How many copies? -Ten. Please.

259
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:54,260
-这些？ -对，  两面都要
-These? -Yeah, both of those.

260
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,523
你为什么会支持柯林顿？
What made you become a Bill Clinton supporter?

261
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,228

Why does everyone have to be a Democrat or a Republican?

No, hold on. You're an Independent, aren't you?

我什么都不是 我为什么一定要跟从某个党派？
I am nothing. Why am I obligated to be something?

268

我为什么要对每件事都有立场？
Why do I have to have an opinion about everything anyway?

女人堕胎的权力呢？这件事呢？
A woman's right to do what she wants with her body? What about that?

你错了，  他将改善黑人权益
You're wrong. He's gonna make a difference with African Americans.

283
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:54,551
也将改善妇女权益，  他了解女性
He's gonna make a difference with women. He gets women.

-But I understand. I get it. -I actually think it's very sweet.

647
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,635
-看，  你又来了 -真的？
-See, you did it again. -Really?

648
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:37,137
-嗯 -我自己都没察觉
-Yeah. -I don't even know I'm doing it.

649
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:40,369
你或许很难想像 一个基于互相尊重的恋情
It's probably hard for you to imagine a relationship based on mutual respect

650
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:44,276
而不包括一丝丝你所谓的被虐倾向
without even the slightest hint of whatever you call it, masochism.

651
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:47,440
你与艾蜜莉的关系 若真像你说的那么完美
Well, if your deal with Emily is so gosh darn wonderful,

652
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:49,313
你为什么不娶她呢？
then why don't you just marry her?

653
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:51,352
什么阻止了你？
What's stopping you?

654

没有啊
Nothing.

Oh, my God. You're doing it in front of a room full of strangers?

659
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:11,933
-是啊，  有什么不妥吗？ -没有，  这表示你很有自信
-Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that? -No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.

660
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:13,065
你要说什么？
What are you gonna say?

661

-我还在想，  不知道 -你应该跟我练习
-I'm still working on it. I don't know. -Oh, you should work on it with me.

662

You should practice with me. I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.

我是你的大学女友艾蜜莉 你有什么要问我的吗？
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart. Is there something you wanted to ask me?

664

-艾蜜莉… -等等！你要跪下来
-Emily... -Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.

不，  我才不要跪下来
No, I'm not getting down on my knee.

666

她会喜欢的，  她会希望你跪下
She'll like it. She'll like seeing you down on your knee.

667
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,223
-我不要跪下 -那真是错大了，  好吧
-I'm not getting down on my knee. -Such a mistake. Okay.

别惹我笑，  艾蜜莉
Don't make me laugh. Emily,

670
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,164
你愿意
will you,

671
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,953
um,

672
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,539
嫁给我吗？
marry me?

673
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:53,139
-不 -我的天
-No. -Oh, my God.

674
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,046
什么叫做“你愿意嫁给我吗？”
Well, what do you mean, "Will you, um, marry me?"

675
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:56,709
我好几个礼拜没见到你了！
I haven't seen you in weeks!

676
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:59,913
你对我们的婚姻前景 看来一点都不开心与兴奋！
You don't look happy or excited about the prospect of our marriage!

677
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:03,890
你要我放弃我的自由
You're asking me to give up my freedom,

为了一个成功与失败率参半的制度？
for an institution that fails as often as it succeeds?

680
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:11,930
我为什么要嫁给你？ 你又为什么想要娶我呢？
And why should I marry you, anyway? I mean, why do you wanna marry me?

681
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,458
唯一理由就是能满足社会 深植在我们心中的理想中产阶级欲望
Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill an ideal that society embeds in us

682
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:18,438
与自小就灌输在我们心中的 消费资本主义
from an early age to promote a consumer capitalist agenda?

683
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,570
Oh!

684
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,976

-You should've got on your knee! -Just shut up!

这样
Here.

687
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:32,376
我想娶你，  是因为你是我一早起来
I wanna marry you because you're the first person

688
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:34,547
第一眼就想要见到的人
that I want to look at when I wake up in the morning

689
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:37,251
并是我每晚睡前唯一想要吻的人
and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.

690
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:41,126
因为当我第一次看到那双手时
Because the first time that I saw these hands,

691
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,423
我就无法想像不能牵著它们的日子
I couldn’t imagine not being abIe to hold them.

692

但最主要的，  当你爱一个人 像我爱你一样
But mainly, when you love someone as much as I love you

693
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:53,104
唯一剩下的就是结婚
getting married is the only thing left to do.

所以你愿意…
So will you...

嫁给我吗？
marry me?

697
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:07,216
绝对是，  或许
Definitely. Maybe.

698
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,817
我得考虑一下
I have to think about it.

699

你为什么有这么多版本的《简爱》？
How come you have so many copies of Jane Eyre?

-说来话长 -真的？
-It's a long story. -Really?

Seriously, why?

我13岁生日时，  想要一副金耳环
For my 13th birthday, I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,

709
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:53,529
但我爸却帮我买了精装版的《简爱》
and instead my dad bought me a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.

710
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:57,868
里头还有他很美的题词 但我当时根本不在乎
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription, which I could care less about at the time

711
00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,669
因为我还在为了耳环的事生气
seeing as I was so pissed about the earrings,

712
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:05,645
真的很遗憾 因为那是他给我最后的一份礼物
which was tragic as it turned out 'cause it was the last present he ever gave me.

713
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,113
什么意思？
What do you mean?

714

他在三周后因车祸身亡
He died three weeks later in a car accident.

I read it every year or two. Each time it's different.

908
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:29,160
我在她生日时跟她说过的话
that I said to her on her birthday.

909
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,222
我们先互写名信片，  然后开始通信
Anyway, we started writing postcards. We started writing letters.

910
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,633
不知不觉中，  虽然我们相隔万里
And before I knew it, even though we were separated by entire worlds,

911
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:37,568
我们成了好朋友
we became great friends.

912
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:39,230
《简爱》

913
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:45,643
1994年，  纽约充满生气
It was 1994, and New York was full of new life.

914
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:47,180
更多的工作与财富
More jobs, more money.

915
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:48,340
敬请期待网路！
That was the start of the Internet. And overnight, everyone in Manhattan

916
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:51,010
那是网路的开始 在一夜之间，  所有曼哈顿的人

917
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,074
都拿著手机
had a cell phone.

918
00:50:52,153 --> 00:50:53,177
听得到我吗？
Can you hear me now?

919
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:55,085
并机不离手
Which they never put down.

920
00:50:56,958 --> 00:51:02,624
然后我们的旧上司亚瑟罗布雷多 给了罗素和我千载难逢的机会
And then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo gave Russell and me our first big break.

921
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:04,289
-这是给你的 -谢谢
-This just came for you. -Thanks.

嘿，  上工罗
Hey, let's get this party started.

926

北部那边怎样？
What's the word from upstate?

927
00:51:15,476 --> 00:51:18,070
生平第一次，  纽约的大头主动来找我
For the first time, New York was coming to me,

928
00:51:18,146 --> 00:51:19,374
而不是我去求他们
instead of the other way around.

929
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:20,471

Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing speeches now for Arthur Robredo?

966

-她跟我说你的新女友是大二生 -不，  其实是两个大一生
-She tells me you're dating a sophomore. -No. Actually, it's two freshmen,

967
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:21,001
情况好时可凑成一个大二生吧
which, on a good day, add up to a sophomore, I suppose.

968
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:25,831
陪我走走，  你怎么会为 亚瑟罗布雷多这种政客卖力？
WaIk with me. Why would you wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?

969
00:53:25,906 --> 00:53:31,538
我记得我们初次会面时 你是个有原则与抱负的人
As I recall from our first encounter, you're a man of principles and ideals, even.

970
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:36,547
别跟我说你也只是另一个 穿著亚曼尼西装的雅痞
Don't tell me you're just another yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.

971
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:40,280
你讲得好好，  亲爱的 他还有礼吗？你对他有礼吗？
You were wonderful, darling. Is he being nice? You being nice?

00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:43,323
-有礼？他顶得住的 -当然，  我顶得住
-Nice? Yeah, he can handle himself. -Sure, I can handle myself.

973
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:46,918
首先，  亚瑟罗布雷多不是政客 他是从基层做起的
First of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack. He's worked his way up from the streets.

974
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:49,121
他曾是警察、实业家
He was a cop, an entrepreneur.

975
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:53,124
他是个白痴，  我的书的主题就是这个
He's a putz. This is exactly what my book is about.

976
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,361
拿去，  读读吧，  免费的
Here. Read it. It's free.

977
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,268
美丽、理想、爱都一文不值
Beauty, ideals, love don't mean squat anymore.

978
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:03,139
-重要的只是权力与金钱 -你的每本书我都拜读过
-It's all about power and money. -I've read every single one of your books,

979
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,269
而你才完全为权力与金钱著迷
and you're completely obsessed with power and money.

980
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:07,837
那是因为他两者都没有 是吧，  宝贝？
That's because he doesn't have any. Right, babe?

981
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,425
宝贝，  我最在乎的是爱
Babe, I am about the love.

982
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:11,868
-你知道的 -对
-As you know. -Yes.

983
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:13,131
所以你才留我在身边
That's why you keep me around.

984
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:16,936
好管住你那又野又贪婪的野心
To keep that rampant, rapacious ambition of yours in check.

985
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:20,074
我有个想法
I have a thought.

986
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:25,177
你不如利用你那一丁点的 权力与影响力
Why don't you use that newly acquired scintilla of power and influence

987
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:30,279
让夏曼帮你那罗布雷多的家伙 写篇文章？
to get Summer here to write an article about your man Robredo?

988
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:33,553
这样一来，  能让夏曼出头 你也能散播你的信息
That way Summer gets a break, and you get the word out.

989
00:54:33,626 --> 00:54:36,322
-你得到了什么呢，  汉普顿？ -是啊
-What do you get, Hampton? -Yeah.

990
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:41,056
我想是爱吧，  更多的爱 我就只在乎这个
I guess it's the love. More of the love. Yeah, that's what I'm about.

991
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:42,327
更多爱
More love.

992
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:44,665
-我就知道夏曼会再出现 -是吗？
- I knew Summer would be back. -Did you?

993
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:46,967
你知道吗？我一开始 并不希望夏曼是我母亲
You know what? At first, I didn't want Summer to be my mom.

994
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,531
但我现在还满喜欢她的 你有约她出去吗？
But now I'm kinda liking her. Did you ask her out on a date?

995
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,536
Uh-uh.

996
00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:54,010
我很想，  但我不能 因为文章出自她笔
I wanted to, but I couldn’t 'cause she was writing the article.

997
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,174
罗布雷多为何无法谨言慎行 纽约打击犯罪铁腕的民主党员

998

-哗，  写得真不错 -威尔，  这篇很棒
-Wow. This is pretty good. -Will, this is really good.

1000
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:27,979
你确定不会像拍马屁的文章？
SUMMER: Are you sure it didn't seem like a puff piece?

1001
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:30,572
不会，很完美，  完全…
No, it's perfect. It's absolutely...

1002
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:34,585
不过有一部份让我有点困扰
You know, there's one part, though, that kind of bothered me.

1003
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:36,078
“威廉海约
"William Hayes,

-纯真？我是说… -对
-Boyishly? I mean... -Yeah.

There's just no room for truth in journalism.

1012
00:55:59,912 --> 00:56:01,971
你一直都想要成为记者吗？
Did you always want to be a journalist?

1013
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:06,984
不，  16岁之前我一直想当演员 我想在百老汇唱歌
No. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress. I wanted to sing on Broadway.

1014
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:08,576
哗，  真的？
Wow. Really?

1015
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,452
是啊，  真的，很难以置信吗？
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?

1016
00:56:11,524 --> 00:56:15,927
嗯，  女演员不都极度需要关注 很情绪化并没有安全感吗？
Well, aren't actresses needy and emotional and, you know, insecure?

1017
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:16,984
都那个样
That sort of thing.

1018
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:20,293
你想说什么？我不需要关注？ 我没有情绪吗？
What are you saying? That I don't need? That I don't have emotions?

1019
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:22,231
-我是个非常需要关注的人 -我不是这意思

01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:49,337
-喂 -威廉海约？
-Yeah. - (WHISPERING) William Hayes?

1166
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:50,574
我就是
Speaking.

1167
01:03:50,649 --> 01:03:53,140
我现在正盯著你
I'm watching you right now.

1168
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:56,483
我很清楚你与你朋友罗布雷多的事
And I know all about you and your friend Robredo.

1169
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:59,888
我甚至可以毁了你们两人
In fact, I know so much, I could bring you both down.

1170
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,585
真的？
Really?

1171
01:04:02,594 --> 01:04:06,189
-请问你是？ -不如我们见个面，  你就知道了？
-Who am I speaking with? -Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?

1172
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:09,394
-你在哪？ -离你很近
-Where are you? -I'm close by.

1173
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:14,629
我对这没什么经验
I don't have a lot of experience with whatever this is.

1174
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:17,407
你越来越接近
You're getting warm.

1175
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,368
很近
You're hot.

1176
01:04:21,046 --> 01:04:22,536
很近

1177
01:04:22,614 --> 01:04:24,946
你好正！
You are so hot!

1178
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,654
(APRIL LAUGHING)

1179
01:04:27,552 --> 01:04:29,315
骗到你了！
I got you!

1180
01:04:30,155 --> 01:04:31,713
我以为你整个夏天都不在
I thought you were gone through the summer.

1181
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,953
不，  我原本也这样想 但是发生了件很疯狂的事
No, I thought so, too, but this crazy thing happened.

1182
01:04:35,027 --> 01:04:38,155
我在克里特岛美丽的沙漠露营
I mean, I was camping on this beautiful beach in Crete

1183
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,791
跟一群很酷的人们 其中有个我喜欢的男的叫派克
with all these really cool people, and there was this guy that I liked, Paco,

1184
01:04:41,867 --> 01:04:45,234
深沉又性感，  话很少，  完全是我的型
brooding and sexy, monosyllabic and totally my type.

1185
01:04:45,304 --> 01:04:48,205
有天晚上我与派克跳舞时，  他吻了我
One night I'm dancing with Paco and he kisses me,

1186
01:04:48,273 --> 01:04:50,867
-很深很棒的一个吻 -请别跟我说细节
-an incredible, deep kiss. - Spare me the details.

1187
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,377
-你知道我怎么样吗？ -不知道，  你怎样？
And what do I do? -I don't know. What'd you do?

1188
01:04:53,445 --> 01:04:54,707
我开始哭
I start crying.

1189
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,214
-眼泪就一直流下脸颊… -你当然会哭
-I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks... -Of course you start crying.

1190
01:04:57,282 --> 01:05:00,740
…结果他没发觉 因为他的手忙著在我身上游走
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course, his hands are all over my body,

1191
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:03,379
感觉很好，  但却让我更难过
which felt nice, which made me feel even more upset,

1192
01:05:03,455 --> 01:05:05,013
突然间
'cause in a flash

1193
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:08,787
我眼前晃过了 我们现在到未来间的恋情
I saw our entire relationship, from present to future tense.

1194
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,695
很火热的开始，  派克享受著我的爱…
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco basking in my love and admiration...

1195
01:05:14,232 --> 01:05:16,291
-我们来这干嘛？ -我需要拿个东西
-What are we doing here? -I just got to pick something up.

1196
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:17,392
一下就好
Just take a second.

1197
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:20,336
然后不可避免的一刻 我也不知道为什么…
And then the inevitable moment, and I don't know why it...

1198
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:21,702
-哈罗 -嗨
-Hello. -Hi.

1199
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:24,333
我也不知道为什么会这样 但是每次都这样
I don't know why it happens, but it always does,

1200
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:26,673
那些爱将开始令他厌烦
when all that love and admiration would start to irritate him

1201
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:28,906
然后他就会伤害我
and he'd find some way to hurt me.

1202
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:31,506
他事后当然感到很抱歉
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.

1203
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,244
所以…
So...

1204
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:37,186
我决定脱离他美丽的唇
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips from mine,

1205
01:05:37,255 --> 01:05:39,553
将他摆在我屁股上的手移开
remove his hand from my ass,

1206
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,478
(LAUGHS)

1207
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,291
-然后走开 -干得好
-and I walked away. -Good move.

1208
01:05:45,364 --> 01:05:48,094
-我离开了，  威尔！离开派克！ -干得好
-I walked away, Will! From Paco! -Good move.

1209
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,657
-没有人能抗拒派克！ -我喜欢这故事
-No one walks away from Paco! -I like the story.

1210
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:53,000
感觉像是扭转了命运
And it felt life-changing.

1211
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:55,369
我发觉我得跟个人分享
And I realized I had to tell someone.

1212
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,465
当我意识到这个人是谁时
When I realized who that person was,

1213
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:59,533
-好出乎意料 -在这里，  先生
-it was so unexpected. - Here we are, sir.

1214
01:05:59,611 --> 01:06:01,442
像是有什么直视著你
It's like when something is staring you in the face

1215
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:04,539
但你却盲目得看不见
and it's like you're too blind to see it.

1216
01:06:04,616 --> 01:06:06,379
那是什么？
What's that?

1217
01:06:07,986 --> 01:06:10,216
我也有事要对你说
I have some news for you, too.

1218
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:17,591
等等、等等，  你为什么这么生气？
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you so upset?

1219
01:06:17,662 --> 01:06:20,688
你不觉得在我们通了这么久的信后
Don't you think it's a little weird we've been writing each other for however long

1220
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:22,734
你竟然没跟我透露
and somehow you neglect to tell me that,

1221
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:27,431
一、你恋爱了，  二、你居然恋爱了
A, you've fallen in love, and, B, you've fallen in love!

1222
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:29,098
-我跟你说过我在约会 -约会
-I told you I was dating someone. -Dating someone.

1223
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:31,870
你才刚帮人家买了订婚戒指！
You just bought a diamond engagement ring for someone!

1224
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:34,036
抱歉，  我对于要跟你说感到紧张
I'm sorry. I think I was just nervous to tell you.

1225
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:36,740
为什么跟我说会让你紧张？
Why would you be nervous to tell me?

1226
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,111
不知道
I don't know.

1227
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:42,677
我好爱这女孩
I love this girl so much.

1228
01:06:44,156 --> 01:06:46,716
我很希望你能为我高兴
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.

1229
01:06:47,993 --> 01:06:51,656
我可以为你高兴 我当然可以为你高兴
I can be happy for you. Of course I can be happy for you.

1230
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:56,959
可怜的艾波
Poor April.

1231
01:06:57,035 --> 01:07:00,471
她就像是故事里永远是朋友的那角色
She's like the character in the story who's always been the friend.

1232
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:03,599
然后发现她不想只做朋友
Then she realized she doesn't just want to be the friend.

1233
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:06,644
她其实想当女朋友，  但是太迟了
She wants to be the girlfriend, except it's too late.

1234
01:07:06,711 --> 01:07:08,144
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1235
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:11,341
你没在听吗？她为了你回来
Weren't you listening? She came home for you.

1236
01:07:17,055 --> 01:07:19,546
所有的菜单上都有徽章，老友
GARETH: There's union seals on all the menus, my friend.

1237
01:07:19,624 --> 01:07:23,287
芝加哥的天气放晴了，  总统8点会到
The weather cleared in Chicago. The President will be here by 8:00.

1238
01:07:23,361 --> 01:07:24,521
小罗呢？
Where's Russ?

1239
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:26,325
他会在餐厅与你和亚瑟碰面
Gonna meet you and Arthur in the restaurant.

1240
01:07:26,398 --> 01:07:28,366
我在这比较好笑
ROBERT KLEIN: I'm funnier over here.

(HARMONICA PLAYING)

1242
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:32,263
我腿停不住
I can't stop my leg

1243
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:40,305
你早到了
You're early.

1244

1245
01:07:45,717 --> 01:07:47,241
见到你真好
Good to see you.

1246
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:49,150
-你看来很好 -谢谢，  你也是
-You look great. -Thank you. You, too.

1247
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:52,384
-领带很漂亮 -你最清楚了
-That's a nice tie. -Well, you'd know.

1248
01:07:53,391 --> 01:07:57,452
杂志社要我继续跟罗布雷多的报导
So, the magazine asked me to do a follow-up on Robredo.

1249
01:07:57,529 --> 01:08:00,521
-很好 -嗯，  是很好，  但也…
-Great. -Yeah, it is great. It's also...

1250
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:03,161
也…
(SIGHING) It's...

1251
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:06,830
你自己看吧
You just read it.

1252
01:08:06,905 --> 01:08:08,930
-你已经写好了 -嗯
-You already wrote it. -Yeah.

1253
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:20,146
-他做了这事？ -是的
-He did this? -Yes.

1254
01:08:20,252 --> 01:08:24,655
他们让一个朋友提早假释
They actually got a friend an early parole.

1255
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:29,422
你知道吗？这是好久以前的事了
You know what? I think it happened such a long time ago,

1256
01:08:29,494 --> 01:08:31,428
你们的问卷调查又领先这么多
and you're way ahead in all the polls.

1257
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:36,160
嗯，  这对他标榜是铁腕打击犯罪的 民主党员不会有什么大影响
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter, because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.

1258
01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:37,792
那…
That's...

1259
01:08:38,236 --> 01:08:40,329
当人们读了这个…
When people read this...

1260
01:08:42,674 --> 01:08:44,972
夏曼，  听我说
Summer, listen to me.

1261
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:48,103
你若交了上去，  我们就完了
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.

1262
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,842
我觉得会被炒作一个礼拜 然后风暴就会过了…
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week, and then the storm will pass...

1263
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:53,146
我是说我们俩
I'm talking about you and me.

-Come on. -I'm just doing my job.

1266
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,485
我第一次时并没有尽责
I didn't do it the first time around.

1267
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:08,021
就算我不写也会有人写
And if I didn't write this, somebody else would.

1268
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:10,659
让他们写
Let them.

1269
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:13,135
嘿，  别交上去，  好吗？
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?

1270
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,742
你已经交了
You already did.

1273
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:41,022
好的
ARTHUR: Yeah, sure.

1274
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,190
我真的很喜欢夏曼
I really liked Summer.

1275
01:09:43,268 --> 01:09:45,133
我真不敢相信她竟然如此…
I can't believe she turned out to be such a...

1276
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:46,397
-让人心碎？ -不
-Heartbreaker? -No.

1277
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:48,769
投机者？背叛…
-Opportunist? Double-crossing... -Uh-uh.

-贱人 -玛雅
-Bitch. -Maya.

1279
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:52,674
她怎么能这样对你？
How could she do that to you?

1280
01:09:52,744 --> 01:09:56,339
就如她所说，  她要是不写 也会有别人去写
It's like she said. If she didn't write it, someone else would have.

1281
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:57,938
而且那是事实
And it was the truth.

1282
01:09:58,016 --> 01:10:00,348
她有吗？她让你心碎吗？
So did she? Did she break it?

1283
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:02,045
什么？
What?

1284
01:10:07,826 --> 01:10:09,657
文章登出后呢？
What happened when the article came out?

1285
01:10:09,728 --> 01:10:13,425
《纽约日报》：  他出局了！

1286
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:29,507
你搞砸了，老兄，  你真的搞砸了
You screwed up, man. You really screwed up.

1287
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:31,276
省省吧，  我现在不想听你说教
Please save it. I don't need to hear this right now.

1288
01:10:31,349 --> 01:10:33,613
等我搞清楚这件事 会带给我什么教训时
Whenever I figure out whatever I'm supposed to learn from all this,

1289
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:36,017
-我会通知你的 -我迫不及待
-I'll write you a letter! -Yeah, can't wait.

1290
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:41,218
我失去了女友、工作、朋友
So I lost my girl, I lost my job, and I lost my friend.

1291
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,891
有好长一段时间，  一切仿佛都不重要
And for a long time, nothing seemed to matter.

1292
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:48,929
但世上有问题的不只是我
But I wasn't the only one with problems.

1293
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,835
我与那女人之间没有性关系
I did not have sexual relations with that woman,

01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:55,463
陆文斯基小姐
Miss Lewinsky.

1295
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,565
我从未要求别人撒谎
I never told anybody to lie.

1296
01:10:57,642 --> 01:10:59,337
-喂？ -你在看吗？
-Hello? -Are you watching?

1297
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,538
这些指控是错误的
These allegations are false.

1298
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:02,671
艾波？
April?

1299
01:11:02,747 --> 01:11:06,706
嗯，  是艾波？你以为是谁？ 你到底有没有在看？
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was? Are you watching or not?

1300
01:11:06,785 --> 01:11:08,616
当然在看
Of course I'm watching.

1301
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:11,221
你觉得他做了吧？
You think he did it, don't you?

1302
01:11:11,289 --> 01:11:15,919
我不用觉得，  我知道 你看她的照片，  我爱她
I don't think, I know. Look at the picture of her. I love her.

1303
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:17,894
她超像他的型
She's so his type.

1304
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:22,990
你为什么这么久才回我电话，  小红？
So, what took you so long to finally call me back there, red?

1305
01:11:23,068 --> 01:11:24,763
我还以为我失去你了
I thought I lost you.

1306
01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:28,829
-感觉好像好几年了 -我现在不是打给你了吗？
-Feels like years. -I'm calling you now, aren't I?

1307
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:31,464
嗯
Yeah.

1308
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:33,906
你好吗？都在做些什么？
How are you? What's doing?

1309
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,208
我多了个室友，  奥莉微雅
I got a new roommate, Olivia.

1310
01:11:37,282 --> 01:11:38,647
我在书店做事
And I'm working at a bookstore.

1311
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:39,706
本书属于芭芭拉贝克 夏绿蒂白朗特著《简爱》

1312
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:42,182
但我一直在想要不要回去念书
But I've been thinking about going back to school.

1313
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:43,481
酷
Cool.

1314
01:11:43,555 --> 01:11:45,284
嘿，  我有说我痛恨我的工作吗？
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?

1315
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:47,848
我以前好爱我的工作 但我现在觉得自己像个骗子
I used to love what I do, and now I feel like a complete hack.

1316
01:11:47,926 --> 01:11:49,416
海约先生：抱歉，  但这本《简爱》首页并没有题词，  需要继续找吗？

1317
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,809
-你交女朋友了吗？ -我？我交…不，  完全没有
-Are you seeing anyone? -Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.

1318
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,812
我从柯林顿连任后就没做过了
In fact, I haven't had sex since Clinton was re-elected.

1319
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,898
何必费事呢？他将全国的额度都包了
Why bother? He's having enough sex for the entire country.

1320
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:01,995
别这么缺德
Easy. Easy now.

1321
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,372
嘿，  或许你该跟随他的脚步 去勾引实习生
Hey, maybe you should follow his lead and seduce an intern.

1322
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:07,741
你提到这还真巧
You know, it's funny that you should mention that.

1323
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:11,714
上礼拜才来了个很正的实习生
There's a fetching young intern who just started a week ago.

1324
01:12:11,783 --> 01:12:13,751
很好，  约她出去啊
Great. Ask her out.

1325
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:16,287
我确实该，  是吗？
I should, shouldn't I?

1326
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:20,990
但我想应该不会吧，  我不想只是玩玩
But I don't think I will. You see, I don't want a fling.

1327
01:12:21,059 --> 01:12:23,118
我要的是真爱
I want the real deal.

1328
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:26,459
别管什么真爱了，  真爱由不得你去找 它自己会找上门
Forget about the real deal. You don't find it, it finds you.

1329
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:29,659
什么意思？我不懂这其中的意思
What does that mean? I don't know what that means.

1330
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:32,965
意思就是等你年纪到了并准备好时
It means that you get to a certain age and then you're ready.

1331
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:36,302
就是你准备好生孩子或是给承诺 或者是…
You know, you're ready for kids or a commitment or, you know...

1332
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:37,773
-先生 -…背房贷
-Sir. -...a mortgage.

1333
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:39,867
-位子准备好了 -谢谢
-Table’s ready. Okay. -Thanks.

1334
01:12:39,944 --> 01:12:41,002
懂吗？
You know what I mean?

1335
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:44,207
当时跟你在一起的人 就是你的真命天子
And the person that you're with then, they become the one.

1336
01:12:44,282 --> 01:12:47,046
你的意思是不是人的问题 而是时机罗？
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.

1337
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:48,847
-正是 -好吧
-Exactly. -Okay. All right.

1338
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,981
所以从未有个男的让你觉得 “就是这个
So there's never been a guy, ever, that made you think, "This is it.

1339
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:55,457
“就是他了，  他是真命天子”
"This is him. This is the one."

1340
01:12:55,527 --> 01:12:57,085
没有
No.

1341
01:12:57,429 --> 01:13:00,421
好，  那你为什么不出去玩呢？
Okay, then why aren't you out there, you know, enjoying yourself?

1342
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:01,760
我有啊
I am.

1343
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,698
-你有？ -对
-You are? -Yes.

1344
01:13:04,469 --> 01:13:06,767
我现在与一个叫凯文的约会
Right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.

1345
01:13:07,372 --> 01:13:08,999
-凯文 -凯文
-Kevin. -Kevin.

1346
01:13:09,073 --> 01:13:10,370
凯文他妈的是谁啊？
Who the hell's Kevin?

1347
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:13,775
哪来的…你怎么从来没提过他？
Where did... How come you never, you know, mentioned anything about him?

1348
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:15,813
我现在不是在提
I'm mentioning him now.

1349
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:19,708
天啊！他们这有新鲜的薄荷茶 我最爱薄荷茶了
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea. I love fresh mint tea.

1350
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:21,479
我爱啤酒
I love beer.

1351
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:25,883
那要看“是”的定义为何了
It depends upon what the meaning of the word "is" is.

1352
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:31,088
若意思是“是没有” 这句话完全的真实
If it means "there is none" that is a completely true statement.

1353
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,038
(BEEPS)

1354
01:13:38,136 --> 01:13:39,569
嘿，  是艾波
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hey, this is April.

1355
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:42,504

1356
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,002
(BEEPS)

1357
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:47,975
哈罗，  希望这是对的号码 听起来像是你的声音
Hello. I hope this is the right number. It sounds like you.

1358
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:49,946
我是艾蜜莉！
It's Emily!

1359
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:50,884
(LAUGHS)

1360
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:53,811
我人在纽约，  我在想
I'm in New York, and I was thinking

1361
01:13:53,885 --> 01:13:57,184
或许我们可以喝杯咖啡、叙叙旧
maybe we could get a cup of coffee and catch up.

1362
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:59,622
我的号码是…
My number...

1363
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,060
(BEEPS)

1364
01:14:00,925 --> 01:14:04,861
嘿，  是艾波，  我还是需要跟你聊 请回电
Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you. Please call me back.

1365
01:14:04,929 --> 01:14:06,726
别逼我过去扁你
I mean, don't make me come over there and hurt you.

1366
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,693
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

1367
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:12,125
好啦，  我来了
Okay, I'm coming!

1368
01:14:13,137 --> 01:14:14,968
天啊，  来了
God, I'm coming.

1369
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,803
嗯，  知道了
Yeah, I get it.

1370
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:23,180
你在里面干嘛？
What are you doing in there?

1371
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:26,109
-你就穿这样？ -什么？
-Is this what you're wearing? -What?

1372
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:29,551
是你的生日派对，  大家都在等你
It's your birthday party. Everybody is waiting for you.

1373
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:31,111
天啊
Oh, Christ.

1374
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:33,350
五分钟，  好吗？五…
Five minutes, okay? Five...

1375
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,719
(CRASHING)

1376
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,794
-我摔倒了 -没事吧？
- I'm down. -Are you okay?

1377
01:14:37,862 --> 01:14:40,524
嗯，  我只需要躺一下
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.

1378
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,977
(GROANS)

1379
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:44,398
看来你有在吃面
I see you've been eating noodles.

1380
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:49,964
嘿，  大家，  他到了！
Hey, everybody, he's here!

1381
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,695
(ALL CHEERING)

1382
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,138
谢了
Thanks.

1383
01:14:57,949 --> 01:14:59,439
嗨
Hi.

1384
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:04,955
我的天！我没想到你也来了！
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!

1385
01:15:05,023 --> 01:15:07,321
怎么能错过你生日 我们特地从华府赶来的
I couldn’t miss your birthday. We came all the way up from Washington.

1386
01:15:07,392 --> 01:15:09,360
生日快乐，  帅哥
Happy birthday, gorgeous.

1387
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:11,957
这可是个漂亮的女人
That is a beautiful woman right there.

1388
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,657
你曾有机会的
You had your chance, pal.

1389
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:15,289
海约
Hayes.

1390
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:22,029
过来
Come on.

1391
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:22,976
(RUSSELL LAUGHING)

1392
01:15:24,676 --> 01:15:28,112
-见到你真好 -嗯，  你看来…
-It's great to see you. -Yeah. You look...

1393
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:30,147
像游民，  我知道
Homeless, I know.

1394
01:15:30,848 --> 01:15:33,180
-凯莉呢？ -她在那边
-Where's Kelly? -She's right over there.

1395
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:36,049
这是她在生宝宝后第一次出来玩
It's her first night out since the baby was born.

1396
01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:38,915
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1397
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:43,890
伊朗军售、石油换武器，  没问题
Iran-Contra. Arms for oil, no problem.

1398
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:47,591
但一点点“嘴上功夫”就面临弹劾
But a little "oralness" and you're headed for impeachment.

1399
01:15:48,566 --> 01:15:51,262
-不谈政治 -或许他该被弹劾
-No politics! -Maybe he should be impeached.

1400
01:15:51,336 --> 01:15:53,930
等等、等等！那话是他说的吗？
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?

1401
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:56,997
-为什么不该？我相信他，  我们都是 -你爱他
-Why not? I put my faith in him. We all did. -You love him.

1402
01:15:57,075 --> 01:15:58,702
我以为他跟其他那些小丑不同
I thought he was gonna be different than the other jokers,

1403
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:01,540
但他连“是”这个字都无法定义
but this guy, he can't even define the word "is."

1404
01:16:02,513 --> 01:16:06,176
要是他们给他像“事实”这种字呢？
What happens if they give him one of the hard words, like "truth"?

1405
01:16:06,918 --> 01:16:09,318
-我还是会选他 -想都不用想
-I'd vote for him again. -In a heartbeat.

1406
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:14,347
威尔很好玩
Will's a lot of fun.

1407
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,689
嗯，  不如我们将澡缸放满水 然后再将烤面包机丢进去
Yeah, let's fill up the tub and drop in a toaster.

1408
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:18,661
应该很好玩吧
That should be a good time.

1409
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:26,000
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

1411
01:16:31,709 --> 01:16:35,475
祝亲爱的威尔生日快乐
Happy birthday, dear Will

1412
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:39,812
-他呢？威尔呢？ -不知道，  刚刚还在跟他说话
-Where is he? Where's Will? -I don't know. I was just talking to him.

1413
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:59,663
你错过了你的生日蛋糕
You missed your birthday cake.

1414
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:00,198
Uh-oh.

1415
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:02,962
-是我烤的 -你烤的
And I baked it. -You baked it.

1416
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,541
你还记得那首歌吗？
Do you remember that song?

1417
01:17:07,612 --> 01:17:09,512
在你的公寓？
In your apartment?

1418
01:17:09,847 --> 01:17:13,510
以朋友的身分前来
Come as you are, as a friend

1419
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:15,916
以宿敌
As a known enemy

1420
01:17:15,987 --> 01:17:19,889
-是“记忆”不是“宿敌” -我知道、我知道、我知道
-"Memory," not "enemy." -I know, I know, I know.

1421
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:24,220
-有人喝多了 -我没有
-Somebody had too much to drink. -No, I didn't.

1422
01:17:24,295 --> 01:17:26,024
我没有、我没有、我没有
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.

1423
01:17:26,097 --> 01:17:28,065
-有，  你有 -我有
-Yes, you did. -I did.

我喜欢你
Is that I like you.

我一直都喜欢你
I've always liked you.

“喜欢”
"Like."

1432
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:04,390
好可悲、好逊的字眼
That's pathetic. It's so puny.

1433

另一方面，  “爱”…
"Love" on the other hand...

听到这种字眼你一定会吓跑
You'd run away from a word like that.

-Why didn't you ever tell me? -Come on.

1438

你知道我为什么没跟你说 你根本不会看上我
You know exactly why I never told you. You'd never be interested in me.

你好好的时候为什么不跟我说？
Why couldn’t you have told me when you had your shit together?

艾波，  从你口中听到这句还真有趣
That's interesting, coming from you, April.

1448

你想做什么都可以，  但却在书店打工
You could do anything on earth, and you work in a bookstore.

是怎样？

1452
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:35,592
或许你该去寻求些咨询
but maybe you should go out there and, you know, get some help.

1453
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,753
去参加复健或重建人生之类的
Go to rehab or life rehab or something like that.

1454
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:40,491
我不清楚是否有这种东西 但若有的话…
I don't even know if they have that sort of thing, but if they did...

是很复杂，  对吗？
It is complicated, isn't it?

1463
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:29,536
你爱艾波，  她曾爱过卢卡斯
I mean, you're in love with April, who used to be in love with Lucas,

1464
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:32,174
后来爱上你时，  你却爱夏曼
and then she fell in love with you, but you were in love with Summer,

1465
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,946
她却一直爱著汉普顿
who was always really in love with Hampton.

你现在爱上艾波时，  她又爱凯文
And now that you're in love with April, she's in love with Kevin.

01:38:37,434 --> 01:38:39,129
你老是说人们太高估婚姻
You always said marriage was overrated.

是啊，  你从来就不听我的 每次都在买戒指

跟凯文总是少了什么

说来话长
That's the difficult part to explain.

送不出手，  而我也不知道为什么
I couldn’t. And I don't know why.

我有次带过去，  我试了，  凯文也在…
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried. Kevin was there and...

嘿，  没有藉口，  我很抱歉
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.

1736
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:34,644
不可原谅
It's inexcusable.

1737

-你该走了，  威尔 -艾波？

你该走了
I think you should go.

1739
01:40:59,042 --> 01:41:02,341
你没给她？这么久都没给她？
You never gave it to her? After all that time?

1740
01:41:02,412 --> 01:41:04,346
-我知道 -那是她爸爸给她的
- I know. I know. -But it was from her dad.

I know. I know.

1742
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:08,741
然后你就这样走了？
And then you just left?

1743
01:41:09,752 --> 01:41:11,310
没错
Yep.

1744
01:41:12,589 --> 01:41:15,786
为什么除了她之外其他人都化名？
How come you changed all the names except hers?

1745
01:41:15,859 --> 01:41:16,985
什么意思？
What do you mean?

但你没有改艾波的名字，  为什么？
But you didn't change April’s name. Why?

1749
01:41:29,506 --> 01:41:33,602
你为什么对这些这么感兴趣？
Why are you so concerned with all of this anyway?

1750
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:36,142
因为我希望你快乐

她说跟凯文少了什么
She said something was missing with Kevin,

1757
01:42:15,018 --> 01:42:17,646
意思就是跟你却没有缺少
which means it might not be missing with you,

1758
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,484
-这样是好事，  对吗？ -可能吧
-which is good news, right? -CouId be.

那是我的女儿，玛雅
That would be my daughter, Maya.

1773
01:43:16,879 --> 01:43:19,177
这样不算是做弊吗？带你女儿来？
That's kind of cheating, isn't it? Bringing your daughter?

1774
01:43:19,249 --> 01:43:21,217
现在我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do now?

1775
01:43:22,518 --> 01:43:24,509
你可以放我们进去啊

她在对讲机听到我们的对话 就会放我们进去
she would have heard through the intercom and let us in,

1803
01:44:54,344 --> 01:44:55,902
或是跑下楼说…
or run down the stairs and say...

1804

什么故事？
What story?
