1
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,120
好，来吧，专心
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,560
速度，我就是速度
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,000
一位冠军，42位失败者
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,630
我会把失败者当早餐吃掉的
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,180
早餐
Breakfast.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,340
稍等，也许我已经吃过早餐了
Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast.

7
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,110
稍微休息一下也不错\n不不不，专注，加速
A little breck-y could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,050
疾上加疾，快上加快
I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,710
我就是“闪电”！
I am lightning!

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,150
喂，“闪电”，准备好了吗
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,960
喔耶，“闪电”已经准备好了
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

12
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,980
哦，我有话要讲

13
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,330
咔嚓！
Ka-chow!

14
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,120
片名：汽车总动员
Cars 2006

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,510
卖天线球喔
Get your antenna balls here!

16
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,250
冲啊，“闪电”！
Go, Lightnin'!

17
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,320
- 哇喔！\n- 说的没错，伙计
- Whoo! - You got that right, slick.

18
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,160
欢迎回到狄纳哥400
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

19
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,860
我是鲍伯凯特拉斯\n以及我的好友岱洛卡崔普
I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

20
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,920
赛车史上一场至关重要的比赛正在进行之中
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,030
鲍伯，我的油压现在高到不行
Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof.

22
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,700
如果再继续这样剌激下去\n我就得被拖吊出去了！
If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

23
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,830
没错，岱洛
Right, Darrell.

24
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,540
三位选手以平分的方式
Three cars are tied for the season points lead,

25
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,700
进入今年的总决赛
heading into the final race of the season.

26
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,550
赢得这场比赛的人\n不仅得到年度总冠军，更将得到活塞杯
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.

27
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,310
绰号“国王”的选手史崔普惠特
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

28
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,790
会在退役之前再得到一项冠军吗？
have one more victory in him before retirement?

29
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,450
他一向都是狄纳哥的常胜将军
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!

30
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,720
他能否再赢一次活塞杯呢？
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

31
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,160
像往常一样\n别忘了第二名的选手奇克希克斯
And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

32
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,750
他的整个职业生涯\n都一直紧咬着“国王”不放
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.

33
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,990
奇克认为今年时机已到
Chick thought this was his year.

34
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,830
也许他可以从“国王”的阴影下走出来
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.

35
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,960
但他意想不到的是\n“闪电”麦坤！
But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen!

36
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,670
我想大家都没预料到这种情况
You know, I don't think anybody expected this.

37
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,370
赛季开始时麦坤只是个无名小卒
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.

38
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,940
但现在没有人不认识他了
But everyone knows him now.

39
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,080
他会成为第一个赢得\n活塞杯的新人并入主迪纳哥吗？
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

40
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,750
传奇“国王”，凶猛“路霸”，新人“闪电”！
The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!

41
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,690
三辆赛车，一个冠军！
Three cars, one champion!

42
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,360
你休想！
No you don't.

43
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,070
嘿！
Hey!

44
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,950
开得太棒了！
What a ride!

45
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,550
追上去，麦坤！\n追上去！
Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em!

46
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,190
我爱你，“闪电”！
I love you, Lightning!

47
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,920
迪纳哥是我的！
Dinoco is all mine.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,930
第三个弯脚处有麻烦了！
Trouble, turn three!

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,230
- 看你怎么过来，麦坤\n- 领先者的后面发生了大碰撞
- Get through that, McQueen. - Huge crash behind the leaders!

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,990
等等，岱洛\n麦坤冲进了混乱之中
Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.

51
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,890
他不可能穿过那里的！
There's no way the rookie can make it through!

52
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,190
他会被撞烂的
Not in one piece, that is.

53
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,510
耶！
Yeah!

54
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,550
“闪电”！喔！
Lightning! Oh!

55
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,920
快看啊！麦坤冲出来了
Look at that! McQueen made it through!

56
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,460
“闪电”麦坤又一次上演精彩表演
A spectacular move by Lightning McQueen!

57
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,650
耶！咔嚓！
Yeah! Ka-chow!

58
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,990
“闪电”！“闪电”！“闪电”！
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

59
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,030
耶，麦坤！咔嚓！
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

60
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,330
当大家都进入维修站的时候
While everyone heads into the pits,

61
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,160
只有麦坤留在赛道上保持领先
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,230
别把我拖出去，教练\n我还能比赛！
Don't take me out, coach. I can still race!

63
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,450
觉得怎么样？漂亮吧
What do you think? A thing of beauty.

64
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,450
- 麦坤出来了！\n- 什么？
- McQueen made it! - What?

65
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,570
他没有进站！
He's not pitting!

66
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,780
你们得让我出去\n快点！我要去追他！
You gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there!

67
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,620
麦坤没有进站！
McQueen's not going into the pits!

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,250
这个新人解雇了他的领队\n这赛季的第三个了！
The rookie fired his crew chief. The third this season!

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,620
- 看起来他喜欢单干\n- 冲，冲啊！
- Says he likes working alone. - Go, go!

70
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,920
看来奇克在维修站里耽误了不少时间
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
对呀，像这样的的停站\n他有的路要赶了
Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up.

72
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,870
准备好，伙计们\n比赛要重新开始了
Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!

73
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,850
让开，让开，让开！
Come on, come on, come on!

74
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,320
我们需要换胎！\n伙计们，快点！
We need tires now! Come on, let's go!

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,100
- 不，不，不，不！不要换胎，只要加油\n- 什么？
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! - What?

76
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,290
你需要新轮胎呀，白痴！
You need tires, you idiot!

77
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,610
看来麦坤今天只加油就好了
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

78
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,110
对呀，又不换轮胎
Right. No tires again.

79
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,870
通常那只会给你带来短暂的优势\n但之后会害了你的
That's a short-term gain, long-term loss,

80
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,610
不过看起来这对麦坤不适用\n嘿，看来他比我们懂的还多
but it's workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.

81
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
快结束了，岱洛，比赛剩下最后一圈\n麦坤领先了一大截
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

82
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,890
他的冠军已经手到擒来了\n可以把啦啦队叫出来欢呼了吧！
He's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,260
我们有一个新冠军了！
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

84
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,970
终点线，我来啦！
- Checkered flag, here I come!

85
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,030
糟糕！麦坤爆胎了！
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

86
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,840
只剩最后一个弯，他到的了吗？
And with only one turn to go! Can he make it?

87
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,470
你这个笨蛋！
- You fool!

88
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,320
麦坤爆胎了！他爆胎了！
McQueen's blown a tire! He's blown a tire!

89
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,880
快追快追！
Go, go, go!

90
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,790
他又爆了另一个胎！
He's lost another tire!

91
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,100
- “国王”和“路霸”快速拉近距离！\n- 他们一起进入三号弯脚
- King and Chick come up fast! - They're entering turn three!

92
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,030
加油
Come on.

93
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,140
真是难以置信，鲍伯！
I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

94
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,740
“闪电”麦坤和他的活塞杯奖座只差一百尺！
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

95
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,080
“国王”和“路霸”过了四号个弯
The King and Chick rounding turn four.

96
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,220
最后一段了\n冠军是...冠军是
Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's...

97
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,090
- 太紧凑了，相差太小了\n- 简直不敢相信！
- It's too close to call! Too close! - I don't believe it!

98
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,530
“闪电”！
Lightning!

99
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,820
- 最最引人入胜，最最精彩的...\n- 真不敢相信！
- The most spectacular, amazing... - I don't believe it!

100
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,360
史上最精彩的结局！
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!

101
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,460
- 我们都不知道谁获得了冠军！\n- 看啊！
- And we don't know who won! - Look at that!

102
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,180
- 这太接近了\n- 能再放一遍吗？
- That's very close to call. - Can we play that again?

103
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,450
嘿，不准拍照！出去！
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

104
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,060
我们在冠军通道等待最终结果
We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results.

105
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,590
麦坤，刚才你不换车胎实在是太大胆了
McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires.

106
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,650
你倒是说说
Tell me about it!

107
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,390
你会不会后悔\n你没有维修团队呢
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?

108
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,900
喔，可莉\n赛车不是只顾输赢就好的
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning.

109
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,870
如果我轻易的领先一整圈夺冠\n那还有什么意思
I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that?

110
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,870
我要给观众们剌激感呀
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

111
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,070
- 剌激？\n- 我会后悔没有维修队吗？
- Sizzle? - Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

112
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,300
不，当然不会\n因为我自己一人就搞定了
No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show.

113
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,810
什么？喔，好吧
What? Oh, yeah, right.

114
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,940
真有自信的“闪电”麦坤
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.

115
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,640
从终点线为您带来的时况转播\n我是可莉特布瓦茨
Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.

116
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,410
- 喂，闪开\n- 嘿，查克
- Get outta the shot. - Yo, Chuck.

117
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,180
查克你在干嘛？\n你挡住摄影机了！
Chuck, what are you doing? You're blockin' the camera!

118
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
- 大家都想看闪电\n- 什么？
- Everyone wants to see the bolt. - What?

119
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
- 退后退后\n- 就是这样！快，伙计们
- Now, back away. - That's it! Come on, guys.

120
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,050
- 唉呀，你们这是干嘛\n- 我们不干了你！自己一人搞定吧
- Whoa, team! Where are you going? - We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

121
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,830
喔喔，随便吧
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

122
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,670
要再找到一个能\n帮我加油的人很难吗？
How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas?

123
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,710
- 再见，查克\n- 我不叫查克！
- Adios, Chuck! - And my name is not Chuck!

124
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,440
哦，随便吧
Oh, whatever.

125
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,530
喂，麦坤！叫你呢，麦坤！
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

126
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,910
刚才的比赛可真漂亮啊
Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there.

127
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,210
- 我是说我！\n- 嗯，好吧
- By me! - Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,810
- 太棒了！\n- 欢迎来到奇克时代！
- Zinger! - Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

129
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,550
不过活塞杯是我的，伙计，是我的
The Piston Cup... It's mine, dude. It's mine.

130
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,180
我觉得迪纳哥蓝蛮适合我的，迪纳哥蓝！
Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

131
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,090
你做你的白日梦吧，“雷”先生
In your dreams, Thunder.

132
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,260
哈，没错，“雷”？\n他干嘛叫我“雷”？
Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

133
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,170
喔，你知道\n打雷一向都是在闪电之后啊
You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning.

134
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,030
咔乒！咔乓！
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

135
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,540
- 你们谁了解雷吗？\n- 不清楚
- Who knew about the thunder thing? - I didn't.

136
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,300
- 我们要闪电！\n- 这就对了！
- Give us the bolt! - That's right.

137
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,840
往右转，对着镜头
Right in the lens.

138
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,170
- 伙计，秀一下闪电！\n- 笑一个，麦坤！
- Show me the bolt, baby! - Smile, McQueen!

139
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,540
- 秀一下闪电，麦坤！\n- 就是这样！
- Show me the bolt, McQueen! - That's it!

140
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,310
比赛结果太接近了\n迪纳哥以你为荣
That was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud.

141
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,380
谢谢你，“国王”
Thank you, King.

142
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,220
泰仕，这些年你一直对我很好
Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years.

143
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,660
我只是尽全力去比赛而已
It's the least I could do.

144
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,960
不管结果怎样\n你永远都是我的冠军
Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.

145
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,830
谢了，亲爱的\n没有你我什么都做不成
Thanks, dear. Wouldn't be nothing without you.

146
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,600
咔嚓！
Kch-i-ka-chow!

147
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,330
- 我是蜜亚\n- 我是蒂亚
- I'm Mia. - I'm Tia.

148
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,670
我们是你的头号粉丝！\n咔嚓！
We're, like, your biggest fans! Ka-chow!

149
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,240
我爱做自己！
I love being me.

150
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,410
- 好了，女孩们，可以了\n- 我们爱你，“闪电”！
- OK, girls, that's it. - We love you, Lightning!

151
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,220
小子，你真是个胆大的选手
Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.

152
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,850
噢，“国王”先生你好
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

153
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
你拥有的天份是其它选手
You got more talent in one lug nut

154
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,350
一辈子都得不到的
than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.

155
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,020
- 是吗？这个...\n- 可是你太笨了
- Really? Oh, that... - But you're stupid.

156
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,660
- 什么？\n- 小子，赛车不是独角戏
- Excuse me? - This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

157
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,830
你得变聪明点\n去找个好的团队
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.

158
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,930
没有好的团队帮你\n你是不可能赢的
You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you,

159
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,300
你要让他们做好他们的工作
and you let them do their job, like they should.

160
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,110
- 就像我告诉孩子们在商店里\n- 好的团队
- Like I tell the boys at the shop... - A good team.

161
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,080
没错
- Yeah...

162
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,380
咔嚓！咔乓！
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

163
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,170
哦，“闪电”！
Oh, Lightning!

164
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,450
你要是能解决这些问题\n就会变得更好了
If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.

165
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,140
嗯，好吧，谢谢你的关心与建议
Oh, yeah, that... That is spectacular advice.

166
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,650
谢谢你，“国王”先生
Thank you, Mr. The King.

167
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,810
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,120
今天是活塞杯历史上，我们第一次
for the first time in Piston Cup history...

169
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,890
一个新手赢得活塞杯
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.

170
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,350
没错！
Yes!

171
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,370
...结果是三人平手
... we have a three-way tie.

172
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,070
嘿，麦坤\n很尴尬吧
Hey, that must be really embarrassing.

173
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,810
不过我不会想太多的\n因为尴尬的不是我，哈哈
But I wouldn't worry about it. Because I didn't do it!

174
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,280
主办单位决定三位平手的选手
Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race

175
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,580
一个礼拜后在加州进行殊死赛
between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.

176
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,090
谢谢！谢谢你们！谢谢！
Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you!

177
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,860
小子，看谁先到加州谁就可得到迪纳哥
Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself.

178
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,900
不，不是我\n你才酷
No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that!

179
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,400
喔耶！太棒了
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

180
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,600
嗯！好吧！
Yep! All right! Got it!

181
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,130
谁先到加州谁就得到迪纳哥
"First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."

182
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,840
我倒要来看看是谁先到，奇克
Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick.

183
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,010
嗯？
Huh?

184
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,420
- 小子，恭喜你得到平手\n- 别说了
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie. - I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,350
我们走吧，麦大叔\n你把我的车厢拿到哪去了？
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer?

186
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,620
- 我把它停在你的赞助商的蓬子里了\n- 什么？
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent. - What?

187
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,680
你得去那边露个脸
Gotta make your personal appearance.

188
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,320
不不不，不要啊
No. No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,860
是的是的\n我是闪电麦坤
Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here.

190
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,560
我用“除锈灵”保险杠防锈药膏
And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

191
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,330
“除锈灵”保护你已经生锈的保险杠不再锈下去
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.

192
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,170
哇，看看这个光泽！
Wow! Look at that shine!

193
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,970
用“除锈灵”你也可以跟我一样亮
Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!

194
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,310
咔嚓！
Ka-chow!

195
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,570
我在沼泽地见过这辆车
I met this car from Swampscott.

196
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,710
他已经锈到不成个样子了
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.

197
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,660
你从车顶都可以看到他的底盘了
- You could see his dirty undercarriage.

198
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,960
唉，我恨生锈的车子\n这有损我的形象
I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image.

199
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,430
至少他们帮你出了赞助费\n你必须帮他们打广告
They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.

200
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,400
拜托别说了行吗？\n去把车厢接起来吧
Oh, will you stop, please? Just go get hooked up.

201
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,430
- 冬天是个可怕的东西\n- 不用猜测，不用怀疑
- Winter is a grand old time. - Of this there are no ifs or buts.

202
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,940
不过记住，所有的盐份和污渍
But remember, all that salt and grime...

203
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,980
会把你的螺丝锈掉，也会把你冻坏
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

204
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,010
嘿，你们看，他来了
Hey, look! There he is!

205
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,050
我们的准冠军！
Our almost champ!

206
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,780
快过来坐
Get your rear end in here.

207
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,880
“闪电”麦坤，你真是太快了
Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!

208
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,110
- 这种比赛小意思\n- 你是真正的冠军！
- That race was a pisser! - You were booking!

209
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,250
- 拜托让让路\n- 你是我的偶像！
- Give me a little room. - You're my hero!

210
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,150
我知道
Yes, I know.

211
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,780
谢谢，弗列德
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

212
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,450
他知道我名字！他知道我名字！
He knows my name. He knows my name!

213
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,490
你气色不错啊，弗列德
Looking good, Freddie!

214
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,030
谢谢你，“闪电”，今年我们业绩好多了
Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!

215
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,630
我们的盈余还可帮你买个车头灯
We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.

216
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,730
你是说他没有车头灯？
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

217
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,140
对呀，他的车头灯其实是贴纸
That's what I'm telling ya. They're stickers!

218
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,200
好吧，你们应该知道\n赛车是不需要车头灯的
Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights,

219
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,270
因为赛场永远都是亮的
because the track is always lit.

220
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,540
我的兄弟们和你不一样\n他们还是要头灯
Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights.

221
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,220
- 女士们先生们\n- “闪电”麦坤
- Ladies and gentlemen, - Lightning McQueen!

222
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,130
自由鸟乐队！
Free Bird!

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,530
“除锈灵保险杠药膏”赛车队
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team

224
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,460
今天跑了一场漂亮的比赛
ran a great race today.

225
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,200
记得喔，用“除锈灵”
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

226
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,470
以及非常好的运气
And an insane amount of luck,

227
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,070
你也可以跟我一样亮\n咔嚓
...you too, can look like me. Ka-chow.

228
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,180
- 嘿，小子\n- 我们爱你
- Hey, kid. - We love ya.

229
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,720
期待明年和你的合作
And we're looking forward to another great year.

230
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,080
就像今年一样！
Just like this year!

231
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,960
那是不可能的事
Not on your life.

232
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,750
- 不要像我兄弟一样开车\n- 没错，不要想他那样！
- Don't drive like my brother! - Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

233
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,820
加州，我们来了
California, here we come!

234
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,590
迪纳哥，我们来了！
Dinoco, here we come!

235
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,340
喔，唔，我正好需要这个，喂？
Oh... oh... uh, I needed this. Hello?

236
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,010
这是世上最快的赛车“闪电”麦坤吗？
Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?

237
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,210
这是世上最棒的经纪人哈夫吗？
Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?

238
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,050
能当你的经纪人真是我的荣幸
And it is such an honor to be your agent

239
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,150
我都不太好意思要抽你10%的佣金
that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings.

240
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,320
总之，真是场漂亮的比赛
Merchandising. And ancillary rights in perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!

241
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,890
我没，我自己没看到比赛\n不过我听说你表现得非常棒
I didn't see it, but I heard you were great.

242
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,090
谢了，哈夫
Thanks, Harv.

243
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,830
对了，主办单位给你20张殊死赛的入场卷
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.

244
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,600
我会帮你分发给你的朋友们\n把名字告诉我
I'll pass 'em on to your friends. Shoot me the names.

245
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,800
- 你得让我为你服务\n- 没错，朋友
- You let Harv rock it for you, baby. - Right. Friends.

246
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,810
是啊，嗯...
Yes, there's...

247
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,340
好的，我知道了，“大明星”
OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.

248
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,540
你太受欢迎朋友多到数不清\n等你到了那里
So many you can't even narrow it down. Hey, when you get to town,

249
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,780
你得多花点时间陪你的朋友
you better make time for your best friend!

250
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,020
和你老友吃顿饭什么的
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!

251
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,150
对啊，那一定很好玩，我们可以
That'd be great! We should totally...

252
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,990
好了，我要挂了\n再跟我联络吧，拜拜
OK, I gotta jump, kid. Let me know how it goes. I'm out.

253
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,320
什么？旅行车
What? A minivan?

254
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,100
拜托，麦大叔\n你开得太慢了
Come on, you're in the slow lane.

255
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,500
你现在载的可是“闪电”麦坤耶
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.

256
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,100
我想停下来喘口气，孩子
Just stopping off for a quick breather, kid.

257
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,610
- 老麦需要休息休息\n- 这可不行
- Old Mack needs a rest. - Absolutely not.

258
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,410
我们要熬夜开到加州\n我们说好了的
We're driving all night till we get to California. We agreed to it.

259
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,680
熬夜？你知道交通部规定不可
All night? May I remind you federal DOT regs state...

260
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,810
拜托，麦大叔\n我要赶在“路霸”前到加州
Come on, I need to get there before Chick and hang with Dinoco.

261
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,980
看那些睡得正熟的卡车们
All those sleeping trucks.

262
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,790
小子，我不知道我撑不撑得下去
Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.

263
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,290
你可以的，麦大叔，没问题
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

264
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,690
我会陪你一起熬夜
Look, it'll be easy. I'll stay up with you.

265
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,630
- 整晚吗？\n- 是的，整晚
- All night? - All night long.

266
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,050
呃！
Uh!

267
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,650
阿嚏！
Ah-choo!

268
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,750
- 喂，DJ\n- 干嘛？
- Hey, yo, D.J. - What up?

269
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,840
这老头在打瞌睡呢
- We got ourselves a nodder.

270
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,730
美妙的音乐
Pretty music.

271
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,200
靖狗，变个线
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

272
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,760
- 在你后面\n- 耶！
- Right back at ya! - Yeah!

273
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,930
- 啊，不小心错过了\n- 你要去渡假啊？
- Oops! I missed. - You going on vacation?

274
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,690
- 喔，不！\n- 他要打喷嚏啦！
- Oh, no, Snot Rod... - He's gonna blow!

275
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,590
阿...阿...阿嚏！
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

276
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,960
祝你健康！
Gesundheit!

277
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,130
实在不该在困的时候开车的
One should never drive while drowsy.

278
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,640
呃！啊！
- Uh! Ah!

279
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,120
麦大叔！
Mack!

280
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,360
麦大叔！
Mack!

281
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,560
麦大叔！
Mack!

282
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,470
嘿，麦大叔！麦大叔！
Hey, Mack! Mack!

283
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,130
麦大叔！
Mack!

284
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,740
麦大叔，等等我！
Mack, wait for me!

285
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,550
麦大叔！
Mack!

286
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,200
麦大叔！麦大叔！
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,850
麦大叔！麦大叔...
Mack! Mack...

288
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,380
等等！麦大叔！
...wait up! Mack.

289
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,380
麦大叔！麦大叔！
Mack! Mack!

290
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,650
什么？你不是麦大叔
What? You're not Mack.

291
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,490
麦大叔？我可不是麦大叔\n拜托，我可是皮特比尔特
Mack? I ain't no Mack! I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

292
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,490
把你的车头灯打开吧，白痴
Turn on your lights, you moron!

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
麦大叔，州际公路
Mack... The Interstate!

294
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,150
呃？
Huh?

295
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,090
在我的镇上不准你开这么快
Not in my town, you don't.

296
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,190
喔，不！
Oh, no.

297
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,820
说不定他能帮我
- Oh, maybe he can help me!

298
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,160
他在对我开枪\n为什么他要射我？
He's shooting at me! Why is he shooting at me?

299
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,600
我好多年没开这么快了
I haven't gone this fast in years.

300
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,500
我引擎快爆了
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.

301
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,910
蛇行！蛇行！蛇行！
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

302
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,670
搞什么？
What in the blue blazes?

303
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,270
他是个疯子
Crazy hot-rodder.

304
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,870
我跟你说\n每次闪第三下时就特别慢
I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower.

305
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,050
60年代对你的影响不好，对吧？
The sixties weren't good to you, were they?

306
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,660
什么？前面不是州际公路
What? That's not the Interstate!

307
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,600
啊！喔！
Ah! Oh!

308
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,970
哦！哦！哦！哦！哦！
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

309
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,410
不不不，不要啊
No, no, no, no, no, no!

310
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,900
哦！
Ow!

311
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,140
不是只有我看见吧？
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

312
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,280
- 来了！\n- 哇塞，伙计
- Incoming! - Whoa, man.

313
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,680
- 不！\n- 嘿！
- No! - Hey!

314
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,020
哇！哇！哇！哇！
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,250
我的轮胎！
My tires!

316
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,130
飞吧，史丹利！飞向自由
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

317
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,250
小子，你的麻烦大了
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

318
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,420
记者现在洛杉矶国际赛道为您实况转播
We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway

319
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,020
第一位选手“闪电”麦坤
as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen,

320
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,390
现在已经到达了
is arriving at the track.

321
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,400
他要去和赛车女郎约会的事是真的吗？
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

322
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,630
你的战略是什么？
What's your strategy?

323
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,370
怎么啦？我忘了擦我的挡泥板吗？
What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?

324
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,270
麦坤的司机到了加州，但麦坤却失踪了
McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing.

325
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,300
赛车“闪电麦坤”失踪\n而他却应该在几天后参加空前的比赛
- McQueen was reported missing. ...to race an unprecedented...

326
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,940
赞助商公开声明不知道他在哪里
Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.

327
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,380
我希望“闪电”没事\n希望他别碰上了麻烦
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.

328
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,660
不知道谁比较难找\n“闪电”麦坤或是他的维修队长
I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

329
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,820
我们一定要尽全力找到“闪电”麦坤！
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!

330
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,860
每个人都在问相同的问题\n麦坤在哪里？
They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?

331
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,000
哦，伙计
Oh, boy.

332
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,130
我在哪里？
Where am I?

333
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
- 早啊，睡美人！\n- 啊！
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty! - Ah!

334
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,000
我去烧个水你就醒过来了
Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up.

335
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,780
你想要什么都给你\n不要伤害我
Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me!

336
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,750
轮胎锁？\n为什么我的轮胎被锁上了
A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on?

337
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,780
- 发生了什么事？\n- 你真有意思
- What's going on here? Please! - You're funny.

338
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,920
我已经开始喜欢你了，我叫拖线
I like you already. My name's Mater.

339
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,420
拖线？
Mater?

340
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,430
对呀\n就像少根筋的意思
Yeah, like "tuh-mater," but without the "tuh".

341
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,770
- 你叫什么名字？\n- 你不知道我名字？
- What's your name? - You don't know my name?

342
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,830
呃...
Uh...

343
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,310
不知道...你也叫拖线？
No, I know your name. Is your name Mater too?

344
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,400
什么？
What?

345
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,240
我必须要赶去加州\n我现在在哪里？
Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I?

346
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,580
你在哪里？啊哈
Where are you? Shoot!

347
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,210
你在水乡温泉镇
You're in Radiator Springs.

348
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,690
这是一个漂亮的小镇
The cutest little town in Carburetor County.

349
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,620
噢，太棒了\n真是太棒了
Oh, great. Just great!

350
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,220
如果你觉得这样就棒的话\n你该去看看镇上其它地方
Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town.

351
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,100
说真的，我很想去看看其它地方
You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town!

352
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,130
所以你把门打开，解开我的锁
So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off,

353
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,930
我们两个一起去逛逛吧看看附近的好景点
you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene...

354
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,240
- 太棒了\n- 会是什么样的景色呢？
- Dad-gum! - How'd that be, Tuhmater?

355
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,830
- 酷！\n- 拖线！
- Cool! - Mater!

356
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,780
我不是叫你不要跟犯人说话的嘛？
What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?

357
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,340
不说话
To not to.

358
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,850
那你就快闭嘴\n把他拖去交通法庭吧
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

359
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,010
好吧，我们晚点再聊，拖线
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

360
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,950
再聊，拖线,真好笑
"Later, Mater." That's funny!

361
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,210
啊！
Ah!

362
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,990
水乡温泉镇交通法院\n现在开庭
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!

363
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,590
嘿，你刮坏了我的漆！\n我要揍扁你
Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

364
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,070
你把道路弄坏了！\n你是一辆罪恶深重的车
You broke-a the road! You a very bad car!

365
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,160
- 法西斯！\n- 共产党！
- Fascist! - Commie!

366
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,930
警官，你能不能告诉我这要开多久
Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take?

367
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,770
我必须赶去加州
I gotta get to California, pronto.

368
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,000
你的律师呢？
Where's your lawyer?

369
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,340
不知道，大概跑去大溪地了吧\n他在那边租了个渡假村
I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there.

370
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:56,540
他如果被控没有律师的话\n法院将指派一位律师给他
When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. Hey!

371
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,610
喂，有没有人想当他的律师啊？
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

372
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,320
好吧，让我来，韩大夫
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

373
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,160
起立，今天的法官是韩大夫
All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.

374
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,620
炫耀狂
Show-off.

375
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,030
祷告韩大夫对你手下留情吧
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

376
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,290
好啊
All right,

377
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,490
我想知道\n到底是谁把我的镇搞成这样
I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

378
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,470
我要把他的引擎盖拆下来
I want his hood on a platter!

379
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,200
我要把他关在牢里直到他腐烂
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that.

380
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,040
我要把他关在牢里\n直到监狱都垮下来
I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him,

381
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,770
然后把他移到另一个监狱\n直到另一个监狱也垮下来
and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot.

382
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,370
我还要
I'm...

383
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,290
把他丢出去，警长
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

384
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,720
把他丢出我的法庭\n把他赶出我的镇
I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town!

385
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,450
- 结案\n- 太好了
- Case dismissed. - Yes!

386
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,790
嘿，我这个辩护律师做得不错嘛
Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff.

387
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,330
不好意思我迟到了，法官大人
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

388
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,360
哇，保时捷，她一定是我的律师派来的
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office.

389
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,900
喂，谢谢你赶来\n不过这案子已经解决了
Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set.

390
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,400
- 他无罪释放了我\n- 他无罪释放你？
- He's letting me go. - He's letting you go?

391
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,410
对呀，你今天的工作轻松吧
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

392
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,640
你现在只要站在那边让我好好看着你
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.

393
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,270
听好，我直说吧\n我跟你一起去吃晚餐吧，咔嚓
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

394
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,310
- 什么？哦！啊！\n- 咔嚓！
- What the...? Ow! Oh! - Ka-chow!

395
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,440
- 拜托！\n- 没关系，我了解你的感受
- Please! - I know. I get that reaction a lot.

396
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,110
我常常让别人感受到前所未有的感觉
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.

397
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,850
啊！哦！
Agh! Ow!

398
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,330
不好意思，我吓到你了吗？
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

399
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,420
有一点，不过我没事
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

400
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,260
呃，我去跟法官谈谈
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

401
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,930
去吧，宝贝，不过小心点
Do what you gotta do, baby. But listen. Be careful.

402
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,700
这里的人脑袋都有点秀逗\n如果你知道我的意思
Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

403
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,770
咔嚓！
Ka-ching!

404
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,930
啊！
Ah!

405
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,010
谢谢你的忠告
I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,580
- 你好啊，拖线\n- 你好呀，莎莉
- Hey there, Mater. - Howdy, Sally.

407
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,250
- 大家好\n- 早安
- Hi, folks! - Good morning!

408
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,970
你认识她？
You know her?

409
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,020
她是镇上的律师\n也是我的未婚妻
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

410
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,080
什么？
What?

411
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,250
开玩笑的\n她只喜欢我的外表
Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body.

412
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,160
韩大夫，您今天看起来真帅\n你是不是改装了你的后照镜？
You look great. You do something different with your side view mirrors?

413
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,890
你到底想说什么，莎莉
What do you want, Sally?

414
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,330
求求你，判他修理被破坏的道路\n我们镇上需要道路啊
Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.

415
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,570
不行，我看多了他这种人，赛车
No. I know his type. Racecar.

416
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,700
这镇上最不需要的就是赛车
That's the last thing this town needs.

417
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,270
好吧，我本来不想这样，是你逼我的
OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice.

418
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,280
各位好市民，你们一定都熟悉这镇上\n令人引以为傲的历史吧
Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.

419
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,780
她又来了
Here she goes again.

420
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,550
水乡温泉镇
Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel

421
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,250
是俗称道路之母的66号公路上
strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!

422
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,120
一颗闪亮的宝石\n我们有权利也有义务
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers

423
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,190
- 照顾所有穿过这城镇的旅行者\n- 旅行者？什么旅行者？
- on our stretch of that road. - Travelers? What travelers?

424
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,430
不要理他
Ignore him.

425
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,870
可是我问你们，现在路被弄坏了\n我们要怎么照顾这些旅行者
But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers

426
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,270
如果没有路给他们开了？
if there is no road for them to drive on?

427
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,140
- 路易奇，你的店里卖什么？\n- 轮胎
- Luigi, what do you have at your store? - Tires.

428
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,700
但如果没有路可以到达你的店呢？
And if no one can get to you?

429
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,110
那我的轮胎就卖不出去\n我什么都没有了
I won't sell any... tires. I will lose everything!

430
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,010
- 芙蓉，你的店里卖什么？\n- 我卖汽油
- Flo, what do you have at your store? - I have gas.

431
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,480
- 很多汽油！\n- 好的，伙计们，听我说
- Lotsa gas! - OK boys, stay with me.

432
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,080
芙蓉，如果没有人能到达你的店加油呢？
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?

433
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,650
那我会\n被迫关店而搬走
I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town.

434
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,860
如果芙蓉关了加油站搬走了我们怎么办？
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?

435
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,490
- 没有汽油，我们也不能动了\n- 什么？
- Without gas, we're done for! - What?

436
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,400
所以你们不觉得闯祸的人\n应该负责修理吗？
Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?

437
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,700
可是唯一够强壮修路的人是大阿尔呀
The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!

438
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,000
丽姬，阿尔15年前就搬走了
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

439
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,100
那你干嘛还提他的名字？
Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?

440
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,170
哦，他能办到
Oh, he can do it.

441
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,040
没问题的，他可以修路\n他马力足够，所以你们想要他做什么？
He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do?

442
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,580
修理马路！
Fix the road!

443
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,210
- 因为我们的城镇是值得修补的！\n- 没错！
- Because we are a town worth fixing! - Yeah!

444
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,820
肃静
Order in the court!

445
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,360
看来有人帮我改变了决定
Seems like my mind has been changed for me.

446
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,420
- 好哇\n- 不要啊
- Yeah! - No!

447
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,830
判得好
Nice ruling.

448
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,060
我不邀请你共进晚餐了
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

449
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,000
哈，没关系\n你可以带贝茜去
That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.

450
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,900
哇，你可以跟贝茜共事！
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

451
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,600
我也好希望能跟她一起工作
I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.

452
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,340
贝茜？贝茜是谁？
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

453
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,510
这就是贝茜\n镇上最好的铺路机
This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

454
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,650
我现在判你做社区服务
I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.

455
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,450
你要在我的监督下修理马路
You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.

456
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,860
什么，这是什么鬼地方！
What? This place is crazy!

457
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,090
喂，我知道现在提这个不好
I know this may be a bad time right now,

458
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,160
可是你欠我三万两千元律师费
but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.

459
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,220
什么？
What?

460
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,860
我们会把贝茜接在你后面\n你要对她温柔点
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.

461
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,530
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

462
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,270
你从路的那头开始
You start there where the road begins.

463
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,640
然后到路的那头结束
You finish down there where the road ends.

464
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,880
天哪！
Holy shoot!

465
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,820
喂，喂，喂\n这样要做多久？
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?

466
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,450
只要不下雨的话\n大概五天
Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days.

467
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,680
五天？
Five days?

468
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,690
我现在应该已经在加州\n谈迪纳哥的事呢！
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!

469
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,730
那你更该赶快闭嘴开始工作
Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

470
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,290
- 把他接起来吧，拖线\n- 好的好的
- Hook him up, Mater. - Okay-dokey.

471
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,600
自由啦！
Freedom!

472
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,440
也许我该先把他接上贝茜
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie...

473
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,520
再解开锁的
...and then... then took the boot off.

474
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,390
哈呼！
Whoo-hoo!

475
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,120
再见啦，水乡温泉镇\n再见，贝茜
Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!

476
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,070
加州，我来了！耶！
California, here I come! Yeah!

477
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,430
风吹的感觉真舒服
Oh, feel that wind.

478
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,470
太棒了
Yes!

479
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,670
不不不不
No. No, no, no.

480
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,280
不不不不，没油了
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

481
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,340
我怎么会没油了
How can I be outta gas?

482
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,380
小子，我们没你想像中那么笨
Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are.

483
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,790
可，可，可是，你们怎么
But how did, how did... you...?

484
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,190
我们趁你昏迷的时候\n把你的汽油吸出来的
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.

485
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,160
- 咔嚓\n- 噢噢噢
- Ka-chow. - Ow, ow, ow, ow.

486
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,970
- 各位\n- 警长
- Gentlemen. - Sheriff.

487
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,130
嘿，警长
Hey, Sheriff.

488
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,470
- 轮胎为什么在这里？\n- [意大利语]
- Why here? - [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

489
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,030
- 他们在原来的地方比较好\n- [意大利语]
- They were better before. - Stai sempre a parlare.

490
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,980
- 戈里多\n- 小红，你能不能移过去一点
- Guido! - Red, can you move over?

491
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,880
我想看看那台性感赛车
I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.

492
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,780
你知道吗，我以前也是蛮风光的
You know, I used to be a purty good whistler.

493
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,580
当然现在不成啦
I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes

494
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,560
老，引擎积水，不中用
I get fluid built up in my engine block,

495
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,990
韩大夫说他会帮我修理\n他什么都能修
but Doc said he's gonna fix it. He can fix about anything.

496
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,290
就是这样我们才选他做法官的
That's why we made him the judge.

497
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,630
孩子，你应该听我说过了
Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

498
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,070
我可没吹牛
Now, I'm not one to brag

499
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,440
别人都大老远来看我
but people come purty far to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

500
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,930
哦！
Oh!

501
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,840
- 啊，伙计，天啊！\n- 喂，怎么了
- Aw, man, that's just great! - Hey, what's wrong?

502
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,710
我的幸运贴纸脏了
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

503
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,040
噢，没关系\n我帮你洗洗
Ah, that ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya.

504
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,810
不不不！
No, no, no!

505
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,220
不用了
That won't be necessary.

506
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,590
嘿！嘿！大家伙\n没错，就是你，红色的
Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red!

507
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,290
你能不能帮我冲洗一下呀
I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off.

508
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,720
他跑哪去了？
Where's he goin'?

509
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,240
他呀，他有点害羞嘛\n而且他很气你把他的花搞砸了
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers.

510
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,830
为什么我要受这种气

518
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,720
我高兴得想尖叫
I must scream it to the world!

519
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,030
这实在太剌激了！

- 你认识很多法拉利吗？\n- 不不不不不
- Do you know many Ferraris? - No, no, no, no, no.

524

顾客
Customers.

525
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,140

526
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,590
- 好\n- 顾客？
- OK! - Customers?

527
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,490
我知道已经过了很久，但我们排练过的
Been a long time. Remember what we rehearsed.

528
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,120
记得把你的“营业中”招牌朝向外面
Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out.

529
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,720
其它的你们都会吧\n好的，别紧张，我们开始吧
You all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

530
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,460
连恩，我没看到高速公路入口啊
Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.

531
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,940
- 米妮，我知道我们在哪里\n- 对对对，我们在一个不知名的地方
- Minny, I know exactly where we are. - Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

532
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,670

- We don't need anything, thank you. - Ask for directions to the Interstate.

537

不用问，我知道该怎么走
There's no need to ask for directions. I know where we're going.

538
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,090

- Minny, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,350
呃，其实我不知道，听着
No, not really. But listen.

571
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,050
我是“闪电”麦坤，著名的赛车\n我被强制拘禁在这里
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar. I'm being held against my will.

572
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,650
你们要帮我个忙，打给我的队员\n叫他们来教我
I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me

573
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,560
我才能赶回加州，参加活塞杯\n明白吗？
and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

574
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,790
不不不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

575
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,730
是真的啊，不骗你\n你们一定要帮我离开这儿
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

576
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,960
这个满是乡巴佬的小镇\n我的IQ在直线下降！
I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second!

577
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,130
我要变得跟他们一样了！
I'm becoming one of them!

578
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,140
别烦恼了\n他们知道我们在哪里了
OK, don't worry. They know where we are now.

579
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,970
他们会帮我们宣传的，等着瞧吧
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

580
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,910
“闪电”麦坤还是不见踪影
We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...

581
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,710
很好，自活塞杯赛事升级之后
- That's good. ...after a Piston Cup update.

582
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,690
仍然没有“闪电”麦坤\n到达加州的迹象
Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Chick arrived in California

583
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,210
今天第一辆赛车已经开始适应场地了
and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.

584
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,460
这种领先别人先到赛场的感觉真棒
It's nice to get out here before the other competitors.

585
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,300
你知道嘛，领先一步\n是个好采头
You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.

586
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,530
哈哈哈！
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

587
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,600
哈哈！
Ha-ha!

588
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,440
耶！
Yeah!

589
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,390
喂，麦坤\n别太伤心了
Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.

590
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,690
哦！
Oh!

591
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,130
我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

592
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,140
我把路修好就可以走了，对吧？
I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?

593
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,930
- 对啊，他们是这么说的\n- 好，让路让路
- That's what they done did said. - OK. Outta my way.

594
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,100
我要修路了
I got a road to finish.

595
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,350
- 他修完了\n- 修完了？
- He's done! - Done?

596
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,790
- 是啊\n- 才过一个小时而已
- Uh-huh. - It's only been an hour.

597
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,060
啊，我做完了，做完了
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

598
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,000
现在你们只要跟我道谢\n我就走人了
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way. That's all you gotta say.

599
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,260
哈！我第一个开在新路上
Whee-hoo! I'm the first one on the new road!

600
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,430
哦！
Oh!

601
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,470
看起来好丑啊
It rides purty smooth.

602
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,170
- 看上去好难看！\n- 跟你们这个镇蛮配的
- It looks awful! - Well, it matches the rest of the town.

603
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,770
哦！
- Oh!

604
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,140
小红
Red.

605
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,090
你以为你是谁啊
Who do you think you are?

606
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,460
喂，韩大夫说我做完后我就可以走的
Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal.

607
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,960
我说的是把路铺好\n不是弄得更糟
The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse.

608
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,500
把它刮起来，重铺一遍
Now, scrape it off! Start over again.

609
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,200
老爹，我可不是铲土机，我是个赛车耶
Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

610
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,760
哇喔
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

611
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,070
是吗？要不我们来个比赛怎么样？\n就我们两个
Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.

612
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,940
- 什么？\n- 我跟你，你在开玩笑吗？
- What? - Me and you. That a joke?

613
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,380
如果你赢了，你就可以走\n我自己修路
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

614
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,150
如果我赢的话\n你得照我的方式修路
If I win, you do the road my way.

615
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,740
韩大夫，你在说什么呀
Doc, what're you doin'?

616
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,950
不好意思喔
I don't mean to be rude here,

617
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,750
不过你从0到60里恐怕要开个3年半吧
but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what? Three-point-five years?

618
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,350
那我想你应该没什么好怕的吧
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

619
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:01,090
好吧，既然你这么说\n那就来比一场吧
You know what, old-timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

620
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,360
两位，这场比赛只有一圈
Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race.

621
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,930
你们要开到威利丘，绕过丘再折返回来
You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back.

622
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,940
不可以碰撞，做弊吐口水
There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin',

623
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,540
不许咬人，发飙，乱放油，推拖
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

624
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,750
不许暗箭伤人，独占道路
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

625
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,580
不许横冲直撞
and no lollygaggin'.

626
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,210
速度，我就是速度
Speed. I'm speed.

627
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,850
壮如凯迪拉克，快如宝马
Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.

628
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,890
我的梦想就是参与赛车比赛
My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop.

629
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,490
- 加油维修区！\n- 呃...
- Peet stop! - Uh...

630
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,440
伙计，这场比赛只有一圈
The race is only one lap, guys.

631
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,000
一圈而已！不需要你们的帮忙
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

632
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,910
- 有我就搞定了\n- 哼，随便你
- I work solo mio. - Fine. Race your way.

633
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,080
- 不用加油维修，了解吗？\n- 好吧
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo? - OK.

634
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,170
两位
Gentlemen...

635
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,650
发动你们的引擎
...start your engines!

636
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,790
- 都看看吧！\n- 哇
- Hijole! Check that out! - Whoa.

637
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,960
韩大夫，你的馊主意\n现在路永远修不好了
Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.

638
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,630
路易奇？
Luigi?

639
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,900
各就各位，预备，开始！
On your mark, get set...

640
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,200
为了奖金，应该秀一下了
Uno for the money, due for the show,

641
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,970
准备，难以置信，冲啊！
tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't believe it. Go!

642
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,790
嗯？
Huh?

643
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,950
韩大夫，摇旗就是说冲啊
Doc... the flag means go.

644
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,360
没错，摇旗\n我们出发吧，出发
Remember the fl... Here we go. Go.

645
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,160
韩大夫，你在干嘛
Doc, what are you doing, man?

646
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,790
真糟，看来我晚了一步
Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start.

647
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,000
不过再迟也比不跑好，走吧，拖线
Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater.

648
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,840
- 可能需要你的帮忙\n- 呃...好吧
- Might need a little help. - Uh... OK.

649
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,980
你有带拖吊工具吧？
You got your tow cable?

650
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,240
当然有啦\n为什么？
Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable. Why?

651
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,610
只是预防万一
Oh, just in case.

652
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,350
哇噢哇噢\n噢！噢！噢！噢！噢！
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

653
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,160
不不不不不！
No, no, no, no, no!

654
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,700
- 哦，天啊！\n- 哇
- Oh, man! - Whoa.

655
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,730
- 哦！\n- 够糟的吧，伙计
- Ow! - Bad trip, man.

656
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,900
嘿！这就是你说的“重”如凯迪拉克或是“笨”如宝马跑车？
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

657
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,340
我搞糊涂了
I'm confused.

658
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,510
你开车就像你修路一样
You drive like you fix roads.

659
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,780
技术真糙！玩笑开够了，拖线
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

660
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,420
啊！
Ah!

661
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,130
原来韩大夫早就知道你会失控
I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!

662
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,320
谢了，拖线，谢谢
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

663
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,370
那种小弯对我应该不算什么啊
I can make a little turn on dirt.

664
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,870
你觉得呢？
You think?

665
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,400
不，我又浪费了一天\n我是不是永远逃不出这里了！
No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!

666
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,940
嘿，放松点\n你需要新的烤漆，伙计
Hey, ese! You need a new paint job, man!

667
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,980
- 不了，谢谢\n- 有机燃料呢？
- No, thank you. - How 'bout some organic fuel?

668
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,410
- 那恶心的果汁？\n- 算了吧
- That freak juice? - Pass.

669
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,940
唔，看他工作的样子让我口干舌燥\n有没有人要喝饮料呀？
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

670
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,610
不用了，芙蓉
Nah, not me, Flo.

671
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,160
因为我是一个特殊机器
I'm on one of them there special diets.

672
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,820
我是结合速度与“空洞”的精密仪器
I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics.

673
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,660
“你开车像你修路”
"You race like you fix roads."

674
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,500
我会，给他好看！
I'll show him. I will show him!

675
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:38,180
气死我啦！
Oh, great! I hate it!

676
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,880
- 气死了！气死了！气死了！\n- 这声音真是太美妙了
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it! - Music. Sweet music.

677
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,650
也许这么做不太好
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

678
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,450
水乡温泉镇，快乐的地方！
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

679
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,550
好啊，贝茜，你觉得我很幽默吗？
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

680
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,900
好啊！我竟然和贝茜说话了！\n我和贝茜说话了！
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now! I'm talking to Bessie!

681
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,010
哇
Wow.

682
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,050
早安，莎莉
Mornin', Sally!

683
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,320
嘿，你们快来看看这条漂亮的新路\n“闪电”麦坤铺的喔
Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

684
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,420
真的耶，不可思议
Yes! Uh, amazing!

685
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,520
哇！耶！
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

686
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,800
唔，雷蒙！好久没看到你那么有精神了
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't seen you that low in years.

687
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,430
我好久没看到这么漂亮的马路了
I haven't seen a road like this in years.

688
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,630
- 我们走走吧，宝贝\n- 慢慢开
- Well, then let's cruise, baby. - Low and slow.

689
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,900
[意大利语]天啊，真漂亮！
[Italian] E bellissima! It's beautiful!

690
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,710
好像是天使们铺的路
Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels.

691
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,950
孩子们，我告诉你们
Boy, I tell you what.

692
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,850
我打赌月亮上的路都没有这条平坦
I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.

693
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,580
韩大夫，来看啊
Doc, look at this!

694
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,590
早该判他修路了吧？
Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

695
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,150
嗯，还早呢\n还有很长一段路没完成
Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.

696
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,200
看看路易奇
Guido, look at Luigi!

697
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,530
看起来太棒了
This is fantastico!

698
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,060
很好玩的样子\n拖线，换我玩啦
That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

699
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,440
喂，路易奇，这条新路\n让你的店看起来像垃圾场
Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.

700
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,810
哼，那疯婆子
That crazy old devil woman.

701
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,680
喔！
Oh!

702
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,580
她说的对！
She's right!

703
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,210
- 啊！\n- 戈里多！
- Ah! - Guido!

704
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,050
哈，那小子干得不错啊
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

705
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,120
不过，他跑哪去啦？
Well, now... where the heck is he?

706
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,200
警长，他又想偷溜了吗？
Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?

707
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,640
不不不，他做到半夜时柏油用完了
No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night,

708
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,070
他问我能不能出来这里
and asked me if he could come down here.

709
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,540
他想要再试过那个弯
All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.

710
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,450
不不不，哇呀
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

711
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,440
我一直试图在弯道跑出完美的弧线
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.

712
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,610
警长，你要不要去芙蓉那喝杯汽油
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's.

713
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:00,090
我帮你看着他
I'll keep an eye on him.

714
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,060
谢了，韩大夫\n我正觉得有点口渴
Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low.

715
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,910
这不是柏油路，这是泥路
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

716
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,710
唉，你又想要干嘛\n你是来炫耀的吗？
Oh, great. What do you want? You here to gloat?

717
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,120
在泥地里煞车没用\n你不能踩煞车
You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard,

718
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,680
你得用油门来控制\n过弯时记得放油门
break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle.

719
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,820
如果你开太快的话就会滑出去
Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.

720
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,990
原来你不只是法官，还是个赛车高手
So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.

721
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,720
我简单说吧
I'll put it simple.

722
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,960
如果你用力左转的话\n你会发现你开始往右转
If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.

723
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,440
是吗，那可真有意思\n向右转却可以向左开，谢谢！
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

724
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,310
或者我应该说，不，谢谢！
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

725
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,970
因为在一个相反的世界里\n那就代表谢谢你
Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

726
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,180
脑子有问题的老爷车
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

727
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,760
向右转却可以向左开
Turn right to go left.

728
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,020
呃...
Hmm...

729
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,160
哇！
Whoa!

730
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,970
啊！
Oh!

731
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,400
啊！这是...
- Ow! Oh, that...

732
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,340
啊！
Ow!

733
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,050
向右转却可以向左开，我试过了
Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it.

734
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,210
神奇的事发生了，我向右开了！
You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!

735
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,690
如果你总是自言自语\n人们会以为你是个疯子
You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you're crazy.

736
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,690
- 谢谢你的提醒\n- 什么，我没在同你说话
- Thanks for the tip. - What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

737
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,130
- [意大利语]\n- [意大利语]
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo! - Che cosa?

738
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,580
- 看上去太棒了！太棒了！\n- [意大利语]
- It looks great! This is great! - Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

739
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,170
哦，天啊！
Oh, Lord.

740
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,880
拖线！
Mater!

741
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,110
我想让你今晚看管那个囚犯
I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.

742
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,480
没问题，如果他又想逃跑怎么办？
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again?

743
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,390
那就让他跑到没油\n再把他拖回来
Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back.

744
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,930
- 你一定要一只眼睛紧紧盯住他\n- 是，长官
- But keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir!

745
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,690
呃...
Oh...

746
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,430
我被困在这里修这条破路
While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road,

747
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,060
“路霸”却在加州争取加入迪纳哥
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

748
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,400
我的迪纳哥！哇哇哇\n谁在碰我？
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me?

749
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,770
路易奇正在给你修理
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

750
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,870
你铺了这么好的一条路
You make-a such a nice new road.

751
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,610
如果你光顾我的店铺\n路易奇会好好招待你的
You come to my shop. Luigi take-a good care of you.

752
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,270
尽管你不是一辆法拉利
Even though you not a Ferrari.

753
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,440
如果你买四个轮胎\n我就给你免费全身修理
You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare

754
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,390
- 全部免费！\n- 瞧，我所用的所有轮胎都是免费的
- absolutely free! - Look, I get all my tires for free.

755
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,980
我喜欢你的作风，嘿
I like your style, eh?

756
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,620
你喜欢讲价，好吧\n路易奇给你提供新的套餐
You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

757
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,160
买一送三怎么样？
You buy one tire, I give you three for free!

758
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,890
你觉得怎么样？
Oh, would you look at that?

759
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,100
雷蒙，雷蒙
Ramone, Ramone!

760
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,260
路易奇再和你谈笔买卖
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.

761
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,330
不不不不，没有买卖，谢谢你
No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

762
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,040
- 不不不不不\n- 好吧，我最后的报价
- No, no, no, no. No. - This is it. My last offer.

763
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,810
买一送七！七个雪地防滑胎！
You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!

764
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,750
如果你有兴趣就来找我\n你知道我在哪里
Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.

765
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,320
啊！
Ah!

766
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,520
停下！让我...
Stop! Let me...

767
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,760
小红，你漏了一个地方\n这儿，看到了吗
Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there?

768
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,860
- 不！不！\n- 就在车前盖那里
- No! No! - On the hood right there.

769
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,270
停！停下！冷死人了
Stop, stop! That's cold!

770
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,830
快停下吧
Help! Please! Stop!

771
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,270
谢谢你，小红
Thanks, Red.

772
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,770
你为什么这么对我？
What was that for?

773
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,970
- 你到底想不想住在舒适小锥里？\n- 嗯？
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone? - Huh?

774
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,540
如果你想，你必须洗干净
If you do, you gotta be clean.

775
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:45,140
就算在这农村人的地方\n我们也有我们的准则
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.

776
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,950
什么？我...我不明白
What, I...? I don't get it.

777
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,610
我只是想感谢你所做的一切
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.

778
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,920
所以我想让你和我住在一起\n不，不是和我在一起
So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me!

779
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,620
是在那边，不是和我住在一个房间\n你住在你的房间
But there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone.

780
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,560
- 我住在我的房间\n- 等一等，你现在对我这么好
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's... - Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

781
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,030
如果你想呆在肮脏的拘留所里，没问题
If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine.

782
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,370
- 我了解你这种罪犯\n- 不不不，那很好
- I understand you criminal types. - No, no, no, no. That's OK.

783
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,640
- 舒适小锥很好\n- 这里刚刚重新装修过
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone. - It's newly refurbished.

784
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,170
把旅馆建成汽车见到会躲避的
Yeah, it's like a clever little twist.

785
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,380
警示标真是一个好主意
The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid.

786
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,820
现在我们要住在那里\n真是可笑
But now we're gonna stay in them. That's funny.

787
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,550
全是你自己想出来的，对不对？
Figure that all out on your own, did you?

788
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,990
你想来，就住在一号房间里
Cone number one, if you want.

789
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,460
哦...
Oh...

790
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,330
哦，那是不是一个细条纹的刺青？
Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?

791
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,500
呃...这只是
Oh... That's just a... Oh!

792
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,410
哦你看到了吗？我得走了
Oh, you saw that? Yeah. Just gonna be going.

793
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,110
哇塞
Gonna... Yeah.

794
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,450
我以前认识一个女孩叫桃瑞丝
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

795
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,010
非常的漂亮
Good-lookin' girl.

796
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,390
就像捷豹，唯一不同的是，她是一辆卡车
Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!

797
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,950
我总是为了和她说话而去撞她
You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her.

798
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,530
- 你到底在说什么？\n- 我也不知道
- What are you talking about? - I don't know.

799
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,730
我想到一些我们晚上可以做的有趣的事\n因为今天晚上我负责看管你
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

800
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,970
不，拖线，我要修完这条路\n然后离开这里
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.

801
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,600
好把，“我可以在泥地上转弯”先生
Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

802
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,980
这也许对你来说太难了
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

803
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,810
哦，小心一点，拖线
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

804
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
你知道你是在和“闪电”麦坤说话吗？
You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen.

805
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,290
我可以处理任何难题
I can handle anything.

806
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,190
- 我可不是说这个\n- 来吧，你会喜欢的
- I'm not doin' this. - Come on. You'll love it!

807
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,990
- 整拖拉机很好玩\n- 这真是太胡闹了
- Tractor-tippin's fun. - This is ridiculous.

808
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,500
好吧，听着
All right, listen.

809
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,560
我说开始，我们就开始\n但是别让弗兰克抓到你，开始！
When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

810
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,470
等等，谁是弗兰克?
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

811
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,440
拖线！
Mater!

812
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,940
等等，拖线！
Wait, Mater!

813
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,080
这就是你需要做的
OK, here's what you do.

814
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,550
你偷偷的走到他们面前\n然后鸣喇叭
You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk.

815
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,110
他们会做剩下的部分，瞧着吧
And they do the rest. Watch this.

816
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,990
啊！
Oh!

817
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,260
啊...啊！啊...
Oh... Oh! Oh...

818
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,300
我说吧，拖拉机真是太傻了
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

819
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,180
告诉你，没有比这更有趣的了，伙计
I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this.

820
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,840
没错，你生活在你梦想的地方，拖线
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

821
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,410
啊！
Oh!

822
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:41,080
啊！啊...
Oh! Oh...

823
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,120
我不管你是谁,你都会觉得那很有趣
I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.

824
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,960
轮到你了，兄弟
Oh, your turn, bud.

825
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,440
拖线，我可不来
Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.

826
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,730
- 宝贝\n- 我可不是宝贝
- Baby. - I'm not a baby.

827
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,280
好吧，停！停下好吗？我试试看
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK? All right. I'll do something.

828
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:19,760
啊！
Oh!

829
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,130
弗兰克来了！
That's Frank.

830
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,380
快跑！
Run!

831
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,450
他过来了，小心！
- Here he comes, look out!

832
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,080
啊！
Whoa!

833
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,060
快跑！他要逮到你了！
Run! He's gonna get ya!

834
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,510
噢！顾客！
Oh! Customers!

835
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,220
噢！
Oh!

836
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,620
啊，不不不
Ah, no, no, no.

837
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,420
哦，不！
Oof! Oh!

838
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,860
明晚我们去看幽灵之光
Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight!

839
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:01,420
- 我等不及了，拖线\n- 我告诉过你
- I can't wait, Mater. - Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

840
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,800
伙计，你必须承认那真是太有趣了
Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!

841
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,810
当然，当然
Oh, yeah... yeah.

842
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,970
我们现在应该回到拘留所里去了
Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.

843
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,240
实际上莎莉想让我住在旅馆里
You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

844
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,300
哦...
Oh...

845
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:20,650
- 我们一起住旅馆？\n- 不是，你是在开玩笑吗？
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we? - Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

846
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,990
她并不喜欢我\n我也不是很喜欢她
Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest.

847
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,960
你也许说的对\n看，莎莉在那边
Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

848
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,760
在哪？在哪？
- Where, where?

849
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,430
- 你爱上莎莉了\n- 我才没有呢
- You're in love with Miss Sally. - No, I'm not.

850
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,660
- 有的，你有\n- 我没有
- Yes, you do. - No way.

851
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,930
- 也许\n- 得了吧，瞧
- Way. - Come on, look...

852
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,440
- 你爱上莎莉了\n- 你可真成熟
- You're in love with Miss Sally! - Real mature.

853
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,130
- 你恋爱了\n- 你真的长大了
- You're in love! - Real grown up.

854
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,070
- 你爱她，你爱她\n- 等等
- You love her. You love her. - Wait...

855
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,170
你爱她！你爱她你爱她！
You love her! You love her. You love her.

856
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,770
好吧，说够了吧，拖线
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

857
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,840
- 能不能别说了？\n- 别说什么？
- Will you stop that? - Stop what?

858
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,220
倒着开，你吓到我了，万一你撞到怎么办？
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck.

859
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:58,190
撞到？我是世界上最好的倒车驾驶
Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver!

860
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,390
看我的，嘿嘿
You just watch this right here, lover boy. Wee-hee!

861
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,120
你要干什么？小心
What are you doing? Watch out! Look out!

862
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,600
拖线，拖线
Mater? Mater!

863
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,270
拖线
- Mater!

864
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,850
嘿，小心点，拖线
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

865
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,620
喔
Oof!

866
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,090
耶嘿！
Yee-hee!

867
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,420
他真是个疯子
He's nuts.

868
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,960
我不用知道我要去哪里
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

869
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,500
只要知道我在哪里就好了
Just need to know where I've been.

870
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,700
哇，太不可思议了！\n你怎么做到的？
Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?

871
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,770
反光镜，我会给你装一个，你想学我会教你
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.

872
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,070
也许在我大赛时用的着
Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.

873
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:56,670
为什么这个比赛对你来说这么重要？
What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?

874
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,920
那不仅仅是一场比赛\n我们是在说活塞杯啊！
It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup!

875
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,320
这是我一生的梦想！
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!

876
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,420
我会成为历史上唯一一个\n赢得活塞杯的新车手
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.

877
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,060
当我赢了之后，我就会得到新的赞助商
And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor,

878
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,790
还有私人直升机
with private helicopters.

879
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,130
再也不会见到保险杠清洁剂\n和老到生锈的车了
No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.

880
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,330
老到生锈的车怎么了？
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

881
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,770
我不是在说你，拖线\n我是在说其它的老爷车
Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know?

882
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,010
- 不是像你这样的，我喜欢你\n- 没关系，兄弟
- Not like you. I like you. - It's OK, buddy.

883
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:32,050
我可不可以有一天\n坐一坐你的直升飞机？
Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?

884
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,710
我总是梦想着坐一坐\n那些漂亮的直升飞机
I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters.

885
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,590
- 当然可以\n- 真的吗？
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. - You mean it?

886
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,420
当然了，你说什么都行
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

887
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:45,460
我就知道我的选择是对的！
I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!

888
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,360
什么选择？
In what?

889
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,200
我最好的朋友
My best friend.

890
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,370
明早见
See you tomorrow, buddy!

891
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,900
麦坤和莎莉停在树旁边
McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,

892
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,650
亲亲，亲亲
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!

893
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,080
哇哇哇
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

894
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:18,360
一号，一号，一号到了
Number one. Number one... Ah, number one!

895
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,860
- 啊，真不错\n- 嘿，小子
- Ah, this is nice. - Hey, Stickers.

896
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,060
- 不好意思\n- 你吓到我了，你得当心一点
- I'm sorry. - You scared me. You gotta be careful.

897
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,270
我也吓到了我自己
I scared myself scaring you scaring me.

898
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,440
- 我并不是因为害怕而害怕\n- 不，当然不是
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared. - No, of course not. No.

899
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,240
- 我只是\n- 我听到你和拖线的对话了
- I was more... - I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

900
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,040
什么时候？刚刚吗？你听到了什么？
When? Just now? What, what did, what did you hear?

901
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,110
关于坐直升飞机的事
Something about a helicopter ride.

902
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,350
没错，他非常想坐
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he?

903
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,320
- 你是认真的吗？\n- 什么？
- Did you mean it? - What?

904
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,420
- 你会让他坐你的直升飞机\n- 谁知道呢？
- That you'll get him a ride. - Who knows?

905
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,520
首先，我必须先离开这里去参加比赛
First things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.

906
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,590
呃
Uh-huh.

907
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,860
你知道吗，拖线信任你
You know... Mater trusts you.

908
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,600
好吧
Yeah, OK.

909
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,370
- 你现在说的话是认真的吗？\n- 怎么了？
- Did you mean that? - What?

910
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,070
你是想敷衍我，还是真心实意
Was it just a "Yeah, OK", or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

911
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,810
我今天已经很累了，感觉上过了很长的一天
Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.

912
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,380
好吧，晚安
Yeah, OK. G'night.

913
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,980
哦...
Oh...

914
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,250
嘿，谢谢
Hey, thank you.

915
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,220
你说什么？
What did you just say?

916
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,130
谢谢你让我住在这里
You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here.

917
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,070
这里比拘留所强多了，而且...很舒服
It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great.

918
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,700
- 新装修的，对不对？\n- 没错
- Newly refurbished, right? - Yeah.

919
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,130
- 晚安\n- 晚安
- G'night. - Good night.

920
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,840
嗯
Hmm.

921
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:01,350
你可不可以把那\n国旗音乐给关了
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

922
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:05,260
要懂得经典，这是亨德里克斯
Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix!

923
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,770
啊！
Ah!

924
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,310
不！
No!

925
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,790
不！
No!

926
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,600
我一定要离开这里
I gotta get outta here!

927
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:40,000
你见到警长了吗？\n上帝啊
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? Oh! Oh, my gosh.

928
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,330
- 你来这里干什么？\n- 吓到你了吗，城里人？
- Hey, what are you doin'? - Get a good peek, city boy?

929
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:46,900
我只是想要我今天需要的汽油
I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

930
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,100
在芙蓉那里等着，现在离开这里
Wait for him at Flo's. Get outta here.

931
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,840
我想离开这里已经有三天了
I've been trying to get outta here for three days!

932
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,410
我希望你喜欢这里
Hope you enjoyed the show!

933
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,790
韩大夫
Whoa, Doc.

934
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:13,600
该整理一下车库了
Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on.

935
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,280
什么？
What?

936
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,190
他有活塞杯？
He has a Piston Cup?

937
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,030
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

938
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,430
三座活塞杯
Three Piston Cups?

939
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,740
门上写着禁止入内
Sign says stay out.

940
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,180
你有三个活塞杯，你怎么
You have three Piston Cups. How could you have...

941
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,350
我只知道你不会开车\n我还不知道你还不识字
I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read.

942
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,450
- 你是哈德逊大黄蜂！\n- 在芙蓉那里等着，照我说的做！
- You're the Hudson Hornet! - Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

943
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,050
我真不敢相信我以前没认出你来
Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before.

944
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,860
你是最棒的哈德逊大黄蜂！
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

945
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:19,590
你还保持着一个赛季\n最多胜利场数的纪录，我们得谈谈
You used to hold the record for most wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

946
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,400
- 你一定要告诉我你的技巧\n- 我已经告诉过你了
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please. - I tried that.

947
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,200
你赢过三次冠军，看看那些奖杯
You won three times! Look at those trophies!

948
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,710
你看，我只看到一些没用的杯子
You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

949
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:39,250
做一些汽车瑜珈可以降低你的转速
You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.

950
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,120
去洗一下车吧，嬉皮士
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

951
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,420
大家快看我的丈夫\n哇！你是什么颜色？
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all! Whoo! That's your color!

952
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:48,220
- 黄色，亲爱的\n- 你看上去真性感
- Yellow, baby. - Mmm. You smokin' hot!

953
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,360
他来了
There he is.

954
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:52,420
天啊，你们知不知道韩大夫\n是一辆有名的赛车？
Oh, my gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

955
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:58,440
- 韩大夫？我们的韩大夫？\n- 不是哈德逊大黄蜂吧？
- Doc? Our Doc? - Not Doc Hudson.

956
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,100
不，那是真的！\n他是真正的赛车史上的传奇人物
No, no, no, no, it's true! He's a real racing legend.

957
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,440
他是最棒的哈德逊大黄蜂！
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

958
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,810
最棒的？我从没见过他时速超过20英里
Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.

959
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,940
你真正见过他参加比赛吗？
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

960
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,610
没有，但是我真希望我可以见到\n他们说那真是棒极了
No, but I wish I could have. They say he was amazing!

961
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:16,560
- 他赢了三个活塞杯\n- 他在他的杯里干了什么？
- He won three Piston Cups! - He did what in his cup?

962
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,960
我想这个年轻人一定是快热昏头了
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!

963
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,160
我想他已经热昏头了
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

964
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,630
他的玻璃需要镀膜了
I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.

965
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,460
- 你病了吗，伙计？\n- 的确有点像
-  Are you sick, buddy? - You are lookin' peaked.

966
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,300
他的玻璃需要镀膜了！
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

967
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:34,130
- 嘿！你干什么？\n- 没关系，你相信我，对不对？
- Hey! What are you doin'? - It's OK. You can trust me, right?

968
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,910
我当然相信你，我担心的是他
I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.

969
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,180
我相信他
Hmm... I trust him.

970
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,450
- 我们去兜兜风\n- 兜风？
- Come on, let's take a drive. - A drive?

971
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,820
没错，兜风
Yeah, a drive.

972
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:48,020
像你这样大城市里的赛车\n从来没有兜过风吗？
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?

973
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,790
呃...没有，从来没有
Ah... No. No, we don't.

974
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,120
你到底来不来？
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

975
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,120
嗯
Mm-hm!

976
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,650
- 你还以为他要逃跑\n- 嘿，你相信吗？
- And you thought he was gonna run. - Hey, can you believe it, man?

977
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:30,160
他以为韩大夫是一辆有名的赛车
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!

978
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,170
真是想的太多了！
That's so too much!

979
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,670
我们出来了，我们要去哪里？
OK, you got me out here. Where are we goin'?

980
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,730
我也不知道
I don't know.

981
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:46,600
哇！耶
Whoa! Yes.

982
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,060
哦！哈哈！
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

983
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:08,800
啊！
Bleah!

984
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,790
哦！
Oh!

985
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,790
这是什么地方？
Wow. What is this place?

986
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,860
中转中心
Wheel Well.

987
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:44,190
以前是公路旁最热闹的落脚点
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.

988
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,570
这个地方？
This place?

989
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,240
是啊，真是很难想像
Yeah, imagine.

990
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,640
想像呆在这里是什么感觉
Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.

991
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,540
我好像不是很了解你
You know, I don't get you.

992
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,850
一辆保时捷怎么会呆在这个地方？
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?

993
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,120
其实很简单，我从前
Well, it's really pretty simple. I was...

994
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:14,360
我在洛杉矶是一个律师\n生活节奏是那么的快
...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and...

995
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:17,990
是吗？你很富有吗？
Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich?

996
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,470
- 什么？\n- 只是想知道答案
- What? - Just... clues to the puzzle.

997
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,870
是的，我的生活是这样的
Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life.

998
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,700
你知道吗？
And you know what?

999
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,400
我从未感到开心过
It never felt... happy.

1000
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,140
真的吗？
Yeah. I mean... really?

1001
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,950
最后我离开了加州
Yeah. So I left California.

1002
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,320
一直开啊开，最后终于坏在了这里
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.

1003
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,850
韩大夫把我修好，芙蓉收留了我
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1004
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,920
他们都收留了我，我再也没有离开过
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1005
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,890
我理解你
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1006
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,800
需要放松一下，给你的电池充充电
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.

1007
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,600
但是过了这么长时间\n你为什么不回去
But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?

1008
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:01,030
我坠入了爱河
I fell in love.

1009
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:04,770
- 哦\n- 没错
- Oh. - Yep.

1010
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,410
- 雪佛兰？\n- 不是
- Corvette? - No.

1011
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,720
我爱上这里的景色了
I fell in love with this.

1012
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,470
哇，快看啊
Whoa. Look at that.

1013
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,670
他们只是驶过这里
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1014
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,940
他们都不知道他们错过了什么
They don't even know what they're missing!

1015
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,280
以前并不是这样的
Well, it didn't used to be that way.

1016
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,080
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

1017
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:48,060
没错，40年前，那条州际公路并不存在
Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1018
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:50,180
真的吗？
Really?

1019
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,960
是的，以前
Yeah. Back then,

1020
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:55,900
车在州之间穿行的方法\n和现在是完全不同的
cars came across the country a whole different way.

1021
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,500
你是什么意思？
How do you mean?

1022
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,970
路并不像那条州际公路一样\n直接穿过沙漠
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.

1023
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,240
路是根据地形曲折蜿蜒的
It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved.

1024
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,730
- 早上好！\n- 天气真不错
- Mornin'! - Nice day, huh?

1025
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:14,450
车不是为了使自己高兴而驾驶
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.

1026
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,080
他们是为了享受这个美好时光而驾驶
They drove on it to have a great time.

1027
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,490
然后发生了什么？
Well, what happened?

1028
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,010
为了节省10分钟的驾驶时间\n公路饶过了我们这里
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.

1029
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,770
能看到这城镇的昌盛时期该有多好
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!

1030
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,650
我都不知梦想过多少次了
Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that.

1031
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,380
终有一天我们会让它回到地图上
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.

1032
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:37,120
是啊，嘿，谢谢你带我兜风
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1033
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:39,020
我感到很高兴
I had a great time.

1034
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,820
有时慢慢开感觉还不错
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.

1035
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,630
不用谢
You're welcome.

1036
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,270
听着
Hey, listen, listen!

1037
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,440
如果有人问起我们\n就说我们去撞信箱了
If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1038
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:58,600
什么？
Wha... what?

1039
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,990
哦，漆还没有干呢
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1040
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,470
不不不，离开我的店铺
No, no, no, no! Get out of the store!

1041
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:32,140
不要吃我的轮胎，吃这些旧的轮胎
Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, take-a the snow tires.

1042
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,510
- 拖线\n- 你可有麻烦了
- Mater! - I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1043
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,610
这些拖拉机是从哪里来的？
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?

1044
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,190
- 嘿，伙计\n- 嘿！嘿！伙计
- Whoa, boy! - Hey! Hey, guys!

1045
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,220
有一个向那边去了
There's one goin' this way.

1046
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,390
我去追他
I got it.

1047
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,200
快过来，小拖拉机，快过来
Come here, little tractor, come here.

1048
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,530
真是个乖拖拉机
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1049
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,970
不不不不，过来这里
No, no, no, no, come here.

1050
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,400
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1051
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,170
你不应该在这里
You're not supposed to go wandering off all...

1052
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,840
单独闲逛
...alone.

1053
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,450
你想用这些老旧的赛车轮胎干什么？
What are you doin' with those old racin' tires?

1054
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,430
来吧，韩大夫，跑吧
Come on, Doc, drive.

1055
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,110
太棒了
Ah... Yeah.

1056
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,840
- 哇！\n- 嗯？
- Wow. - Huh?

1057
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,510
你真是太棒了
You're amazing!

1058
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,750
你要去哪？
What are you doin'?

1059
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,520
韩大夫，等一等
Doc, wait!

1060
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:00,830
往这边走！快点，生锈的家伙们
Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty.

1061
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:06,930
韩大夫，你的技术真是太棒了！
Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1062
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,300
- 太好了，现在请你离开\n- 我是认真的，你还是和以前一样棒
- Wonderful. Now, go away. - Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1063
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,200
- 我叫你离开这里\n- 得了吧
- I'm askin' you to leave. - Come on.

1064
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:15,270
我是一辆赛车\n你是一辆老式的赛车
I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar,

1065
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,330
但是在引擎盖下面，我们是一样的
but under the hood you and I are the same.

1066
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:20,470
我们并不一样！\n明白了吗？现在离开这里
We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out.

1067
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:23,480
一辆像你这样的车\n为什么在你的尖峰时期退出？
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?

1068
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,820
你以为我退出了？
You think I quit?

1069
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,100
是啊
Right.

1070
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:45,370
54年的大撞车
Your big wreck in '54.

1071
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:48,410
他们离开了我
They quit on me.

1072
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,040
当我完全修好后\n我回去以为别人会热烈欢迎我
When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome.

1073
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,010
知道他们怎么说吗？\n你已经是历史了
You know what they said? "You're history."

1074
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,140
他们挑选了一位新人
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.

1075
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:03,220
我还有很多能量可以发挥
There was a lot left in me.

1076
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,950
但是我却没有机会再表现了
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1077
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:12,490
我把新闻留了下来
I keep that to remind me never to go back.

1078
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,830
来提醒我永远不要回头了
I just never expected that that world would...

1079
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,100
我没有预料到会有人找到我
...would find me here.

1080
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,800
- 韩大夫，我可不像他们\n- 是吗？
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them. - Oh, yeah?

1081
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,870
我不像他们
No, I'm not.

1082
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:27,780
你最后一次关心除了你自己\n以外的人是什么时候？
When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?

1083
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:32,450
你说出一次来，我就回去参加比赛
You name me one time and I will take it all back.

1084
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,280
呃...我可不这样认为
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1085
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,460
这里的人都是好人\n每个人都关心对方
These are good folk around here, who care about one another.

1086
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,230
我不想让他们依赖一个不值得依赖的人
I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.

1087
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,830
像你吗？\n你已经来这里多久了
Oh, like you? You've been here how long

1088
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,130
你的朋友们都不知道你真正的身份？
and your friends don't even know who you are?

1089
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,860
到底是谁只会关心自己？
Who's caring about only himself?

1090
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,740
快点修完那条路，然后离开这里！
Just finish that road and get outta here!

1091
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,590
你可不可以把那不尊重国旗音乐给关了
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

1092
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,100
尊重古典音乐
Respect the classics, man.

1093
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,640
啊
Ah...

1094
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,920
他完成了
He's done.

1095
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:46,220
他一定是在我们睡觉时完成的
He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.

1096
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,520
太好了
Good riddance.

1097
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,840
他走了？
He's gone?

1098
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:00,930
我们可不想让他错过那个比赛
Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his.

1099
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:10,720
- 伙计，你是在哭吗？\n- 不，我是太高兴了
- Oh, dude, are you crying? - No! I'm happy!

1100
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:13,750
我不用每天再看着他了
I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore!

1101
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,020
他走了我很高兴
I'm glad he's gone!

1102
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,430
小红，怎么了？
What's wrong with Red?

1103
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,900
因为你走了，他感到很难过
Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town

1104
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,900
你去参加你的比赛
and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup

1105
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,840
去赢取你梦寐以求的活塞杯
that you've always dreamed about your whole life

1106
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:38,440
得到有钱的赞助商的赞助\n还有直升机接送
and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1107
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,380
等一下！
Wait a minute!

1108
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,620
我知道你不会不说再见就离开的
I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

1109
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,420
你还呆在这里干什么？\n你会错过你的比赛的
What are you doin' here? You're gonna miss your race.

1110
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:56,160
没关系，我用警车护送你\n把失去的时间赢回来
Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1111
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,390
谢谢，警长
Thank you, Sheriff.

1112
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:59,590
但是我现在还不能走
But you know I can't go just yet.

1113
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,160
为什么？
Well, why not?

1114
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,070
我想我的轮胎
- I'm not sure these tires...

1115
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:07,040
- 没法熬到加州\n- 换胎吗？
...can get me to California. - Peet stop?

1116
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:10,370
你们谁知道路易奇的店什么时候开门？
Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?

1117
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:11,780
我真是不敢相信！四个全新的轮胎
I can't-a believe it! Four new tires!

1118
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,610
I can't-a believe it! Four new tires!

1119
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,410
谢谢你，“闪电”麦坤
Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!

1120
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,580
- 你看看！\n- 这几年来我的第一位顾客！
- Would you look at that! -  Our first customer in years!

1121
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:24,250
我满含激动的泪水
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1122
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:28,190
这是我生命中最快乐的一天
for this is the most glorious day of my life!

1123
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,260
好了，路易奇，把你最好的黑轮胎给我
All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1124
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:33,700
不！不不不
No! No, no, no.

1125
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:37,140
你不知道你想要什么\n路易奇知道你想要什么
You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want.

1126
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:42,640
黑轮胎，太寻常了
Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement.

1127
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,180
但是这个
But-a this...

1128
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,310
白色的轮胎！
Whitewall tires!

1129
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:51,550
好像是在说，快看我！\n我在这，爱上我
They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."

1130
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,420
好吧，你是专家
All right, you're the expert.

1131
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:56,420
别忘了备用胎
Don't forget the spare.

1132
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:59,320
- 太棒了，奇诺\n- 开工！
- Perfetto. Guido! - Peet stop!

1133
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,640
我是怎么跟你说的，嗯？
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1134
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:17,170
你说的对极了\n比法拉利还要漂亮，对吗？
Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1135
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,110
呃...不对
Eh... No.

1136
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,580
这个有机汽油真是在棒了\n我以前怎么没听说过
Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?

1137
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,650
这是一个阴谋！
It's a conspiracy, man!

1138
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,190
那些公司和政府有交易！
The oil companies got a grip on the government!

1139
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,490
他们告诉我们的都是谎话
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1140
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,690
好的，给我来一桶
OK, I'll take a case.

1141
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,210
哦！额
Ow! Eh!

1142
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,680
啊，耶
Ah... Yeah.

1143
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,750
咔嚓
Ka-chow.

1144
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,600
- 她来了！\n- 让路，伙计们，快
- Here she comes! - Places, everybody. Hurry!

1145
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,390
自然一点
- Act natural.

1146
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,800
嗨，莎莉
- Hi, Sally. - Buon giorno!

1147
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,700
好了，到底怎么回事？
All right, what's goin' on?

1148
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,930
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlecars,

1149
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,940
请欢迎崭新的“闪电”麦坤！
please welcome the new Lightning McQueen!

1150
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,570
你认为怎么样？
Pow! What do you think?

1151
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,840
水乡温泉镇\n这漆在我身上看起来不错
Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.

1152
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,710
我说
I'll say.

1153
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:30,980
咔嚓
Ka-chow.

1154
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,580
你一定很适合加州
You're gonna fit right in in California.

1155
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,580
天啊，你帮助了城镇里的每一个人
My goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town.

1156
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,490
耶，除了一个人
Yeah, everybody except one.

1157
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:45,720
- 现在是不是天黑了？\n- 什么？他说什么？
- Hey, is it getting dark out? - What? What'd he say?

1158
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,830
我再说一次\n现在是不是天黑了？
Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?

1159
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,100
我应该做什么？
Now, what was I supposed to do after that?

1160
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,890
他们修好了霓虹灯
They fixed their neon!

1161
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:30,300
- 低一些慢一些\n- 好的，亲爱的
- Low and slow? - Oh, yeah, baby!

1162
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,950
就像这个城镇的昌盛时期，对吗？
Just like in its heyday, right?

1163
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:41,390
比我想像中的还要好，谢谢你
It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.

1164
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,250
我们要去兜风吗？
Shall we cruise?

1165
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,650
谢谢你，亲爱的，我非常想去
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1166
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,190
- 不不不！\n- 莉奇
- No, no, no. - Lizzie!

1167
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:18,590
我还记的斯坦利第一次叫我和他去兜风
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.

1168
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:21,530
你好，莎莉，我可以请你去兜风吗？
Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise?

1169
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,960
- 当然可以，拖线\n- 呃！
- Of course, Mater. - Uh-uh-uh!

1170
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,810
我一次一次说不\n他又问了我一次，我还是说不去
...and again and I said, "No." He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1171
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,210
对于一个2缸的车来说，他真是太漂亮了
But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1172
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,680
最后我说，只能兜一会儿
Finally I said, "All right, one little drive."

1173
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:48,850
哦！
- Oh!

1174
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,320
- 嘿！\n- 谢谢，拖线
- Hey! - Thanks, Mater.

1175
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,690
你们两个晚安
Good evenin', you two.

1176
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,430
斯坦利，我真希望你可以看到这个景象
Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.

1177
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,340
- 那是我想看到的吗？\n- 我不知道，芙蓉
- Is that what I think it is? - Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1178
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:19,080
我还不知道结果是什么\n但是我会找出结果的
I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello.

1179
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,750
不是那个
Not that. That.

1180
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,220
顾客？\n顾客？
Customers?\nCustomers?

1181
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:26,950
大伙，顾客们来了！有很多顾客
Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em!

1182
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:29,190
你们知道该怎么做了\n就像我们排练的一样
You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed.

1183
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:32,930
那是幽灵之光！
It's the ghostlight!

1184
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,590
我们找到了麦坤\n我们找到了麦坤！
We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen!

1185
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,940
麦坤看这边
McQueen, over here!

1186
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:40,770
- 等一等\n- 他们说你去戒毒所了
- Wait, excuse me. - Is it true you've been in rehab?

1187
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,970
- 他们说你被压力压跨了？\n- 什么？
- Did you have a nervous breakdown? - What?

1188
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,770
- 麦坤用上了白色的轮胎\n- 你的胎坏了吗？
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls! - Your tires balding?

1189
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:46,840
麦坤
Stickers!

1190
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:49,080
- 麦坤是不是你的囚犯？\n- 当然不是！
- Was McQueen your prisoner? - Shoot, no!

1191
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:51,620
才不是呢，我们是最好的朋友
We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1192
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:54,880
我只是在他逃跑时负责捉住他
but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.

1193
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,550
莎莉！莎莉！
Sally! Sally!

1194
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,680
你还会参加活塞杯吗？
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1195
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,490
- 麦坤？\n- 莎莉！
- Stickers? - Sally!

1196
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,960
看这边，闪一下！
- Come on, give us some bolt!

1197
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:07,520
你在这里！感谢上帝，你还活着
You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1198
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,970
- 麦大叔？\n- 我真不敢相信你在这里！
- Mack? - You're here! I can't believe it!

1199
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,910
你是新闻头条！
You are a sight for sore headlights!

1200
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,710
对不起我把你搞丢了，老板
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you!

1201
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,640
麦大叔，真不敢相信你在这儿
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1202
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:22,310
这不是世界上最快的赛车吗？
Is that the world's fastest racing machine?

1203
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,910
- 那是哈夫吗？\n- 是的，哈夫就在后面
- Is that Harv? - Yeah. He's in the back.

1204
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,460
- 秀一下闪电！\n- 退后，狗仔队
- Show us the bolt! - Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1205
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,790
- 老麦坤在哪里？\n- 实际上这是我好的一面
- Where's the old McQueen? - Actually, this is my good side here.

1206
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,120
- 哈夫！哈夫！\n- 秀下下闪电！
- Harv! Harv! - Give us the bolt!

1207
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,050
- 哈夫？\n- 我在这里！
- Harv? - Come on!

1208
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,830
- 小子，我在这儿\n- 你还好吗，伙计
- Kid, I'm over here! - How you doin', buddy?

1209
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,560
我的明星客户从地球上消失了！
My star client disappears off the face of the earth!

1210
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,830
- 你说我感觉如何？\n- 我可以解释
- How do you think I'm doing? - I can explain.

1211
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:49,310
我感觉好极了！你在各种媒体上\n电视，广播，报纸
I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers!

1212
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:52,440
这是用钱也买不到的暴光率！\n你还要我干什么
You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?

1213
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:54,980
那只是些客套话，因为你签了合约
That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract.

1214
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:57,350
你在哪里？我在我个导航仪上找不到你
Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS.

1215
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,940
我在一个叫水乡温泉镇的地方
I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs.

1216
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:03,220
- 你知道66号州际公路吗？它就在这里！\n- 很好，太棒了，孩子
- You know Route 66? It's still here! - Yeah, that's great, kid.

1217
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:04,490
游戏结束了
Playtime is over, pal.

1218
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,390
当整个世界都在找你的时候\n迪纳哥没有人可以选择
While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1219
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,160
- 他们要选择谁？\n- 路霸！
- Who are they gonna woo? - Chick!

1220
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:13,860
没错，看看电视上在播什么
Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.

1221
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:16,100
- 给我看看雷鸣！\n- 你要看雷鸣？
- Show us the thunder! - You want thunder?

1222
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:19,800
要看雷鸣？咔嚓，咔嚓
You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1223
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:23,140
- 嘿，那是我的招牌动作！\n- 你现在要马上赶到那里！
- Hey, that's my bit! - You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1224
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:27,200
马上离开水乡温泉镇，不然你永远没有机会\n和迪纳哥合作了，知道吗？
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1225
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,010
等一下，哈夫
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1226
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:30,880
不行，等等，你去哪里？
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1227
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,220
进拖车吧，孩子，想要个更大一点的拖车吗？
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer?

1228
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,160
莎莉，我想让你知道
Sally, I... I want you to...

1229
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,890
瞧，我想
Look, I wish...

1230
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:49,230
谢谢，谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1231
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:56,600
- 只是修了一条路而已\n- 不，不只是一条路而已
- It was just a road. - No. It was much more than that.

1232
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,940
嘿，小子，我们该走了\n哈夫快疯了
Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy!

1233
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:06,250
如果你现在不进到卡车里\n他会解雇我的！
He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!

1234
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,050
- 麦大叔，再等一会\n- 该走了
- Mack, just... hold it for... - You should go.

1235
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,350
- 我知道，但是\n- 祝你好运
- I know, but... - Good luck in California.

1236
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:16,750
我希望你可以找到你所期望的
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1237
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,920
- 麦坤，快点！\n- 莎莉
- McQueen, come on! - Sally...

1238
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,230
- 莎莉！\n- 秀一下闪电，麦坤，秀一下！
- Sally! - Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1239
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,400
嘿，“闪电”，秀一下
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1240
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,010
- 快进来\n- 原来的麦坤呢？
- Come on, get in the trailer. - Where's the old McQueen?

1241
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,450
- 闪光！\n- 很好，我们走了
- The bolt! - That's it. That's right, let's go!

1242
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,210
你是巨星，超级巨星
You're a big shining star. You're a superstar.

1243
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:40,580
你根本不属于这里
You don't belong there, anyway.

1244
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:43,650
等，等等，等等！
Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1245
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,690
嘿，伙计们，他钻进卡车里了
Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1246
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,200
嘿，你是韩大夫吗？
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1247
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:00,670
- 是的\n- 谢谢你打电话来
- Yeah. - Thanks for the call.

1248
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:12,880
- 是你告诉他们的？\n- 这对每个人都有好处，莎莉
- You called them? - It's best for everyone, Sally.

1249
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,650
对每个人都好还是对你好？
Best for everyone or best for you?

1250
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,940
我还没有和他说再见呢
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1251
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,840
大家好，赛车迷们
Hello, race fans. Welcome to what has become, quite simply,

1252
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:41,200
欢迎来到赛车史上最重要的比赛
the biggest event in the history of racing.

1253
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,510
三辆赛车争夺活塞杯！
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1254
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:46,050
洛杉矶国际赛道涌进了
There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars

1255
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,670
大约20万辆赛车迷
here at the Los Angeles International Speedway.

1256
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:53,080
比赛的票比夏天坐在黑色的皮椅上还要热！
Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1257
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,710
“国王”，“路霸”和“闪电”麦坤
The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen

1258
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:59,120
要赛200圈，胜者将赢得所有的荣誉
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race.

1259
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:02,420
你知道我见过世面，但让我告诉你
I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'.

1260
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,490
我从来没有想过会看到这场比赛！\n太激动人心了！
I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting!

1261
01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:08,900
事实上，整个国家几乎都歇业了
In fact, the country has almost shut down

1262
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:13,070
他们都在观看这场世纪之战
to watch what many experts are calling "the race of the century."

1263
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,770
嘿，“国王”，祝你最后一场比赛好运
Hey, King! Good luck in your last race.

1264
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,940
- 我受了你很大的影响\n- 谢谢你，非常感谢
- You've sure been an inspiration to me. - Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1265
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:23,110
- 你要小心，知道吗？\n- 知道了
- Hey, be careful out there, OK? - Yeah, man.

1266
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,170
他真性感！
He's hot!

1267
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,910
你想要知道天气预报吗？我就告诉你们
Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast.

1268
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:30,080
百分之百雷鸣！咔嚓！咔嚓！
A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1269
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,680
跟我说！咔嚓！咔嚓！
Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1270
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,700
嘿，说你呢！没有证件不能进
Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass.

1271
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,530
没关系，“闪电”麦坤认识我
Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me!

1272
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,730
马克，这天真适合比赛，对不对？
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it?

1273
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:46,760
- 是的，安杰帝先生\n- 早，佛瑞德
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. - And good morning to you, Fred.

1274
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,740
安杰帝先生知道我的名字！你得让我进去了
Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!

1275
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:52,070
不好意思，不行
Sorry, pal.

1276
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:56,410
好了，我们走\n专注，速度
OK, here we go. Focus. Speed.

1277
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,980
我就是速度
I am speed.

1278
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,920
胜利
Victory.

1279
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:05,120
一个冠军，两个失败者
One winner, two losers.

1280
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:12,760
速度，速度，速度
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1281
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,530
“闪电”，准备好了吗？
Lightnin'! You ready?

1282
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:22,300
是的，准备好了
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1283
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,490
麦大叔，谢谢你今天当我的维修团队
Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.

1284
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,150
没关系，小子\n至少我可以帮你做这些
Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do.

1285
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:43,630
毕竟，油箱是我的中名
After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.

1286
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:46,060
- 是吗？\n- 呃...不是真的
- It is? - Ah... Not really.

1287
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,750
额
Uh-oh

1288
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:18,600
放大！准备切换16号摄影机
Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16.

1289
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:21,000
那就是“闪电'麦坤
And there he is, Lightning McQueen!

1290
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:24,200
失踪了一周，但又从一个\n不知名的地方冒了出来！
Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere!

1291
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:26,670
一个叫水乡温泉镇的地方
In a little town called Radiator Springs.

1292
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,800
换了白色轮胎和其它装饰
Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things.

1293
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:34,070
- 哦！\n- 咔嚓！咔嚓！咔嚓！
- Oh! - Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1294
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:37,710
你去哪了，麦坤\n我真是寂寞
Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely.

1295
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:40,690
没有人和我说话\n除了迪纳哥的人
Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1296
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,750
当然还有那对双胞胎姐妹\n记得吗，她们是你忠实的粉丝
And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans,

1297
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:46,990
现在她们是我的粉丝了\n你知道她们说什么吗
but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think...

1298
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,890
啊！
Agh! Shoot!

1299
01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:59,100
伙计们，我们开始比赛吧！
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'!

1300
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:06,940
你可以做到的！
Come on, you can do it!

1301
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:09,040
加油，“国王”，我们为你感到骄傲
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1302
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:13,450
50圈了，冠军还保持领先地位
Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead.

1303
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,750
麦坤要超车了！他要从内道超车
McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside!

1304
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,090
哦，他阻止了他！
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1305
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,560
“路霸”今天可不是好欺负的
Chick's not making it easy on him today.

1306
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:25,360
他落后了很长一段距离
He lost momentum,

1307
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,730
他现在要追赶上去！
and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!

1308
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,200
麦坤失去控制，滑到草地上去了！
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1309
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,780
只剩我和那辆老爷车了
Just me and the old man, fellas.

1310
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:49,380
麦坤今天不在状态
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1311
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,620
- 孩子，你还好吗？\n- 我不知道，麦大叔
- Hey, kid, are you all right? - I don't know, Mack.

1312
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,130
我想我
I don't think I...

1313
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,930
我可不是开可这么远的路来看你退出的
I didn't come all this way to see you quit.

1314
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:00,690
韩大夫？
Doc?

1315
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:06,000
伙计们，你们都来了！\n真不敢相信！
Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!

1316
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,840
我知道你需要一个车队主管\n但我不知道你这么烂
I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.

1317
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:11,810
你说你永远不会回来了
You said you'd never come back.

1318
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,470
好吧，我没有选择的余地\n拖线没有和你说再见
Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1319
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:18,450
再见！好了，没我事了
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1320
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:25,920
如果你能像你修路时那样驾驶
All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road

1321
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:29,260
就算你闭着眼也能赢这场比赛
then you can win this race with your eyes shut.

1322
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:31,320
回到比赛去吧！
Now, get back out there!

1323
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:36,540
他终于恢复状态了！\n奇诺，路易奇
Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi!

1324
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,900
你们如果要和专业的维修团队竞争
You're goin' up against professional pit crews.

1325
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,140
- 你们的动作必须要快\n- 他们根本都不知道他们为什么输了！
- You're gonna have to be fast. - They will not know what bit them!

1326
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:43,900
孩子，你一定会赢他们的
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1327
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:47,380
最好的队员和你合作\n你会夺回那一圈的差距的
Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back.

1328
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:00,990
- 是他？\n- 哦，没错，就是他！
- Is it? - Oh, wow. That's him!

1329
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:04,830
是他吗？那是哈德逊大黄蜂！\n哈德逊大黄蜂回来了！
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back!

1330
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,530
看上去麦坤有了自己的维修团队
It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew.

1331
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,000
看看他们的主管是谁
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1332
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:12,770
- 快看，是哈德逊大黄蜂！\n- 哇！
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! - Whoa!

1333
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,170
真是太棒了，当然是他
Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is.

1334
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:22,840
这真是在制造历史
Wow, this is history in the making.

1335
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,820
50年来，有人见过这位赛车界的传奇人物
Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years!

1336
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,290
嘿，韩大夫
Hey, Doc!

1337
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:31,520
快看看这位在广播上的人\n他看起来就像你
Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you.

1338
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:40,230
- 麦坤在内道超车了\n- 但是他还落后一圈
- McQueen passes on the inside! - He's nearly a lap down.

1339
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:43,200
还剩60圈，他能赶上他们吗？
Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go?

1340
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:46,170
你做的很好，要保持下去
You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on.

1341
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,830
加油！加油！
Vai! Vai, vai!

1342
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:50,810
嘿，麦坤在哪里找到你的？
Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh?

1343
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,310
那些圆的东西叫轮胎\n它们应该放在车子下面
Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car!

1344
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:58,080
[意大利语]
Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1345
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:01,320
不不不！你会有机会表现的
No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance.

1346
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:18,570
这小子想成为英雄吗？
Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh?

1347
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,400
看看这个怎么样？
What do you think of this?

1348
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,640
对，就是这样，孩子
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1349
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:28,240
什么？
What?

1350
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,110
哇！就是这样！
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1351
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:36,150
- 是我教他的！咔嚓！\n- 啊！
- I taught him that. Ka-chow! - Ah!

1352
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,190
麦坤真是太棒了\n他已经追上领跑者了
What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders.

1353
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,090
这才是最关键的
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1354
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:44,320
3辆车的比赛，还剩下10圈
A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go!

1355
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:51,170
看看在跑的那小子
Look at that boy go out there!

1356
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,180
啊！
Oh!

1357
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:01,670
不，这可不行！
No, you don't.

1358
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,740
韩大夫，我暴胎了！我暴胎了！
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1359
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:10,260
- 你能开到维修站吗？\n- 我想没问题
- Can you get back to the pits? - Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1360
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,620
亮黄旗了，快开进来，不要失去信心
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1361
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,690
我们必须马上把他修好
We gotta get him back out there fast

1362
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,700
不然我们不可能赢这场比赛！
or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race!

1363
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:22,930
奇诺，时间到了
Guido! It's time.

1364
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:30,300
小不点，你要帮他擦挡风玻璃吗？
Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield?

1365
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:40,850
真是不敢相信！
I don't believe it!

1366
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,620
那是我见过的最快的换胎过程！
That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1367
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:45,250
漂亮的停站\n但是他必须超过那辆安全车
It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1368
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,020
接近了
It's gonna be close.

1369
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:51,160
太棒了，伙计
- Yeah, baby!

1370
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:52,600
他又回来了！
He's back in!

1371
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:54,920
换胎完毕
Peet stop.

1372
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:58,300
- 奇诺，你成功了！\n- 干得好，奇诺！
- Guido, you did it! - Way to go, Guido!

1373
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:16,650
我们即将进入最后一圈
This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen

1374
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,090
麦坤就跟在他们后边，多棒的回归
is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!

1375
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:22,690
199圈了，已经到了最关键的时刻
A hundred and ninety-nine laps! It all comes down to this!

1376
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,030
就是这样，孩子
This is it, kiddo.

1377
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,590
就剩下4个弯脚了，一个一个的来
You've got four turns left. One at a time.

1378
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,100
加速猛冲，希望你不会失控
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1379
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,570
冲啊！
- Go!

1380
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:34,400
瞧瞧这个！
We'll see about that!

1381
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:37,470
麦坤在内道超车
McQueen's going inside!

1382
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:43,470
- “国王”和“路霸”失控了\n- 麦坤滑出了赛道！
- Chick and King are loose! - I think McQueen's out!

1383
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,630
- 麦坤又回来了！\n- 他回到了赛道！
- McQueen saved it! - He's back on the track!

1384
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:59,690
- 壮如凯迪拉克\n- 快如宝马
- Float like a Cadillac... - Sting like a Beemer!

1385
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:04,400
咔嚓！咔嚓！咔...
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1386
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:08,970
“闪电”麦坤即将赢得活塞杯了
Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1387
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,140
你一定会赢的！一定会
Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers!

1388
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:16,450
我不会再跟在你屁股后面开了，老家伙
I am not comin' in behind you again, old man.

1389
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:28,690
哦，不！
- Oh, no!

1390
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:49,410
耶！哇！
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1391
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,210
我赢了，宝贝！耶！哦耶！
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1392
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,650
他到底想干什么，韩大夫？
What's he up to, Doc?

1393
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:08,400
你要干什么，孩子？
What are you doin', kid?

1394
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,700
我想“国王”应该完成\n他的最后一场比赛
I think The King should finish his last race.

1395
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,870
你刚刚放弃了活塞杯，你知道吗？
You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?

1396
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:21,540
有一辆老赛车教会了我一些事
This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'.

1397
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:23,670
那只是一个没用的杯子
It's just an empty cup.

1398
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:28,350
在最后一圈推车符合赛规吗？
Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?

1399
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:32,090
他没有在推，他只是跟在他后边开而已
He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft.

1400
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,460
喔！哦哦哦哦！
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1401
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:37,220
嘿，发生了什么事？
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1402
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,560
那才叫真正的赛车！
- That's what I call racin'.

1403
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,580
- [意大利语]\n- 做的太好了
- Bravo il mio amico! - Way to go, buddy!

1404
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:01,250
这里充满了爱，不是吗？
There's a lotta love out there, you know, man?

1405
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,850
- 不要让我丢脸\n- 那才是我喜欢的赛车
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. - That's my hot rod.

1406
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:11,330
快点，把活塞杯给我
Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup!

1407
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,800
咔嚓！咔嚓！
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1408
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:15,840
耶！这就是我想要的！
Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1409
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:19,030
嘿，为什么只有我自己在庆祝？
Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh?

1410
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:21,340
女孩们呢？彩纸呢？
Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti!

1411
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:25,000
喔！喔！轻一点！怎么了？
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on?

1412
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,380
快照些照片\n我要去和迪纳哥签合同了！
Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1413
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,920
跟着我一起说，咔嚓！
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1414
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,610
- 嘘！\n- 嘘！
- Boo! - Boo!

1415
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:34,780
你们都怎么了？到底怎么了？
What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness?

1416
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,950
嘿！这可是奇克时代的开始啊！
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1417
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,350
- 谢谢你，“闪电”\n- 不客气
- Thanks, Lightnin'. - You're welcome.

1418
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:50,200
- 干的好，“国王”\n- 你是好样的！
- Way to go, King! - You're still the car!

1419
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:52,260
你才是真正的冠军！
You're The King! Yeah!

1420
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,140
- 我们为你感到骄傲，孩子！\n- 祝贺你，小子
- You made us proud, kid! - Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1421
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,980
你很有潜力，孩子
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1422
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:13,850
谢谢你，韩大夫
Thanks, Doc.

1423
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,330
嘿，“闪电”
Hey, Lightnin'.

1424
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,060
过来和我谈一谈怎么样？
How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute?

1425
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:22,990
孩子，这才是真正的比赛
Son, that was some real racin' out there.

1426
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:25,830
你想不想成为迪纳哥新的代言人？
How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?

1427
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,010
但是我没有赢
But I didn't win.

1428
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,740
“闪电”，除了赢得比赛之外\n还有其它更重要的事
Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'.

1429
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:38,510
你看他都生锈了\n他需要“除锈灵”保险杠防锈药膏
He was so rusty, when he drove down the street

1430
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:42,750
围着车绕圈子
- buzzards used to circle the car!

1431
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:44,550
感谢你，泰克思先生，但是
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1432
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:48,360
但是“除锈灵”保险杠防锈药膏的人\n给了我第一次机会
...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break.

1433
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,630
我想和他们在一起
I'm gonna stick with them.

1434
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,760
我尊重你的决定
Well, I sure can respect that.

1435
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,000
可是你知道
Still, you know,

1436
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:59,940
如果有任何事需要帮忙\n告诉我就可以了
if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.

1437
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:02,530
我很感激，谢谢你
I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1438
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:07,000
实际上，有一件事
Actually, there is one thing.

1439
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:08,720
哇喔！
Whoo-hoo!

1440
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,940
哇喔！
Whoo-hoo!

1441
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:13,880
嘿！看看我！我在飞！
Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly!

1442
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,380
我比在停车场的“龙卷风”还要开心
I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!

1443
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,330
我们是不是该重新装修一下了
I think it's about-a time we redecorate.

1444
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:33,910
你好，“闪电”麦坤告诉我\n这是世界上最好的
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world

1445
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:34,960
轮胎店
to get tires.

1446
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:39,240
给我和我的朋友换一换轮胎怎么样？
How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?

1447
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:44,510
奇诺，这是真正的舒马赫的法拉利！
Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1448
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,880
一辆真正的法拉利！
A real Ferrari!

1449
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:49,080
在我脸上打一拳，奇诺，打一拳
Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face.

1450
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:52,610
这是我生命中最美好的一天
This is the most glorious day of my life.

1451
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:57,490
哇[意大利语]
Wow. [Italian] Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

1452
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,900
[意大利语]
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

1453
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,710
只是路过吗？
Just passin' through?

1454
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,080
其实我想在这里呆一段时间
Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile.

1455
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:23,420
- 我听说这个地方又在地图上出现了\n- 是吗？
- I hear this place is back on the map. - It is?

1456
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:27,260
有人说一个活塞杯获得者
There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1457
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:29,800
会在这里建立他的比赛中心
is setting up his big racing headquarters here.

1458
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,700
真的吗？这对小镇来说是件大好事
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1459
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:35,260
我很想你，莎莉
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1460
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,470
我有一种别人并不理解的感觉
Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and,

1461
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,700
等等等
- blah, blah, blah.

1462
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,100
麦坤和莎莉停在树旁边
McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree,

1463
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:49,810
亲亲...亲亲...
K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!

1464
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,150
拖线，来的真是时候
Great timing, Mater!

1465
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:56,210
嘿嘿！耶！
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1466
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,720
他是我最好的朋友\n我能拿他怎么办呢？
He's my best friend. What're you gonna do?

1467
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:01,730
那么，准备最后一个光顾芙蓉的店？
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1468
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,490
我不知道，我们为什么不去兜兜风
I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive?

1469
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,160
嗯...不
Hmm... Nah.

1470
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,140
好吧！咔嚓！
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1471
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,200
阿嚏！
Ah-choo!

1472
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:26,000
大家过来集合一下
All right, everybody please keep together now.

1473
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,850
我们现在进入了韩大夫博物馆
We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum.

1474
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:33,890
哇，太不可思议了，一个赛季拿这么多冠军
Wow. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season.

1475
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:38,010
他实在太厉害了，哈德逊大黄蜂是我的偶像
He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1476
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:41,550
打扰了，哈德逊大黄蜂今天在吗？
Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today?

1477
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:45,430
抱歉，“国王”夫人，我想韩大夫可能是出去兜风了
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or somethin'.

1478
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:51,930
- 哇哦！哇哦！\n- 耶！
- Whoo! Whoo! - Yeah!

1479
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,530
嘿，你可不是开泥地的
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1480
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:57,670
老家伙，泥的绝招我可都会了
Not today, old man. I know all your tricks.

1481
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:03,880
韩大夫！韩大夫！
Doc! Doc!

1482
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,650
喔哈！
Whoo-ah!

1483
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,310
差远啦，菜鸟！
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1484
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:28,430
注意！和公路吻别吧
Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1485
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:31,940
等我搞定后，你们会在\n想象不到的地方沾上泥土
When I'm finished, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had!

1486
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:35,850
- 啊，我从来没在路外面开过呢\n- 好吧，那现在你得改改了
- Yo, I've never been off-road! - Well, that's gonna change right now!

1487
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:39,020
向后转！往前开20英里！
About face! Drop and give me 20 miles!

1488
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,080
出发！出发！开！开！开！开！开！
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1489
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:43,990
伙计，我的轮胎脏了！
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1490
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:48,620
嗯？看啊！
Huh? Look at this!

1491
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:50,860
这是我的前盖！我的前盖！
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1492
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:54,020
我已经20年没见到它了！
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1493
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:58,590
看上去太棒了，我看上去怎么样？\n阿嚏！
Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? Ah-choo!

1494
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,540
哦，天啊
Oh, dang.

1495
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:14,240
你是一辆玩具车！
You are a toy car!

1496
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:19,090
你就是辆可怜的，古怪的破车\n我还真同情你，再见
You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell.

1497
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:22,220
哦，是吗？好吧，随你吧，疯子
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony!

1498
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:25,990
嘿，我可不想打断集会\n但伙计们，他们来了！
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, but they're here!

1499
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:28,430
三点参加生日聚会的客人们！
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

1500
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:31,830
伙计们！谁要能像这只卡车猪那样说话
Oh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck,

1501
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,460
我敢保证他是个很棒的演员！
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1502
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:39,210
我们被流放了，天才们！\n被困在这个鬼地方！
We're banished, genius! Stuck here in this wasteland without chains!

1503
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:43,040
但是麦克，波波比尔还有麻烦\n她需要我们的帮助！
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help!

1504
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,380
- 你还是没在听我说话！\n- 啊！
- You're still not listening!  - Ah!

1505
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:51,080
欢迎来到喜马拉雅山！要冰激凌吗？
Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone?

1506
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:55,090
哦，这辆扫雪机还真有意思
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian!

1507
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,620
快进去吧！快快快！
Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!

1508
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,100
马戏车？
Circus cars?

1509
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,630
你们是怎么成为马戏车的？
How can you be circus cars?

1510
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,230
这些可是世界上最有意思的马戏车
These are the lousiest circus cars in the world,

1511
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,290
他们会让我成为富翁！
and they're gonna make me rich!

1512
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:07,500
等一下！
Wait a minute here.

1513

No! There's an on-ramp close! I know it! I can feel it!
