you've gotta trust them.

You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

要不然有什么意义？
Otherwise, what's the point?

00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:07,462
一直以来，我深信我拥有的是这样的爱

-我会的
WOMAN 2: Would you put in shrimp?
WOMAN: I would.

130
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:10,188
要是这些家伙们每月拿不到
这只小箱子…
NICKY: Nobody got a Teamsters'
loan unless the guys in this room...

131
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,608
那谁就都别想贷到款
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

132
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:16,404
像这从底特律来的老家伙
Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

133
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:21,952
或尤其是像利蒙盖吉
这群人的首脑
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss.

134
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,334
有大概数字吗？
You got a round figure on it?

135
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,588
绝对是这房里最重要的人物
NICKY: Definitely the most
important guy in this room.

136
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,702
-十公斤，那就差不多七十万了
-很好
FRANK: About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.

REMO: Good.

138

虽说对拉斯维加斯还有点早…
STONE: It's a little early for Las Vegas...

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,309
但我想邀请赌博游乐业界的
先生与小姐们…
but I want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry....

140
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,481
就以世界所知…
SAM: As far as the world was concerned...

141
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,782
安迪史东卡车司机工会
退休基金会的负责人…
Andy Stone,
head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

142
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,446
是个清白的人物
was a legitimate guy.

143
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,479
有权力的人
A powerful man.

144
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:49,112
他与总统一同打高尔夫
He played golf with the President.

145
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,493
代表卡车司机工会退休基金会…
ANDY: On behalf
of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

146
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:54,328
-我很高兴将这…
-但安迪也听命于人
I'm glad to present...
SAM: But he also took orders.

147
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:57,710
当他被指示将基金贷款
贷给菲立浦葛林…
When he was told to give
a pension-fund loan to Philip Green...

148
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:00,874
六千两百七十万的支票…
...this check for $62,700,000...

149
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,384
给全新的坦吉乐
for the new Tangiers.

150
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,511
他就会乖乖听话
...he did what he was told.

151
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,638
他可是最完美的傀儡
NICKY: Here was the perfect front man.

152
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,345
他还能干嘛呢？
他什么都不知道
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.

153
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:10,929
也什么都不想知道…
He didn't want to know too much...

154
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:13,849
尤其是老大们让工会借钱给他
especially that the bosses
made the Teamsters lend him money.

155
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,060
他想相信他们是因为
他的才智贷款给他
He wanted to believe they gave him
the money because he was smart.

156
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,689
我了解这城市的竞争性有多大
才会说出此话
I say that knowing just how much
competition we have in this city.

00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,160
他们从哪儿找来葛林的？
NICKY: And where they got Green from?

159
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:27,825
谁知道啊？
Who the fuck knows?

160
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:30,869
我只知道他在亚利桑那州
是个房地产经纪…
All I know is that he was
an Arizona real-estate hustler...

161
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,495
却连开来拿支票的油钱
都差点付不出来
who barely had enough gas money
to come and pick up his fucking check.

162
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,172

卡车司机工会退休基金
是由老大的人…
And it was the bosses' man...

163
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,050
安迪史东下所有的命令
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.

164
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,550
并不是由董事会主席
菲立浦葛林
Not the Chairman of the Board,
Philip Green.

165
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,310
我了解
I understand.

[Upbeat jazz music intensifies]

167
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,053
现在只缺…
NICKY: Now all they needed was...

168
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,271
一个可信任的人来管理赌场
someone they could trust to run the casino.

169
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,941
有谁比艾斯更适合？
他已经在赌城混了几年…
And who better than Ace?
He was already in Vegas a couple years...

170
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,945
他对这儿t若指掌
and he had the fucking place clocked.

171
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,368
艾斯的一贯作风
你给他个管理赌场的机会…
But typical Ace,
give him a shot to run a casino...

172
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,947
他还推三阻四
and he tries to talk you out of it.

173
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,739
我不知道自己行不行
I don't know if I could do this.

174
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,120
赌博游乐委员会绝不会
发执照给我的
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

175
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:09,003
我最起码有两打以上
赌博与赛马被逮的前科
I have at least 24 gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me.

176
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:12,380
在赌场工作不需要执照
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

177
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,674
你只需要去申请
All you gotta do is apply for one.

178
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,252
州法律允许你在申请期间…
The State law says that
you can work in a casino...

179
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,931
在赌场做事
while they process your application.

180
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:20,973
他们文件进度现在落后十年
ANDY: They got a 10-year backlog.

181
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,725
若他们发现了怎么办？
What happens when they do find out?

182
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,472
他们为什么会想发现？
ANDY: Why would they want to find out?

183
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:28,182
我们在这儿投资了一亿
他们何必赶我们走？
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?

184
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:32,353
他们不会发现的
你只需要一直改变职位头衔
ANDY: They'll never find out. All you
gotta do is keep changing your job title.

Like, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

摆到最下面去
Then they put your application
at the bottom of the pile.

It's a tough proposition, Andy.

NICKY: And that's how they got Ace
to take over.

196
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:08,071
要艾斯是因为
他不管是吃喝拉撒睡时都在赌
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

But the only thing he ever directed
was the casino.

He made his first bet when he was 15,
and he always made money.

你是怎么办到的？
Nobody ever had Oklahoma....
How'd you do it?

244
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,559
所以他们才赔得高啊
That's why they paid so well.

505

好样的，山姆
Okay, Sammy.

506

晚餐后，我们让珍妮佛
与金吉儿一块儿…
SAM: After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger...

507
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,674
我们俩则出去谈话
and we took a ride to talk.

508
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:49,388
然后他对我丢了颗炸弹
And then, he hit me with it.

509
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,683
你觉得我也搬来如何？
What do you think
about me moving out here?

510
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,023
有问题吗？
You got a problem with that?

511
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,390
当然没有
No, of course not.

512
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:00,154
你是说你允许罗？
You mean I have your permission?

513
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,445
当然罗
但我得告诉你…
Sure, you do. But I just gotta tell you...

514

在这儿可不能开玩笑
it's no joke out here.

515

你得保持低调
You gotta keep a low profile.

516

不像是在老家
这儿他们不喜欢我们
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.

517

This sheriff's a real cowboy.

518

Even coppers aren't afraid
to bury people in the desert.

519
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:17,502
我不在乎
我只想离开老家一阵子
I don't care. I want to get away
from back home for a while.

Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

524

没人看着我们，大家都在老家
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

525

我无缘故被逮了两次
I got pinched twice for no reason.

526
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:31,935
我真得小心了
I really gotta be careful.

全是合法的
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.

528
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,353
别担心，我什么都不会做的
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

529

I'm especially not gonna involve you
in anything.

NICKY: Ace saw Vegas one way...

531
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:47,665
-你跟他说过我要来吗？
-当然
NICKY: Call and tell him I'm coming?
JACK: Of course.

532

我的看法不同
...but I saw it another.

533

我视它为未开发的
I saw it as untouched.

534
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:57,967
多的是可勒索的赌马组头
皮条客与毒贩…
They had bookies, pimps,
and drug dealers I could shake down.

535
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,014
他们能找谁靠？
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?

536
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,969
我开始一个一个下手
So I started getting everybody in line.

I figured out a way not to lose.

539
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,186
他是有个稳赢之计
SAM: He had a foolproof scheme.

540
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,359
虽然不高明，但起码行得通
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

541
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,775
他赢时就收钱
When he won, he collected.

542
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:15,440
输时就叫赌马组头去死
When he lost,
he told the bookies to fuck off.

543
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:19,118
他们能怎样？逼迫尼奇？
尼奇就是逼迫者
What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.

-Hey, how you doing?

-什么东西？
-You got that thing for me?
-What thing?

546
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:26,581
尼奇，我以为你是来下注的
Nicky, I thought you was laying.

547
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,881
下注？不，我来收钱
I was laying? No, I'm taking it.

548
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,835
-你确定？
-非常
-You sure?
-I'm positive.

549

-我搞混了
-你搞混了？
-I'm a little confused.
-You're a little confused?

550

或许在我把你的脸砸过这窗户后…
Maybe if I stick your fucking face
through this window...

-对不起
-Give me the fucking money.
-I'm sorry.

我不是故意的
I didn't mean anything by it.

554
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,522
所以你连钱都准备好了
你他妈的以为我要下注
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.

And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first President.

and quiet for a while.

艾斯让我儿子，小尼奇
参加市区青少棒，真的很好
NICKY: Ace got Little Nicky
involved with Little League. It was great.

563
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:18,145
结果其中的一位教练
是市立警察局情报单位的
Turned out that one of the other coaches
was a metro intelligence cop.

564
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,771
不过无所谓，这纯粹是孩子的事
But it didn't matter. It was all about the kids.

565
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:23,357

He's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run.

566
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:26,946
我也是这样告诉他

That's exactly what I tell him,

the bosses sent me out here.

were knocking this place dead for years.

632
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,468
-他身上有窃听器
-你在干嘛？
GUARD 1 : He's wired.
HUSTLER: What are you doing?

633
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:03,269
在那儿，就是它了
GUARD 1 : There it is. That's it.

634
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:05,353
-老千的正法
-我的天！
GUARD 2: Cheater's justice.
HUSTLER: Oh, God!

635
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,652
[Saw whirring]

636
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,181
不！
No!

637
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:13,358
我要所有人知道这儿跟以往不同了
SAM: I wanted everybody to
know that things were changed around here.

638
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:17,868
我们得用这些家伙来让大家知道
他们的好日子不长了
We had to make an example of these pricks
that the party was over.

639
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,987
我很好奇
I'm just curious.

640
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:22,620
我看到你用右手玩筹码
I saw you shuffling your checks
with your right hand.

641
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,707
-你两只手都可以这样吗？
-不
-Can you do that with both hands?
-No.

642
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:28,196
-不能用两只手吗？
-不能
SAM: You can't do it with both hands?
HUSTLER: No, sir.

643
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,697
-左手可以吗？
-我从没试过
-Can you do it with your left hand?
-I never tried.

644
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,999
-所以你是右撇子
-是
-So, you're a righty.
-Yeah.

645
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:46,756
那你现在得学习用左手罗
Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

646
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:50,426
-十万，不，十一万吧
-是啊
-It's $100,000, $1 10,000 I think.
-Yes, it is.

647
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,632
好的
Okay.

648
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,267
嗨
Hi.

649
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,813
在大庭广众数这么多钱
That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

650
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,487
为何不让我拿到办公室确认？
Why don't I take him
over to the office and verify it?

651
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:03,652
多一点隐私
A little privacy.

652
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:07,318
顺便叫一瓶好香槟来
By the way, send over
a nice bottle of champagne on ice.

653
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,162
-没问题
-要很特别的
CASHIER: Sure will.
BILLY: Real special.

654
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,124
对了，我是赌场经理
比利雪伯堤
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert,
casino manager.

655
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,209
-还玩得愉快吗？
-是的
BILLY: Having a good time?
HUSTLER 2: Yes.

656
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,329
你在较有隐私的地方算比较好
You want to count the money in privacy.

657
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,627
我得赶飞机去克里夫兰
我可以领取我赢得的钱吗？
HUSTLER 2: I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?

658
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,344
看他们对我的手做了什么
Look what they did to my hand, man.

659
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:29,471
我给你一个选择
SAM: I'm gonna give you a choice:

660
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:33,146
你可以拿钱然后被锤头砸
或者是从这儿走出去
You can have the money and the hammer,
or you can walk out of here.

661
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:35,315
-你要哪个？
-我要走
-What do you want?
-I wanna get out of here.

662
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,529
告诉你那群朋友，他们若来乱搞
会发生什么事
Tell your friends what happens
if they fuck around here.

663
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:42,567
-对不起，我犯了大错
-你真他妈的说对了
-I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
-You're fucking right.

664
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:46,238
你们要是再敢回来
我会敲烂你们的头
SAM: If you come back, either one
of you, we'll break your fucking heads.

665
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:49,909
你看到那锯子没？不是放着好看的
我们不是在开玩笑
You see that fucking saw? We're gonna
use it. We don't fuck around here.

666
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,034
-懂吗？
-是
SAM: Got it?
HUSTLER 2: Yes.

667
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,707
-给我滚
-谢谢你
-Get out of here.
-Thank you.

668
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:56,962
把他丢到后街去
跟条子说他被车撞到了
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.

669
00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:59,220
不到一会儿，一切就都搞定了
SAM: Within no time,
everything was set in place.

670
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:02,592
我们弄走了那些老千
盈利上扬好多…
We got rid of the freelance scamsters,
the pro was way up...

671
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,852
上头老大高兴极了
the gods were happy,
or as happy as the gods can ever be.

672
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,547
然后我决定将生活复杂化
And I decided to complicate my life.

673
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,065
对不爱冒险的我来说…
For a guy who likes sure things...

674
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:12,945
我用我的下半辈子
下了笔胜算不大的赌注
I was about to bet the rest of my life
on a real long shot.

675
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:14,732
我们也不年轻了
We're not getting any younger.

676
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:16,407
你不觉得是时候了？
Don't you think it's time?

677
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,486
你对这些不厌烦吗？
这边睡、那边混？
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?

678
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:23,789
-你想要妨碍我吗？
-我想给你更好的
-Are you trying to handicap me?
-I'm gonna do you one better.

679
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:26,210
我想娶你进门
I'm trying to marry you.

680
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:28,995
你想嫁我吗？
SAM: You wanna marry me?

681
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,092
我说真的
SAM: I'm serious.

682
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,761
我想定下来，想有个家
I wanna settle down. I want a family.

683
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,471
你找错人了，山姆
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

684
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:42,142
我会是个好爸爸
你也将是个好妈妈
I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

685
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:43,600
你不知道我
You don't know me.

686
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,270
你才认识我两、三个月
你了解什么？
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?

687
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,608
我已经43岁了，我不想再等了
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

688
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:52,406
我对你的了解深到
令我自己知道我非常爱你
I know you well enough
to know that I really love you very much.

689
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,735
你是我心目中最理想的人
I can't think of anybody better to be with.

690
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:58,204
我不想再等了
I don't feel like waiting anymore.

691
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:03,791
你见过很多婚姻美满的人吗？
我可没见过
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.

692
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:06,503
这我都懂
I know all that.

693
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,702
[Sighs]

694
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:12,795
我在乎你
I care about you.

695
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:16,680
但我对你没有那种感觉
But I just don't have
those kind of feelings for you.

696
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,724
对不起，我并不爱你
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

697
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,653
-好的
-懂吗？
SAM: All right.
GINGER: Understand?

698
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,154
对不起
GINGER: I'm sorry.

699
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,109
不…
No....

700
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,085
那可以培养
That can grow.

701
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:41,332
只要互相尊重
感情是可以培养的
As long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

702
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:44,796
我很现实，我可以接受
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

703
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:47,554
爱到底是什么？
SAM: What is love anyway?

704
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,260
不就是互相尊重
不就是一心一意
SAM: It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

705
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:53,228
是一个人在乎另一个人
It's a caring from one person to another.

706
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:57,439
若我们可以设立一个基础…
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

707
00:40:58,235 --> 00:40:59,978
以相互尊重为底…
based on that mutual respect...

708
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:04,069
我觉得迟早你会对我有情…
I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me...

709
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:05,950
这样我能接受
that I could live with that.

710
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,033
若行不通的话…
If it doesn't work out...

711
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,788
若行不通的话
那我怎么办？
if it doesn't play out,
then what happens to me?

712
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:16,088
我现在做得不错
往后会越来越好
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.

713
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,132
不论如何…
So whatever happens...

714
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,633
就算我们俩行不通…
if it doesn't work out between us...

715
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,334
我都会确保你下半辈子的生活
I'll make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

716
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,590
尤其如果有了孩子…
If there are kids, especially...

717
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,344
我会给你今生最好的照料
I'll take care of you better
than you'd imagine.

718
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:30,803
-你葫芦到底卖什么药？
-我都明讲了
GINGER: What are you pitching me?
SAM: Just what I said.

719
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,474
你下半辈子都不用愁
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.

720
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,444
这我可保证
That I can promise you.

721
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,440
要不要试试？
Want to take a chance?

722
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:47,463
[Applause and clinking glasses]

723
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:51,202
[Romantic instrumental music]

724
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:55,419
我娶金吉儿时就听过她的一切往事…
SAM: When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories...

725
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:58,220
但我不在乎
我是山姆罗斯坦
but I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

726
00:41:58,346 --> 00:41:59,425
我能改变她
I can change her.

727
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,517
这是典型的艾斯
NICKY: It was typical Ace.

728
00:42:03,644 --> 00:42:06,894
他请了城里所有的大人物
他知道他们都会出席
He invited the biggest people in town.
He knew they'd show.

729
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,395
他知道他们都有求于他
He knew they all wanted
something from him.

730
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,729
艾斯绝对不可能不求回报
连金吉儿也不例外
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger.

731
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,690
一切还是依他行事
With her, he still covered his bets.

732
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,860
他们在结婚前得先有孩子
They had to have the baby first,
before they could get married.

733
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,443
他甚至还托我们帮忙看艾美几天…
He even made us watch Amy
for a few days...

734
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,038
好让他们去渡蜜月
when they went on their honeymoon.

735
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,832
无所谓啊
我们爱死那孩子
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.

736
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:29,923
你感到我的眼神？
LESTER: Can you feel my eyes on you?

737
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,586
你感到我看透你的心吗？
Can you feel me look into your heart?

738
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:37,172
你能感到我躺在你肚皮上吗？
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?

739
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:42,187
你能在体内感受我？
Can you feel me in you?

740
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,306
在心里？
In your heart?

741
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,779
别等我过去
Don't make me come there.

742
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:52,407
回答我
Answer me.

743
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:54,326
我爱你
GINGER: [Crying] I love you.

744
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:56,575
宝贝，你知道我也爱你吗？
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?

745
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:58,823
-不，莱斯特
-你知道吗？
GINGER: No, Lester.
LESTER: Do you know that?

746
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:00,031
知道
GINGER: Yes.

747
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,413
这是我目前能为自己做的
最好的事
This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now.

748
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,745
没错
That's right.

749
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,625
所以会没事的
So it's going to be okay.

750
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:07,957
你发誓？
Promise?

751
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,925
我希望你幸福
I wish you all the luck in the world.

752
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,799
-真的？
-是，我真的这么想
GINGER: You do?
LESTER: Yeah, I do.

753
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:17,180
这是你目前能做的最好的事
It's the best thing you can do right now.

754
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:19,147
我说真的
I mean this.

755
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:21,356
你生活会很安稳
You have real security.

756
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:25,310
甜心，你将坐在赌城最有利的位子
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated
just right in Vegas.

757
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,695
这对我们来说再好不过了
Come on. This is great for us.

00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:26,850
-妈的，你给我滚
-去你的！
GUARD: Bullshit. You're out of here.
MAN: Fuck you!

887
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,315
你知道你在招惹谁吗？
你知道吗？
MAN: You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?

888
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:33,561
你他妈的王八蛋！
你知道你招惹了谁吗？
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?

889
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:35,403
别碰我！
MAN: Leave me alone!

890
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:38,064
-喂！
-别闹了！
GUARD: Come on!
MAN: You gotta be kidding me!

891
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:41,405
不出所料，我一小时后就接到电话
SAM: Sure enough, an hour later,
I get the call.

892
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:45,318
艾斯，那边怎么了？
你知道那家伙是跟我的吗？
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

893
00:51:45,456 --> 00:51:47,578
我不知道，你知道他做了什么吗？
I didn't know that. You know what he did?

894
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:51,123
我很有礼貌的走过去
他却叫我回家吃自已
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

895
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:53,210
-还骂我是臭玻璃
-什么？
SAM: Then he called me a faggot.
NICKY: What?

896
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,586
-我把那王八蛋踢出去了
-过来
SAM: I threw that cocksucker out.
NICKY: Come here.

897
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:58,962
你骂我的朋友臭玻璃
还叫他回家吃自己？
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?

898
00:51:59,052 --> 00:52:01,507
你这样说？
叫他回家吃自己？
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

899
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,931
你这个死乡巴佬！
NICKY: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!

900
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,933
你给我过去道歉
NICKY: You go over there. You apologize.

901
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:10,888
你最好求他让你进去
NICKY: You better hope he lets you back in.

902
00:52:11,022 --> 00:52:14,188
你要再敢没大没小
我会将你的头打到…
If you get out of line again,
I'll smash your head so hard...

903
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:17,441
你连那牛仔帽都戴不上
死乡巴佬
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on. Fucking hick.

904
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:22,189
听着，这家伙压根就不知道
自己在跟谁说话
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

905
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:24,862
他不知道我们是好兄弟
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

906
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:27,160
他非常抱歉
He's already very sorry.

907
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:30,116
但如果你可买我个面子
让他再进去…
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

908
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:32,662
我发誓他再也不会乱来
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

909
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:35,077
若他再敢乱来，就别想再踏进这儿
If he does it again, he's out for good.

910
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:37,334
我永远都不会再让他进门
I'll never let him in the place again.

911
00:52:37,464 --> 00:52:39,006
真是对不起
NICKY: I'm sorry about this.

912
00:52:39,508 --> 00:52:42,212
好吗，艾斯？
谢了，兄弟
All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

913
00:52:43,387 --> 00:52:46,755
你把鞋都脱了？
把脚放在桌上？
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

914
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:51,101
你这全身马粪骚的混蛋！
You shit-kicking, stinky,
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

915
00:52:51,228 --> 00:52:54,312
你要敢再去丢我的脸
我会在沙漠里将你埋了
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.

916
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:56,976
-快给我去道歉
-尼奇，对不起
NICKY: Go over and apologize.
MAN: Nicky, I'm sorry.

917
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:03,562
艾斯可是个很敏感的人
NICKY: Ace could be a very touchy guy.

918
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:05,904
尤其是当他在城里越来越出名后
Especially when he got bigger in town.

919
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:09,195
像他将强纳森与大卫
从凯撒宫挖角来时…
Like when he hired Jonathan and David
away from the Palace...

920
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:12,697
他为他们盖了全新的舞台
还给了他们一人一辆劳斯莱斯
by building them a new stage
and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.

921
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:15,744
但我得说
他真的知道怎么吸引群众
But, I tell you,
he knew how to bring in the crowds.

922
00:53:15,877 --> 00:53:17,916
他懂得一切门路
He knew all the fucking angles.

923
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,535
他将整个蛇蝎美人的秀
从巴黎搬来…
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show
from Paris...

924
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,876
但他却忘记那些欧洲跳舞妹有多懒
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

925
00:53:24,009 --> 00:53:28,053
他还得每周为她们秤体重
她们的身材才不至于像吹气球
He had to weigh them once a week
so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.

926
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,804
你还是4公斤过重
You're still eight pounds over.

927
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,595
-为什么会这样？
-罗斯坦您…
-What's the reason for this?
-Mr. Rothstein, sir--

928
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:35,929
别在那儿您了
她为什么会超重4公斤？
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

929
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:38,060
我只是尊重您
I'm trying to use respect.

930
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,515
罗斯坦先生就可以了
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

931
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:44,227
嗯，有时当你给她们
太多的压力…
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

932
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:47,607
你只需要给我答案
给我正确答案就好
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

933
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:51,743
我不知道，她害怕要是不减肥
她就会被解雇
I don't know why. She's frightened
if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.

934
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,532
没错，她会被解雇
送她回巴黎…
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

935
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,703
-我们一贯的做法是…
-停
-It's been our policy--
-Stop everything.

936
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:59,786
-她很出名
-这就是问题，她太懒散
AGENT: She's an institution.
SAM: That's the problem. She's lazy.

937
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,037
我得佩服这家伙
NICKY: I gotta give the guy credit.

938
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:04,377
我的意思是
他做了最明显的事
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

939
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:07,757
这里是全国唯一可以合法签注的地方
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

940
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:09,960
为什么不加以利用呢？
So why not take advantage, right?

941
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:12,551
所以他把签注从街上…
So he took bookie joints off the street...

942
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,513
开到赌场内
and opened them up inside the casino.

943
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:17,194
没几年后…
Within a few years, he had...

944
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:20,145
精华地段的每家赌场都想抄袭他
every casino on The Strip
trying to copy off of him.

945
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:21,979
我的创意…
SAM: Between my innovations...

946
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:28,023
加上尼奇对工作的投入…
and Nicky's dedication to his job...

947
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:33,147
我的赌场很快就成为
精华地段中最好的赌场
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.

948
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:39,534
小心点，你最近很引人注目
Watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you.

949
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:41,999
怎么，有人抱怨吗？
Why, somebody is complaining?

950
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:44,622
我从警卫那儿听来的
他们以前都曾是警察
I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.

951
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:47,334
警长已将你放入黑名单了
The sheriff wants to put you
in the Black Book.

952
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,504
那黑名单根本就是个屁
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.

953
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:51,667
全国只有两个人的名字在里面
There's two names in it
for the whole country...

954
00:54:51,803 --> 00:54:53,546
教父艾尔卡邦就是其中之一
and one of them is still Al Capone.

955
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,431
你上了名单麻烦就大了
They put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

956
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:59,012
你将进不了赌场
You won't be able to walk into a casino.

957
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:01,890
我只不过是在养家活口罢了
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

958
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:04,891
我只是跟你讲一声
别说我没警告你
I'm just telling you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

959
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:08,703
[Upbeat swing music]

960
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:13,942
罗斯坦夫人，请看前面
很好，谢谢你
PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. Rothstein,
straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you.

961
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:16,709
[People chattering]

962
00:55:19,538 --> 00:55:21,613
因他的努力与认真…
PHILIP: For his hard work and dedication...

963
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:24,993
与他为拉斯维加斯带来的新生命…
and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas...

964
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:28,044
山姆将自己建立为赌博游乐业界…
Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member...

965
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:30,210
不可缺乏的成员
of the gaming community.

966
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:32,920
以坦吉乐赌博游乐集团
董事长的名义…
As the head of
the Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

967
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:35,423
我很容幸为你们介绍
山姆罗斯坦…
it's my pleasure to welcome
Sam Rothstein...

968
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:37,260
维加斯谷乡村俱乐部新成员
to the Vegas Valley Country Club.

969
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,769
[Applause]

970
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:44,561
嘉许状

971
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:47,356
要是在老家，我所做的
早就让我蹲牢房去了
SAM: Back home, they'd put me in jail
for what I'm doing.

972
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,681
但在这儿，他们却颁奖给我
But out here, they're giving me awards.

973
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:54,194
我很荣幸能获得…
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

974
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,817
拉斯维加斯慈善基金会
颁发的嘉许奖状
from the Charitable Foundations
of Greater Las Vegas.

975
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,736
恭喜你，甜心
Congratulations, sweetheart.

976
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:02,406
山姆募得了有史来
最多的捐款
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

977
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:07,781
但我最爱的还是看着我老婆
金吉儿周旋全场
SAM: But my greatest pleasure
was watching my wife work the room.

978
00:56:08,794 --> 00:56:11,545
他们爱死她了
但你又怎能不爱她？
They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

979
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,997
她是世上最有魅力的女人
She could be the most charming woman
you ever saw.

980
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,675
人们都喜欢在她身边
People loved to be around her.

981
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:18,433
你一定得带艾美来参加
莎夏的生日派对
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

982
00:56:18,522 --> 00:56:21,274
星期六下午三点
我们很希望她能来
LADY: We'd love to have her there.
3:00, Saturday.

983
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,818
-好的
-太好了
-Yes, okay.
-Great.

984
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:25,691
她让大家都开心
SAM: She made everybody feel good.

985
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:34,998
-恭喜你，山姆
-谢谢
-Congratulations, Sam.
-Thanks.

986
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,603
嗨，罗斯坦夫人，你好吗？
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?

987
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:44,151
你是我见过最美丽的女人
罗斯坦先生，你真是个幸运的男人
You're one of the most gorgeous women
I've seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

988
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:49,287
多谢夸奖
Thanks for that compliment.

989
00:56:50,629 --> 00:56:54,129
他是赌场里的小伙子
挺好又聪明的小子
SAM: He was a young kid
from the casino. Nice kid. Bright boy.

990
00:56:54,634 --> 00:56:57,421
这小子真他妈的带种
我第二天就炒了他
What balls on this fucking kid.
The next day I fired him.

991
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,806
金吉儿对人就是有这种魅力
她甚至鼓励他们这样
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

992
00:57:02,894 --> 00:57:04,637
你想看看这件吗？
GINGER: Do you wanna see this one?

993
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:06,623
[Ginger exclaims]

994
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:10,441
爸爸帮我买了这么多珠宝
因为他好爱我
GINGER: Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

995
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,691
但不管他们多爱她…
SAM: But as much as they loved her...

996
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:13,902
真美丽
GINGER: Fabulous.

997
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:15,907
他们都不知道什么让她感动
...they didn't know what really moved her.

998
00:57:15,994 --> 00:57:18,319
看看这个
GINGER: Look at this.

999
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:20,069
爸爸给我的…
GINGER: Daddy gave me....

1000
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:24,336
金吉儿快快乐乐的
我才能专心去做我所专长的…
SAM: With Ginger happy, I was
able to concentrate on what I knew best.

1001
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:27,246
较松的机器都在后面
Loose machines are right back over there.

1002
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,508
它们在那儿干嘛？
看都看不到
What are they doing back there?
You can't even see them.

1003
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:31,836
好吧
Okay.

1004
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,088
那最大累积奖金的那些呢？
What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1005
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:37,677
这些是我们最好的机子
都是靠它们
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

1006
00:57:37,813 --> 00:57:40,767

1121
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,467
-谢了
-慢慢享用
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it. Have a good time.

1122
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,674
-噎死你，王八蛋
-嗨，小多
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.

1123
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:57,007
你怎么样？
How you doing?

1124
01:03:57,185 --> 01:04:00,969
是啊，尼奇很喜欢餐馆
他对开餐厅也很拿手
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1125
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,764
这么多年来，他逢开餐厅必赚
And over the years,
he always made money with them.

1126
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:07,271
他在拉斯维加斯开了比萨斜塔
很受大家欢迎
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1127
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:11,487
常有政客、脱衣舞娘
还有电影明星光顾
He had politicians, showgirls
and movie stars hanging out all over.

1128
01:04:11,912 --> 01:04:14,154
佛罗明哥的那场秀越做越好罗
That show at The Flamingo
gets better and better.

1129
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:17,535
对了，山姆说
请你有空时打个电话给他
By the way, Sammy said whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1130
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,541
-你也变传话的了啊？
-有钱我什么都做啊
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.

1131
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:24,042
-他对每个人都这样，好好享用晚餐
-谢啦
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

1132
01:04:24,177 --> 01:04:27,878
尼奇最喜欢的
当然就是脱衣舞娘
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls.

1133
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:30,091
对她们来说，尼奇像是电影名星
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

1134
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:33,013
-你就这样走过？
-这是雪莉
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.

1135
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:35,145
-嗨，雪莉，你好吗？
-嗨
-Hi, Shelly. How are you?
-Hi.

1136
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:36,727
这是史黛希
This is Stacy.

1137
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:40,064
-这是尼克，想吃晚餐吗？一起吧
-好啊
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on.
-All right.

1138
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:42,688
我带你去厨房看看
失陪一下
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1139
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:46,319
来吧，我带你去
我每天都空运新鲜的东西进来
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1140
01:04:46,413 --> 01:04:49,663
我从老家运面包
从加州运鱼
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1141
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:53,327
光从我们用奶喂食的小牛肉就看得出
我们绝对是好餐厅
You can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1142
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,294
这就是诀窍
奶喂小牛的肉是纯白色的
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1143
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:59,464
其他餐馆都用那种粉红色的小牛肉
过去点，甜心
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1144
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,093
粉红色的那种小牛肉
你就算是追个两天两夜
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

1145
01:05:04,227 --> 01:05:06,765
它还是不会变嫩
你懂我的意思吗？
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1146
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:10,727
我从这儿拿钱离开时
在街上被抢了
AL: I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1147
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:14,105
是几个我欠钱的家伙
所以我把钱给他们了
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1148
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,280
-就是这样
-是吗？
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?

1149
01:05:16,617 --> 01:05:18,325
你还敢自称是男人吗？
You call yourself a man?

1150
01:05:18,453 --> 01:05:22,783
你知道你是个撒谎的杂碎
他妈的烂赌的狗东西吗？
You know you're a lying lowlife,
motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

1151
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,539
你知道自己是什么东西吗？
家里有两个小孩
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1152
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,663
我给你钱付房租…
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

1153
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,791
买菜、开暖气
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1154
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,427
你知道你老婆打给法兰克
说家里连暖气都被停了吗？
You know your wife called Frankie
and told him the fucking heat's off?

1155
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,969
你没拿钱去赌吗？
你敢这样跟我说吗？
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?

1156
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:37,684
-你没有吗？
-没有
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.

1157
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:40,972
别耍我，艾尔！
别把我当傻子
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1158
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:44,187
你当我是傻子是吧？
你没去赌？
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

1159
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:48,859
告诉我你把钱拿去赌掉了
我就给你钱回去交电费！
Tell me you gambled the money and
I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

1160
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,980
有没有赌？
Did you gamble?

1161
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,167
真是他妈的狗东西
Fucking degenerate, you.

1162
01:05:58,169 --> 01:05:59,449
孩子在家里
Fucking kids at home.

1163
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,341
拿去，给我滚
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1164
01:06:06,346 --> 01:06:07,970
-谢了，尼克
-是啊，谢了
AL: Thanks, Nick.
NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

1165
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:10,969
若被我知道是你搞砸的
我会把你扔在我找到你的地方
If I find out you fucked up,
I'll leave you where I find you.

1166
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:14,344
-你要吃几个？
-两个
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR.: Two.

1167
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:18,019
但早上六点半，当他下班时…
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m.,
when he finished his day...

1168
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,310
不管他在那里或是在做什么…
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1169
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:23,525
他都会回家为儿子，小尼奇做早餐
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1170
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,191
我知道你喜欢
NICKY: I know you like this.

1171
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:29,329
一点点牛油，对不对？
不要很多，你知道为什么，对不对？
NICKY: A little butter, right?
Not a lot. You know why, right?

1172
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:32,201
-为什么？
-因为会堵塞心脏
NICKY: Why?
NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1173
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:35,086
你真是聪明的孩子
What a smart kid you are.

1174
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,046
快吃吧
NICKY: Okay, eat.

1175
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:40,297
每隔几个礼拜我就会派玛雷诺
去老大那儿…
NICKY: Every couple of weeks,
I sent Marino back to the bosses...

1176
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:44,303
在老家
也分他们一份
当然不是很多，但他们哪知道？
BACK HOME
with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

1177
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:48,019
他们在2500里外，天高皇帝远
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1178
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:50,350
收货地点是个修车场…
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1179
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:53,569
利蒙他们以前常在那儿数钱
where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count their millions.

1180
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:57,574
条子们也知道，但他们不在乎
他们早协议好了
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.

1181
01:06:57,702 --> 01:06:59,576
尼奇向你们问好
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1182
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,702
我知道怎样让老大们服服帖帖
NICKY: I knew how to keep
the bosses happy.

1183
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,159
每当他们有些小事需要我做
例如传个话之类的…
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message...

1184
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:08,913
我一定做到完美
I would carry things out to a "T."

1185
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:13,261
就像那次东尼道格
那个听说是城里的新硬汉…
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1186
01:07:13,388 --> 01:07:15,096
在利蒙的一家酒吧乱开枪
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1187
01:07:20,063 --> 01:07:22,850
这混蛋打死了两个利蒙的手下…
Here's a fucking guy
who kills two of Remo's guys...

1188
01:07:22,983 --> 01:07:26,684
还有一个代班的倒霉女侍者
and a poor fucking waitress
who was just working on her night off.

1189
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:33,028
这家伙根本就
等着被我们杀鸡儆猴
This guy's just begging
to be made an example of.

1190
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:36,782
我要知道当天有谁跟他一起动手
I want the names of all the other people
he had with him.

1191
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:40,536
我要你不择手段去查
懂不懂？
I don't care what you have to do to them
to get them. You understand?

1192
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,828
我搞定，利蒙
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

1193
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,003
说真的，我还蛮佩服这混蛋的
NICKY: To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this fucking guy.

1194
01:07:46,137 --> 01:07:48,509
他真是我所遇过
最硬脖子的爱尔兰人
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1195
01:07:49,016 --> 01:07:50,759
这家伙真是个硬汉
This son of a bitch was tough.

1196
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,727
我们痛殴了他两天两夜
For two days and two nights,
we beat the shit out of him.

1197
01:07:54,814 --> 01:07:56,854
还用冰锉刺他的G丸
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1198
01:07:57,109 --> 01:08:00,063
他最好快吐个名字出来
法兰克，要不然我就递你的上去
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name,
or I'll give him yours, Frank.

1199
01:08:00,196 --> 01:08:01,227
谢谢喔
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

1200
01:08:01,364 --> 01:08:02,395
但他守口如瓶
NICKY: But he never talked.

1201
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,199
我知道你要供早就供了
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

1202
01:08:04,285 --> 01:08:06,990
最后，我还得他妈的把他的头
摆在夹板里
NICKY: In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

1203
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:09,534
你听到了没？
NICKY: Can you hear me?

1204
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,996
听好，你的头在夹板里
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

1205
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:17,210
再不给我个名字
我就夹爆你的头
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

1206
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,668
别逼我这么做，拜托你快说吧
NICKY: Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.

1207
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,927
别逼我当坏人
Don't make me be a bad guy.

1208
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:24,964
去你的
Fuck you.

1209
01:08:25,144 --> 01:08:28,181
王八蛋，你相信吗？
他妈的两天两夜
Motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.

1210
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:31,269
去我的？你这个王八蛋！
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1211
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:34,107
去我老母？
你是这意思是吧？
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?

1212
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,857
你这混蛋！
You motherfucker!

1213
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,328
天呀，给我一个名字！
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

1214
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:41,824
查理
Charlie M.

1215
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,493
-查理
-查理？
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?

1216
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:47,504
你逼我将你眼珠都爆出来…
You make me pop your eye out your head...

1217
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:49,416
就为了保护这狗屁名字？
to protect that piece of shit?

1218
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:52,466
王八蛋加蠢才！
You dumb motherfucker!

1219
01:08:52,553 --> 01:08:54,261
杀了我啊，混蛋！
Kill me, you fuck!

1220
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:56,549
你这王八蛋！
You motherfucker!

1221
01:08:57,059 --> 01:08:59,301
法兰克，你帮帮他吧
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

1222
01:08:59,687 --> 01:09:02,059
镇上流传着…
SAM: Word got around that finally...

1223
01:09:02,032 --> 01:09:04,072
说这儿终于出了个真的帮派份子
there was a real gangster in town.

1224
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:07,278
尼奇成了拉斯维加斯的新老大
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

1225
01:09:07,383 --> 01:09:08,748
NICKY: Charlie M.

1226
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,287
[Coins clinking]

1227
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:16,999
四个轮，一排七个
三个一万五的奖金
SAM: Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.

1228
01:09:17,176 --> 01:09:19,050
你知道这机率是多少吗？
You have any idea what the odds are?

1229
01:09:19,178 --> 01:09:21,087
要好几百万，可能更多
It's gotta be in the millions. Maybe more.

1230
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:22,298
二十分钟内三个大奖？
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?

1231
01:09:22,498 --> 01:09:25,590
你为什么没停机？
为什么没通知我？
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?

1232
01:09:25,686 --> 01:09:28,355
发生得太快，一下就三个人赢
我还没机会
It happened quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

1233
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:30,397
你没看到出千吗？
You didn't see the scam?

1234
01:09:30,526 --> 01:09:31,985
这无法确定
There's no way to determine that.

1235
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:34,227
有，绝对有
他们赢了就是最好的证据
Yes, there is. An infallible way. They won!

1236
01:09:34,364 --> 01:09:37,033
这里是赌场，总会有人赢的
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

1237
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,619
你气死我了
你在污辱我的智慧
You're pissing me off.
You're insulting my intelligence.

1238
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:41,861
你认为我是白痴？
You think I'm an idiot?

1239
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,243
一定有人对转轮动了手脚
Somebody had to get into those machines
and set the reels.

1240
01:09:45,377 --> 01:09:48,164
一台机的机率是一百五十万比一
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1241
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:51,625
连续三台的机率是好几兆比一
这根本不可能
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions. It can't happen.

1242
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,420
你到底是怎么了？
SAM: What's the matter with you?

1243
01:09:53,554 --> 01:09:56,804
你难道不知道你被骗了吗？
Didn't you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1244
01:09:56,933 --> 01:10:00,183
-你没看到吗？
-我觉得你有些反应过度
-You didn't see that?
-I think you're overreacting.

1245
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:02,021
听着，智障，我受够你了
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.

1246
01:10:02,148 --> 01:10:04,188
我从到这儿时就一直罩你
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.

1247
01:10:04,443 --> 01:10:06,317
把东西收收走吧
Get your things and get out of here.

1248
01:10:06,445 --> 01:10:09,861
-你开除我？
-我就开除你
-You're firing me?
-I'm firing you.

1249
01:10:10,075 --> 01:10:12,946
-你可能会后悔
-留你我一定后悔
-You might regret this.
-I'll regret it if I keep you.

1250
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:16,614
-不应该这样对人
-若你不知道有人出千…
-This is not the way to treat people.
-If you didn't know about the scam...

1251
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,502
你就蠢到不配在这儿工作
若你知道，你就是共犯
you're too dumb to work here.
If you did, you were in on it.

1252
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:21,585
不管怎样，你都得走
Either way, you're out. Go on.

1253
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:26,297
在我看来那家伙已经被炒了
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.

1254
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:29,383
你不能开除他
他的姐夫是县辅导
You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1255
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:33,466
这里每个穿马靴的不是辅导
就是辅导的亲戚
Everyone out here with cowboy boots
is a commissioner or related to one.

1256
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,979
我受够了
I'm sick of this.

1257
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,229
这是他的州，他的叔叔是大法官
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.

1258
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:39,731
他的姐夫管理县委员会
His brother-in-law runs
the County Commission.

1259
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,777
一定有方法让他回来
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

1260
01:10:41,948 --> 01:10:45,898
你是搞帐目的，在楼上
你看不到下面发生的事
You're in the finances, upstairs.
You don't see what's going on.

1261
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,830
我有上千的赌客
却只有五百个庄家
I've got thousands of players.
I got 500 dealers.

1262
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,662
他们每天24小时都在想着
怎么将我抢空
They're all looking to rob me blind
24 hours a day.

1263
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:54,996
我必须要让他们知道
我随时都在注意每个细节
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1264
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,753
我不会漏掉任何一样事情
That there is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1265
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,675
看你的，看
SAM: Look at yours. Look at that.

1266
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:04,347
再看这个，什么都没有
SAM: Look at this. There's nothing.

1267
01:11:04,476 --> 01:11:06,433
你看你的蓝莓那么多
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.

1268
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,267
-我一个都没有
-你在说什么？
-I have nothing.
-What are you talking about?

1269
01:11:09,357 --> 01:11:12,109
自己不动手做就弄不好
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1270
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:13,517
你要去哪儿？
PHILIP: Where are you going?

1271
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:19,358
从现在开始
我要你全都放同份量的蓝莓
SAM: From now on, I want you to put an
equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1272
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:22,609
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1273
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:25,500
你知道那多花时间吗？
Do you know how long that will take?

1274
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:29,370
我不管要多久
每个松饼的份量都要一致
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1275
01:11:33,762 --> 01:11:36,134
再吃一点，乖
Just a little. That a girl.

1276
01:11:38,852 --> 01:11:40,845
-你要找妈妈？
-来妈妈这儿？
SAM: Wanna go to Mommy?
GINGER: Wanna come to Mommy?

1277
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,771
好的，甜心
It's all right, sweetheart.

1278
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:46,185
我要跟你谈谈，我需要点钱
GINGER: I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1279
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:49,822
-你要什么？
-抱好了吗？
-What do you need?
-Got her?

1280
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:54,360
我需要很多，比平时要多
I need a lot. I need more than usual.

1281
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,578
为什么不从你户头领呢？
Why don't you take it out of your account?

1282
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:59,745
我本想，只是…
I would, it's just that...

1283
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:03,169
我需要更多，我要两万五
I need more than that. I need $25,000.

1284
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,759
两万五千元？
$25,000?

1285
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:08,720
-你自己要？
-是啊
-For yourself?
-Yeah.

1286
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:11,051
你为什么要那么多？
SAM: Why do you need that much?

1287
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:13,884
有什么差别？我需要就是了
What's the difference? I just need it.

1288
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,896
我一定得问啊
那很多钱耶，又不只是一盒爆米花
I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.

1289
01:12:18,151 --> 01:12:20,607
我们不用将这变成件大事
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.

1290
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:22,362
我们不用吵架
We don't have to have a fight.

1291
01:12:22,782 --> 01:12:26,365
只是对我很重要，算了
有些想做的事罢了
GINGER: It was important to me. Forget it.
Something I wanted to do.

1292
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:30,164
谁在吵架？
告诉我钱的用处
Who's fighting? Tell me what it's for.

1293
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:34,710
为什么不能告诉我？
Why can't you tell me what it's for?

1294
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:41,879
现在我要你告诉我
Now I want you to tell me.

1295
01:12:42,014 --> 01:12:45,882
我老婆跑来问我要两万五
你想买大衣吗？
My wife comes to me and asks me
for $25,000. Do you want a coat?

1296
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:48,391
-不
-如果想买大衣，就去买啊
GINGER: No.
SAM: If you want a coat, you got it.

1297
01:12:48,522 --> 01:12:51,096
不是钱的问题
只是，你为什么要？
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?

1298
01:12:51,276 --> 01:12:52,854
我无权过问吗？
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1299
01:12:52,986 --> 01:12:56,521
我一辈子都很独立
我从不为任何事求人
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1300
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:58,525
现在你要我求你是吧
Now you're making me beg you for this.

1301
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,037
-你在说什么？
-好，你还羞辱我
-What are you talking about?
-Okay? And you're embarrassing me.

1302
01:13:02,122 --> 01:13:04,957
-为什么得让我如此难受？
-你问我要两万五
Why make me feel so bad?
SAM: You're asking me for $25,000.

1303
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:08,453
我不是要让你难堪
我只是希望能信任你
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.

1304
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:10,162
是信任问题
It's about trust.

1305
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:13,959
我必须要连性命都能交托于你
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

1306
01:13:14,179 --> 01:13:15,554
你懂吗？
Do you understand?

1307
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:18,137
我能信任你吗？
Can I trust you?

1308
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:23,502
Can I trust you?

1309
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,400
我能吗？告诉我
Can I trust you? Answer me.

1310
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,279
你能
You can trust me.

1311
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,984
好，那你就可以告诉我
钱要拿来干嘛
Good. So then you can tell me
what the money is for.

1312
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:39,884
[Sentimental jazz music]

她现在正离开银行
She's leaving the bank now.

1314
01:13:59,944 --> 01:14:01,106
我跟着她
I'll follow her.

1315

那是什么？
LESTER: What is that?

1316
01:14:04,575 --> 01:14:06,484
我知道那神情，那表情是什么意思？
I know that look. What does that look mean?

1317
01:14:06,619 --> 01:14:08,078
意思是我有钱
GINGER: It means I got the money.

1318
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:29,601
你好吗？是莱斯特吧？
How are you doing? It's Lester, right?

1319
01:14:30,872 --> 01:14:32,032
Sam.

1320
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:40,072
我记得你不是玩牌老手…
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark...

1321
01:14:41,663 --> 01:14:44,700
高尔夫球骗子
比佛利山庄的皮条客吗？
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1322
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:48,747
若记错了，请纠正我
SAM: If I'm wrong, correct me.

1323

我从不知道你也是个小偷
I never knew you to be a heist man.

1324
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:53,383
不过如果是的话，这样吧
But if you are, you know what?

1325
01:14:54,596 --> 01:14:55,924
我的也拿去吧
Here, take mine, too.

1326
01:14:56,765 --> 01:14:59,090
拿吧，反正你已拿了她的
Take it. You already have hers.

1327
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:01,474
她是我老婆
She's my wife.

看着我
SAM: Look at me.

1329
01:15:04,024 --> 01:15:06,693
你知道吧？
你知道她是我老婆吧？
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew she's my wife?

1330
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:10,567
-看着我
-我知道
SAM: Look at me.
LESTER: I know that.

1331
01:15:10,657 --> 01:15:11,688
知道啊？
SAM: You do, yeah?

1332

你下次若再想回来…
If you ever come back again...

1333
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,877
拿她的钱，记得带枪
to take her money, next time bring a pistol.

1334
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:22,628
这样你才有机会
That way you got a chance.

1335
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:24,797
当个男人，别做皮条客
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.

Remember when you called him that night
and said goodbye to him?

1340

He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."

-He didn't say that, did he?
-No, he didn't.

before we got married.

1362
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:35,329
-这并不是什么新鲜事
-是吗？我并不知道
-This is no fucking surprise.
-You did? I didn't know that.

1363
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:39,208
他只是我的朋友
我想要帮他，有什么大不了？
He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

1364
01:17:41,136 --> 01:17:43,627
我第一次看到你们俩在一起时…
The first time I ever saw you guys together...

1365
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:46,098
我从未见他那么快乐过
I never saw him so happy.

1366
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:49,599
我知道他是个犹太疯子…
NICKY: I know he's a crazy Jew fuck
and everything...

1367
01:17:49,981 --> 01:17:53,433
但我从未见过他跟别人一起时这样
but I never seen him act like that
with anybody else.

1368
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,571
他为你疯狂
他真的很爱你
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.

1369
01:17:57,657 --> 01:17:59,400
-他真的是
-拜托
NICKY: He does.
GINGER: Come on.

1370
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:01,777
我是睁着双眼走进这关系的
I went into this with my eyes open.

1371
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:03,552
我知道随时都可能变卦
GINGER: I knew the bottom
could drop out any time.

1372
01:18:03,752 --> 01:18:08,033
我也混过，你真以为
我在没有保障的情况下…
I'm a working girl. You don't think
I'm gonna go into a situation like this...

1373
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:10,412
会走这条路吗？
if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?

1374
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:12,375
是啊，我可以了解
Sure, I can see that.

1375
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:16,714
他买了好多珠宝给我
好多好多
So he put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.

1376
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:19,846
很多贵重的珠宝？
大概值多少？
A lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?

1377
01:18:20,477 --> 01:18:21,936
你想偷吗？
You want to steal it?

1378
01:18:22,438 --> 01:18:26,306
不，只是好奇
我是在想…
No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

1379
01:18:26,693 --> 01:18:29,149
他会在那种东西里
投入多少钱
how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1380
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,513
他跟我说大约一百万
可能更多
I'm told it's worth about $1 million,
maybe more.

1381
01:18:31,713 --> 01:18:34,573
那就是罗
这说明了什么？
NICKY: There you go.
What does that tell you?

1382
01:18:34,703 --> 01:18:36,078
一百万的珠宝
$1 million in jewelry.

1383
01:18:36,873 --> 01:18:38,949
这不说明了他爱你爱到疯了吗？
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?

1384
01:18:39,084 --> 01:18:40,792
我根本就不该嫁给他的
I should have never married him.

1385
01:18:41,712 --> 01:18:44,832
他是双子座的，双子加三级，两面人
He's a Gemini. Triple Gemini. Duality.

1386
01:18:46,009 --> 01:18:48,678
双子座就像条蛇
你不能相信蛇
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.

1387
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:52,338
我说真的
I mean it.

1388
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:54,681
我懂你的意思，金吉儿，听着
I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

1389
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:59,475
这可能不是…
我也没有答案
This is probably not....
I don't have the answers anyway.

1390
01:18:59,607 --> 01:19:01,710
-这可能不是你想听的
-我想
-This is probably not what you want to hear.
-I do.

1391
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:04,688
你不高兴，我可以理解…
You're a little upset, and I understand that.

1392
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:10,454
但先撑着点吧
慢慢来，看看会发生什么事
But try to make the best of it now.
Go slow. See what happens.

1393
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:11,956
他差点杀了他！
He could've killed him!

1394
01:19:13,054 --> 01:19:16,124
他用不着打他
我又没跟他上床
He didn't have to hit him.
I'm not sleeping with the guy.

1395
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:19,045
他让我得偷偷摸摸的
跟我的朋友见面
He makes me sneak around
to see my own friends.

1396
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,961
这算什么呢？
What the fuck is that all about?

1397
01:19:21,062 --> 01:19:24,881
我想是因为他太爱你了吧
他吃醋又担心
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much,
he's jealous and worries.

1398
01:19:25,433 --> 01:19:27,473
谁会在乎我做什么？
Who gives a fuck what I do?

1399
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,906
我会试着问问到底怎样
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.

1400
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:33,939
-遇到他时我会跟他谈谈的
-好
-When I see him, I'll talk to him.
-Okay.

1401
01:19:34,277 --> 01:19:35,985
-可以吗？
-好
-All right?
-Yeah.

1402
01:19:36,678 --> 01:19:38,573
谢了…
Thanks...

1403
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,482
忍受我唠叨
for putting up with me.

1404
01:19:40,682 --> 01:19:44,786
别喝这么凶吧
这只会让情况更糟
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.

1405
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:46,221
你是个美女，别搞砸了
You're a beautiful girl. Don't ruin that.

1406
01:19:46,421 --> 01:19:50,187
我看过太多漂亮女孩
因这个变丑八怪
I've seen a lot of girls
get shot to hell from this stuff.

1407
01:19:50,425 --> 01:19:52,044
你真好
You're so nice.

1408
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:55,294
好了啦
我不想见你不快乐
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.

1409
01:19:57,866 --> 01:19:59,589
谢了
Thanks.

1410
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,857
没事啦
It's all right.

1411
01:20:14,382 --> 01:20:15,815
[Phone ringing]

1412
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,912
县辅导派特委布来见你
County Commissioner Pat Webb
is here to see you.

1413
01:20:22,421 --> 01:20:24,663
-等一下
-好的，请稍候
-Give me a minute.
-Okay. Just a minute.

1414
01:20:41,843 --> 01:20:44,319
你需要什么吗？
RECEPTIONIST: Can I get you anything?

1415
01:20:44,949 --> 01:20:46,776
不，谢谢，小姐
No, thank you, little lady.

1416
01:20:47,202 --> 01:20:49,325
让他进来，然后四分钟后打给我
Send him in and call me four minutes after.

1417
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:52,454
罗斯坦先生，我是派特委布
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.

1418
01:20:52,654 --> 01:20:53,555
你好吗？
How do you do?

1419
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:56,334
-幸会
-我常听起你的事
-It is a pleasure.
-I heard a lot about you.

1420
01:20:56,421 --> 01:20:59,339
过奖了，庄家最近还过得去
PAT: Thank you, sir. House is doing well.

1421
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:01,529
那么多钱滚滚而来
All that money is rolling in.

1422
01:21:01,729 --> 01:21:05,388
我很感激你愿意见我这老公仆
I appreciate you taking the time
to see a poor old civil servant.

1423
01:21:05,474 --> 01:21:07,846
-不如坐下吧？
-谢谢您
SAM: Why don't you have a seat?
PAT: Thank you, sir.

1424
01:21:08,203 --> 01:21:11,573
我是来亲自化解…
PAT: I come here personally
to smooth over...

1425
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:14,273
一些小误会的
any fracas about a certain matter.

1426
01:21:14,342 --> 01:21:16,694
你可能不知道…
Maybe you didn't know it...

1427
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:19,900
但道恩华德在镇上挺受欢迎的
but Don Ward is a very well-liked man
in this town.

1428
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:23,885
他有许多朋友
他们家族及产业也很久了
He's got lots of friends. His family
and their money go back many years.

1429
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:27,541
朋友是选民
家人与金钱都能助选
Friends vote, family and money votes.

1430
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:30,709
这对你我都很重要
That's important to me and you.

1431
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:35,835
若你从这个角度
来看我们这个小问题的话…
If you'll think about our little problem
along them lines...

1432
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:38,756
很抱歉我得这么说…
and you'll forgive me for saying it...

1433
01:21:39,058 --> 01:21:41,216
但他可能不该被开除
maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

1434
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,838
他非常清楚我们…
He knew about our getting hit...

1435
01:21:44,038 --> 01:21:47,008
在一瞬间被赢了三个大奖
但他却袖手旁观
on three big machines in a row,
and he did nothing about it.

1436
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:51,012
他要不是跟他们一伙
那很抱歉，他就是蠢到看不见
Either he was in on it
or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.

1437
01:21:51,212 --> 01:21:54,285
不论如何，我都无法让一个
这样的人在这儿工作
Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

1438
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:57,085
在将过错都推给道恩前…
Before we point the dirty end
of the stick at old Don...

1439
01:21:57,285 --> 01:21:59,788
我们得先确定有证据这样指控他
we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

1440
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:03,446
相信我，要是有证据
他早就被逮捕了
Believe me, if I could prove it,
he'd be under arrest.

1441
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:09,798
你确定要让赌博游乐委员会…
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board...

1442
01:22:09,998 --> 01:22:13,368
过目你与你的帮派朋友
尼奇的记录吗？
eyeballing your record
and your gangster pals like Nicky?

1443
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:16,681
我觉得你这样跟我说
有点太过份了
I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1444
01:22:16,813 --> 01:22:20,608
你所说的几乎是毁谤
你无权怀疑我的专业
What you're saying is libelous. You're
in no position to challenge my expertise.

1445
01:22:20,808 --> 01:22:24,045
我已尽我所能去
帮助并善待那孩子
I went way out of my way
to be helpful and courteous to that kid.

1446
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:27,549
他太弱了也很无能
他使这地方濒于险境
He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

1447
01:22:27,749 --> 01:22:29,751
我对他真的无能为力
There's not much more I can do for him.

1448
01:22:29,951 --> 01:22:31,851
这倒是真的
You have got me there.

1449
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:35,957
道恩就像公猪身上的奶头一样无用
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.

[Pat coughs]

1451
01:22:37,325 --> 01:22:39,790
但他还是我的小舅子…
But he is my brother-in-law...

1452
01:22:40,028 --> 01:22:42,630
我会当是我欠你的一个人情
and I would look on it
as a personal favor...

1453
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:45,765
若你愿意考虑重新聘用他
if you'd think some more
on hiring him back.

01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,679
我不能
I can't do that.

1455
01:22:48,136 --> 01:22:50,638
我知道他是你的小舅子
I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law.

and I like to do favors.

但我真的不能这么做
And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.

1458
01:22:57,845 --> 01:23:01,408
日后是否会有其它较适合的…
Could there be any position...

1459
01:23:01,883 --> 01:23:03,942

farther down the trough?

抱歉，并没有
I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

1461

最终还是他不能被信任
He's too incompetent.

01:24:25,233 --> 01:24:28,336
你不能让我完全不关心别人
GINGER: You can't make me stop
caring about people.

1485
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:31,351
-什么？
-我说…
SAM: What?
GINGER: I said...

1486
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:36,272
你不能让我完全不关心别人
you can't make me
stop caring about people.

1487
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,817
听着…
SAM: Listen...

1488
01:24:46,888 --> 01:24:49,707
我只想让一切比较好
I'm trying to make the best
of everything here.

1489
01:24:49,795 --> 01:24:51,953
老天啊，你是我老婆
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.

1490
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:55,550
镇上的人都很看重你
People look up to you in this town.

1491
01:24:55,636 --> 01:24:58,566
你知道吗，艾斯？
那关我屁事
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit.

1492
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:00,791
我要离开
I'm getting out of here.

1493
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:10,312
你冷静一点
SAM: You gotta get a hold of yourself.

1494
01:25:10,529 --> 01:25:12,403
-好
-不为我，也为艾美
GINGER: Okay.
SAM: If not for me, at least for Amy.

1495
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:16,155
懂吗，你酒喝得太过份了
SAM: Understand? Your drinking's
getting way out of hand.

1496
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:19,449
我帮你安排去做治疗
这儿有很多好疗养所
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.

1497
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:22,624
-我不需要
-你需要，那很隐密的
-I don't need one.
-Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1498
01:25:22,824 --> 01:25:25,496
姓名也不会被公布
There's no names in the papers.

1499
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,174
你只在乎名誉
That's all you care about.

1500
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:30,064
你不在乎我
GINGER: You don't care about me.

1501
01:25:30,264 --> 01:25:32,133
-我在乎
-不，你不在乎
SAM: Yes, I do.
GINGER: No, you don't.

1502
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:34,177
你怎能这样说？
How could you say that?

1503
01:25:34,309 --> 01:25:36,671
你是个美丽的女人
你在摧残自己
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

1504
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:40,108
你不需要那些
你现在芒刺在背
You don't need that stuff,
that fucking leech living off you.

1505
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:42,443
我比你还要了解你
I know you better than you know yourself.

1506
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:45,443
你像只老虎，你比我还坚强
You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.

1507
01:25:45,615 --> 01:25:49,483
只要你下定决心的事
你就做得比任何人都要好
When you set your mind on doing
something, you do it better than anybody.

1508
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:55,572
你一定得去
You're gonna do it.

1509
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,665
天啊
Oh, God.

1510
01:25:58,459 --> 01:26:00,393
[Ginger sobbing]

1511
01:26:07,268 --> 01:26:08,924
我试
I'll try.

1512
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:14,138
我会的
GINGER: I will.

1513
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:17,317
别生我气，好吗？
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1514
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:32,214
不管在计算室外有多少问题…
NICKY: No matter what
the problems were outside the count room...

1515
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,424
都是值得的
it was all worth it.

1516
01:26:35,016 --> 01:26:37,055
现金滚滚而来…
The cash kept rolling in...

1517
01:26:38,144 --> 01:26:40,183
皮箱也不停的进出
and the suitcases kept coming and going.

1518
01:26:41,356 --> 01:26:45,519
让我告诉你
除了钱还是钱
And let me tell you,
the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1519
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:49,694
唯一的问题是过了一阵子后…
The only problem was that after a while...

1520
01:26:49,823 --> 01:26:53,358
老大们发觉皮箱越来越轻
the bosses noticed that
the suitcases were getting a little light.

1521
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,075
等一下，你是说…
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1522
01:26:57,165 --> 01:26:59,620
我们抢的钱被人抢？
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1523
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:01,625
有人抢我们？
Somebody's robbing from us?

1524
01:27:01,836 --> 01:27:04,920
我们这么大费周章
竟有人在抢我们？
We go through all this fucking trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1525
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:09,801
如我所说，这就是这行的一部分
就当做是遗漏的
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1526
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:12,259
遗漏，狗屁
我要找到抢我们的人
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1527
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:15,058
就连约翰南斯
主导这骗局的人…
NICKY: Even John Nance,
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1528
01:27:15,184 --> 01:27:17,223
都知道自己无能为力去阻止
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1529
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:19,641
你得知道一个肯帮你偷钱的人…
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1530
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:21,889
就算你把他照顾得好好的…
even if you take care of him real well...

1531
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:24,268
他还是为自己多偷一点
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1532
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:26,519
很合理不是吗？
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1533
01:27:26,738 --> 01:27:30,189
试着让这些固执的老头们了解吧
You go try and make these hard-headed
old greaseballs understand that.

1534
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:32,655
如果自己抽完还要被别人抽
还有什么意义？
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1535
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:35,359
这样我们根本就在做白工嘛
It defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing.

1536
01:27:35,748 --> 01:27:40,125
他们是我的手下才帮我们拿钱
就睁只眼闭只眼吧
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give them some leeway.

1537
01:27:40,253 --> 01:27:42,230
但老大们从来就不相信这理论…
NICKY: But the bosses never believed
in leeway...

1538
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,506
听听他们做了什么
so listen to what they do.

1539
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:47,503
他们将艾题派斯康
堪萨斯市的二佬…
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1540
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:51,093
调来管理
确定没有人抽头
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1541
01:27:51,223 --> 01:27:53,678
-你那时在干嘛？
-我与我马子一起
BOSS: What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.

1542
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:56,970
-你跟你马子那时在干嘛？
-我打她一巴掌
BOSS: What were you doing
with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.

1543
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:59,642
问题是，派斯康是个麻烦
NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1544
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,850
这家伙连泡咖啡都可搞砸
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1545
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:05,021
-你都在干嘛？
-我在那儿的时间比在这儿多
BOSS: What you been doing?
ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1546
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,527
当时没人想到
后来会演变为何
NICKY: Little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1547
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:11,073
若有人早知道
去做念珠可能都还好些
If they did, they would've
been better off making fucking novenas.

1548
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,528
你得回去跟那家伙讲
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1549
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,492
-我上次的花费都还没补给我
-什么花费？
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?

1550
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:20,540
我一直自掏腰包
却什么都拿不回来
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1551
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:22,130
你得再回去
You gotta go back out there.

1552
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:24,753
从今开始
我得开始做记录了
From now on,
I'm gonna start keeping records.

1553
01:28:25,135 --> 01:28:28,171
你要记录干嘛，缴税吗？
What are you gonna do with records,
pay taxes?

1554
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:31,756
我不能一直这样自己出钱
跑来跑去
I can't keep laying out
my own fucking dough for these trips.

1555
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:33,926
我们他妈的到底在那儿干嘛？
What the hell are we doing over here?

1556
01:28:34,061 --> 01:28:36,978
我花钱让你去赌城玩
You're going to Las Vegas and having
a good time at my expense.

1557
01:28:37,106 --> 01:28:38,979
我靠，我是说…
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1558
01:28:39,108 --> 01:28:41,100
不论你做了几符念珠…
SAM: No matter how many
novenas you could make...

1559
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:43,899
都无法阻止接下来
在赌场发生的事
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next at the casino.

1560
01:28:43,988 --> 01:28:46,443
-我不相信你会这样做
-我们有协议
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA: We made a deal.

1561
01:28:47,117 --> 01:28:48,963
结果菲立浦葛林，   “老实先生”…
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity"...

1562
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:51,529
有个没人知道的搭挡…
had a partner nobody knew about...

1563
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:54,829
当她出现并向坦吉乐要钱时…
and when she showed up
and demanded money from Tangiers...

1564
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:57,497
-你为什么这样对我？
-因为你错了
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.

1565
01:28:57,628 --> 01:28:58,956
-我没错
-你有
ANNA: I'm not.
PHILIP: You are.

1566
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,292
不，我没错
No, I am not wrong.

1567
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:02,041
葛林试着搪塞她
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1568
01:29:02,216 --> 01:29:04,671
我不会这么轻易的放过你的
ANNA: I will see that
you don't get away with this.

1569
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:06,510
所以她一状告到法庭去
So, she sued him in court.

1570
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:09,259
本庭现在将开始审理
安娜史考特…
The court will now hear the matter
of Anna Scott...

1571
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:12,884
对坦吉乐集团与其总裁
菲立浦葛林
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

1572
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:16,845
-葛林先生将由欧伯伦辩护
-安娜史考特的律师则是罗根
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1573
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:19,397
-欧伯伦先生，可以开始了
-谢谢，大人
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON: Thank you.

1574
01:29:20,111 --> 01:29:23,444
我觉得判决很公正
而我也对判决非常满意
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1575
01:29:23,531 --> 01:29:24,859
有麻烦了
We got a problem.

1576
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:31,454
官司结果不理想，葛林得呈交帐簿…
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1577
01:29:31,582 --> 01:29:33,954
他得解释钱是怎么来的
has to show how he got the financing.

1578
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:36,000
这可不好
That's not good.

1579
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,797
她官司还打得不错
NICKY: She was doing pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1580
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:43,965
但在钞票还未落入她口袋之前…
But before she could start
counting her money...

1581
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:47,298
老家的老头子们就已决定庭外和解
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1582
01:29:47,432 --> 01:29:48,630
因此他们派我
So they sent me.

1583
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:07,323
你对安娜史考特的谋杀
有什么想法吗？
REPORTER: Any comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1584
01:30:07,537 --> 01:30:10,988
-你在说什么？
-她昨晚被人发现中弹身亡
What are you talking about?
REPORTER: She was found last night
shot in the head.

1585
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,909
只是有关房地产合伙问题吗？
MAN: Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1586
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:14,834
她的律师说你们是搭挡
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1587
01:30:15,546 --> 01:30:19,164
我们是在多年前
在一些小房地产交易上合作过
We were involved
in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1588
01:30:19,258 --> 01:30:20,586
称不上是搭挡
It was never a partnership.

1589
01:30:22,053 --> 01:30:24,888
你听过.22口径杀手吗？
MAN: Did you ever hear
of the.22 caliber killer?

1590
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:27,677
现在条子不只是盯尼奇…
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1591
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,676
他们也开始盯葛林
they started looking at Green, too.

1592
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:32,384
他本是我们的正派门面
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1593
01:30:32,564 --> 01:30:35,648
我得接受访问
让大家都知道…
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1594
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,311
赌场没有牵涉到案子
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1595
01:30:37,444 --> 01:30:39,686
你多常帮他代班？
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1596
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,531
葛林一个月大约来个两、三次…
Green's here about two or three times
a month...

1597
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,656
他还有其他房地产交易
和别的事要忙
and he's busy
with other real estate deals, and things.

1598
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:51,574
所以葛林不在时
你就是老大罗？
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1599
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:55,255
我很荣幸能为董事会的主席服务
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board.

1600
01:30:56,256 --> 01:31:00,088
我的责任是管理赌场的日常运作
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1601
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:02,177
所以平常日子你就是老大？
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1602
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:06,801
可以这么说吧…
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1603
01:31:06,935 --> 01:31:08,892
当葛林先生不在时
when Mr. Green is away.

1604
01:31:11,523 --> 01:31:12,721
可以这么说
You could say that.

1605
01:31:12,858 --> 01:31:13,557
山姆罗斯坦：   “我是老大！”

1606
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:15,604
你看了没？
PAT: Have you read this?

1607
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:17,653
关于罗斯坦先生
About Mr. Rothstein.

1608
01:31:18,364 --> 01:31:21,649
上面说：   与黑道有关连的
中西部下注者…
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1609
01:31:21,784 --> 01:31:26,078
“说他才是价值一亿的坦吉乐赌场
真正的老板”
"says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1610
01:31:26,664 --> 01:31:29,333
-你相信吗？
-他真的这么说？
PAT: Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

1611
01:31:29,501 --> 01:31:31,992
他当然是这么说的
这儿不都写了吗
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

1612
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:36,337
这家伙申请执照了没？
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1613
01:31:36,466 --> 01:31:38,505
我不知道，得查查
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1614
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:41,714
去查查看吧，用不着太激动
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

1615
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:45,886
查仔细点，我们也许能
将这死犹太人踢出城了
And check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1616
01:31:47,186 --> 01:31:48,514
谢谢
PAT: Thank you.

1617
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:53,351
赌博游乐委员会开始调查
坦吉乐的高层主管…
A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive...

1618
01:31:53,443 --> 01:31:56,479
山姆罗斯坦的赌博游乐执照
还没核发下来…
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is underway.

1619
01:31:56,613 --> 01:32:00,588

并也是赌城黑手党老大…
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1620
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:03,924
尼奇山多罗的儿时好友…
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

1621
01:32:04,124 --> 01:32:07,202
他有可能会失去
在赌场工作的权力…
could lose his ability
to work in the casino....

1622
01:32:07,527 --> 01:32:09,051
[Phone rings]

1623
01:32:11,087 --> 01:32:12,082
喂？
Hello?

1624
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:16,500
我要去你家见见银行经理，好吗？
我得见见清洁工
在小巴黎如何？
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker
right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

1625
01:32:16,634 --> 01:32:18,792
你得要订位，一定客满了
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1626
01:32:18,887 --> 01:32:19,882
不用，没关系
NICKY: No, it's okay.

1627
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:23,410
我不要在家见客
不可能啦，绝对客满
而且很难进去
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible. It's booked up,
and it's very difficult to get in.

1628
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,595
我会从高尔夫球场过来
六点见
没关系，我走后门
九点见
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.

1629
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:28,975
好
All right.

1630
01:32:30,733 --> 01:32:33,821
州政府赌博游乐处官员
与坦吉乐高层…
The battle between state gaming
officials and Tangiers casino boss...

1631
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:36,323
山姆“艾斯”罗斯坦之战正如火如荼
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

1632
01:32:36,523 --> 01:32:40,627
今晚，看看艾斯罗斯坦如何
尝试取得州立执照…
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's
attempt to get state licensing...

1633
01:32:40,827 --> 01:32:45,497
虽然面对警方的指控
怀疑罗斯坦与犯罪集团有勾结
despite law-enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1634
01:32:45,707 --> 01:32:49,470
山姆罗斯坦与黑道人物
尼奇山多罗之间的友谊…
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship
with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

1635
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:52,206
是否会阻碍罗斯坦
管理坦吉乐赌场呢？
keep Rothstein
from running the Tangiers casino?

1636
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:56,310
而州政府的赌博游乐法规
是否会因儿时友谊而受到威胁呢？
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1637
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:59,377
你少喝点吧？
SAM: Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff?

1638
01:33:00,849 --> 01:33:02,972
来，我扶你下楼
Come on. Let me help you down.

1639
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:04,381
我们在谈话
We're talking about some stuff.

1640
01:33:04,519 --> 01:33:06,511
今晚六点，儿时的友谊是否…
NEWSCASTER: At 6:00,
will a boyhood friendship...

1641
01:33:06,605 --> 01:33:08,722
会让罗斯坦失去坦吉乐
老大的位子？
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

1642
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:12,520
KBBO独家专题报导
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1643
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:16,562
下楼去，到楼下去
Go down. Just go downstairs.

1644
01:33:21,746 --> 01:33:25,364
你不能让这影响你，艾斯
别管这些了
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

1645
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,291
只是政治圈找替死鬼游戏
It's just a political witch hunt.

1646
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:36,927
你要喝什么吗？
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

1647
01:33:37,055 --> 01:33:39,593
-查理，你还要吗？
-好啊
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.

1648
01:33:39,682 --> 01:33:43,051
我什么都不要
嗨，克拉克先生，我一直在找你
I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.

1649
01:33:43,145 --> 01:33:45,896
-你比总统还难找
-最近比较忙
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.

1650
01:33:46,023 --> 01:33:48,596
是吗？但你至少也该
回我个电话吧
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1651
01:33:48,734 --> 01:33:51,735
听着，尼奇，我们谈过这个
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1652
01:33:51,965 --> 01:33:57,031
我也跟你解释过
你可能会有亏损
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1653
01:33:58,071 --> 01:33:59,095
Yeah.

1654
01:34:00,497 --> 01:34:02,039
我想把钱拿回来
I think I want my money back.

1655
01:34:03,176 --> 01:34:05,951
你是要威胁我吗？
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1656
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:10,505
我想你可能误解我了
I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1657
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:12,986
我觉得为公平起见…
I think, in all fairness...

1658
01:34:13,186 --> 01:34:16,678
我应该告诉你我打算怎么做
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1659
01:34:17,473 --> 01:34:21,636
明天一大早我就会散步去银行…
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1660
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:25,165
走进去看看
若还没把我的钱准备好的话…
and walk in and see,
and if you don't have my money for me...

1661
01:34:25,365 --> 01:34:29,392
我就会在众人面前爆开你的头
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

1662
01:34:29,536 --> 01:34:32,775
而当我服完刑出狱时…
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail...

1663
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:36,486
希望你也能从昏迷中苏醒
hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

1664
01:34:36,676 --> 01:34:40,447
知道吗？
我会再爆开你的头
And guess what? I'll split
your fucking head open again.

1665
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:44,447
因为我是个傻子
我完全不在乎坐牢
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1666
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:47,743
这就是我的职业
我会做的事
That's my business. That's what I do.

1667
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,590
我们知道你的职业
We know what you do.

1668
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,630
你把人的钱骗走
然后大摇大摆的走开
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1669
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,211
-你不能这样对我说话
-你这只爱尔兰肥猪！
You can't talk to me like that.
NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

1670
01:34:55,348 --> 01:34:58,514
你害我领不到我的钱
你最好把它弄出来，不然我要你好看
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1671
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:01,014
山姆别看，这是我们的事
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1672
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:03,896
我明天早上一定到
你试试看啊，肥猪
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.

1673
01:35:07,194 --> 01:35:09,566
-你觉得他懂了吗？
-你在干嘛？
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?

1674
01:35:09,696 --> 01:35:12,980
他是个老实的生意人
他会去找联邦调查局的
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1675
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,882
这混蛋躲了我三个礼拜了
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1676
01:35:16,082 --> 01:35:19,853
-你在告诉我该怎么做吗？
-我没有要告诉你该怎么做
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

1677
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:23,117
你太过份了，你的脑哪里去了？
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

1678
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:25,334
我的脑？
你的种又去了哪儿？
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?

1679
01:35:25,592 --> 01:35:30,325
我有更大的计划
你知道我在说什么
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.

1680
01:35:30,385 --> 01:35:33,505
如果你现在就这个样
我还怎么指望你啊？
If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

1681
01:35:33,597 --> 01:35:36,467
很多事都要改变了
你若要跟我一起…
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me...

1682
01:35:36,559 --> 01:35:38,516
你就得听我的
you're gonna have to go my way.

1683
01:35:38,644 --> 01:35:42,179
你得体谅我的处境
我得对上千名员工负责
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1684
01:35:42,315 --> 01:35:44,521
我每年都得经手一亿元
SAM: I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1685
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:47,812
我若拿不到执照就玩完了
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1686
01:35:47,904 --> 01:35:51,652
相信我，我若玩完了
很多人就会跟着完蛋
Believe me, if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1687
01:35:51,784 --> 01:35:52,853
去他妈的什么烂执照
Forget about your fucking license.

1688
01:35:53,053 --> 01:35:56,578
到时候我说的就是法律
你根本不需要什么执照
I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a license.

1689
01:35:58,058 --> 01:36:00,994
我不知道为什么
但越和你说话…
I don't know what it is,
but the more I talk to you...

1690
01:36:01,194 --> 01:36:04,581
我越觉得你不会挺我
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1691
01:36:04,714 --> 01:36:07,584
-不，我不打算和你一起
-好
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.

1692
01:36:07,676 --> 01:36:10,879
我不想涉入你所说的任何事，好吗？
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1693
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:13,343
我只想好好经营赌场
我只要我的执照
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1694
01:36:13,432 --> 01:36:15,471
我只想一切都安静下来
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1695
01:36:15,601 --> 01:36:17,807
这样叫安静？
“我是老大”这样叫安静？
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1696
01:36:17,937 --> 01:36:19,929
他们扭曲了意思
我根本控制不了
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

1697
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,519
罗尼与比利可以告诉你整个经过
Ronnie and Billy will tell you
exactly what happened.

1698
01:36:22,608 --> 01:36:24,399
这在老家很难看
Back home that looks bad.

1699
01:36:24,527 --> 01:36:29,236
难看？每次只要你上电视
就会提到我，这才叫难看
Looks bad? Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1700
01:36:29,574 --> 01:36:31,365
你到底怎么了？
What the fuck happened to you?

1701
01:36:31,493 --> 01:36:34,162
-你怎么了？整个失控？
-我失控？
-What happened to you? You lost control?
-I lost control?

1702
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,779
你他妈的像个电影明星似的走来走去
You're fucking walking around
like John Barrymore.

1703
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:41,101
穿粉红色的浴袍还拿烟盒？
是我失控？
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?

1704
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:46,755
我本来不想提的，但你不尊重人
连你老婆都不例外
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat
people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

1705
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:49,242
我老婆？关她什么事？
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1706
01:36:49,442 --> 01:36:54,841
她为了许多事不高兴
尤其是莱斯特戴蒙德那档
She was upset about a lot of things,
especially that Lester Diamond incident.

1707
01:36:55,048 --> 01:36:59,185
你是她哭诉的对象？
你没告诉她那事你也有份？
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?

1708
01:36:59,315 --> 01:37:01,603
没有，那不是重点
No, that's not the fucking point.

1709
01:37:01,734 --> 01:37:04,091
重点是，她不快乐
你也有问题
The point is, she's upset,
and you've got a problem.

1710
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:07,394
我希望你不要干涉
我的私生活
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out
of my personal life.

1711
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:09,529
若我这样你也会不爽吧
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

1712
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:13,158
她来找我说话的
我该赶她出去吗？
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?

1713
01:37:13,247 --> 01:37:16,616
离她远一点
不关你的事
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

1714
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:21,620
一周前就是我的事，现在就不是
你需要我时，我就得到
A week ago it was. Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.

1715
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:24,834
是啊，就像你需要我
帮你做担保一样
Right, the way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1716
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:27,796
我得去解决你刚刚对那人
所做的事情
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1717
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:29,637
他会去找联邦调查局的
This guy's gonna run to the FBI.

1718
01:37:29,764 --> 01:37:32,385
你的自尊比你的赌场还大
这就是你的问题
NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.

1719
01:37:32,517 --> 01:37:36,894
我知道他想做什么，但我不想参与
尼奇想自个儿当老大
SAM: I knew what he wanted
and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.

1720
01:37:37,022 --> 01:37:41,294
他想干掉盖吉
抽头，还有一切
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1721
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:45,563
他不再每件小事都要老家批准
He also stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1722
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:54,279
一位赌场大亨与他老婆被杀了
调查员侦问了尼奇
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1723
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:58,495
一位西洛可的庄家
他们也询问尼奇
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1724
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:01,982
几个线民死在自己的后车箱里
他们也追问尼奇
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks
of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1725
01:38:02,182 --> 01:38:03,873
一个律师
A lawyer.

1726
01:38:06,353 --> 01:38:07,022
They questioned Nicky.

1727
01:38:07,222 --> 01:38:08,420
他们问尼奇
When some guys who didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1728
01:38:08,598 --> 01:38:10,991
当一些拖欠高利贷的人
莫名的开始消失…

1729
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:13,927
尼奇的名字布满每家报纸
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

1730
01:38:14,127 --> 01:38:17,931
尼奇因为一堆谋杀案调查被侦讯
但他们每次都放他走
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1731
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:19,979
从来没有目击者
There were never any witnesses.

1732
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:23,603
条子把所有的不顺
都归昝于我
NICKY: The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1733
01:38:23,803 --> 01:38:26,365
小心点
你会好看的
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.

1734
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:30,283
若有个家伙踩到香蕉皮跌倒
可能都要带我回局里
NICKY: If a guy tripped over
a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1735
01:38:30,377 --> 01:38:31,845
客气点
Be nice.

1736
01:38:32,045 --> 01:38:36,049
老大们也没好到哪儿去
他们抱怨事情运作不顺
NICKY: The bosses were no better.
They complained because things
don't run smooth.

1737
01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:39,519
不过在我这行
真抱歉，事情本来就不会顺
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1738
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:41,688
我每天对付的可是些三教九流之徒
I'm dealing with degenerate
animals out here.

1739
01:38:41,888 --> 01:38:43,690
老大们在乎个屁啊？
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1740
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,193
他们只会坐着喝酒
They're sitting on their asses
drinking anisette.

1741
01:38:46,393 --> 01:38:48,662
而这期间我得做牛做马
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

1742
01:38:48,862 --> 01:38:52,354
那些王八老大们
真以为天下的午餐都是免费的
Fucking bosses think it's
a fucking free lunch out here.

1743
01:38:53,233 --> 01:38:57,105
法兰克，他们在沙漠里
找到一个家伙的头
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1744
01:38:57,871 --> 01:38:59,539
你知道吗？
You know about that?

1745
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:01,041
听说了
I heard.

1746

大家都在讲，报纸里也有登
Everybody's talking about it and making
a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1747
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,247
你要怎么办？
What are you gonna do?

1748
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:09,496
这可不好
That's no good.

1749
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:14,157
叫他做事要小心点
Tell him to take care of things a little better.

1750
01:39:15,379 --> 01:39:16,493
我会的，利蒙
I'll tell him, Remo.

1751
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:18,692
王八老大们抽着雪茄
NICKY: Fucking bosses

吃着他们的美食…
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit',
fried pigs' guts...

1753
01:39:22,228 --> 01:39:25,532
而我若想私下找人谈话
我还得坐在公车站
while if I wanna talk private,
I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.

1754

-他们在乎个屁？只要我拿钱回去
-他们在抱怨了
-What do they care? Long as I send money.
-They're complaining.

1755
01:39:30,203 --> 01:39:34,037
让他们抱怨，是我在这儿
活都是我在做
Let them complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1756
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:38,060
-有人不喜欢，就去他的
-你决定罗
NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK: It's up to you.

1757
01:39:38,545 --> 01:39:41,105
他们他妈的想打仗？
我准备好了
NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

1758
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:46,076
我只要干掉那五个
其他的自然会水到渠成
If I take care of five of those guys,
the rest will fall into place.

1759
01:39:46,753 --> 01:39:49,785
被我抓到了吧，这群王八羔子
NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

1760
01:39:49,956 --> 01:39:51,625
我看到你们了，混蛋
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1761
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:55,395
问题是，尼奇不只是
让自己更受注目，还连累到我
SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat
on himself, but on me, too.

1762
01:39:55,595 --> 01:40:00,066
联邦调查局盯着他的每一步
但他不在乎
The FBI watched every move he made,
but he just didn't care.

1763
01:40:00,266 --> 01:40:03,103
想要盯我，我就盯回去
NICKY: If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them back.

1764
01:40:03,303 --> 01:40:06,806
或许花了很多钱
但谁在乎？
I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?

1765
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:10,777
我买了最先进的反窃听装置
向卖给中央情报局的那家买的
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment
from the same places that sell to the CIA.

1766
01:40:10,977 --> 01:40:16,475
我有所有的警察特殊频道对讲机
FBI的解干扰器、夜光照相机…
I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

1767
01:40:16,816 --> 01:40:22,238
这些衰角从未抓到我任何把柄
So, the miserable sons of bitches never
caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1768
01:40:22,288 --> 01:40:26,118
我工作都快丢了
但他却玩得不亦乐乎
SAM: I got my job on the line,
he's having the time of his life.

1769
01:40:26,247 --> 01:40:29,532
全州的警察都在盯他
他却在打高尔夫球
He has every cop in the state watching him,
and he's out playing golf.

1770
01:40:30,335 --> 01:40:32,826
对我来说时期最坏不过
And at the worst possible time for me.

1771
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:37,711
我的执照听证会要到了
我不想有一点点失败的机率
I had my license hearing coming up and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1772
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:41,007
若不能在赌城工作
那我要去哪儿？
If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1773
01:40:41,207 --> 01:40:44,744
你一直都很合作
从文件到帐簿
You've been very open with us
with the books and papers.

1774
01:40:44,944 --> 01:40:47,347
这对委员会是很重要的
That'll mean a lot
when you go before the commission.

1775
01:40:47,547 --> 01:40:51,451
-我只希望能有个公正的听证会
-你的诚实会为你赢的
-All I ask is a fair hearing.
-This honesty will guarantee it.

接下来…
We'll move on to....

1778
01:40:55,955 --> 01:41:00,230
我想听听关于堪萨斯市
SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.

1779
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:03,201
这他妈的是什么？
What the fuck is this?

1780
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:08,328
这家伙要停在哪里，球场上吗？
Where's this fucking guy gonna land,
in the fairway?

1781
01:41:27,987 --> 01:41:30,806
他们是探员，法兰克
来看看
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1782
01:41:32,358 --> 01:41:34,861
他们盯尼奇打高尔夫盯到…
SAM: The Feds were watching
Nicky play golf for so long...

1783
01:41:35,061 --> 01:41:36,892
飞机没油
they ran out of gas.

1784
01:41:37,831 --> 01:41:41,494
还真是我需要的
就在委员会面前
Just what I needed,
right in front of the control board.

1785
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:48,502

$100, whoever hits the plane.

1786

堪萨斯市的老二
SAM: If things weren't bad enough...
in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

1787
01:41:55,215 --> 01:41:58,652
在堪萨斯市收皮箱的那家超市
就是他开的
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City
where they brought the suitcases.

1788
01:41:58,852 --> 01:42:01,821

你知道这代表什么吗？
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?

1789

又要花我好几千
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1790
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:07,932
他和他姐夫一起开店…
SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1791
01:42:08,023 --> 01:42:12,400
但他大多都在跟他姐夫与岳母
抱怨他去赌城的事
but he mostly complained about his trips
to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.

1792
01:42:12,528 --> 01:42:15,268

from taking what he wants?

COUNSELOR: Members
of the Commission...

1830
01:44:08,362 --> 01:44:09,349
主席先生
委员会的同仁…

1831
01:44:09,549 --> 01:44:11,351
今天罗斯坦先生很荣幸能在这儿
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

1832
01:44:11,551 --> 01:44:14,696
当那天终于来时
我已准备好了
SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.

1833
01:44:14,785 --> 01:44:17,857
我自信满满的认为
我只需要呈上我的案件
I felt so confident that all I had
to do was present my case.

1834
01:44:18,057 --> 01:44:22,529
我们拥有文件，其中一份是由
一位退休的联邦探员写的…
COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of
which is a report by retired FBI agents...

1835
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:25,732
上头清楚的记载罗斯坦先生
并未触犯任何法律
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

1836
01:44:25,932 --> 01:44:30,166
-律师，在你继续前…
-我要将这呈为…
-Counselor, before you continue...
-I want to have this marked....

1837
01:44:30,302 --> 01:44:33,573
本委员会针对是否应
驳回罗斯坦的申请书在此动议
...this Commission acts on a motion
denying the Rothstein application.

1838
01:44:33,773 --> 01:44:37,048
-驳回？
-有人赞成驳回吗？
COUNSELOR: Denying?
SENATOR: Do I hear a motion seconded?

1839
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:38,678
主席先生，我赞成
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

1840
01:44:38,878 --> 01:44:40,513
还有赞同票吗？
Do I have a vote on the motion?

1841
01:44:40,713 --> 01:44:41,714
同意！
-Aye!
-Aye!

1842
01:44:41,914 --> 01:44:42,938
Aye!

1843
01:44:43,149 --> 01:44:45,649
同意票获胜，听证会结束
The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.

1844
01:44:45,777 --> 01:44:48,943
-开什么玩笑
-什么叫结束？
-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned? What do you mean?

1845
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:53,660
议员，你答应我一场听证会的
你连联邦调查局的报告都没看
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.

1846
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:58,832
你来坦吉乐作客时
不是答应我会有公平的听证会？
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

1847
01:44:59,032 --> 01:45:02,502
-我从未是你的客人
-不是我的客人？我没招待过你？
SENATOR: I was never your guest.
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

1848
01:45:02,702 --> 01:45:04,904
难道我一个月
没有最少招待你三次？
I don't comp you
at least three times a month?

1849
01:45:05,104 --> 01:45:07,373
我现在回答这个问题
I'd like to answer that at this time.

1850
01:45:07,573 --> 01:45:10,877
罗斯坦先生的反应很常见
他在撒谎
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1851
01:45:11,077 --> 01:45:14,981
我唯一一次去过坦吉乐
就是巴尼葛林斯坦那次晚宴
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

1852
01:45:15,181 --> 01:45:17,750
-我当时在场吗？
-你四处周旋着
Was I at the dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering around.

1853
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,920
-我在场吗？
-你四处周旋
SAM: Was I at that dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering.

1854
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,057
-你在室内
-我在室内？
SENATOR: You were in the building.
SAM: I was in the building?

1855
01:45:24,257 --> 01:45:28,595
你很清楚我在那儿
你向我保证会有公正的听证会
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

1856
01:45:28,795 --> 01:45:31,651
没有吗？
Did you not?

1857
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:36,620
至少承认说我那天在场
这总可以了吧
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

1858
01:45:36,702 --> 01:45:39,172
-至少也得说我在场吧！
-是，你在
SAM: Give me that much at least!
SENATOR: Yes, you were.

1859
01:45:39,372 --> 01:45:42,864
多谢你没说我是骗子
你这个狗东西
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch.

1860
01:45:44,277 --> 01:45:47,547
一场例行的听证会
在昨晚成了一场闹剧…
A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1861
01:45:47,747 --> 01:45:51,084
当抢眼的坦吉乐高层
山姆“艾斯”罗斯坦…
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1862
01:45:51,284 --> 01:45:54,187
指控赌博游乐委员会高官贪污
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

1863
01:45:54,387 --> 01:45:57,123
你在我的旅馆接受招待
并答应我会有公平的听证会
...promised me a fair hearing
when you were comped at my hotel?

1864
01:45:57,323 --> 01:46:00,760
你还要求将你的帐单挂公帐
And you asked for copies of your bill
to put on your expense account.

1865
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,897
当赌博游乐执照被驳回时大吼大叫…
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming
license denial...

1866
01:46:04,097 --> 01:46:04,663
Bullshit!

1867
01:46:04,863 --> 01:46:06,299
-狗屁！
-罗斯坦与好几名…
...Rothstein followed several...

1868
01:46:06,499 --> 01:46:10,650
错愕的委员到走道
并持续着他的指控…
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1869
01:46:10,744 --> 01:46:13,235
直到他的律师与朋友劝他离开
until his own lawyers and friends
urged him to leave.

1870
01:46:13,372 --> 01:46:16,876
你有过去，我也有过去
我的不见得比你的糟糕
You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

1871
01:46:17,076 --> 01:46:19,545
你们还自以为有权去判决别人！
You guys think you have
the right to pass judgment!

1872
01:46:19,745 --> 01:46:22,815
被怀疑长期无照管理坦吉乐…
NEWSREADER: Long suspected
of running Tangiers without a license...

1873
01:46:23,015 --> 01:46:27,420
昨天的听证会本是要决议
像罗斯坦如此背景的人…
yesterday's hearing was to determine
if someone with Rothstein's history...

1874
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:30,556
是否有资格正式在赌博游乐界
担任如此高的职位
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

1875
01:46:30,756 --> 01:46:33,424
罗斯坦玩完了
王八伪君子！
REMO: Fucking hypocrites!

1876
01:46:33,493 --> 01:46:36,829
-他现在怎么办？
-我不知道
-What the hell's he gonna do now?
-I don't know.

1877
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:38,398
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

1878
01:46:38,598 --> 01:46:41,401
他也知道他大吼大叫的那群人
都是我们的朋友
He knows all those guys he yelled at
are friends of ours.

1879
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:43,836
他是怎么了，搞得一团糟？
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1880
01:46:44,036 --> 01:46:46,239
他或许可以用另一个头衔管事
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

1881
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:48,841
这不是最好的
但我们又能如何呢？
Won't be the best,
but what are we gonna do?

1882
01:46:49,041 --> 01:46:53,246
他不论管什么，都得安静点
让他躲到楼上办公室去
REMO: However he runs things, it's gotta be
quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

1883
01:46:53,446 --> 01:46:56,247
说他是工友，我不在乎
Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.

1884
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:01,371
但拜托，不管他做什么
都得低调点
But please, whatever job he takes,
make sure it's something quiet.

1885
01:47:09,295 --> 01:47:11,097
各位先生与女士…
ANNOUNCER: [On TV]
Ladies and gentlemen...

1886
01:47:11,297 --> 01:47:13,866
坦吉乐大饭店
非常荣幸能为您介绍…
the Tangiers Hotel
proudly presents the all-new...

1887
01:47:14,066 --> 01:47:17,564
山姆罗斯坦秀，艾斯的单人牌
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.

1888
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:18,645
艾斯的单人牌

1889
01:47:20,706 --> 01:47:23,443
今晚，从最新的球赛赌区
现场实况转播…
Tonight, taped live
from the all-new sports book...

1890
01:47:23,643 --> 01:47:26,779
我们为您带来艾斯的单人牌的
首次演出…
we present the premiere showing
of Aces High...

1891
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:29,990
连同莎夏西门诺夫交响乐团…
with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...

1892
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:33,786
与山姆罗斯坦舞群！
and the Sam Rothstein dancers!

1893
01:47:35,021 --> 01:47:39,726
罗斯坦先生是位职业赌徒
也是全美最棒的美式足球下注者
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler
and the best U.S. football handicapper.

1894
01:47:39,926 --> 01:47:45,259
一位能带领你进入
真正的拉斯维加斯的人
A man who will take you inside the real
Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.

1895
01:47:45,264 --> 01:47:49,469
现在让我们欢迎
坦吉乐赌场新的娱乐董事…
Now, the new entertainment director
of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...

1896
01:47:49,669 --> 01:47:51,304
山姆罗斯坦先生
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

1897
01:47:51,504 --> 01:47:53,836
[Audience applauding]

1898
01:47:53,973 --> 01:47:58,933
[Band playing upbeat dance music]

1899
01:48:00,846 --> 01:48:05,018
欢迎来到山姆罗斯坦秀
很高兴你们能参与
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show.
We're happy to have you here this evening.

1900
01:48:05,218 --> 01:48:08,087
我左边的这位小姐是特茹蒂…
The young lady to my left is Trudy...

1901
01:48:08,287 --> 01:48:11,357
她是我们巴黎秀新的首席舞者
who is a lead new dancer
in our fabulous show from Paris.

1902
01:48:11,557 --> 01:48:14,622
我们今晚的第一位来宾…
Our first guest this evening...

1903
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:17,374
法兰克艾华伦
is Frankie Avalon.

1904
01:48:22,535 --> 01:48:25,905
-看好他
-我有个大家庭
PAT: Keep an eye on him.
FRANKIE: I've got a large family.

1905
01:48:26,105 --> 01:48:31,143
-你有几个孩子？
-我很自豪的说，八个
SAM: How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say, eight children.

1906
01:48:33,813 --> 01:48:37,617
-太了不起了
-没什么，是我的荣幸
-That's amazing.
-There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

1907
01:48:37,817 --> 01:48:39,079
[Audience laughing]

1908
01:48:39,151 --> 01:48:40,978
别这样
PHILIP: Ace, don't do it.

1909
01:48:45,324 --> 01:48:47,157
天啊
Jesus.

1910
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:48,895
他在耍杂技！
He's juggling!

1911
01:48:49,095 --> 01:48:52,698
我们别对县辅导
派特委布太认真
SAM: Let's not take County Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

1912
01:48:52,898 --> 01:48:56,402
我最近本想邀他在节目上辩论的
但是他拒绝了
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

1913
01:48:56,602 --> 01:49:01,635
你在担心什么呢，派特？
你不需要事先给我问题
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

1914
01:49:01,907 --> 01:49:03,943
你什么都可以问我
You can ask me anything you want.

1915
01:49:04,143 --> 01:49:07,010
他在电视上干嘛？
ANDY: What the hell is he doing
on television?

1916
01:49:07,146 --> 01:49:12,394
他整晚都在上面
喊着要将他的案子告上最高法院
He's on all night, screaming about
taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

1917
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:16,186
他真是疯了
他想将这带到华府去？
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

1918
01:49:16,355 --> 01:49:18,606
他简直是疯了
He's out of his fucking mind.

1919
01:49:18,697 --> 01:49:21,828
世上有这样的伪君子真是可叹
他们爱做什么就做什么
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

1920
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:24,797
其他人却得承担后果
这就是人生
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

1921
01:49:24,997 --> 01:49:30,657
安迪，去找他
告诉他辞职的时候到了
Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

1922
01:49:36,008 --> 01:49:38,611
第一点，他们的所做所为
完全的违反了宪法
SAM: First, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1923
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:42,415
我们已在高等法院的等候单上了
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1924
01:49:42,615 --> 01:49:44,784
这些家伙才不在乎高等法院
These guys don't care
about the Supreme Court.

1925
01:49:44,984 --> 01:49:47,887
他们要一切平息，要你别再搞了
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

1926
01:49:48,087 --> 01:49:53,025
别搞了？安迪，你不是说真的
你难道看不到这严重性吗？
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?

1927
01:49:53,225 --> 01:49:56,028
老头说你的朋友或许该罢手了
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1928
01:49:56,228 --> 01:49:58,931
当老头说“或许”时
就像是教皇发谕令一样
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1929
01:49:59,131 --> 01:50:01,868
你不但该罢手，还该跑路
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1930
01:50:02,068 --> 01:50:07,074
他们每次在报上提到我的名字
就一定扯到尼奇
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

1931
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,957
这他妈的有什么帮助？
How the fuck does that help?

1932
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:11,377
他带来的注目简直是谋杀
The heat he brought down is murder.

1933
01:50:11,577 --> 01:50:14,039
警察局本来很合作
The police department was cooperative.

1934
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,182
他将他们激怒到
现在大家都动不了
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.

1935
01:50:16,382 --> 01:50:17,550
你能怎样呢？
What do you do about that?

1936
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,686
-你想说什么？
-我不知道，他根本不听我的
-What are you proposing?
-I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1937
01:50:20,886 --> 01:50:23,656
或许他才该消失一阵子
这样会很糟吗？
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?

1938
01:50:23,856 --> 01:50:26,973
-他们不会调走尼奇的
-若他离开一阵…
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-If he took a break...

1939
01:50:27,104 --> 01:50:28,528
给大家移动布局的机会
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1940
01:50:28,728 --> 01:50:33,307
别再搞布局的事
赶紧离开吧
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

1941
01:50:34,767 --> 01:50:35,825
[Sighs]

1942
01:50:36,769 --> 01:50:38,480
我不能
I can't do that.

1943
01:50:39,105 --> 01:50:43,342
当然，安迪一到家后
尼奇就听说我们的谈话
SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

我得去买点东西，你要不要去？
I've got to do some shopping. Want to go?

连接尼奇的电话都不是件易事
SAM: Getting a call from Nicky
wasn't easy anymore.

1947
01:50:52,084 --> 01:50:55,087
暗号都没有用了
我们得想新方法
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

1948

若是电话被窃听
他们只能听关于犯罪的谈话
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1949
01:50:59,925 --> 01:51:03,162
例行通话时
他们必须在几分钟后挂断
On routine calls, they have
to click off after a few minutes.

这东西好可爱
Something very cute.

他出门了，棕组
AGENT: Okay, he's out. It's the ant.
Brown unit.

1958

他带着个替身，应该是法兰克
He's with the bogey. I think it's Frankie.

尼奇比我早出门…
SAM: Nicky started out before me...

1960
01:51:34,677 --> 01:51:37,512
因为他要出门越来越难了
because it wasn't that easy for him
to get around anymore.

1961
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:40,967
尼奇到那儿都最起码得…
Nicky couldn't even go
for a ride without changing cars...

1962
01:51:41,167 --> 01:51:44,203
换六次车才甩得掉跟踪他的人
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails.

1963
01:51:44,403 --> 01:51:47,873
因为有飞机
所以他得用地下停车场
Because of the planes,
he had to use underground garages.

在沙漠中央会面总让我紧张
SAM: Meeting in the desert
always made me nervous.

1966
01:52:21,841 --> 01:52:23,890
那是个可怕的地方
It's a scary place.

1967
01:52:24,376 --> 01:52:26,512
我当然也知道沙漠里的洞
I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

1968
01:52:26,712 --> 01:52:30,307
我张望的每一处都可能是个洞
And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

1969
01:52:32,017 --> 01:52:34,320
通常我与尼奇会面
能活着回来…
Normally, my prospects
of coming back alive...

1970
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,525
机率是百分之九十九
from a meeting with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

1971

离道路几百码外…
But this time, when I heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road...

1972
01:52:43,729 --> 01:52:46,169
我想应该还有一半的机率吧

在背后捅我是什么意思？
Where the fuck you get off
talking to people behind my back?

1975
01:53:11,023 --> 01:53:13,693
-跟什么人？

-What people?
-Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1976

我根本不知道你在说什么
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1977
01:53:16,128 --> 01:53:21,033
你说我害你被盯？
我得因为你被人家念？
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?

1978
01:53:21,233 --> 01:53:24,236
你想搞走我？
你最好准备好自己的军队？
You're ordering me out? You better get
your own fucking army!

我没有要搞走任何人
I didn't order you or anybody.

1980
01:53:26,071 --> 01:53:28,974
我跟安迪说你被盯上了
这是个问题
I told Andy Stone that you had heat,
and that was a problem.

1981

You want me to get out
of my own fucking town?

Yeah, let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

Anything goes wrong
with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.

You know that you only have your fucking
casino because I made that possible!

And what the fuck
are you doing on TV anyhow?

1988

I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!

1989
01:53:56,539 --> 01:54:00,122
我上电视是因为
我必须待在赌场
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able
to hang around the casino. You don't understand that....

1990

You brought down so much heat on me.

Every time I meet somebody,
they ask me if I know you.

01:58:53,142 --> 01:58:56,392
我知道，但现在情况不同了
你要求的是离婚
I know, but everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.

2060
01:58:56,521 --> 01:58:59,771
你要求你与孩子的赡养费
现在又要孩子的监护权
You're asking for alimony payments
and child support, and now custody.

2061
01:58:59,858 --> 01:59:01,934
我只要任何一个离婚女人想要的
I just want what any
divorced woman would get.

她一天不过清醒两个小时
She's only sober about two hours a day.

2063
01:59:04,362 --> 01:59:06,687
通常是早上十一点到下午一点
It's usually from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

2064
01:59:06,823 --> 01:59:11,366
我要是给她钱与珠宝
她一年内就会浪费光了
If I gave her her money and her jewels,
she's gonna piss it all away in a year.

2065
01:59:11,786 --> 01:59:15,486
到时你怎么办？
还不是又回来找我…
Where would you be then?
Coming right back to me...

2066
01:59:15,582 --> 01:59:17,788
或找什么其他的理由回来…
or finding some other excuse to come....

2067
01:59:18,668 --> 01:59:21,372
我们有协议，记得吗？
We had a deal. Remember that?

2068
01:59:22,714 --> 01:59:26,628
他说过若我们之间走不下去
我可以拿我的东西走
He said if it didn't work out between us,
I could get my things and leave.

2069
01:59:28,887 --> 01:59:30,001
看着我
Look in my eyes.

2070
01:59:31,059 --> 01:59:32,856
Look in my eyes.

2071
01:59:33,725 --> 01:59:34,887
你知道我
SAM: You know me.

2072
01:59:35,477 --> 01:59:38,643
你看到任何迹象
让你觉得…
Do you see anything that makes
you think I would ever let...

2073
01:59:38,730 --> 01:59:41,303
以你现在的状况
我会将我的孩子交给你？
someone in your condition
take my child away from me?

2074
01:59:44,402 --> 01:59:45,600
有吗？
Do you?

2075
01:59:47,948 --> 01:59:49,406
你知道这不可能
You know that won't happen.

2076
01:59:54,496 --> 01:59:56,287
过了这么久…
SAM: And after all this time...

2077
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:59,624
不管我多么努力，多么想…
and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...

2078
01:59:59,835 --> 02:00:01,542
我始终触碰不到她
I could never reach her.

2079
02:00:01,837 --> 02:00:03,794
我无法让她爱我
I could never make her love me.

2080
02:00:03,922 --> 02:00:07,373
我总觉得她会爱我
那么多的钱…
I always felt she should have gone
for all that money...

2081
02:00:07,551 --> 02:00:11,714
第一次在生命中成为一个重要的人
一个家、孩子
being somebody for the first time
in her life, a home, a kid.

2082
02:00:12,139 --> 02:00:14,676
但事实并非如此
那样做却行不通
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.

2083
02:00:14,808 --> 02:00:16,944
-都好吗？
-我们能怎么办？
Everything all right?
SAM: What could we do?

2084
02:00:17,144 --> 02:00:20,678
过一阵子后，我们开始放对方的假
短期的不见面
After a while, we'd just take breathers
from each other. Little separations.

2085
02:00:20,856 --> 02:00:24,438
那时，我记得金吉儿
带着艾美去比佛利山庄
At that time, I remember Ginger
took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.

2086

她要去逛一个礼拜的街
She was gonna spend a week shopping.

-比佛利大饭店

-请找山姆罗斯坦夫人
RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Beverly Hotel.
SAM: Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

很抱歉，罗斯坦先生与夫人
已经退房了
RECEPTIONIST: Sorry, Mr. and Mrs.
Rothstein have checked out already.

2090
02:00:36,747 --> 02:00:38,704
罗斯坦先生与夫人？
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

2091
02:00:41,251 --> 02:00:44,702
-是的，他们俩都退房了

They're gonna try and kidnap her.

哪位？
Who's calling?

我要跟金吉儿讲话
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.

她不在这儿，山姆
She's not here, Sam.

我要跟金吉儿说话
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

I want her put on a plane immediately.

2106

-山姆，我没有

LESTER: I wouldn't.

你不应这么做
You shouldn't do this.

2108

你懂不懂？叫她听电话

SAM: That's all I'm asking.
GINGER: Do you....

2177
02:05:42,263 --> 02:05:45,299
我是说，我不觉得
她应该一个人回去
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2178
02:05:47,393 --> 02:05:48,555
你这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

2179
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:50,550
我是说…
What I mean is--

2180
02:05:50,939 --> 02:05:54,687
如果我回去…
Do you think if I came back....

2181
02:05:56,402 --> 02:05:58,608
你可以原谅我吗？
Do you think you could forgive me?

2182
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:02,197
老实说，我不知道
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

2183
02:06:02,283 --> 02:06:04,156
我了解
I understand that.

2184
02:06:05,745 --> 02:06:07,203
我知道我搞砸了
I know I fucked up.

2185
02:06:08,289 --> 02:06:11,622
-那钱呢？盒子呢？
-老实说…
-What about the money? Where's the box?
-I gotta tell you...

2186
02:06:12,877 --> 02:06:15,450
我做错事了
我花了一些钱
I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

2187
02:06:15,588 --> 02:06:18,505
-少很多吗？
-蛮多的
SAM: What's it under?
GINGER: Pretty serious.

2188
02:06:19,134 --> 02:06:23,131
-多少
-两万五以下
SAM: How serious?
GINGER: It's under $25,000.

2189
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:25,303
-两万五以下？
-对
SAM: It's under $25,000?
GINGER: Yeah.

2190
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:28,390
-剩下的两百万还在吗？
-在，其他的都还在
SAM: The $2 million is still there?
GINGER: Yeah, I got the rest.

2191
02:06:28,977 --> 02:06:30,684
好吧，没关系
Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

2192
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:33,308
他拿了两万五
He got his $25,000.

2193
02:06:34,482 --> 02:06:36,604
我可以接受，再多就不行了
That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.

2194
02:06:36,735 --> 02:06:37,730
好
Okay.

2195
02:06:37,819 --> 02:06:41,437
好啦，你在哪里？
我马上派飞机去接你
All right, all right. Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.

2196
02:06:45,368 --> 02:06:46,613
嗨，山姆
Hi, Sam.

2197
02:06:58,256 --> 02:06:59,750
你拿去干嘛了？
So what'd you do with it?

2198
02:07:00,008 --> 02:07:01,336
什么？
With what?

2199
02:07:03,303 --> 02:07:04,845
钱啊
With the money.

2200
02:07:06,139 --> 02:07:07,846
他需要些衣服
He needed some clothes.

2201
02:07:09,184 --> 02:07:10,975
两万五买衣服？
$25,000 for clothes?

2202
02:07:12,813 --> 02:07:14,686
他还要了只表
He wanted a watch, too.

2203
02:07:17,651 --> 02:07:19,442
两万五买衣服和表？
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?

2204
02:07:22,739 --> 02:07:25,230
晚安夫人，这边请
GINO: Good evening, signora. This way.

2205
02:07:25,492 --> 02:07:27,568
好事是艾美回来了
SAM: The good part was I had Amy back.

2206
02:07:27,703 --> 02:07:31,914
我们回家，请管家来过夜
然后送孩子上床
So we went home, had the housekeeper
stay over, put the kid to bed.

2207
02:07:32,291 --> 02:07:34,413
我逼自己冷静
然后我们出门吃饭
I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

2208
02:07:35,044 --> 02:07:37,036
我试着让一切缓和…
I tried to keep things nice and civil...

2209
02:07:37,171 --> 02:07:41,168
但是两万五买三套西装？
but $25, 000 for three suits?

2210
02:07:42,051 --> 02:07:43,628
这不太合理
That doesn't make much sense.

2211
02:07:44,178 --> 02:07:46,669
第一点，他不可能穿
一千元一套的西装
First of all, he's not gonna wear
$1,000 suits.

2212
02:07:48,223 --> 02:07:50,049
就算假设他穿，虽然他不会
Let's say he did, which he won't.

2213
02:07:50,309 --> 02:07:52,800
三天内怎么可能
量身订做25套西装？
How you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2214
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:57,116
怎么可能量得那么快？
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2215
02:07:57,316 --> 02:08:00,286
我付两倍的钱都不可能那么快
I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

2216
02:08:00,486 --> 02:08:01,944
我还帮他买了只表
I bought him a watch, too.

2217
02:08:03,906 --> 02:08:07,654
就算是买了只好表
一只他认为是好的表…
But even if you bought him a really nice
watch, one that he thought was nice...

2218
02:08:07,743 --> 02:08:09,879
他根本不知道好表长什么样子
he doesn't know
what the fuck a good watch is.

2219
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:14,539
假设表价在五千
最多一万二，对他来说也不可能
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000
at the most, which is impossible for him.

2220
02:08:16,168 --> 02:08:20,580
加上三套一千一套的西装
还剩多少？
Plus, at the most, three suits,
$1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2221
02:08:21,173 --> 02:08:24,209
-差不多一万左右
-山姆，可以停止吗？
-Around $10,000?
-Would you knock it off, Sam?

2222
02:08:24,343 --> 02:08:27,509
-我只是想算清楚
-没什么好算的
SAM: I'm just trying to figure it out.
GINGER: There's nothing to figure out.

2223
02:08:29,682 --> 02:08:32,801
我回家了，我们在协调
I'm home. We're working it out.

2224
02:08:33,019 --> 02:08:35,592
可是我以前也听过
“我们在协调”
But I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

2225
02:08:35,813 --> 02:08:37,355
你以为你回家…
You think that you're home...

2226
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:41,640
在你对我与艾美所做的一切后
算是给我面子吗？
after what you just put me
through with Amy, is a favor to me?

2227
02:08:49,327 --> 02:08:54,202
加上表，假设你们这个周末
花费了四千好了…
Counting the watch, let's say
another $4,000 for expenses this weekend...

2228
02:08:55,374 --> 02:08:57,331
我相信你们一定过得很愉快
of which you must have had a good time.

2229
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:59,251
至少我很确定他很愉快
I know he did. That's for sure.

2230
02:08:59,337 --> 02:09:03,037
我知道那狗杂种一定很快乐
I know that fucking piece
of shit had a good fucking time.

2231
02:09:04,967 --> 02:09:06,425
花我的钱
On my money.

2232
02:09:06,886 --> 02:09:10,005
你干脆就跟他上床算了
你八成也这样做了
You might as well have fucked him,
which you probably did anyway.

2233
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:13,425
你看我的表情很奇怪
You're looking at me a certain way.

2234
02:09:15,061 --> 02:09:16,768
你热泪盈眶
You're teary-eyed.

2235
02:09:17,772 --> 02:09:20,227
你很难过
你真是个好演员
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?

2236
02:09:20,984 --> 02:09:22,810
真他妈的演得好
Good fucking actress.

2237
02:09:24,153 --> 02:09:26,192
你可让任何人可怜你
SAM: You can fucking get pity out of people.

2238
02:09:26,364 --> 02:09:28,071
但我不是嫖客，好吗？
I'm not a john. You understand?

2239
02:09:28,533 --> 02:09:31,403
你一直以为我是
但我不是，我也不是冤大头
You always thought I was,
but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2240
02:09:33,329 --> 02:09:35,570
那可恶的拉皮条狗杂碎
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2241
02:09:35,832 --> 02:09:37,705
上次没杀了他是他命好
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2242
02:09:37,876 --> 02:09:41,079
他活着是命好
若你们带着艾美…
SAM: Lucky he's fucking living.
If you would have stayed with Amy...

2243
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:43,210
然后走人的话
他就死定了
and you had run away,
he would have been dead.

2244
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:47,004
你们俩都死定了
Both of you. Dead.
Dead.

2245
02:09:55,212 --> 02:09:56,919
不，不公平
GINGER: No, it isn't fair.

2246
02:10:03,303 --> 02:10:06,090
他晚上根本不回家
有什么了不起？
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fucking deal?

2247
02:10:06,223 --> 02:10:08,692
我走，听着，我真的受不了
I go.... Listen, I just can't fucking take it.

2248
02:10:08,892 --> 02:10:12,196
我为什么要忍受？
这不是我们的协议
Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal.

2249
02:10:12,396 --> 02:10:15,765
他一副好像就只有我有过去的样子
He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a fucking past.

2250
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:17,952
他永远都不让我忘记
He'll never let me live it down.

2251
02:10:18,152 --> 02:10:21,106
是，我试过，我当然试过
Well, yes, I have tried. Of course I've tried.

2252
02:10:21,238 --> 02:10:24,291
你以为我为什么回来？
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2253
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:26,530
不，我不，我想杀了他
No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.

2254
02:10:27,077 --> 02:10:29,171
对，我要杀了他
我受够了
GINGER: I want him killed. I've had it.

2255
02:10:29,371 --> 02:10:32,044
你要帮我吗？
So are you with me on this?

2256
02:10:33,167 --> 02:10:35,740
你想干掉我？我就在这儿
You want to get rid of me? Here I am.

2257
02:10:36,253 --> 02:10:38,691
来啊，干掉我啊
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2258
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:41,684
-喂
-是的！
SAM: Hello.
GINGER: Yes, I do!

2259
02:10:41,884 --> 02:10:46,557
我恨死你了！我受不了了！
GINGER: I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!

2260
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:49,467
是，我要杀了你！
我恨死你了！
Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fucking guts!

2261
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:53,563
你恨死我了？
我要你现在就给我过来！
SAM: You hate my guts?
I want you to come with me now!

2262
02:10:57,775 --> 02:11:00,436
我要你滚！
SAM: I want you out of here!

2263
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:07,025
拿好行李给我滚！
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!

2264
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:09,170
我会走，但我现在就要我的钱！
I'll go, but I want my money right now!

2265
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:12,240
-你会拿到钱的！别担心
-协议结束了
-You'll get your money! Don't worry.
-The arrangement is over.

2266
02:11:12,331 --> 02:11:14,884
-废话！
-我还是拿得到钱
SAM: No kidding!
GINGER: And I still get my money.

2267
02:11:15,084 --> 02:11:18,054
我现在就要一些现金
你不能就这样把我赶出街！
I need some cash now!
You can't just put me in the street!

2268
02:11:18,254 --> 02:11:20,682
你从一认识我就没诚实过！
You've never been straight with me
ever since I met you!

2269
02:11:20,882 --> 02:11:22,934
你从一开始就没爱过我！
You never even loved me in the first place!

2270
02:11:23,134 --> 02:11:25,838
跟你这婊子一起
我连脑后都得长眼睛！
I need eyes in the back
of my head with you, you bitch!

2271
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:29,173
我怎么爱你？
你对我像对条狗一样！
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2272
02:11:29,307 --> 02:11:32,902
-你连狗都不如！
-去你的！
SAM: You're lower than a dog!
GINGER: Fuck you!

2273
02:11:33,102 --> 02:11:34,738
拿去！够了没？
Here! Is this enough money?

2274
02:11:34,938 --> 02:11:37,615
可以活两天吗？拿去！
Will it last you two fucking days? Take it!

2275
02:11:37,815 --> 02:11:40,851
-贪得无厌的婊子，钱拿去
-我要去银行…
-Greedy bitch. Take the fucking money.
-I'm going to the bank...

2276
02:11:40,985 --> 02:11:44,289
-我还要去拿我的珠宝！
-早上9点开，去拿啊
-and I'm getting my jewelry, too!
-It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.

2277
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:47,459
别叫你的人去阻止我！
我说真的！
Don't send your guys down there
to stop me! I mean it!

2278
02:11:47,659 --> 02:11:49,503
我向你保证我绝对不会阻止你
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.

2279
02:11:49,703 --> 02:11:52,297
你别想以一口箱子就打发我！
You're not getting rid of me
with one fucking suitcase!

2280
02:11:52,497 --> 02:11:55,675
剩下的明天再回来拿吧
给我滚
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.

2281
02:11:55,875 --> 02:11:57,582
-我要带艾美走
-不行
GINGER: I'm taking Amy.
SAM: You're not.

2282
02:11:57,711 --> 02:11:59,169
我要，我现在去叫她
I am. I'm waking her up right now.

2283
02:11:59,296 --> 02:12:01,306
你w药了，你这个毒虫
给我滚
SAM: You're stoned. You're a junkie.
Get out of here.

2284
02:12:01,506 --> 02:12:03,266
我不是！她也是我女儿！
I am not! She's my daughter, too!

2285
02:12:03,466 --> 02:12:06,520
写信给我的律师吧，去你的！
SAM: Send my lawyers a letter,
god-fucking-damn you!

2286
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:10,764
你跑不掉的！
你别想不遵守你的诺言！
GINGER: You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!

2287
02:12:12,017 --> 02:12:13,883
王八蛋！
GINGER: Fucker!

2288
02:12:28,102 --> 02:12:29,569
[Car engine stops]

[Approaching footsteps]

2291
02:13:05,571 --> 02:13:08,940
好笑的是，经过这么多事
我还是不想让她走
SAM: The funny thing was,
after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2292
02:13:09,575 --> 02:13:11,697
她是我孩子的妈，我爱她
She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.

2293
02:13:12,411 --> 02:13:16,360
后来，我发现我并不想
将钱给她，因为我若给了…
Later, I realized I didn't want
to give her the money because if I did...

2294
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,660
我知道将再也见不到她
I knew I'd never see her again.

好的，天使
Okay, angel.

2297
02:13:40,815 --> 02:13:45,471
从现在起，我随时都得知道
你与艾美在哪儿
From now on, I have to know
where you and Amy are at all times.

2298
02:13:46,779 --> 02:13:47,810
这是呼叫器
SAM: Here's a beeper.

2299
02:13:49,073 --> 02:13:51,167
我要你拿着
I want you to keep it on you.

2300
02:13:51,367 --> 02:13:52,446
很轻
It's very light.

2301
02:13:53,036 --> 02:13:56,078
让我可以随时打给你
SAM: So I can call you whenever I have to.

2302
02:13:59,167 --> 02:14:00,886
好吗？
Okay?

2303
02:14:10,971 --> 02:14:12,773
你能怎么做？
你想怎么做呢？
NICKY: What are you supposed to do?
What do you wanna do?

2304
02:14:12,973 --> 02:14:15,692
你想就像现在这样吗？
你也不能啊
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.

2305
02:14:15,892 --> 02:14:18,846
两个人若合不来
总要有人出来说…
Two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it....

2306
02:14:18,979 --> 02:14:21,865
这不关我的事
但我觉得你应该这样做
It's not my business,
but I think that's what you gotta do.

2307
02:14:22,065 --> 02:14:23,867
你说得对，我知道
You're right. I know.

2308
02:14:24,067 --> 02:14:25,810
-我只是…
-什么？
-I was just--
-What?

2309
02:14:27,696 --> 02:14:29,289
-没什么
-你想说什么？
-Nothing.
-What were you gonna say?

2310
02:14:29,489 --> 02:14:31,583
-我不…
-告诉我你本来想说什么
-I don't--
-Tell me what you were gonna say.

2311
02:14:31,783 --> 02:14:33,627
真的？
Yeah?

2312
02:14:33,827 --> 02:14:37,631
我在想说你有没有认识
银行的人…
I was thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank...

2313
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:39,870
可以帮我把珠宝拿出来？
who could help me get my jewelry out?

2314
02:14:40,417 --> 02:14:42,469
有很多钱在那儿
There's a lot of money in there.

2315
02:14:42,669 --> 02:14:46,603
我愿意重赏任何可以帮助我的人
I'd be willing to take care
of anybody who helped me out.

2316
02:14:47,508 --> 02:14:49,168
我想想办法
Let me think about that.

2317
02:14:50,302 --> 02:14:53,814
我看看能找谁
一定得是可以信得过的人
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust.

2318
02:14:54,014 --> 02:14:57,401
你也知道他是不会把珠宝给我的
You know he's never gonna
give me my jewelry.

2319
02:14:57,601 --> 02:15:00,934
他把那把钥匙抓得很紧
我看就差没藏到屁眼里去了
He holds that key so tight,
he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

2320
02:15:02,606 --> 02:15:04,728
说得好，真像是山姆
You're right. That's Sammy.

2321
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:06,982
搞不好真的就在那儿
And he's probably got it there, too.

2322
02:15:09,154 --> 02:15:12,893
他真是命大，我本可以埋了他
He's so fucking lucky.
I could have buried him.

2323
02:15:12,908 --> 02:15:16,763
我本可以去欧洲并把孩子带走
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2324
02:15:17,121 --> 02:15:19,825
那他可能就会找到我
并把我杀了
Then he'd have tracked me down,
and he'd have killed me.

2325
02:15:20,166 --> 02:15:23,052
不，他不会，但我会
No, he wouldn't. I would have.

2326
02:15:23,252 --> 02:15:26,169
-不过他是没错
-别闹了
-He'd have been right, too. Seriously.
-Come on.

2327
02:15:26,297 --> 02:15:29,001
你不能就这样把他的孩子带走
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.

2328
02:15:29,091 --> 02:15:33,254
我没有，我本来有
但后来我照你所说的回家了
I didn't. I did, but then I did exactly
what you told me to do, and I came back.

2329
02:15:33,387 --> 02:15:36,257
你是，你照做了，很好
You did. You're right. I like that.

2330
02:15:36,974 --> 02:15:41,112
-我喜欢这样，你做对了
-我听了你的话
-That's what I like, you did the right thing.
-I did what you told me to.

2331
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:45,161
-是的
-你总会告诉我正确的做法
-Yes, you did.
-You always tell me the right thing to do.

2332
02:15:51,072 --> 02:15:53,859
他真的在这儿把自己搞砸了
不是吗？
He really fucked himself up
out here, didn't he?

2333
02:15:54,409 --> 02:15:57,535
-是啊
-这一切改变了他的想法
-He sure did.
-Everything went to his head.

2334
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,715
改变了
Changed.

2335
02:16:00,915 --> 02:16:04,814
-他变了，他已不是同一个人了
-不，他不是
-He did. He ain't the same person.
-No, he's not.

2336
02:16:05,253 --> 02:16:07,957
-他真的觉得自己多了不起
-的确
-He really thinks who the fuck he is.
-Exactly.

2337
02:16:11,926 --> 02:16:13,384
他恨我
He hates me.

2338
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:15,647
他好恨我
He hates my fucking guts.

2339
02:16:15,847 --> 02:16:19,398
别这样，你最坚强了
这不算什么
Come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this.

2340
02:16:23,271 --> 02:16:26,450
-别哭
-我没你想像的坚强
NICKY: Don't cry.
GINGER: I'm not as tough as you think I am.

你有
Yes, you are.

2342
02:16:28,443 --> 02:16:30,579
我没有，我好怕他
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.

2343
02:16:30,779 --> 02:16:33,999
-我永远都不知道他下步要干嘛
-别这样
-I never know what he's gonna do.
-Come on.

2344
02:16:34,199 --> 02:16:37,509
-别怕
-我需要帮助
-Don't be scared.
-I need some help.

2345
02:16:39,329 --> 02:16:41,649
我需要帮助
I need some help.

2346

你得帮我
You gotta help me.

2347

我需要个新靠山
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2348
02:16:48,088 --> 02:16:49,848
真的，我需要个新的靠山
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2349
02:16:50,048 --> 02:16:51,934
-这是你想要的？
-是啊
-Is that what you want?
-Yeah.

2350
02:16:52,134 --> 02:16:54,528
-靠山？
-是的
-A sponsor?
-Yeah.

2351
02:16:56,054 --> 02:17:01,597
好，别担心
没人敢动你的
Okay. Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.

2352
02:17:01,935 --> 02:17:04,113
我会照顾你的
I'll take care of you.

2353
02:17:04,313 --> 02:17:07,183
-谢谢你
-这是你想要的，不是吗？
GINGER: Thank you.

你丢了
You threw it away?

I tried to do it.
I know that you want me to, but....

02:22:05,618 --> 02:22:09,306
因为若他有，就是个问题
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2422
02:22:11,791 --> 02:22:12,989
我能说什么？
FRANK: What could I say?

2423
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:14,927
我知道若我答错了…
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...

2424
02:22:15,127 --> 02:22:19,515
尼奇、金吉儿与艾斯全部
都可能被干掉
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up getting killed.

2425
02:22:19,715 --> 02:22:22,185
因为这些老家伙们有个禁忌
Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

2426
02:22:22,385 --> 02:22:25,355
就是他们不能忍受搞别人老婆
They don't like any fucking around
with the other guys' wives.

2427
02:22:25,555 --> 02:22:26,898
那很难看
It's bad for business.

2428
02:22:27,098 --> 02:22:30,735
所以我撒谎
虽然我知道对盖吉撒谎…
So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi...

2429
02:22:30,935 --> 02:22:33,529
可能会害我也被干掉
I could wind up getting killed, too.

2430
02:22:33,729 --> 02:22:38,210
-不，我没见到这种事
-你确定？
-No, I ain't seen anything like that.
-Are you sure?

2431
02:22:38,985 --> 02:22:41,069
我很确定
I'm positive.

2432
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:44,958
利蒙，那边现在可是一团糟
Remo, things are very
fucked up down there.

2433
02:22:45,158 --> 02:22:46,960
我知道，所以我才问你
I know. That's why I'm asking.

2434
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:49,963
我最担心的是尼奇
You see, my main concern is Nicky.

2435
02:22:50,163 --> 02:22:54,282
我想知道他最近如何
过得好不好
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

2436
02:22:54,584 --> 02:22:59,472
-他很好
-我要你看好尼奇
-He's good, he's fine.
-I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2437
02:22:59,672 --> 02:23:01,933
-为了我
-没问题
-Do it for me.
-No problem.

2438
02:23:02,133 --> 02:23:07,480
你知道，我不想得罪我们的朋友
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing
anything for our friends.

2439
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,711
你懂吗？
You understand?

2440
02:23:08,848 --> 02:23:10,887
-我懂了
-好
-I understand.
-Okay.

2441
02:23:12,185 --> 02:23:13,845
法兰克，你是个好孩子
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2442
02:23:14,396 --> 02:23:15,641
谢了，利蒙
Thanks, Remo.

2443
02:23:15,772 --> 02:23:18,533
这时，尼奇与他那帮人
已经跌到谷底了
SAM: By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

2444
02:23:18,733 --> 02:23:21,310
赌城真的改变了他
Vegas really got to him.

2445
02:23:21,528 --> 02:23:24,589
酒精、可卡因、女人
The booze, the coke, the broads.

2446
02:23:25,282 --> 02:23:27,759
我是说，他开始大意
I mean, he got sloppy.

2447
02:23:27,784 --> 02:23:29,741
他再也不是以前那个尼奇了
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

2448
02:23:29,870 --> 02:23:32,325
-你喝太多了
-去你的
FRANK: You must've drank too much.
NICKY: Fuck yourself.

2449
02:23:32,414 --> 02:23:34,453
有晚他对个家伙开了三枪…
SAM: One night, he had to belt a guy
three times...

2450
02:23:34,583 --> 02:23:36,260
才将他打死
before the guy finally went down.

2451
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:39,179
要是以前，尼奇只要一枪就够了
In the old days,
Nicky would've decked him with one shot.

2452
02:23:39,379 --> 02:23:41,723
加上这些成份…
You add this into the mix....

2453
02:23:41,923 --> 02:23:44,164
可能赌城改变了我们全部
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.

2454
02:23:44,635 --> 02:23:46,979
他那帮人随着他一起堕落
His crew followed him right over the edge.

2455
02:23:47,179 --> 02:23:49,634
他们每天一半的时间
都在吸毒中渡过
They were all tuned up half the time
on coke.

2456
02:23:49,932 --> 02:23:52,818
他们开始做些蠢事
尤其是布鲁
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.

2457
02:23:53,018 --> 02:23:55,696
-你们要干嘛？
-警察！别下车！
-What do you guys want?
-Police! Stay in the car!

2458
02:23:55,896 --> 02:23:57,865
他从不知道何时该闭嘴
SAM: He never knew when
to keep his mouth shut.

2459
02:23:58,065 --> 02:24:00,951
-放下枪！
-去你的！
COP: Drop the gun!
BLUE: Fuck you!

2460
02:24:05,531 --> 02:24:07,570
条子朝布鲁开枪…
SAM: The cops shot Blue...

2461
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:10,155
因为他们以为
他手上拿的潜艇堡是手枪
because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

2462
02:24:10,869 --> 02:24:13,047
他们也许是对的
但谁知道？
They could have been right,
but who knows?

2463
02:24:13,247 --> 02:24:17,093
天啊，什么枪？
他手上拿的是潜艇堡
COP: Jesus Christ! What gun?
He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.

2464
02:24:17,293 --> 02:24:19,387
不然能怎样？这儿这么黑
COP 2: What do you want? It's pitch black.

2465
02:24:19,587 --> 02:24:22,056
-是锡箔纸，看来像枪！
-你这智障！
COP 2: It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!
COP: You moron!

2466
02:24:22,256 --> 02:24:24,892
-我得办两个月的公文！
-该怎么办？
COP: I'll be doing paperwork for two months!
COP 2: What'll we do?

2467
02:24:25,092 --> 02:24:26,686
-抱歉！
-白痴！
COP 2: Sorry!
COP: You jerk-off!

2468
02:24:26,886 --> 02:24:28,555
更糟的是，为了报仇
尼奇那帮人有天晚上…
SAM: To make matters worse...

2469
02:24:28,755 --> 02:24:33,492
吸毒后跑去扫射警察的家
to get even,
Nicky's crew got stoned one night...
and started shooting up the cops' houses.

2470
02:24:43,778 --> 02:24:47,360
后来严重到连在掏金热潮里
都不方便讲话…
It got to the point where they couldn't
talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2471
02:24:47,490 --> 02:24:49,399
因为联邦调查局在窃听
because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

2472
02:24:49,534 --> 02:24:52,420
他们连在外面讲话时
都得捂住嘴
Even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...

2473
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,756
因为联邦调查局请来了
读唇语的专家
because the Feds brought in lip readers.

2474
02:24:54,956 --> 02:24:57,743
尼奇是从一个欠他钱的
银行职员那听说的
Nicky found out about it from a teller
who owed him money.

2475
02:24:58,626 --> 02:25:00,998
他又问我你跟犹太人老婆的事
FRANK: He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2476
02:25:01,629 --> 02:25:04,001
走、走、走
你说什么？
NICKY: Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

2477
02:25:04,632 --> 02:25:07,268
他又问我你跟犹太人老婆的事
FRANK: He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2478
02:25:07,468 --> 02:25:09,925
你怎么说？
NICKY: What'd you tell him?

2479
02:25:09,971 --> 02:25:11,678
我说我不知道
FRANK: I told him I didn't know nothing.

2480
02:25:11,806 --> 02:25:16,278
杰葛与东尼国理拉说
你要是有做什么就完了
FRANK: Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked up.

2481
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:19,147
你想他是不是背着我回老家
跟他们抱怨？
NICKY: You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

2482
02:25:19,981 --> 02:25:23,041
不，若有的话
你应该早听到风声
FRANK: No, you would have
heard something.

2483
02:25:23,485 --> 02:25:25,940
-有什么阻止他这么做？
-是啊
NICKY: What's to stop him?
FRANK: I know.

2484
02:25:28,198 --> 02:25:31,960
我不相信他了
但老大们不会答应我干掉他的
NICKY: I don't trust him anymore,
but they'd never okay anything.

2485
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,867
但他们一直在问
FRANK: But they keep asking about it.

2486
02:25:34,996 --> 02:25:37,202
当然会问罗
他们靠他赚钱
NICKY: Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.

2487
02:25:39,167 --> 02:25:42,002
我有种感觉
他好像想引发战争
NICKY: I got a funny feeling he's gonna start
a war or something.

2488
02:25:44,172 --> 02:25:47,208
我还不确定
但你知道我要你干嘛吗？
NICKY: I'm not sure yet.
But you know what I want you to do?

2489
02:25:47,342 --> 02:25:49,459
这是谁？
NICKY: Who's this guy?

FRANK: That ain't nobody.

你知道我要你干嘛吗？
NICKY: You know what I want you to do?

2492
02:25:54,391 --> 02:25:58,904
找个人在沙漠挖个洞
要他告诉你在哪儿
NICKY: Get some guys to dig a hole
in the desert and show you where it's at.

2493
02:25:59,104 --> 02:26:01,939
-安基罗与本斯特
-我还不确定
FRANK: Angelo and Buster.
NICKY: I'm not sure yet.

2494
02:26:02,357 --> 02:26:05,035
-他们肯干的
-我准备好时会跟你说…
FRANK: They'll do it.
NICKY: When I'm ready, I'll say the words:

2495
02:26:05,235 --> 02:26:08,998
“去找犹太人”
然后你就让他消失，懂不懂？
"Go see the Jew." And you make
it disappear. Know what I mean?

2496
02:26:09,198 --> 02:26:10,708
让我知道，但你得准备好
FRANK: Let me know.
But you gotta be ready.

你懂我的意思吗？
FRANK: You know what I'm talking about?

2498
02:26:14,161 --> 02:26:15,536
我有叫你行动吗？
NICKY: Did I say to do anything yet?

2499
02:26:15,621 --> 02:26:19,008
我说了我不确定，我会让你知道
我得再想想
NICKY: I said I'm not sure. I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.

2500
02:26:19,208 --> 02:26:21,927
那些混蛋呢？
在旅馆里吗？
NICKY: Where are these pricks at?
They're in the motel?

2501
02:26:22,127 --> 02:26:26,830

GINGER: You should be afraid,
the way you treat me!

2661
02:35:55,833 --> 02:35:57,677
让大家都好过点
It'll make it easier on everybody.

2662
02:35:57,877 --> 02:36:00,414
若让她进去拿东西
我们大家就不打扰你了
COP: If we let her get her things,
we'll be out of your hair.

2663
02:36:00,546 --> 02:36:02,473
她要冷静下来，我就让她进来
If she calms down, I'll let her in.

2664
02:36:02,673 --> 02:36:05,045
-我很冷静！
-若她冷静下来…
GINGER: I am calm!
SAM: If she calms down...

2665
02:36:06,177 --> 02:36:08,104
我让她进来五分钟…
I will let her in for five minutes...

2666
02:36:08,304 --> 02:36:12,066
如果你们愿意在她不愿走时
护送她出去
if you gentlemen will escort her out
if she won't leave.

2667
02:36:12,266 --> 02:36:14,194
-可以进去了吗？
-这不是问题
-Can I go in?
-That's not a problem.

2668
02:36:14,394 --> 02:36:18,361
-杰夫，你跟她去？
-好，好，去你的！
-Jeff, would you go in with her?
-Yes. Fine! Fuck you!

2669
02:36:20,817 --> 02:36:24,517
你无法相信他多坏
他把我的证件都锁起来
GINGER: You wouldn't believe how mean
he is. He's locked up my papers.

2670
02:36:24,654 --> 02:36:27,109
我要拿它们
别让他上来这儿…
I have to get them.
Don't let him come up here...

2671
02:36:27,198 --> 02:36:30,115
因为它们在这书桌里
because I know they're in here
in the desk. Fuck.

2672
02:36:33,329 --> 02:36:37,041
注意点，他随时都会上楼
GINGER: Pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.

2673
02:36:40,003 --> 02:36:42,042
你有看着他吗？
Are you watching for him?

2674
02:36:44,341 --> 02:36:45,539
找到了
GINGER: Got them.

2675
02:36:46,676 --> 02:36:49,249
我不要她在里头超过五分钟
I don't want her in there
more than a few more minutes.

2676
02:36:49,387 --> 02:36:52,387
很快就好了
我们也有别的事要做
It'll just be a couple minutes.
We got other things to do, too.

2677
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:56,767
我们会叫她快点的
He'll hurry her up.

2678
02:36:57,354 --> 02:36:59,595
-其他都还好吧？
-很好
-How's everything else?
-Fine.

2679
02:36:59,815 --> 02:37:04,469
-你那边呢？
-不错啊，我老婆又怀孕了
-How's your family?
-Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.

2680
02:37:05,028 --> 02:37:07,067
-恭喜你
-谢了
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

2681
02:37:08,365 --> 02:37:09,859
我们很开心
We're happy about that.

2682
02:37:09,950 --> 02:37:13,746
我得再拿一样东西
然后我们就可以走了
I just have to get this one more thing,
then we can go.

2683
02:37:13,787 --> 02:37:16,444
妈的！
GINGER: Shit! Fuck!

2684
02:37:16,707 --> 02:37:18,035
妈的！
GINGER: Shit! God!

2685
02:37:18,709 --> 02:37:21,164
气死我了！别管它！
GINGER: That pisses me off! Don't worry.

2686
02:37:23,380 --> 02:37:24,306
若能…
It would be great...

2687
02:37:24,506 --> 02:37:26,016
跟我一起出去最好…
if you could follow me out of here...

2688
02:37:26,216 --> 02:37:28,018
因为他在威胁我！
because he's been threatening me!

2689
02:37:28,218 --> 02:37:30,934
保重，谢谢
Take care. Thank you.

2690
02:37:49,782 --> 02:37:51,608
我真不敢相信
[Crying] I can't believe this.

2691
02:38:02,753 --> 02:38:06,204
我只是需要领一些现金
你可以陪我来吗？
GINGER: I just need to pick up a little cash.
Could you come with me?

2692
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:15,883
-你得阻止她
-抱歉，山姆
SAM: You've got to stop her.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry, Sam.

2693
02:38:16,100 --> 02:38:19,136
-我无能为力
-她是个毒虫，根本就疯了！
CHARLIE: What can I do?
SAM: She's a junkie. She's out of her mind!

2694
02:38:19,312 --> 02:38:21,553
她有钥匙，而且你们两人名字
都在户头上
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.

2695
02:38:21,689 --> 02:38:24,393
我无能为力，我想要帮忙…
There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...

2696
02:38:24,609 --> 02:38:26,566
-但我不能
-严格说，她不能拿
-but I can't.
-Legally, she can't take it.

2697
02:38:26,694 --> 02:38:29,267
-她不能，一半是我的
-听我说
SAM: She can't. Half of it is mine.
CHARLIE: Listen to me.

2698
02:38:29,447 --> 02:38:32,317
-我爱莫能助
-我马上到
CHARLIE: There's nothing I can do.
SAM: I'm coming down.

2699
02:38:45,171 --> 02:38:47,044
妈的！靠！
Shit! God damn it!

2700
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:52,334
我需要个袋子
你可以帮我要个袋子吗？
I'll need a bag. Could you
ask the guy for the big bag?

2701
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:54,509
-拿个袋吧
-拿去
COP: Go get a bag, man.
GINGER: Here.

2702
02:38:54,806 --> 02:38:58,009
-小姐，我不能拿
-你可以，你对我好好
-Lady, I can't take it.
-You can. You've been so nice to me.

2703
02:38:59,477 --> 02:39:02,846
好，帮我打开，好吗？
这样我就可以…
GINGER: Yes, just hold the top open.
All right? And I can....

2704
02:39:06,693 --> 02:39:09,362
天啊，是他！
你们得阻止他
Oh, God! It's him. You have to stop him.

2705
02:39:09,487 --> 02:39:11,313
因为他说他会杀了我
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.

2706
02:39:13,158 --> 02:39:15,399
罗斯坦先生，等一下
COP: Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

2707
02:39:16,244 --> 02:39:17,951
请等一下
COP: Hold on a second.

2708
02:39:18,246 --> 02:39:21,449
-她开走了
-我们不能做什么
SAM: She's driving away.
COP: There's nothing we can do.

2709
02:39:21,666 --> 02:39:23,954
-我们不能做什么
-你瞧瞧
-There's nothing we can do.
-Look, look.

2710
02:39:24,252 --> 02:39:27,556
你们不能抓她超速吗？
看看她开多快
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.

2711
02:39:27,756 --> 02:39:31,393
-我们不能做什么，她有钥匙
-她的名字在户头上
COP: Nothing we can do. She had the key.
COP 2: She's on the account.

2712
02:39:31,593 --> 02:39:34,712
-我们在加油站拦她
-好的，就这么办
-Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station.
-Okay. Let's do it.

2713
02:39:35,728 --> 02:39:37,719
[Siren wailing]

2714
02:39:46,358 --> 02:39:49,145
-我们必须逮捕你
-为了什么？
-We're placing you under arrest.
-For what?

2715
02:39:49,278 --> 02:39:52,232
-为了协助犯罪…
-为了什么？
-For aiding and abetting--
-For what?

2716
02:39:52,531 --> 02:39:55,876
-为了协助犯罪…
-我只是要离开
-For aiding and abetting--
-I'm just trying to leave.

2717
02:39:56,076 --> 02:39:57,962
在这么多威胁之后…
SAM: After all the threats and bullshit...

2718
02:39:58,162 --> 02:40:00,089
金吉儿什么都没告诉他们
it turned out
Ginger didn't tell them anything.

2719
02:40:00,289 --> 02:40:03,718
但那时，他们也不需要她了
But, by then,
the Feds didn't need her anyway.

2720
02:40:03,918 --> 02:40:06,804
-他们已有足够的证据
-但我什么都没做
They had all the pieces they needed.
But I didn't do anything.

2721
02:40:07,004 --> 02:40:12,184
-大家就像牌九一样跟着倒
-联邦调查局！我们有拘捕令！
SAM: Everyone began to tumble,
like dominoes.
FBI! We have a warrant!

2722
02:40:12,384 --> 02:40:14,756
不管是窃听器上派斯康的抱怨…
SAM: Between Piscano complaining
on the wire...

2723
02:40:14,887 --> 02:40:17,923
还是尼奇、我与我的执照…
between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...

2724
02:40:18,224 --> 02:40:21,924
天堂就这样被我们搞砸了
paradise. We managed to really fuck it up.

2725
02:40:22,061 --> 02:40:25,311
-妈
-门口他妈的有人
NICKY JR.: Mom.
JENNIFER: Someone's at the door now.

2726
02:40:25,439 --> 02:40:27,597
联邦调查局，我们有搜查令
FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

2727
02:40:27,733 --> 02:40:30,769
我马上知道苗头不对
所以我跑路了
NICKY: I got wind of the pinches
coming down, so I took off.

2728
02:40:30,903 --> 02:40:32,812
谁要待在那儿找麻烦啊？
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?

2729
02:40:32,947 --> 02:40:35,069
-我是马克凯斯伯，FBI
-是吗？
-I'm Mark Casper, FBI.
-Yeah?

2730
02:40:35,241 --> 02:40:36,783
我可以打个电话吗？
Can I make a fucking phone call?

2731
02:40:36,909 --> 02:40:39,295
可以，但你不用这样对我们讲话
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us
like that.

2732
02:40:39,495 --> 02:40:42,382
大家都出去
往警铃的方向走
FBI AGENT: Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.

2733
02:40:42,582 --> 02:40:46,219
-其他人似乎都被抓了
-这地方被查封了！
NICKY: They got almost everybody else.
FBI AGENT: This area is seized!

2734
02:40:46,419 --> 02:40:49,953
-去拿总户头单
-我要查封所有的文件
-Get the master account list.
-I want all those papers seized.

2735
02:40:53,927 --> 02:40:56,049
将每个箱子都放到桌上
FBI AGENT: Put every box on the table.

[Rhythmic jazz music]

好，在这儿，所有的数字
Yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.

2738
02:41:06,731 --> 02:41:08,273
葛林？别提了
SAM: Green? Don't even ask.

2739
02:41:08,358 --> 02:41:11,109
-你的三万元
-不，所以不成立
-...$30,000 of yours.
-No. That's why it wasn't valid.

2740
02:41:11,236 --> 02:41:14,372
我是被敲诈的
你们想知道什么就问我
I was being extorted.
I'll tell you what you want to know.

2741
02:41:14,572 --> 02:41:16,500
-我不需要隐藏
-最经典的是
PHILIP: I've got nothing to hide.
NICKY: Now for the best.

2742
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:21,004
我不敢相信派斯康的花费记录
竟然成了关键
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

2743
02:41:21,204 --> 02:41:24,466
-这太好了
-他干脆就把蓝图给他们算了
Oh, this is good.
NICKY: He might as well give them
a blueprint.

2744
02:41:24,666 --> 02:41:28,095
所有人的名字、地址、日期
一切都在上面
Everybody's names, addresses,
dates, everything.

2745
02:41:28,295 --> 02:41:31,664
真是多谢你了，派斯康先生
你真是体帖
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.

2746
02:41:31,798 --> 02:41:34,434
-那是我妈的账目
-你被逮捕了
-Those are my mother's books.
-You're under arrest.

2747
02:41:34,634 --> 02:41:37,062
-真是个蠢才
-你在干嘛？
NICKY: What a fucking balloon head.
ARTIE: What are you doing?

2748
02:41:37,262 --> 02:41:39,398
-冷静点
-等一下！

WIFE: Wait!

2749
02:41:39,598 --> 02:41:41,525
-等一下，他有病！
-走开
WIFE: Wait! He's sick!
COP: Move back.

2750
02:41:41,725 --> 02:41:43,847
-是心脏，还呼吸吗？
-快人工呼吸！
WIFE: It's his heart! Is he breathing?
COP 2: CPR now!

2751
02:41:44,186 --> 02:41:46,113
艾提被搞到心脏病发…
SAM: Artie got so upset
he had a heart attack...

2752

当他老婆的面就挂了
and dropped dead right in front of his wife.

2753
02:41:48,732 --> 02:41:50,605
-冷静点！
-我无法冷静！
-Calm down!
-No, I won't calm down!

2754
02:41:50,692 --> 02:41:53,494
-他是我丈夫，艾提！
-我们也不能…
-He's my husband! Artie!
-We can't help him if--

2755
02:41:56,865 --> 02:41:58,193
最后…
SAM: At the end of the day...

2756
02:41:58,325 --> 02:42:00,780
他们终于拿照片来给我看
they finally came to see me
with the pictures.

2757
02:42:00,911 --> 02:42:03,448
为什么要保护一个背叛你的朋友？
FBI AGENT: Why protect a friend
who betrayed you?

2758
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:05,382
但我并不想看它们…
SAM: But I didn't want to look at them...

2759
02:42:05,582 --> 02:42:08,475
或是拿照片来的人
or the guys who brought them.

2760
02:42:10,754 --> 02:42:14,169
大人，你可看见，我的客户们
都年事已大并生病
COUNSELOR: Your Honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

2761
02:42:14,341 --> 02:42:17,395
任何的刑责都将会
严重威胁到他们的健康
COUNSELOR: Any incarceration could pose
a serious health risk.

2762
02:42:17,595 --> 02:42:19,730
当老大们被逮时
有些简直老到…
NICKY: When they were arrested,
some were so old...

2763
02:42:19,930 --> 02:42:21,721
罪状认否程序时都需要医师
they needed doctors at their arraignment.

2764
02:42:21,849 --> 02:42:24,819
预审时建议将保释金额
维持现额
COUNSELOR: Pre-trial services
recommends that bail remain as set.

2765
02:42:25,019 --> 02:42:27,613
-现在休庭
-当情况看来他们似乎…
JUDGE: Take recess.
NICKY: When it looked like they'd get...

2766
02:42:27,813 --> 02:42:30,658
得为了抽头而关上25年时…
25 years to life in prison
just for skimming a casino...

2767
02:42:30,858 --> 02:42:35,204
不管有病没病
总有人要倒霉
sick or no fucking sick, you knew
people were going to get clipped.

2768
02:42:35,404 --> 02:42:39,615
所以在罪状认否程序那天
他们在法庭后头开会
So the day of the arraignment, they had
this meeting in the back of the courthouse.

2769
02:42:39,825 --> 02:42:43,905
当类似的事发生时
你已知道事情会怎样
When something like this happens,
you know how things are gonna work out.

2770
02:42:44,038 --> 02:42:48,217
最好是不要有目击者
那安迪呢？
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?

2771
02:42:48,417 --> 02:42:51,346
他不会说的，史东是好家伙
He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

跟他老爸一样带种
Stand-up guy just like his old man.

2773
02:42:53,965 --> 02:42:55,459
我是这么想的
That's the way I see it.

2774
02:42:55,716 --> 02:42:59,662
我同意，他很强悍
I agree. He's solid. He's a fucking Marine.

2775
02:42:59,846 --> 02:43:04,358
他没问题，一直都是
