二一二年二月二十三日 12:34:13

1
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,536
还有十分钟就开打……
Ten more minutes.

2
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,194
你准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

3
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,721
谁让你进来的，滚！
Get the fuck out of here!

4
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,885
停! 不! 不!不!
Stop! Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

5
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,253
"Jrabbren"（俄语发音，一种软饮料）
"Jrabbren"

6
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,301
我说"krabren".
I said "krabren".

7
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,301
不! 不!
No! No!

8
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:03,390
应该念成：Jrabbren（带典型的俄语喉音发声）
Jrabbren.

9
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,576
J-j-j-- 我念不了这样的音啊！
J-j-j-- I can't say that shit!

10
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,966
嘿, 菲尔!
Hey, Phil!

11
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,291
我们要试多少次才能拍完这一条?
How many times we got to go through that?

12
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:10,526
我们能否改个词，换个发音呢?
Could we just change that last line?

13
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,799
你看到了，必须这样念。
We'll have to do it again.

14
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,628
操，老子不拍了!
Man, fuck this shit!

15
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,930
等等.
Hold on.

16
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:28,051
乔治... 听我说.
George... Listen to me.

17
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,638
你已经不再是拳击冠军了, 做人要低调点，好吗?
You're not the champ anymore, you understand me?

18
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,118
事实上，你现在已经身无分文了.
In fact, right now all you are is broke.

19
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,950
要知道，我们好不容易来到俄罗斯.
Now, we traveled a long way.

20
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:37,864
我一直在帮你重新开始.
I'm trying to get you back on your feet.

21
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,435
一直在帮你挣钱.
I'm trying to get you paid.

22
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,731
所以，帮个忙.
So do me this favor.

23
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,781
按他说的去做.
Please, just do what he asks.

24
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,166
拍另外一个镜头吧，好吗?
Let's give it another shot, huh?

25
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,220
- 但是-- - 不, 不, 不.
- But listen-- - No, no, no.

26
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,565
不要 "但是".
No "but listen".

27
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,425
你在做你分内的工作, 我们得保持微笑...
You just do your job, we smile...

28
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,187
和那些公司的傻鸟老板吃午饭...
go out to dinner with these corporate cocksuckers...

29
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,259
忍一忍，你就能挣大钱回家了.
and you go home a richer man.

30
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:28,054
# Money, money, money #

31
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,100
Whoa.

32
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,341
Hmm.

33
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,726
Oops!

34
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,890
我的顾客们等不及了.
Our customers are very excited.

35
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,864
该死的比赛何时开始?
When the hell does the fight start?

36
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,591
马上就开始了.
It should start any second.

37
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,658
下注情况如何?
What are we giving?

38
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,618
俱乐部的赔率是5比1, 押博伊卡胜.
The bets from the clubs are 5 to 1, Boyka.

39
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:13,120
不过，马尔科夫说的，这个和博伊卡打的新人相当厉害.
Markov says this, uh, new fighter is extremely good.

40
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,374
以前听说过这个人.
Heard that one before.

41
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,577
博伊卡! 博伊卡! 博伊卡!

博伊卡, 博伊卡!

44
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,560

59
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,697
尤里・博伊卡! 博伊卡, 博伊卡, 博伊卡!
Uri Boyka! Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

60
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,661

博伊卡, 博伊卡, 博伊卡!
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

62
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:56,786
博伊卡, 博伊卡!

开始!
Fight!

67
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:57,422
Uh!

68
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,422
Unh! Ah!

69
00:07:58,502 --> 00:07:59,921
- Uh! Argh! - Ah!

70
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:03,081
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

71
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:05,601
- Ha! - Unh!

72
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:07,622
Argh!

73
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,386
- Argh! - Boyka!

74
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,909
Aaah!

75
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:18,095
Uh!

76
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,511
Ugh! Uh!

77
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,479
Uh!

78
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,212
Argh!

79
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:30,611
Argh!

80
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:31,660
Unh! Oh!

81
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:32,661
Bah!

82
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,285
博伊卡, 博伊卡!
Boyka, Boyka!

83
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,376
博伊卡, 博伊卡!
Boyka, Boyka!

84
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,288
合作愉快
To success!

85
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:49,861
他来了.
Here he is.

86
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,206
我去找他.
Excuse me.

87
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:58,317
乔治，你已经迟到一个小时了.
George, you are an hour late for the dinner.

88
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,495
不好意思，我把这事忘了.
Oh, my bad. I forgot all about this dinner.

89
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,964
查伯先生
Mr. Chambers.

90
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:04,249
广告的进展实在让人恼火.
The ad execs are getting pissed off.

91
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,415
进去喝一杯，跟他们沟通下，快.
Come in. Have a drink. We'll go.

92
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,462
好吧. 让我换件衣服.
All right. Let me change clothes.

93
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:08,771
- 给我10分钟. - 10分钟?
- Gimme 10 minutes. - 10 minutes?

94
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,128
在这个节骨眼上?
On top of an hour?

95
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,024
听着，这种扯蛋的公关事务--
Hey, listen, this brown nosing and breaking bread bullshit--

96
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,791
是你的工作. 我已经做好了我该做的.
That's your job. I did mine already.

97
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:14,861
我不想鸟他们.
They can kiss this ass.

98
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,629
告诉你, 等个20分钟吧.
Tell you what, 20 minutes.

99
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,045
Raah!

100
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,369
Argh!

101
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:20,382
Uh!

102
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:21,382
Uh!

103
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,996
Argh!

104
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,636
Unh! Uh!

105
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,702
Ah!

106
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,475
Argh!

107
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,752
- Unh! - Yes!

108
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:34,857
- Unh! - Argh!

109
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,285
Argh!

110
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,512
起来! 搞定他!
Get up! Finish him!

111
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,157
现在!
Now!

112
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,530
Aaaah!

113
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,967
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

114
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,100
Unh!

115
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:19,340
Uh! Oh!

116
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,189
Argh!

117
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:24,677
Uh! Ugh!

118
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,280
你们在我的房间搞什么鬼--
What the fuck are you doing in my--

119
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,841
Ugh!

120
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,744
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

121
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:41,821
停!
Stop!

122
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,247
Boyka, Boyka!

123
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,096
Argh!

124
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,141
Uh!

125
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,141
Argh!

126
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,256
Unh!

127
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,340
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

128
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,284
Raaah!

129
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:12,299
Raah!

130
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,494
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

131
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,964
给.
There.

132
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:41,607
如果我们不能找个牛人来对抗博伊卡...
If we cannot get better odds against Boyka...

133
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,236
我们就不得不在来年春天关门大吉.
we will have to shut down by spring.

134
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,454
赔不起了，靠！
It cannot keep going on like this.

135
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,459
放心吧，我已经想到办法了.
Don't worry. It won't.

136
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:53,689
乔治，他们说没人看到有暴徒侵犯你.
They said nobody saw these guys, George.

137
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:55,783
什么？难道他们没有监控的摄像头?
What, they ain't got no surveillance cameras out here?

138
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:56,860
我不知道.
I don't know.

139
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,051
你不会认为是我自己打自己吧.
You really don't think I did this shit.

140
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,860
又赢了一场，冠军?
Another easy fight, eh, champ?

141
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,440
没有人能打败你，是吧?
No one's ever gonna stop you, huh?

142
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,718
当你离开这里的时候...
When you get out of here some day...

143
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:18,048
你会成为基辅（乌克兰首都）最富有的人.
you'll be the richest man in Kiev.

144
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,678
我只是希望你记得我曾为你服务过--
I just hope you'll remember me--

145
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,201
Aah!
Aah!

146
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,661
对不起，这是意外.
It was an accident.

147
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,769
把你的手拿过来.
Put out your hand.

148
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,821
不要.
No.

149
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:34,813
博伊卡.
Boyka.

150
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:35,863
你在听吗?
Did you hear?

151
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:37,133
听什么?
Hear what?

152
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,652
他马上要来了.
He is coming.

153
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,006
警察已经在他的房间里.
The police is already in his room.

154
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,409
他明天就到这.
He'll be here tomorrow.

155
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,035
Aaah!
Aaah!

156
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:11,097
这是你的圣经吗?
This is your Bible?

157
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:15,049
是的，警官.
Why, yes, sir.

158
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:18,058
我随身携带圣经.
I take the Good Book with me everywhere I go.

159
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:19,450
哦.
Mmm.

160
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,410
这个东西不是我的.
That is not mine.

161
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,492
那么这个也不是你的东西了.
Then this must not be yours, too.

162
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,121
对，不是我的.
No, it isn't.

163
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,824
你搞毛啊?
What the hell is going on here?

164
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,287
他们陷害我.
They're setting me up.

165
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:51,904
美国拳击手乔治・查伯被移往...
American boxer George Chambers has been transferred...

166
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,825
一座戒备森严的监狱内等待审判.
to a maximum security jail to await charges.

167
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:58,128
他六年前因为有争议的人身攻击行为 而被指控……
Convicted of a controversial assault charge 6 years ago...

168
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:02,101
这个前世界轻量级拳击冠军也曾被警告，因为...
the former Heavyweight Champion of the World was also cautioned...

169
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,681
拥有过量的非法止痛药片，在1993年的时候.
in 1993 over the possession of illegal painkillers.

170
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,201
可靠消息指出这次他涉案的毒品数量...
Our sources have indicated that the quantity...

171
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,683
超过了俄国法律规定的界限...
of narcotics involved is well over the threshold...

172
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:11,167
他将面临贩毒的指控.
for a trafficking charge.

173
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,909
这是马丽亚・阿隆索发自俄罗斯的报道.
This is Maria Alonso reporting from Russia.

174
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,241
他刚到了.
He just arrived.

175
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,839
看什么看?
Fuck are y'all lookin' at?

176
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:30,931
Yeah.
Yeah.

177
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,890
晚上好，查伯先生.
Good evening, Mr. Chambers.

178
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,285
我相信你一路上过得并不舒服.
I trust your journey wasn't too uncomfortable.

179
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:45,415
现在，我们再谈这个没鸟意思了.
Now, you and I both know you don't give a damn how my journey was.

180
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:47,733
我知道你以前进过监狱...
I understand you have been to prison before...

181
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:49,666
在你美国老家.
in the United States.

182
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:52,621
呵呵，你不要假装不知道...
And don't pretend that you don't know...

183
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:53,739
我是谁.
who the hell I am, either.

184
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,434
我可是你的超级粉丝...
I was a big fan of yours...

185
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,960
为你辉煌的职业生涯倾倒.
during height of your career.

186
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,866
事实上，我们很高兴能在这看到你.
In fact, we all are very excited you are here.

187
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,406
别太兴奋了, 因为我打算尽快离开这里...
Don't get too excited, 'cause I plan on walking...

188
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,766
一旦这桩鸟事有了个结果.
straight outta here as soon as this shit's straightened out.

189
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,935
可能吧.
Perhaps.

190
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,328
但是，同时...
But in the meantime...

191
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:11,265
你应该知道在这种地方...
you should know that in this facility...

192
00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:13,033
我们非常渴望“斗士”.
we think very highly of fighters.

193
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:15,828
事实上，我们已经培养出了自己的冠军.
In fact, we even have our own champion.

194
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:18,247
你没听我说话, 克林克上校.
You ain't hearing me, Colonel Klink.

195
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,380
我已经说过了，我不会在这呆太久.
I told you. I don't plan on staying here long.

196
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,358
操！把水加热。
Fuck y'all. Heat this shit up.

197
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:09,207
你现在开始洗澡.
You take shower now.

198
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,646
操你妈的.
Go...fuck...yourself.

199
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:17,943
Ugh!

200
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:18,983
Ugh!

201
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,906
Argh! Ow!

202
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,173
Ugh!

203
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,836
Ugh!

204
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,511
Hmm.

205
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:53,894
Ha ha ha!

206
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,147
冠军，这是博伊卡给你的礼物，热腾腾的尿.
Champ, gift from Boyka. Warm piss.

207
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:02,686
- Unh! - Ugh!

208
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,703
Argh!

209
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:07,813
Ugh!

210
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:08,940
Unh!

211
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,635
Argh!

212
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:12,087
Oh!

213
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:32,329
没事吧, 伙计?
Are you all right, chum?

214
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:35,865
转过身去，别让老子看到你!
Turn around, get the fuck out of my face!

215
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,730
好吧.
Got it.

216
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:47,579
操! 这里真恶心!
Ugh! This is bullshit!

217
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:34,309
我不想打扰你，但是...
I don't mean to bother you, but...

218
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,959
你最好快点起床.
you better get up.

219
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,964
知道吗，如果你现在不离开这个房间...
Look, if you don't leave your cell...

220
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:44,095
等会他们就会锁门的.
when they unlock the door, they'll lock it again.

221
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:46,144
意味着你这一天都要困在这，出去不了.
You won't eat or get air for the rest of the day.

222
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:51,736
没有什么事……
Not that either of those things...

223
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:53,055
比不呆在这更让人愉快了.
are particularly pleasant out here.

224
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,025
伙计...
Yo, dude...

225
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,022
坦白讲.
Iet's get one thing straight.

226
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,533
我现在不想了解这里的垃圾规矩...
Now, I don't need to learn the ropes around here...

227
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,428
还懂?
you feel me?

228
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,807
好的，查伯先生.
Sure, Mr. Chambers.

229
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:06,557
当然理解.
Of course.

230
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:54,606
躲开!
Move!

231
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:56,737
老兄，你什么意思，你瞎了吧?
Hey, man, what the fuck? Man, you blind, too?

232
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,322
别介意.
Ignore him.

233
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,813
一个老疯子.
He's a bit crazy.

234
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,402
他被困在这太久了，懂我的意思吧?
Been here too long, you know what I mean?

235
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:05,268
平时在地下工作，只有到吃饭的时间才上来.
Lives underground. Only comes up here at mealtimes.

236
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:14,820
像“五星级宾馆待遇”，是不是?
Not exactly five star, is it?

237
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,982
不介意我坐在这和你一起吃吧?
Uh...do you mind if I join you?

238
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:00,874
嘿，老兄，你干吗老盯着我看?
Yo, dude, why do you keep staring at me like that?

239
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,288
不好意思.
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,152
只是--
It's just--

241
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,221
我无论如何都想不到...
Well, it's incredible that I'm sharing a cell...

242
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,495
能在这儿和大名鼎鼎的乔治・查伯共处一室.
with George Chambers here.

243
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:15,786
我叫斯蒂文・帕克.
Steven Parker.

244
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:23,403
我建议你马上站起来.
I suggest you stand up.

245
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,238
Unh!
Unh!

246
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:38,653
我不是非要你这么干...
Look, I don't want to be pushy, man...

247
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,011
但你最好不要惹毛博伊卡.
but you don't want to mess with Boyka.

248
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:02,102
你,站起来!
You, stand!

249
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,160
站起来...快点!
You stand up...now!

250
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,304
Mmf!
Mmf!

251
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:13,769
- Unh! - Ugh!
- Unh! - Ugh!

252
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,166
你就是博伊卡?
Boyka, huh?

253
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:38,044
真JB恶心的名字
Now, what kind of bitch ass name is that?

254
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:43,400
我知道你曾是了不起的冠军.
You were great champion. I know.

255
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:46,690
但那是很久很久以前的事了.
Long time ago. Long time.

256
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:51,632
在这里，我才是冠军.
But in here, I am the champion.

257
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,169
而你...
And you...

258
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,937
只是一砣屎--
You are just my bi--

259
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,125
Raaah!

260
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:27,793
来吧，操!
Let's go, motherfucker!

261
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,398
拉开他们! 拉开他们!
Bring it! Bring it!

262
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,117
老子揍死你！
Let's go right now!

263
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:33,836
操!
Fuck you!

264
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:39,007
为什么阻止我?!
Why did you stop me?!

265
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,368
你以为我会怕那个王八蛋吗?
You think I'm afraid of that fucking oaf?

266
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:43,837
尤里，我已经告诉过你，你会和他公开单挑的.
Uri, I told you you'll have your own shot at him.

267
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:46,323
我已经在揍他!
I had my shot at him!

268
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,615
但是你的手下阻止了!
And then your guards stepped in to save him!

269
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,012
你到底想帮谁?!
How do you think that looks?!

270
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:51,487
忍耐一下，我们会帮你的.
Look, we help.

271
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,158
我没有问你.
I didn't ask you.

272
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,345
你阻止不了我想做的任何事.
You cannot stop me from doing what I have to do.

273
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,501
没人想阻止你.
No one wants to stop you.

274
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:02,392
我们只想提醒你，我们的职责是确保...
We're just telling you we have to be sure...

275
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,423
单挑是在擂台上，而不是在食堂!
it is in the ring!

276
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,375
Argh!
Argh!

277
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,723
情况不妙.
Some bad news.

278
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,435
俄国人拒绝了我们的保释请求.
They're not offering bail.

279
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:13,849
你通知洛山矶的鲁本没有?
Did you call Ruben in L.A.?

280
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:16,208
乔治，你要知道鲁本是美国律师.
George, Ruben is an American attorney.

281
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:17,573
他对这件事爱莫能助.
He can't help with this.

282
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:19,928
那你还找其他人了-- 听着.
Did you even call-- Listen.

283
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:23,325
你最好告诉我现在怎么解决这案子.
You better tell me something I wanna hear right now.

284
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:24,732
我去过美国大使馆.
I've already been to the embassy.

285
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,091
他们对解决这事挺乐观的.
They're very upbeat.

286
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:27,836
但是他们告诉我这事运作起来...
But they're telling me the process can take...

287
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:29,213
至少要一个月--
anywhere from a month--

288
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,840
一个月?!
A month?!

289
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:33,247
这算什么鸟办法?!
What the fuck you talking about?!

290
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:35,687
现在，菲尔，我向上帝发誓...
Now, Phil, I swear to God...

291
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,820
你最好回去帮我找一群律师来...
you better turn around and get me a team of lawyers...

292
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:39,251
然后把我从这鬼地方救出去!
and get me the fuck out of here!

293
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:40,458
我想帮你啊.
I will.

294
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,654
但这需要时间.
It's just gonna take a little bit more time.

295
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,332
你这该死的小丑!
You fucking clown!

296
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:47,881
你知道耗在俄国的监狱里是什么感觉吗?
You know what it feels like to be in here for nothing, huh?

297
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:49,484
你在忽悠我!
You're bullshittin' me!

298
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:52,655
耐心点，乔治! 我尽我所能!
Just be patient, George! I'm doing everything I can!

299
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,044
我亲爱的马尔科夫.
My dear friend, Markov.

300
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:03,760
事情进展如何?
So, where are we?

301
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:06,093
黑鬼正被激怒.
He's uncomfortable.

302
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,721
这是一个好的开始.
That's a good first step.

303
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:11,048
我不需要什么好的开始，我要他俩马上打起来.
I don't need first steps. I need them to fight.

304
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:13,719
他和博伊卡之间已经有打架的动力了.
There's already bad blood between him and Boyka.

305
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,438
我想他最终会和博伊卡单挑的.
I think he'll--he'll-- he'll fight.

306
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,466
- 你想? - 是的.
- You think? - Yeah.

307
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,157
哦，这真是一个惊喜.
Well, that's a nice surprise.

308
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:20,259
"想" 是远远不够的，马尔科夫
"Think" isn't good enough, Markov.

309
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,073
我现在就要比赛的事尽快搞定.
I have to start making arrangements now.

310
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,106
恩...好吧.
Eh...sure.

311
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,451
最大的麻烦是……
Th-th-the only problem is, eh,

312
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:27,346
那个白痴黑人想早点离开这，重获自由.
this idiot hopes he'll go free any day.

313
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:28,925
哦，这样啊...
Yeah...

314
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:30,752
这事我负责搞定.
Well, I'll handle that.

315
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,975
你负责把他俩弄上擂台.
You just take care of the fight.

316
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,025
-马尔科夫... - 啥?
- And Markov... - Yeah?

317
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,513
不要让我失望，记住了吗?
Don't disappoint me, ok?

318
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,816
我说, 够了!
I said, enough!

319
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:50,748
到底怎么了?! 你们想干嘛?!
What the fuck's going on?! Why are you doing this?!

320
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,606
Ugh!

321
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,510
Ow, unh!

322
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,335
Argh!

323
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,233
Ugh, uh!

324
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,044
Argh!

325
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:23,065
Unh!

326
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:24,145
Aah!

327
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,704
Aaargh!

328
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:27,857
Ow!

329
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:33,674
Ugh! Unh! Ugh!

330
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,782
Ow!

331
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:53,330
谢谢.
Thank you.

332
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,344
他们为啥打你?
What the hell was that about?

333
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,231
没什么.
Nothing.

334
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,453
但无论如何都要谢谢你.
But thanks for your help anyway.

335
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,544
毒虫（吸毒上瘾的人），你悠着点，
Well, don't take it personally, junkie.

336
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,812
我只是不想看到一群人欺负一个人罢了.
I just don't like seeing people getting bullied.

337
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,864
除非我也是其中的一员.
Unless it's me doing the bullying.

338
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,697
听我说, 查博先生...
Listen, Mr. Chambers...

339
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:13,281
你应该知道这里的一些规矩.
there's something you ought to know about this place.

340
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,998
当然，即使你有一天会离开这.
E-even when you're getting out any day, of course.

341
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,660
说?
What?

342
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:21,474
这里被黑道统治.
It's owned by the mob.

343
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:24,156
我的意思是有一个黑老大.
I mean... One man, really.

344
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:27,068
他控制一切，包括法律和警察.
He owns the cons, he owns the cops.

345
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,336
他叫卡卡.
Ha! He's name is Gaga.

346
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:30,732
哈哈!
Ha ha ha!

347
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:32,553
- 卡卡? - 是的.
- Gaga? - Yeah.

348
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,816
你为什么要告诉我这些?
So why are you telling me?

349
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,706
以防万一...
Just thought it best if--if--if--if you...

350
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,245
万一什么?
If I what?

351
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:40,381
简单地说.
Go with the program.

352
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,483
就是如何保护好自己.
Best way to stay healthy.

353
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:45,887
呵呵，我有自己的办法保护自己.
Hey! I got my own way of staying healthy.

354
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,103
怎么保护?
What's that?

355
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,531
狠狠地揍那些兔崽子...
Knock the other son of a bitch out...

356
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:50,432
如果他们敢惹我.
before he gets a chance to do it to me.

357
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:06,297
发生什么事了?!
What happened?!

358
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:09,655
什么?!
What?!

359
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,005
你敢在这为所欲为?!
You think you come in here and do what you want?!

360
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:20,332
操！这是我的地盘.
Fuck you! This is my world.

361
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:22,155
操你妈的！
Motherfucker, keep your world.

362
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:23,418
老子才不稀罕你的地盘.
I don't want this shit.

363
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:25,155
有种你别嚎叫
And anyway, why you talking to me right now, man?

364
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,032
咱们来干一场--
Either throw your hands or step the fuck--

365
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:28,873
- 好啊，来啊! - 操你妈的!
- If you're so tough, then fight me! - Bitch ass motherfucker!

366
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:30,366
到擂台上打!
In the ring!

367
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:31,386
操，我才不去擂台!
Man, fuck the ring!

368
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:32,617
就在这打.
We can do this shit right now.

369
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,855
操你这个SB!
Bitch-ass punk!

370
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,417
日，有种在擂台打!
Fuck you! Fight me in the ring!

371
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,734
痛快点! 就在这解决!
Right now! I'll take you right here!

372
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,133
- 来啊! - 来啊!
- Come on! - Come on!

373
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:47,262
还等什么?
What you got for me?

374
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,497
操!
Fuck you!

375
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,504
就在这打, 操你妈的，来啊!
I'll fight you right now, motherfucker! Come on!

376
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,621
- 到擂台上打! - 去你妈的!
- In the ring! - Fuck that!

377
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,796
你一次只能集中精神打一个人.
You have to concentrate on one fight at a time.

378
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,099
先别管那个美国黑鬼--
Forget the American--

379
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,525
闭嘴!做你的事!
Shut up! Do your fucking job!

380
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:07,779
什么鸟世界轻量级拳击冠军.
Heavyweight Champion of the World.

381
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,133
我会把他的头扭下来!
I'll rip his fucking head off!

382
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,041
是的，你当然会.
Of course you will.

383
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:15,486
但是今晚你会扭另外一个人的头, 好吧?
But tonight you rip someone else's head off, ok?

384
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:16,969
闭嘴!
Shut up!

385
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,590
博伊卡.
Boyka.

386
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,010
下注情况如何?
So what are the bets?

387
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,754
25万人押前三回合结束...
250,000 across the first 3 rounds...

388
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,862
只有20人押四至5回合结束.
and another 20 across 4 and 5.

389
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:29,635
情况还可以好点. 给我电话.
Could be a lot better. Give me the phone.

390
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,647
马尔科夫.
Markov.

391
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:35,051
搞定没?
What the hell's going on?

392
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:37,449
比赛将在15分钟内开始.
Fight starts in 15 minutes.

393
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:39,083
我现在正赶往现场.
I'm walking to the arena right now.

394
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,491
我不是谈这场比赛.
That's not what I'm talking about.

395
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:42,313
我是说你搞定那个黑鬼没?
What the fuck's going on with Chambers?

396
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:44,230
我们正在尽力，卡卡.
We're doing everything we can, Gaga.

397
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:47,453
再加把劲，加把劲，好吧？
You better do more, my friend. You better do more, understand?

398
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,547
好的.
Yes.

399
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,624
Boyka, Boyka!

400
00:31:54,427 --> 00:31:55,501
Fight!

401
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:00,860
Unh!

402
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,943
Unh! Ugh!

403
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:04,142
Ugh!

404
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,609
Boyka! Boyka!

405
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,163
Raaah!

406
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,800
Boyka! Boyka!

407
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:10,867
Unh!

408
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:12,634
Unh! Uh!

409
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:18,466
Arghhh.

410
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:20,737
Unh!

411
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,033
Raah!

412
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:25,527
Boyka!

413
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:27,586
Ugh!

414
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:31,377
Unh! Ah!

415
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:33,906
Uh!

416
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:35,907
Ow!

417
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,506
Argh! Argh!

418
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,162
Boyka!

419
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:46,735
Unh! Ow!

420
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,399
Argh!

421
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:50,193
Ow!

422
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,986
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

423
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:57,139
Unh! Yaah!

424
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,456
Yah!

425
00:32:58,548 --> 00:32:59,507
Ow!

426
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:03,032
Arrrrgh!

427
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,911
Unh! Unh!

428
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,718
Ow!

429
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,699
Unh!

430
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,320
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

431
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,154
Boyka! Boyka!

432
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,024
Unh!

433
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,095
Boyka! Boyka!

434
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:25,029
Unh! Unh! Unh!

435
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:29,173
Stop! Stop!

436
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,648
Unh!

437
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:34,354
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

438
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,274
Argh!

439
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,455
Argh!

440
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,094
Unh!

441
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:12,565
监狱长要见你.
Warden wants to see you.

442
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:15,430
我现在唯一想见的人是美国大使.
Only person I wanna see is from the U.S. embassy.

443
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,041
你现在必须见狱长.
You see warden now.

444
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:25,408
Ugh!
Ugh!

445
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:39,988
操你妈的--!
Motherfuck--!

446
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:41,986
Ugh!

447
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:44,976
够了.
That's enough.

448
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,449
查伯先生...
Mr. Chambers...

449
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:52,997
你自己不断地给自己找麻烦.
you are making things very difficult on yourself.

450
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:57,179
我给你指出一条活路.
There's a way you can make your time here much easier.

451
00:34:58,507 --> 00:35:01,614
你已经知道我们监狱的搏击冠军...
You've seen now our resident champion...

452
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:03,974
尤里・博伊卡有多牛B了.
Uri Boyka, in action.

453
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:06,524
我们想你和他之间来一场擂台赛.
We want to arrange a fight between the two of you.

454
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,163
我才不干!
I ain't fighting, man!

455
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,990
我不想参加这种狗日的马戏团杂耍...
I wouldn't take part in this circus brawl bullshit...

456
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:12,989
你安排的一切.
you got going on here anyway.

457
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:15,140
你叫那种鸟事什么?
The hell you call that shit?

458
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,070
运动吗?
A sport?

459
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:20,181
就像我说过的，如果你答应了...
As I was saying, if you fight...

460
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,998
你会发现事情完全不一样了...
you'll find that things could become...

461
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,374
比呆在这愉快多了.
much more pleasant around here.

462
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,502
或许，你甚至可以...
Who knows? You could even find yourself...

463
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,583
坐上回家的飞机.
on a plane heading home.

464
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,983
好，听着.
Fine. Have it your way.

465
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:43,195
你现在的工作是为整个监狱掏下水道.
Sewage duct for whole prison.

466
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:45,112
非常破旧.
Very old.

467
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,221
每天都堵塞的下水道.
Clogged every day.

468
00:35:48,987 --> 00:35:49,907
干吧!
Go!

469
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:52,407
去你妈的!
Uh, hell no!

470
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:54,667
干!
Go!

471
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,626
把那东西拿开!
Get that shit out of my face!

472
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,848
去捡起来.
Go get it.

473
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:06,346
操!
Fuck you!

474
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:18,237
敬酒不吃，吃罚酒.
If you don't work, then we'll make you work.

475
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,349
嘿.
Heh.

476
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,387
什么?
What?

477
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,096
不要给那些“猩猩”任何整你的借口.
Don't give these gorillas an excuse.

478
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,026
不值得.
It's not worth it.

479
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,217
告诉我你的工作号.
Give me number.

480
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:10,266
在你的铁锹上.
On your shovel.

481
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,106
Eighteen.
18.

482
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:20,594
你每天干完活后记得把铁锹还我.
You bring it back to me when you've finished each day.

483
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:24,739
在还之前，一定记得把屎清理干净.
Make sure you clean the shit before you give it back.

484
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:27,513
吹得不错啊.
Not bad for an old Russian dude.

485
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:30,508
我经常练而已.
I've had time to practice.

486
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,259
天啊!
Oh, Christ!

487
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,605
你真臭.
Man, you truly stink.

488
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:04,512
去死吧.
Fuck you.

489
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,697
或许我应该戴个防毒面具.
Maybe I should ask for a gas mask.

490
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:10,093
你还可以申请换个房间.
Or maybe transfer to another cell.

491
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:12,530
那意味着你会失去与我聊天的乐趣，如何?
What, and miss out on my sparkling conversation?

492
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:16,552
貌似克罗特会让你不好过的哦.
Looks like Crot gave you quite a hard time.

493
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:17,822
谁?
Who?

494
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,442
轮椅上的那个家伙, 克罗特.
The guy in the wheelchair, Crot.

495
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:21,812
克罗特在俄语里是鼹鼠的意思. （比喻他在地下打洞）
Crot is Russian for mole.

496
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,098
你要了解...
You know...

497
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,459
那家伙曾是苏联红军的军官.
that guy used to be a commando in the Russian army.

498
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:30,621
他被关进来后相当凶悍.
I'm told that he was quite a mean motherfucker back then.

499
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:32,246
甚至杀了一个狱卒.
He even killed a prison guard.

500
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,466
你说那老家伙?
That old dude?

501
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,122
是的.
Yeah.

502
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:39,412
他会在地洞里被关一辈子的.
There's no way they're gonna let him out of this shit hole.

503
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:40,700
哦.
Hmm.

504
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,322
但是，你就不一样了...
But you, on the other hand...

505
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:45,574
你是少数能有机会从这脱身的人.
you're one of the lucky few that does have a way out.

506
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:47,282
是吗? 如何脱身?
Yeah? How so?

507
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,997
听马尔科夫的话，跟博伊卡打一场.
Take Markov's offer. Fight Boyka.

508
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,358
天啊, 难道你们不睡觉的?
Jesus, don't you guys ever sleep?

509
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:40,549
Aah!
Aah!

510
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:42,278
看你那鸟样，毒虫.
Look at you, junkie fuck.

511
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:44,076
好痛--
C-can't--

512
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,109
Argh!

513
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:46,799
你应当庆幸你还活着.
You're lucky to still be breathing.

514
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:47,982
Unh.

515
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:50,868
如果那黑鬼还不答应打擂台的事，你就完了.
If he doesn't fight soon, your luck will end.

516
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:56,457
Ah!

517
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,003
我们给你带来博伊卡的口信.
We bring you a message from Boyka.

518
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,089
Argh!

519
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,337
Unh! Ow!

520
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,150
Ow!

521
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:25,761
Ugh!

522
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,056
Aah!

523
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:33,028
Argh!

524
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:35,969
嘿!
Hey!

525
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:42,788
Ugh!

526
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,143
Argh!

527
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:53,417
Ow!

528
00:41:53,507 --> 00:41:55,272
Unh!

529
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,310
Oh!

530
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,253
Uh!

531
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:01,770
- Uh! - Uh!

532
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:03,750
Ow!

533
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:05,979
Ow!

534
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,658
Argh!

535
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:22,308
走.
Move.

536
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:24,829
走.
Move.

537
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:35,177
Ugh!

538
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,729
Argh!

539
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:42,130
好好呆着.
Enjoy your new home.

540
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,249
什么事?
What?

541
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:53,766
他被关进了水牢.
He's in the hole.

542
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,750
一个可以使人改变想法的地方.
People change their minds in that place.

543
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,021
做得好
Good.

544
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,979
Ugh.

545
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,489
Ow!

546
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:30,199
嘿
Hey.

547
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,881
站起来
Stand up.

548
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:33,792
站起来接这碗热汤
Stand up. I have soup.

549
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:48,185
这是药丸
Pills.

550
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,558
嚼着吞
Chew and swallow.

551
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,434
能降烧
Help with your fever.

552
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,409
你为什么要帮我？
Why are you doing this?

553
00:43:57,508 --> 00:43:59,081
闭嘴，别废话
Shut up and drink.

554
00:44:00,188 --> 00:44:01,608
还有面包
And take this, too.

555
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:08,578
嘿
Hey.

556
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,249
你为什么帮我？
Why are you doing this?

557
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,958
你为什么老是问个不停？
Why do you care why I do it?

558
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:21,138
因为我从一个从不免费帮人的地方来（美国）
'Cause where I'm from, ain't nothin' free. Why?

559
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,076
你从没帮过别人吗？
You never help anyone?

560
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:27,570
可能真没有吧
Probably not.

561
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,510
操！你不了解我
Motherfucker, you don't know me.

562
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:31,777
至少我给我妈购买了一幢豪宅
That's why I bought my mother a ten-bedroom house.

563
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,827
但我不会这么慷慨的对其他人
I don't do for nobody, shit.

564
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:36,135
但你也可以帮你自己
You probably do that for you, too.

565
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:38,378
你知道你的问题在哪吗，老家伙？
Hey, you know what your problem is, old man?

566
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:41,845
你被关太久了，已经变得很不现实了
You been here too long. You lost touch with reality.

567
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:46,019
呵呵，你的问题恰恰在于你太不现实了
Your problem is that you're not accepting reality.

568
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:48,531
现实是，我被人陷害
Reality is, I was framed.

569
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,206
我不属于这
I don't belong here.

570
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:52,114
我也不会在这呆太久的
And I ain't gonna be here much longer.

571
00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:55,452
你还是没明白
You still don't understand.

572
00:44:55,669 --> 00:44:58,316
他们不会让你轻易离开这的
They will never let you out of here.

573
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:18,515
把他捞起来清洁干净
Get him cleaned up.

574
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,790
这是白色大鲟鱼的顶级鱼子酱
It is Beluga caviar.

575
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:57,788
每千克要2万5千美圆
25,000 American dollars per kilo.

576
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,175
对我来说，这像老鼠屎
Looks like rat shit to me.

577
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,227
闻起来也像，呵呵
Smells like it, too.

578
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:04,384
你知道我是谁吗？查伯先生
Do you know who I am, Mr. Chambers?

579
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,581
你是“大狗”，对不对?
You're the big dog, right?

580
00:46:06,669 --> 00:46:10,159
是的，我是“大狗”
Yeah. I'm the big dog.

581
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,536
汪、汪，呵呵
Ruff! Heh.

582
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,470
我是把你弄到这来的大狗
I am the big dog that brought you here.

583
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,083
那么……大狗先生……
So...Mr. Big Dog...

584
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:21,187
你难道就不怕我跳起来……
what makes you think I won't jump up there...

585
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:22,728
把你揍成一条死狗?
and make you a dead dog?

586
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,671
因为我相信你没那么笨
Because I know you're not stupid.

587
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:33,269
让我解释一下，查伯先生
Let me explain something to you, Mr. Chambers.

588
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,461
我是一个商人
I'm a business man.

589
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,080
而这就是一个商业运作
And, uh, this is a business situation.

590
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,229
请
Please.

591
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,863
我把你弄进来，也能把你放出去
I brought you here. I can let you out.

592
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:47,869
选择权……在你手里
The choice...is yours.

593
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,945
你想我和那个博伊卡鸟人在擂台上干一架，对吧？
You want me to fight that clown Boyka, right?

594
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:52,912
是的，这会让我很高兴
It will make me very happy, yeah.

595
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:55,411
如果我不答应呢？
And if I don't?

596
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:56,966
这样的话……
Well...

597
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,487
你会老死在这个监狱
you could end up in this place for a very long time.

598
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:02,546
运气好点的话，会遇上一次意外，早点超脱……
Maybe meet with an accident. Perhaps stay forever.

599
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,550
我已让我的人负责斡旋...
Well as we speak, I got my man working on turning...

600
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,548
会把整件事曝光在媒体面前
this thing into the biggest media circus you ever seen.

601
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:10,935
你的人?
Your man?

602
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:11,989
哪一位啊?
Which one is this?

603
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,221
我的经纪人
My manager.

604
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,852
菲尔，你他妈的站在那干吗--
Phil, what the fuck are you doing up--

605
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,415
听着，乔治，一切都会好起来……
Listen, George, everything is going to be all right.

606
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,583
卡卡有个伟大的计划
Gaga here has a great plan.

607
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:30,898
我们都会发财的
We're all gonna make a ton of money.

608
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,339
放屁！
Oh, shit.

609
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:35,232
他们告诉我整件事会很快解决的
They told me the whole thing would be quick.

610
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:36,617
你将在一周内重获自由
That you'd be out in a week.

611
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,198
一大笔钱啊，是我们梦寐以求的
The money is huge. It's what we've been waiting for.

612
00:47:41,431 --> 00:47:44,116
你只要识时务，不要那么固执
You just need to stop being so goddamned stubborn...

613
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,766
去擂台上打一场
and take the fight.

614
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:49,705
操你妈的，老子要踢烂你的屁股！
Motherfucker! I'll kill your motherfuckin' ass!

615
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,751
你个王八蛋!
Backstabbing son of a bitch!

616
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,555
别傻了，打擂台吧！
Don't be stupid. Take the fight!

617
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,549
该死的，闭嘴！
Shut up, dead man! Shut the fuck up!

618
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,476
操！
Fuck you!

619
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,567
我有一个好消息
I have good news.

620
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:14,190
说
Tell me.

621
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,647
我太兴奋了，乔治
I'm so bloody excited, George.

622
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:17,713
为何？
Why?

623
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:19,059
为何?
Why?

624
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,835
因为你马上要和博伊卡打了
You're going to fight Boyka, that's why.

625
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,421
嘿...
Hey...

626
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,504
你不需要一个助手吗?
You don't need a cornerman, do you?

627
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,471
哦，你有适当的人选?
Why, you got somebody in mind?

628
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,006
乔治...
George...

629
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:34,877
我是这里你唯一能信任的人...
I'm the only one you can trust around here...

630
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,947
你知道的，对不?
you know that, don't you?

631
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,832
我能问你一个问题吗? 乔治
Can I ask you something, George?

632
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,026
什么?
What?

633
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:59,666
如果你离开这了...
If you got out of here...

634
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:02,478
你想干的第一件事是啥?
what's the first thing you'd do?

635
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,277
你的意思是“当”我离开这里的时候，对不?
You mean "when" I get out of here, right?

636
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,658
当然
Of course.

637
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,716
我还不知道，兄弟
I don't know, Stevie.

638
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,210
我想去看我老婆
I'd try to see my wife.

639
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,272
你结婚了?
You're married?

640
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,486
“应该”是吧
I like to think so.

641
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:29,229
她来这探望过你吗?
She ever visit you here?

642
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,767
来过一次
Once.

643
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:38,609
她现在另结新欢
She's got a boyfriend now.

644
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:41,360
一个做生意或干别的行当的
Commodities or something.

645
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:43,044
真不幸啊，兄弟
That's messed up, Stevie.

646
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,945
这样也好，不再心痛了
Doesn't hurt anymore.

647
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,801
你知道，有一段时间还是很痛苦的
Used to, you know?

648
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,711
现在结束了
Not anymore.

649
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,177
你何时才能离开这?
When are you getting out of here, man?

650
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,296
哦...
Ohh...

651
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:04,295
还有12年
twelve years.

652
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,423
真糟糕!
Damn!

653
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,121
兄弟...
Stevie...

654
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,838
你是否想过戒毒呢?
you ever think about cleaning your shit up?

655
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,291
为何而戒?
What for?

656
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,026
哦.
Wow.

657
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,684
兄弟，不要这样举着
See, Stevie, don't hold it like that.

658
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,747
应当这样举着
Hold it like this. You hold it like this...

659
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:06,022
你的肩膀与软垫之间要保持一定的距离
you'll rip your shoulder out of the socket.

660
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,798
像这样举着，还懂?
So hold it like that, you got it?

661
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:10,134
- 懂了 - 慢慢来
- I think so. - Don't worry.

662
00:51:10,271 --> 00:51:12,419
好的，左
All right. Jab.

663
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,008
右
Cross.

664
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,453
左
Jab.

665
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,969
右
Cross... jab.

666
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:17,991
# I'm gonna crush you #

667
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,374
# Thank you much #

668
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,772
# You can't compete with me, I'm gonna flush you #

669
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:24,019
# Send you out to sea, so take a number, line 'em up #

670
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,605
# I'll cut you down like a tree, I'm gonna crush you #

671
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,249
# Flatten out your brain, gonna rush you #

672
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:30,769
# You gonna get such pain, they're gonna brush you #

673
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:32,293
# Dust you off the ring #

674
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,655
# Bow down low 'cause there can only be one king #

675
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,514
# I'm dropping bombs on you like a blitzkrieg crew #

676
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:40,970
# And you can't see through the fog of this storm of power #

677
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,142
# 'Cause I am the man of your life's last hour #

678
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:46,383
# You gonna feel my game until you scream #

679
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,265
Ugh.

680
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:12,674
醒醒
Hey. Hey.

681
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,095
醒醒!
Hey!

682
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,952
醒醒!!
Hey!!

683
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,680
你们想干嘛？
Oh, for fuck's sake, man.

684
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:22,787
我不是按你们的吩咐把事办妥了吗?
I did everything you asked, didn't I?

685
00:52:22,952 --> 00:52:24,947
他不是答应比赛了
He's going to fight.

686
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,755
我们还有一件事要你做
We have one more job for you.

687
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,215
放聪明点?!
Understand?!

688
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,804
Ha ha ha!

689
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:38,631
做得如何?
How did I do?

690
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:41,511
还不赖
Not bad.

691
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,196
时间到
Time.

692
00:52:46,351 --> 00:52:47,655
成功！
Let's do this.

693
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,040
我们伦敦的朋友...
Have our friend in London...

694
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:53,915
在博伊卡身上押了50万美圆
put half a million on Boyka.

695
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:55,527
搏卡?
Boyka?

696
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,156
但是，先生这里80%的钱都是押在美国人身上
But, sir, 80% of the money coming in is on the American.

697
00:53:00,391 --> 00:53:01,925
随你怎么想，先生
Whatever you say, sir.

698
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:03,143
先生们!
Gentlemen!

699
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,606
一场你们期待已久的比赛
The fight you've all been waiting for.

700
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,703
右边是来自美国的选手...
To my right, fighting out of the United States...

701
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:13,866
拥有38次击倒对手的记录...
with a record of 38 victories...

702
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:16,756
未尝败绩...

703
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,445
乔治...
George...

704
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:21,775
莱斯曼・查伯!
Iceman Chambeeeers!

705
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:29,944
左边是...
And to my left...

706
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,521
无需介绍的
a man who needs no introduction.

707
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,282
我们自己的……
Our...own...

708
00:53:36,432 --> 00:53:38,925
无可争议的冠军...
undisputed champion...

709
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,685
尤里...
Uri...

710
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,944
搏卡!
Boyka!

711
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:44,295
Boyka! Boyka!

712
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,235
Boyka! Boyka!

713
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:50,149
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

714
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,920
Boyka! Boyka!

715
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,557
先生们, 比赛规则是...
Gentlemen, remember...

716
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:06,084
不许咬人，不许插眼睛，不许扯头发
no biting, no eye gouging, and no hair pulling.

717
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:08,190
我会用你熟悉的拳击的方式打败你
I'll beat you at your own game.

718
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,112
只用拳头
Fists only.

719
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:12,226
不要在我身上溅太多血
Just don't bleed on me too much.

720
00:54:12,351 --> 00:54:14,307
开始!
Fight!

721
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:29,220
Boyka! Boyka!

722
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:31,550
Uh! Uh! Uh!

723
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:39,990
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

724
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:43,203
- Unh! Unh! - Ah!

725
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,320
Kill him! Come on! Come on! Kill him!

726
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:09,830
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

727
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:11,563
Ow!

728
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:15,699
Mmf! Uh! Uh!

729
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:16,713
Unh!

730
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:18,402
Keep your hands up!

731
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:19,430
Unh!

732
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:20,509
Ugh!

733
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:28,161
Ugh!

734
00:55:29,352 --> 00:55:30,273
Unh!

735
00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:32,826
Ugh!

736
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,711
Oh!

737
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:43,309

00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:50,412
四!
Four!

741
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:52,084
Argh!

742
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:53,112
Hey!

743
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:08,575
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

744
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,939
Boyka! Boyka!

745
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:15,672
Argh!

746
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:16,788
Boyka! Boyka!

747
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:19,559
Yaah! Yaah! Yaah!

748
00:56:19,712 --> 00:56:21,477
- Ugh! - Argh!

749
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:23,240
- Unh! - Yah!

750
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,057
Ow!

751
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:37,451
Yaah! Ugh! Ugh!

752
00:56:39,951 --> 00:56:41,102
Argh!

753
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:01,865
Ugh!

754
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:12,879
毛巾
Towel.

755
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,017
桶
Bucket.

756
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,256
水
Water.

757
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:24,854
快点，斯蒂文
Come on, Stevie!

758
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:33,624
Argh!

759
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,128
Boyka! Boyka!

760
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:53,667
开始!
Fight!

761
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:58,366
- Unh! - Yaah!

762
00:58:03,753 --> 00:58:05,325
Ugh!

763
00:58:05,432 --> 00:58:06,889
Boyka! Boyka!

764
00:58:09,512 --> 00:58:10,433
Unh!

765
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:11,434
Ugh, uh!

766
00:58:11,552 --> 00:58:12,434
Ow!

767
00:58:19,432 --> 00:58:21,388
Ugh!

768
00:58:21,512 --> 00:58:22,433
Uh!

769
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:24,851
Boyka! Boyka!

770
00:58:27,513 --> 00:58:30,083
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

771
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:40,416
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

772
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:51,336
Uh!

773
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:06,505
Ugh!

774
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:15,033
发生什么事了?
What happened?

775
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,162
你被下药了
You were drugged.

776
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:22,984
斯蒂文
Stevie.

777
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,225
那个王八蛋
That motherfucker!

778
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,394
混蛋，你干的好事！
That's your ass, Stevie.

779
00:59:40,512 --> 00:59:42,161
婊子养的!
You son of a bitch!

780
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,197
斯蒂文!
Stevie!

781
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:15,152
哦，不！
Oh...Ugh.

782
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:16,694
你怎么了!
Man!

783
01:00:24,113 --> 01:00:25,877
斯蒂文，天啊！
Goddamn it, Stevie.

784
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:34,300
你个胆小鬼，站起来!
You fuckin' pussy, get up!

785
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:39,261
我是胆小鬼?
I am pussy?

786
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:40,272
哈哈哈!
Ha ha ha!

787
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:42,346
我是胆小鬼? 看看你的脸!
I am pussy? Look at your face!

788
01:00:42,512 --> 01:00:44,238
你才是胆小鬼
You are a fuckin' pussy.

789
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:46,539
那场比赛不公正，你知道的
That fight was bullshit and you know it.

790
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:48,782
你让斯蒂夫下药，所以你赢了
You had Stevie drug me, and that's how you won.

791
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:58,313
我是世界上最好的战士
I am the best fighter in the world.

792
01:00:58,473 --> 01:01:01,350
我不需要你那个毒虫朋友来帮我取胜
I do not need your junkie friend to help me win.

793
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:04,200
你能相信这个SB美国人说的话吗?
Can you believe this fuckin' American?

794
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:07,614
你给你的对手下药，还恬不知耻的说 自己是战士？
You drug your opponents and you call yourself a fighter?

795
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:09,710
我不知道你放什么屁
I do not know what you're talking about.

796
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,674
你给你自己的失败找借口
You make big excuse because you lose!

797
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,710
你应该很庆幸我没有打死你
You should be happy I did not finish you.

798
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,748
两位，冷静一下
You guys can't get enough of each other.

799
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:26,426
回到你的囚室
Move over back to your cell.

800
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:28,777
操！你答应过我，放我出去的
Man, fuck you! You said I'd get out.

801
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:31,872
乔治，我不知道有这么个说法
I know nothing about this arrangement, George,

802
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,179
但我会去了解一下
but surely, I'll look into it.

803
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:36,153
你个王八蛋骗子!
You lying mother--!

804
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:37,232
Ow!

805
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:40,974
你答应过我的，放开我，放开我！
You told me I was gonna get out of here! Get off me! Get off!

806
01:01:41,112 --> 01:01:42,071
把他拖出去!
To the pole!

807
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:50,617
混蛋，我会揍扁你!
Ugh! I'm gonna have your ass, punk!

808
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,250
混蛋，我会揍扁你!
I'm gonna have your ass, punk!

809
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:55,345
混蛋，等我离开这我会揍扁你!还有你!
Wait till I get outta here! Yeah, you, punk! You!

810
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,592
马尔科夫! 操你妈--!
Markov! You motherfuck--!

811
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:01,285
干死你!
You understand what I'm--unh!

812
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:02,354
你他妈的!
You--! Unh!

813
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:03,353
Ow!

814
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:04,890
Ow! Ugh!

815
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:08,266
谣传……
There's a rumor.

816
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,962
美国人喝了被下药的水
The American was given a bottle of water with something in it.

817
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:15,260
我已经警告过你们
I'm told you know something about it.

818
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:19,645
博伊卡...不
Boyka...no.

819
01:02:20,753 --> 01:02:21,673
这可是真的?
Is it true?

820
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:24,861
回复他
Answer him.

821
01:02:24,913 --> 01:02:26,524
但是--
But--

822
01:02:27,713 --> 01:02:29,363
看看这个!
Look at this!

823
01:02:29,473 --> 01:02:30,509
看!
Look!

824
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:32,909
古埃及勇士!
Egyptians!

825
01:02:32,993 --> 01:02:35,716
古希腊壮士! 少林武僧! 拳王阿里!
Greeks! Asians! American boxers!

826
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:38,405
他们把搏击带入科学的殿堂
All made fighting into a science.

827
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:39,859
Ugh!

828
01:02:39,913 --> 01:02:42,329
而我则是下一个殿堂级人物
I am the next stage.

829
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:43,741
你会觉得我需要你...
And you think I need you...

830
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:46,709
去给我的对手下药?
to drug my opponents?

831
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:05,955
把这些垃圾打算干净
Wipe this fuckin' trash off my floor.

832
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:25,439
听我说
Listen.

833
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,352
当你计划释放查伯的时候，我很惊讶
I was wondering when you're planning on releasing him.

834
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,275
我的意思是，自从交易结束后……
I mean, since the deal is done.

835
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:36,502
了解，是你一开始就说过的
Since when did you start...

836
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:38,395
关于查伯的事吗，菲尔?
caring about Mr. Chambers, Phil?

837
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:40,314
哦，与他无关
Well, it's not that.

838
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:43,041
只是，你知道人总是喜欢问问题
It's just, people are starting to ask questions.

839
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:44,612
问题
Questions.

840
01:03:44,714 --> 01:03:46,441
你想要什么，菲尔?
What do you want, Phil?

841
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,561
是这样，我要的是...
Well, given the, uh...

842
01:03:49,673 --> 01:03:53,471
一些意外、一些耽搁需要点补偿啦...
unexpected hassles, the delays...

843
01:03:53,673 --> 01:03:54,977
我还想要25万
I'd like another 250.

844
01:03:55,074 --> 01:03:57,720
好的，再给你25万
Ah, ok. 250 it is.

845
01:03:57,874 --> 01:03:59,216
太好了
Oh! That's great.

846
01:04:00,273 --> 01:04:03,534
24万、25万
240. 250,000.

847
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:04,749
谢谢
Thank you.

848
01:04:08,713 --> 01:04:10,401
是说再见的时候了
I guess this is good-bye, then.

849
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:13,125
一路顺风，“钱迷”先生
Have a nice trip, Mr. Gold.

850
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:14,344
谢了
Thank you.

851
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,609
Oh!

852
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:40,070
想干吗?
Now what?

853
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:45,123
看什么看?
What the hell you looking at?

854
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:24,727
我已经注意到...
It has been brought to my attention...

855
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,712
你们中有人多管闲事...
that a few of you have been interfering...

856
01:07:27,873 --> 01:07:30,443
帮助了正在受罚的查伯
with the punishment of inmate Chambers.

857
01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:32,512
那么，所有与此事有关的人...
All those responsible...

858
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:35,933
自觉举手站出来
identify themselves now by raising their hands.

859
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:50,470
向前一步!
Step forward!

860
01:07:55,435 --> 01:07:56,931
还有谁?
Anyone else?

861
01:08:02,634 --> 01:08:03,669
Ah-ha.

862
01:08:06,474 --> 01:08:07,472
我明白了
I see.

863
01:08:25,713 --> 01:08:27,056
真有趣
Very cute.

864
01:08:27,114 --> 01:08:29,032
你们现在就站在这儿...
So now you'll stand out here...

865
01:08:29,154 --> 01:08:31,571
在寒风中反思吧!
in the fucking cold and think about it!

866
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,597
闭嘴，我告诉过你不要乱来...
Shut up. I told you to do nothing...

867
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:54,095
经我允许你才能做
nothing without asking me first.

868
01:08:55,394 --> 01:08:56,545
闭嘴SB!
Shut the fuck up!

869
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:57,747
如果他有什么意外...
If anything happens to him...

870
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,675
我会剥光你的衣服...
I will strip you naked...

871
01:08:59,795 --> 01:09:01,674
把你的蛋蛋切下来挂在岗哨上
and hang you by the balls from the watchtower.

872
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:02,945
- 噢 - 开门
- Heh. - Open the door.

873
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:04,721
- 卡卡-- - 开门!
- Gaga-- - Now, Vlad!

874
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:11,299
是他们自做主张...
It was never meant you'd be put out...

875
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,696
让你挨冻, 我深表歉意，查伯先生
in the cold like that, Mr. Chambers. I apologize.

876
01:09:14,434 --> 01:09:17,503
我们已经谈好了，我上擂台，然后重获自由
We had a deal. I fight, I go free.

877
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:20,205
不，交易是...
No, the deal was...

878
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:22,656
你赢了你才可以走
you win, you go free.

879
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,918
你知道我被人下药了
I was drugged and you know it.

880
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,642
是的，我知道
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

881
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:33,250
或许下次你再和博伊卡打的时候...
Maybe next time you fight Boyka...

882
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:36,270
你要注意挑个可靠的助手了
you should pick a better cornerman.

883
01:09:36,435 --> 01:09:37,663
操你!
Fuck you!

884
01:09:38,835 --> 01:09:40,945
我不干了
There ain't gonna be a next time.

885
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:44,026
听说我，乔治，其实事情很简单
Listen to me, George. It's very simple.

886
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:51,973
我挣钱，你挣自由，大家可以双赢
I make my money. You make your exit.

887
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:55,891
操你!
Fuck you!

888
01:09:57,714 --> 01:09:58,980
操我?
Fuck me?

889
01:10:00,835 --> 01:10:02,100
随意啦
As you wish.

890
01:10:04,874 --> 01:10:06,754
呆在这好好享受吧...
Enjoy the rest of your stay here...

891
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:07,833
查伯先生
Mr. Chambers.

892
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:14,713
等等
Hold on.

893
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:20,750
这次不许下药
No drugs.

894
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:24,096
无论是我还是博伊卡
Not me, not Boyka.

895
01:10:24,315 --> 01:10:26,424
我和他来场公平的
We fight straight up.

896
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,550
当然
Of course.

897
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:29,904
你要知道，乔治...
Look, George...

898
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:32,680
我也不想让你在这多呆，因为……
keeping you here any longer is a bit of a hassle for me.

899
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:35,289
你太惹人注目，会给我带来不少麻烦
You're, uh, too visible.

900
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:38,273
所以我想要的是再打一场……
All I want is one more fight.

901
01:10:38,394 --> 01:10:39,852
一场解决问题
One.

902
01:10:40,915 --> 01:10:42,142
菲尔在哪?
And Phil?

903
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:43,769
Heh.

904
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:45,372
不必担心菲尔
You don't have to worry about Phil.

905
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,619
他在……钱……恩
Where he is, money...heh...

906
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:51,020
钱不是理由
Money is not a factor.

907
01:10:54,475 --> 01:10:57,544
我还能为你做什么,查伯先生?
Anything else I can do for you, Mr. Chambers?

908
01:11:02,514 --> 01:11:03,703
有的
Yeah.

909
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:07,406
还有一件事要麻烦你
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

910
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:17,114
乔治?
George?

911
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:23,175
你知道这棉袄从哪来的?
You know where this coat come from?

912
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,814
我听说从...
'Cause I hear it come from...

913
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:32,291
一个宣称自己从不帮助别人的混蛋那来的
selfish asshole who never does anything for anyone else.

914
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,932
为什么这样做?
Why?

915
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:36,953
问那么多干吗?
Why you think?

916
01:12:37,075 --> 01:12:38,648
因为这鸟地方太冷了
It's cold as a motherfucker around here.

917
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:42,803
我看过你和博伊卡的第一场比赛
You know, George, I saw first fight.

918
01:12:42,955 --> 01:12:45,487
看出点门道
I saw something in first round.

919
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:47,860
在你的眼中
Something in your eyes.

920
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,604
在你被药迷倒之前
Before you started to look drunk.

921
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:52,864
说说看，克罗特，我看到了什么?
Ok, Crot, what did you see?

922
01:12:53,955 --> 01:12:55,643
你自己说你看到了什么?
What did you see, George?

923
01:12:58,195 --> 01:13:00,075
Tsk.

924
01:13:00,236 --> 01:13:01,693
好吧
OK.

925
01:13:01,796 --> 01:13:04,481
或许我低估了那小子不少
Maybe I underestimated the guy a little bit.

926
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:06,322
但是我现在熟悉了他的套路
But I know how he fights now.

927
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,964
下次我不会再吃亏了
And that same stuff ain't gonna work on me a second time.

928
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:10,340
我要找到制敌之道
I'm gonna figure somethin' out.

929
01:13:10,435 --> 01:13:13,351
是的……你需要有人帮忙
Maybe...you need a little help.

930
01:13:14,677 --> 01:13:15,597
你想帮我，呵呵?
Oh, you gonna help me?

931
01:13:17,755 --> 01:13:20,325
我没打过擂台，乔治
I'm no fighter, George.

932
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:23,199
但我曾经被训练过如何杀人
But I was once trained how to hurt people.

933
01:13:23,356 --> 01:13:25,580
我对格斗略知一二...
I know a thing or two about grappling...

934
01:13:25,716 --> 01:13:27,327
主要是军队教的近距离格斗术
military close combat.

935
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:30,198
可能对你有所帮助
Things you might need in this type of fight.

936
01:13:31,716 --> 01:13:34,593
谢谢你的好意，克罗特，我自己能行
You know what, Crot? Thanks, but I'm OK.

937
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:36,150
一切搏击都由街头打架的实用技术演化而来
Hey, this is all street fighting anyway,

938
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:37,577
而那是我自小就熟悉的
and that's what I'm from.

939
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:39,440
我会打败他，重获自由
I'll just go home on his ass.

940
01:13:39,556 --> 01:13:43,277
还有，博伊卡精通的那些混合搏击术...
Besides, all that kickboxing and grappling stuff...

941
01:13:43,515 --> 01:13:45,011
也不过尔尔
- it's overrated. - Aah!

942
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:47,842
# I move weight like a freight truck, build the muscle #

943
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:49,491
# You can't escape your fate, we ain't scared to tussle #

944
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,283
Aaah!

945
01:13:51,396 --> 01:13:52,431
# I put the pressure on your offense #

946
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:54,126
# You can't advance, I'm a pro #

947
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,459
# Hit the bench, bro, you had your chance #

948
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:59,204
# Do my dance in the end zone, and hone my skill #

949
01:13:59,354 --> 01:14:01,963
# If I don't take it all the way, no one will #

950
01:14:02,115 --> 01:14:04,187
# Get back, you outta line, you outta your mind #

951
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,349
# You outta time, keep searching, brotha #

952
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,125
# How do you find another man #

953
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:10,152
# As efficient as this machine I am? #

954
01:14:10,276 --> 01:14:12,155
用我的长项打败我
Beat me at my own game, huh?

955
01:14:13,476 --> 01:14:16,353
那我也用你的长项打败你
I'm gonna beat you at yours.

956
01:14:16,556 --> 01:14:18,205
Hmm.

957
01:14:18,396 --> 01:14:19,853
听着，乔治
Now listen, George.

958
01:14:19,995 --> 01:14:21,990
人体就像一个锥型...
Man is like pyramid...

959
01:14:22,116 --> 01:14:24,533
不过是倒着的
but upside down.

960
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:28,666
你打断他的腿就能解决他
You cut his legs-- Finish.

961
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:32,366
好的，但我们要怎样做?
OK. How do we...begin?

962
01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:37,488
现在拿我来做实验
Now get on top of me.

963
01:14:37,595 --> 01:14:39,590
不行，你经不起折腾
Sorry, man, I'm just not attracted to you.

964
01:14:39,715 --> 01:14:42,017
太冒险了
Maybe it's the beard.

965
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:45,886
你想训练还是想开玩笑?
You want to train or you want to joke?

966
01:14:46,035 --> 01:14:47,032
# Bring it on #

967
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:48,612
# And I'm ready to eat #

968
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:50,213
# So if you're scared, get outta here #

969
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:51,774
# Before you get beat #

970
01:14:51,876 --> 01:14:52,796
# Bring it on #

971
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:54,412
# Yeah, the heat is on #

972
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,937
# You better get your best to the plate #

973
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:56,955
# Or it be the gong #

974
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,495
# Calculate the magnitude #

975
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:00,321
# Of the situation you're facing #

976
01:15:00,435 --> 01:15:02,314
# No time for pacing, there's no time for wastin' #

977
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:03,356
Unh!
Unh!

978
01:15:03,436 --> 01:15:05,008
这是基本的锁臂术
So this is a basic arm lock.

979
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:08,694
当你挥拳过来，我抓住你的手
When you punch, I grab.

980
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:11,560
紧紧锁住
I wrap arm.

981
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:14,054
用劲，明白吗?
Put pressure, you see?

982
01:15:17,195 --> 01:15:20,187
你可知道那个老头在训练美国人?
You know the old man is training the American?

983
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:23,195
这能吓住我吗?
Is that supposed to scare me?

984
01:15:23,355 --> 01:15:25,963
他想学什么就学什么
He can learn any fucking thing he wants.

985
01:15:26,156 --> 01:15:27,307
Yaah!

986
01:15:28,876 --> 01:15:31,101
反正他甭想活着离开擂台
He's still not going to leave that ring alive.

987
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:37,034
# Bring it on #

988
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,496
# Do you accept the challenge? #

989
01:15:38,554 --> 01:15:39,859
# Bring it on #

990
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:41,375
# I'm-a test your balance #

991
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:42,473
- Argh! - # Bring it on #

992
01:15:42,555 --> 01:15:43,783
# You can't stand the violence #

993
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,218
# Bring it on #

994
01:15:45,316 --> 01:15:46,774
# Put your tail between your legs, leave in silence #

995
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,526
- # Bring it on # - Argh!

996
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:49,556
# You can't handle the heat #

997
01:15:49,636 --> 01:15:50,672
# Bring it on #

998
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:17,334
不好意思--
Hey, man, sorry. Uh--

999
01:16:17,436 --> 01:16:19,085
没事
No, it's OK.

1000
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:29,485
土豆酿的伏特加（一种烈性俄国白酒）
Potato vodka.

1001
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,070
我在卫生间酿的
I make it in my toilet.

1002
01:16:43,436 --> 01:16:45,047
我不能喝，我还有比赛要打
No, man, I'm gonna pass.

1003
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:48,955
当然，你正在训练中
Of course, you are in training.

1004
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:53,628
那张照片是怎么回事?
So what's up with the photograph?

1005
01:17:04,275 --> 01:17:06,116
很漂亮的一个小姑娘，对不?
She's beautiful, isn't she?

1006
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,476
她是谁?
Who is she?

1007
01:17:09,557 --> 01:17:10,938
我的侄女
My niece.

1008
01:17:11,036 --> 01:17:12,800
她现在快19了
She's almost nineteen, now.

1009
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:14,604
她来探望过你吗?
She ever visit you here?

1010
01:17:14,716 --> 01:17:16,174
没
No.

1011
01:17:17,236 --> 01:17:18,808
从没来过
Never.

1012
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:19,875
为什么不来?
Why not?

1013
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:24,214
以为她不知道我在这...
She doesn't know that I'm here...

1014
01:17:24,316 --> 01:17:25,774
根本不知道我在哪
that I exist.

1015
01:17:25,876 --> 01:17:28,753
我也不想她到这来
I never want her to come to this place.

1016
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:34,803
嘿，我只是好奇...
Hey, I was just wondering...

1017
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:36,221
到底发生了什么?
what happened?

1018
01:17:36,316 --> 01:17:37,966
你是怎么被关进来的?
How did you get yourself in this place?

1019
01:17:40,996 --> 01:17:43,260
当我还在苏联军队的时候...
When I was in the army...

1020
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:45,469
我年轻的弟弟...
my younger brother...

1021
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:49,508
在家门口打劫了党委书记
he robbed party headquarters near our house.

1022
01:17:49,716 --> 01:17:52,861
恰好我正休假在家
It happened when I was home on leave.

1023
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:57,513
一天，他过来找我...
He come home one day...

1024
01:17:57,676 --> 01:18:00,055
我感到他有话要说
and I see it in his eyes.

1025
01:18:00,197 --> 01:18:03,649
他说他犯下了大罪
He tells me he just made a big mistake.

1026
01:18:04,797 --> 01:18:06,907
- 你弟弟? - 是的
- Your brother? - Yes.

1027
01:18:07,036 --> 01:18:09,530
那么，为什么他没被关进来?
Well, why the hell isn't he here instead of you?

1028
01:18:09,676 --> 01:18:11,824
维克托很优秀
Victor was brilliant.

1029
01:18:11,996 --> 01:18:13,952
他前程似锦...
He had a future...

1030
01:18:14,117 --> 01:18:16,073
还有一个妻子
And a wife.

1031
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:17,770
一个怀孕的妻子
A pregnant wife.

1032
01:18:19,556 --> 01:18:20,477
而我?
Me?

1033
01:18:22,356 --> 01:18:24,965
只是一个为勃列日涅夫（前苏共主席）卖命的军人
I was only a trained killer for Brezhnev.

1034
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:28,414
所以...
So...

1035
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:30,818
你用你的一生去代他受过
you basically traded your life for his.

1036
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:31,954
不，不
No, no.

1037
01:18:32,037 --> 01:18:34,339
刚开始，我只是为弟弟的抢劫罪而判了四年
I-I was given only four years for the robbery.

1038
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,970
但是在这儿我饱受折磨
But when I got here they tried to drive me crazy.

1039
01:18:37,156 --> 01:18:39,343
忍无可忍，我决定越狱
So finally, I decided to escape.

1040
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:40,972
我逃了两次
I tried twice, actually.

1041
01:18:41,077 --> 01:18:42,611
最后一次，与他们打了起来
The second time there was a fight.

1042
01:18:42,756 --> 01:18:44,175
我杀了一个警卫
A guard got killed.

1043
01:18:45,715 --> 01:18:47,595
但我自己也因为被射中脊椎而瘫痪
I was also shot, paralyzed.

1044
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,402
他们把我一人关禁闭
They put me here in solitary.

1045
01:18:50,556 --> 01:18:52,435
典型的苏联式折磨
Soviet style.

1046
01:18:52,556 --> 01:18:54,857
你知道的，乔治
You see, George?

1047
01:18:54,998 --> 01:18:57,338
我接受了现实
I accepted my reality.

1048
01:18:59,437 --> 01:19:02,122
这是命啊
This is where I belong.

1049
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:05,115
我会在这老死的
And this is where I will die.

1050
01:19:07,277 --> 01:19:09,195
我不明白，克罗特
I don't get it, Crot.

1051
01:19:10,717 --> 01:19:11,868
尼古莱
It's Nikolai.

1052
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:13,374
什么?
Huh?

1053
01:19:13,436 --> 01:19:17,693
我叫尼古莱
My name, it's Nikolai.

1054
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:19,796
我知道你不理解
And I know you don't get it.

1055
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:25,426
# Oh, yeah #

1056
01:19:27,477 --> 01:19:28,397
Argh!

1057
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,625
# It's an illusion #

1058
01:19:31,717 --> 01:19:33,136
Ugh!

1059
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,576
Ow!

1060
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:44,902
Ugh!

1061
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:49,024
- Ow! - Argh!

1062
01:19:50,676 --> 01:19:52,019
Argh!

1063
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,459
把我的腿抬到你肩上
Now on top of shoulder.

1064
01:19:57,677 --> 01:19:59,135
用头压住
Lock with head.

1065
01:20:00,237 --> 01:20:02,347
同时使劲摁住膝盖
Now press on top of knee.

1066
01:20:04,756 --> 01:20:05,753
用力，乔治
Press, George.

1067
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:07,333
再用力
Harder!

1068
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,086
如果我使劲，你的腿就断了
If I press any harder it's gonna break.

1069
01:20:09,197 --> 01:20:11,153
也不错，说不定疼痛会让我恢复知觉呢
Good, maybe I start to feel the leg again.

1070
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:19,892
Boyka.

1071
01:20:22,957 --> 01:20:24,299
Boyka.

1072
01:20:24,397 --> 01:20:25,279
Chambers.

1073
01:20:26,356 --> 01:20:28,006
Chambers.

1074
01:20:31,877 --> 01:20:33,565
Boyka.

1075
01:20:33,677 --> 01:20:34,828
Chambers.

1076
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:36,836
Chambers.

1077
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:48,806
你搞笑吧（短裤上的C.C.C.P是苏联的俄语简称）
You are trippin'.

1078
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:54,563
今晚，我会终结他
Tonight, I settle it forever.

1079
01:20:55,677 --> 01:20:58,132
再次打败他...
I beat this man again...

1080
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:00,734
解决一切问题
then there is no question.

1081
01:21:03,397 --> 01:21:06,313
我将成为最牛的终极斗士
I'm the most complete fighter in the world.

1082
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:08,586
记住, 乔治...
Remember, George...

1083
01:21:08,717 --> 01:21:10,328
比赛结束的时候...
when fight is over...

1084
01:21:10,477 --> 01:21:12,472
不要往回看，迅速离开场地
you need to leave fast. Don't look back.

1085
01:21:14,277 --> 01:21:16,233
听着...
Listen...

1086
01:21:16,358 --> 01:21:17,739
尼古莱，我...
Nikolai, I, uh...

1087
01:21:19,557 --> 01:21:22,280
- 我很高兴-- - 不，无需多说
- I'm glad that-- - No, shut up.

1088
01:21:22,397 --> 01:21:24,162
打完比赛再说
Stay mean for fight.

1089
01:21:29,555 --> 01:21:30,821
你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

1090
01:21:33,996 --> 01:21:35,147
打完再说
I'll see you later.

1091
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:36,426
乔治...
George...

1092
01:21:42,876 --> 01:21:44,257
我也很高兴
I'm glad, too.

1093
01:21:50,117 --> 01:21:53,378
再一次，欢迎...
Once again, please welcome...

1094
01:21:53,557 --> 01:21:58,429
前世界轻量级拳击冠军...
former Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the World...

1095
01:21:58,676 --> 01:21:59,635
乔治...
George...

1096
01:21:59,717 --> 01:22:02,210
莱斯曼・查伯!
Iceman Chambeeers!

1097
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,410
Chambers! Chambers!

接下来，欢迎...
And now, let's welcome...

1099
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:13,435
我们未尝败绩的轻量级搏击冠军...
our own undefeated Heavyweight Champion...

1100
01:22:13,718 --> 01:22:16,326
尤里・博伊卡!
Uri Boykaaaaa!

1101
01:22:17,477 --> 01:22:19,280
Boyka! Boyka!

1105
01:22:37,197 --> 01:22:40,304
Boyka! Boyka!

1106
01:22:43,478 --> 01:22:44,936
开始!
Fight!

1107
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:45,999
Unh!

1108
01:22:47,078 --> 01:22:47,998
- Unh! Ah! - Uh!

1109
01:22:54,998 --> 01:22:56,225
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1110
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:02,709
Argh! Unh!

1111
01:23:04,998 --> 01:23:06,072
Ugh!

1112
01:23:06,157 --> 01:23:07,308
Argh!

1113
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:08,356
Yeah!

1114
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:09,397
Unh!

1115
01:23:10,837 --> 01:23:12,640
- Argh! - Unh!

1116
01:23:12,757 --> 01:23:15,097
Argh!

1117
01:23:16,998 --> 01:23:18,455
- Unh! Ah! - Uh!

1118
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:20,862
Argh!

1119
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:22,645
Ugh!

1120
01:23:23,837 --> 01:23:24,758
Move in!

1121
01:23:24,837 --> 01:23:27,100
Boyka! Boyka!

1122
01:23:27,237 --> 01:23:28,349
- Argh! - Yah!

1123
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,395
Ugh!

1124
01:23:31,558 --> 01:23:33,360
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

1125
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:37,574
Argh!

1126
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:38,596
Ow!

1127
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:46,976
停! 第一回合结束!
Stop! Round's over!

1128
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:53,335
打得不赖，乔治
Not bad for first round, George.

1129
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:55,202
但为何不用你的新招?
But why you don't use your new technique?

1130
01:23:55,318 --> 01:23:56,584
我会在适当时候用的
I'm working on it.

1131
01:23:57,638 --> 01:23:59,901
博伊卡，让他等着
Boyka, make him wait.

1132
01:24:00,038 --> 01:24:02,915
记住，打断他的腿
Remember, take his leg.

1133
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:08,055
Fight!

1134
01:24:11,518 --> 01:24:12,669
Unh!

1135
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:16,555
Argh!

1136
01:24:18,718 --> 01:24:20,482
Unh! Uh!

1137
01:24:23,077 --> 01:24:24,534
Unh! Ugh!

1138
01:24:26,157 --> 01:24:27,347
Arrrgh!

1139
01:24:31,437 --> 01:24:32,358
Ugh! Unh!

1140
01:24:32,437 --> 01:24:34,508
- Argh! - Ow!

1141
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:36,134
Ugh!

1142
01:24:37,758 --> 01:24:40,136
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

1143
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:41,965
Boyka! Boyka!

1144
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,343
Unh!

1145
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:45,954
Ow!

1146
01:24:47,438 --> 01:24:48,972
Arrrgh!

1147
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:53,878
Argh!

1148
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:57,323
Argh!

1149
01:24:57,438 --> 01:24:58,665
Argh!

1150
01:24:58,758 --> 01:24:59,678
搞定他!
Take him!

1151
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,221
Argh!

1152
01:25:17,956 --> 01:25:19,644
听我说，乔治
Listen to me, George.

1153
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:20,869
你必须结果他...
You must finish him...

1154
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:22,645
否则你永远别想...
or you will rot in this stinking hole...

1155
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:24,179
从这个监狱出去
for the rest of your life.

1156
01:25:24,317 --> 01:25:26,351
就像我一样!
Like me!

1157
01:25:27,678 --> 01:25:29,519
- 好好干!
- Go! - Ugh!

1158
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:33,238
我是冠军！
I am the champion.

1159
01:25:34,799 --> 01:25:37,139
他们永远不会让你离开这
They will never let you out of here.

1160
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:40,386
你别无选择，乔治
Do you understand me, George?

1161
01:25:40,558 --> 01:25:41,671
你还等什么?
What are you waiting for?

1162
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:43,062
比赛开始
The bell.

1163
01:25:45,078 --> 01:25:46,344
Argh!

1164
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:50,837
Ow!

1165
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:52,918
Yaaah!

1166
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:56,387
# You can't advance, I'm the storm at night #

1167
01:25:56,598 --> 01:25:59,321
# Bring it on and be ready to fight #

1168
01:25:59,518 --> 01:26:00,899
# Do you accept the challenge? #

1169
01:26:00,997 --> 01:26:02,110
# Bring it on #

1170
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:03,466
# I'm-a test your balance #

1171
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:04,556
# Bring it on #

1172
01:26:04,678 --> 01:26:05,599
# You can't stand the violence #

1173
01:26:05,678 --> 01:26:07,098
- Ow! - # Bring it on #

1174
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:09,041
# So put your tail between your legs and run off in silence #

1175
01:26:09,157 --> 01:26:10,269
# Bring it on #

1176
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:11,623
# You can't handle the heat #

1177
01:26:11,678 --> 01:26:12,752
# Bring it on #

1178
01:26:12,838 --> 01:26:14,641
# This cannibal is hungry for meat #

1179
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:15,986
# Bring it on #

1180
01:26:16,078 --> 01:26:17,881
# And I'm ready to eat, so if you're scared #

1181
01:26:17,998 --> 01:26:19,763
# Get outta here before you get beat #

1182
01:26:19,838 --> 01:26:22,063
# Bring it on #

1183
01:26:24,517 --> 01:26:26,166
Chambers! Chambers!

1184
01:26:26,277 --> 01:26:28,233
# Is to shine more bright in the sunlight #

1185
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:29,508
# I'm the storm at night #

1186
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:32,053
# Bring it on and be ready to fight #

1187
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:33,695
# Do you accept the challenge? #

1188
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:36,294
Unh!

1189
01:26:36,478 --> 01:26:38,051
Argh! Argh!

1190
01:26:38,718 --> 01:26:39,984
Now on top of shoulder.

1191
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:40,998
Argh!

1192
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:41,999
Lock with head.

1193
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:42,999
Argh!

1194
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:44,920
Argh!

1195
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:46,075
Press harder!

1196
01:26:47,398 --> 01:26:48,434
Fuck you!

1197
01:26:49,798 --> 01:26:50,795
Argh!

1198
01:26:52,318 --> 01:26:53,430
Press, George.

1199
01:26:54,879 --> 01:26:55,838
Harder.

1200
01:26:57,158 --> 01:26:58,347
Ugh!

1201
01:26:58,438 --> 01:26:59,550
If I press any harder it's gonna break.

1202
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:02,666
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1203
01:27:03,998 --> 01:27:05,340
Aaaah!

1204
01:27:05,398 --> 01:27:06,894
- Yes! - Aaah!

1205
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:09,531
Aaah!

1206
01:27:09,718 --> 01:27:10,946
Aaaargh!

1207
01:27:11,037 --> 01:27:12,034
Argh!

1208
01:27:12,157 --> 01:27:13,615
Aah!

1209
01:27:19,757 --> 01:27:21,138
别碰我!
Don't touch me!

1210
01:27:25,197 --> 01:27:31,105
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1211
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:33,968
Chambers! Chambers!

1212
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,135
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1213
01:27:39,318 --> 01:27:41,620
Chambers! Chambers!

1214
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:43,446
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1215
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,627
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1216
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:50,733
Chambers! Chambers!

1217
01:27:50,878 --> 01:27:52,950
你发财了
You made a fortune.

1218
01:27:53,078 --> 01:27:57,259
呵呵，时来运转
Yeah. I had a feeling our luck would change.

1219
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,512
是吧?
Hmm?

1220
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:05,771
Chambers! Chambers!

1221
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:25,379
恭喜你，查伯先生
Congratulations, Mr. Chambers.

1222
01:28:27,598 --> 01:28:29,095
我可以离开这了，对吧?
I'm outta here, right?

1223
01:28:31,558 --> 01:28:33,092
是的
Yes, you are.

1224
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:37,270
等等
One moment.

1225
01:28:40,717 --> 01:28:41,676
这是什么?
What's this?

1226
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,354
你应得的
Your cut.

1227
01:28:46,999 --> 01:28:48,763
听着，乔治，我也不想...
Listen, George, it was never my intention...

1228
01:28:48,879 --> 01:28:50,758
让你呆在这受折磨
to make your stay here so unpleasant.

1229
01:28:50,879 --> 01:28:53,679
对不住了 等等
I'm sorry for that. One more moment.

1230
01:28:53,838 --> 01:28:56,524
是否介意我们来一张合影?
Do you mind if we take a photo together, me and you?

1231
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:59,326
不是为我，是为了我侄子
Not for me. My nephew.

1232
01:28:59,478 --> 01:29:01,243
他是你的超级粉丝
Big fan of yours.

1233
01:29:01,358 --> 01:29:03,583
听好了
Let me tell you something.

1234
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:06,286
我永远忘不了你对我做的一切
I'm not gonna forget what you did to me.

1235
01:29:06,438 --> 01:29:08,010
永远
Ever.

1236
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:09,882
我还会来找你的
And I will see you again.

1237
01:29:09,998 --> 01:29:12,069
这就是我想说的
That's my word.

1238
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:13,886
但是现在...
But right now...

1239
01:29:13,998 --> 01:29:15,877
我很高兴能离开这鬼地方
I'd like to get the hell out of here.

1240
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:17,418
当然
Sure.

1241
01:29:28,559 --> 01:29:29,786
等等
One moment.

1242
01:29:33,878 --> 01:29:35,643
这家伙想干吗？
Where the fuck is he going now?

1243
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:42,627
查伯先生，别犯傻
I wouldn't try anything stupid, Mr. Chambers.

1244
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:43,985
门外全是警卫
There are guards outside.

1245
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,955
放松，我只是找你谈谈
Relax, I just need to talk to you about something.

1246
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:48,614
谈什么?
What?

1247
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:55,417
谈一笔交易
I wanna make a deal.

1248
01:30:04,518 --> 01:30:06,359
来告别的?
Came to say good-bye, huh?

1249
01:30:08,877 --> 01:30:09,836
是的
Yeah.

1250
01:30:12,599 --> 01:30:14,095
你打得很好
You did well.

1251
01:30:15,718 --> 01:30:18,595
我搞定一切了
I did all right.

1252
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,640
那件我送你的棉袄还在?
Do you still have that jacket I got you?

1253
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,217
当然
Of course.

1254
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:27,702
我会永远保存他
I will hold on to it forever.

1255
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,795
现在，由你决定...
Well, now that's up to you...

1256
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,146
但你最好马上穿上它
but you better grab it and put it on right now.

1257
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:34,160
为什么?
Why?

1258
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:37,432
因为，尼古莱...
Because, Nikolai...

1259
01:30:37,559 --> 01:30:40,551
有一个18岁的姑娘想见她叔叔
there's an 18-year-old girl who needs to meet her uncle.

1260
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:42,828
而且外面贼冷
And it's cold as a motherfucker out there.

1261
01:31:02,398 --> 01:31:04,777
像是做梦啊
I don't know about this, George.

1262
01:31:07,239 --> 01:31:08,850
一切会好起来的，尼古莱
It's all right, Nikolai.

1263
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:11,222
你有大把时间忘记过去的一切
You got a lot of time to let it sink in now.

1264
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,068
我说，乔治，这是个错误
I'm telling you, George, it's a mistake.

1265
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,735
不是
No, it ain't.

1266
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,224
我不敢面对她
No, I can't.

1267
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,698
你可以
Ah! Yes, you can.

1268
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,952
不敢
No, I can't.

1269
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,341
去吧！好运！ 
- Go. - Oh, George.

1270
01:34:00,799 --> 01:34:02,256
# Oh #

1271
01:34:02,318 --> 01:34:05,080
# I move weight like a freight truck, build the muscle #

1272
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,656
# You can't escape your fate, we ain't scared to tussle #

1273
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:10,373
# I put the pressure on your offense, you can't advance #

1274
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,244
# I'm a pro, hit the bench, bro, you had your chance #

1275
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:16,122
# Do that dance in the end zone and hone my skill #

1276
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,852
# If I don't take it all the way, no one will #

1277
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,494
# Get back, you outta line, you outta your mind #

1278
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,444
# You outta time, keep searching, brotha #

1279
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,440
# How do you find another man #

1280
01:34:25,519 --> 01:34:27,399
# As efficient as this machine I am? #

1281
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,474
# I was born immortal, to be the king of the sport, a portal #

1282
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,750
# Just follow me to the next dimension #

1283
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,450
# You get lifted like these plates I'm benchin' #

1284
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,134
# Go ahead, put your two cents in #

1285
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:38,620
# Your worries are worthless #

1286
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:41,288
# Takes a strong-like mind to understand my purpose #

1287
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,511
# It's to shine more bright than sunlight #

1288
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,982
# I'm the storm at night #

1289
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:46,881
# Bring it on, if you ready to fight #

1290
01:34:46,999 --> 01:34:47,958
# Bring it on #

1291
01:34:48,039 --> 01:34:49,113
# Do you accept the challenge? #

1292
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:50,352
# Bring it on #

1293
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:52,014
# I'm-a test your balance #

1294
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,080
# Bring it on #

1295
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,696
# You can't stand the violence #

1296
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,601
# So put your tail between your legs and leave in silence #

1297
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,680
# Bring it on #

1298
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,140
# You can't handle the heat #

1299
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:01,699
# Bring it on #

1300
01:35:01,799 --> 01:35:03,065
# This cannibal is hungry for meat #

1301
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:04,425
# Bring it on #

1302
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:06,362
# And I'm ready to eat, so if you're scared #

1303
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,437
# Get outta here before you get beat #

1304
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,672
# Bring it on #

1305
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:11,257
# Yeah, the heat is on #

1306
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:14,238
# You better get your best to the plate or it be the gong #

1307
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:16,931
# Calculate the magnitude of the situation you're facing #

1308
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,460
# No time for pacin', there's no time for wastin' #

1309
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,518
# What, you thought it would be a cake walk? #

1310
01:35:21,641 --> 01:35:23,789
# I won't make it easy for you to hate-talk #

1311
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,109
# The trash is big #

1312
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,158
# No, I couldn't let you do it no longer #

1313
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,158
# So I built up mass and my passion is stronger #

1314
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:33,122
# To the point that I need an extra me to hold it #

1315
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,354
# So think that you could try #

1316
01:35:34,441 --> 01:35:36,128
# But ain't no need to fold it #

1317
01:35:36,241 --> 01:35:38,773
# Or bend it any which way, nothing is happening #

1318
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,567
# Just me groovin' here, I'm-a keep on rappin' #

1319
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,481
# And then the competition has to retire, no other chance #

1320
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,172
# Who can do it like I do it? No other voice #

1321
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,967
# If you need some help, call the doctor, get some medicine #

1322
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:51,538
# I'll expire you, bring you back to life #

1323
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:52,828
# And make you dead again #

1324
01:35:52,919 --> 01:35:53,839
# Bring it on #

1325
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,454
# Do you accept the challenge?#

1326
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,672
# Bring it on #

1327
01:35:56,759 --> 01:35:58,217
# I'm-a test your balance #

1328
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,357
# Bring it on #

1329
01:35:59,441 --> 01:36:00,592
# You can't stand the violence #

1330
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:02,140
# Bring it on #

1331
01:36:02,281 --> 01:36:03,777
# So put your tail between your legs and leave in silence #

1332
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,840
# Bring it on #

1333
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,454
# You can't handle the heat #

1334
01:36:06,559 --> 01:36:07,633
# Bring it on #

1335
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,178
# This cannibal is hungry for meat #

1336
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,546
# Bring it on #

1337
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,788
# And I'm ready to eat, so if you're scared #

1338
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:14,493
# Get outta here, before you get beat #

1339
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:15,752
# Bring it on #

1340
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:17,220
# Show me the money, show me the glory #

1341
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,816
# Gimme a second to demonstrate #

1342
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:20,340
# Let me tell you the story #

1343
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,588
# Do me a favor, pretend my name wasn't in the street #

1344
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,947
# If you my homie #

1345
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:25,728
# You won't have no problem holding this heat #
