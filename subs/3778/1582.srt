[? Ric Ocasek: Emotion in Motion]


2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,612
当我还是个小女孩的时候
[woman] When I was a little girl,

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,033
东西分成原价和妈妈价两类
there were real prices and mom prices.

4
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,120
原价是能让你耀眼三周的东西
Real prices got you shiny, sparkly things that lasted three weeks,

5
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,123
而妈妈价是...褐色的东西
and mom prices got you brown things...

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,542
可以用一辈子
...that lasted forever.

7
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,627
你留意到这双鞋可是打5折?
You notice they were 50 percent off?

9
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,721
但当我看着商店的橱窗
[woman] But when I looked into shop windows,

10
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,431
我看到了另一个世界
I saw another world.

11
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,225
一个充满完美商品的梦幻世界
A dreamy world full of perfect things.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,813
一个成年女子能拥有一切的世界
A world where grown-up girls got what they wanted.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,401
她们太美了
[woman] They were beautiful.

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,488
就像仙女和公主一样
Like fairies or princesses.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,410
她们甚至不需要钱 她们有魔法卡
They didn't even need any money, they had magic cards.

16
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,666
我也想有一张
I wanted one.

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,211
小时候我怎么也没想到
Little did I know...

18
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,421
我居然有了12张
...I would end up with 1 2.

让我对一切充满期待
And that kind of put things in perspective.

28
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,952
因为当你遇到一帅哥 他对着你笑
'Cause you know that thing, when you see someone cute and he smiles,

29
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,286
你的心就会像
and your heart kind of goes

30
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,456
暖暖的奶油被涂在热吐司上
like warm butter sliding down hot toast?

31
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,086
嗯 这就是我看到商店的感觉
Well, that's what it's like when I see a store.

32

只是感觉更美妙
Only it's better.

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,139
你知道 男人永远不会像 
[Rebecca] You see, a man will never love you

34
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,225
商店那样子爱你 款待你

要是男人不合适 你也不能7天内退货
If a man doesn't fit, you can't exchange him seven days later

36

把他换成羊绒毛衣
for a gorgeous cashmere sweater.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,276
商店里的味道总是那么清新
And a store always smells good.

38
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,988
商店总能燃起你的欲望
A store can awaken a lust for things

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,990
渴求你不曾知道你需要的东西
you never even knew you needed.

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,453
当你的手指抓住那些闪亮的新手袋...
And when your fingers grasp those shiny, new bags...

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,750
噢 就是这样!噢 就是这样!

冷静 冷静  Bloomingdale's(美国奢侈品连锁店)

嗯 那是裤子
Well, that would be the pants.

48

- 噢 鞋子 - 我...

我提到我要去杂志面试了吗?

我是说 不是说你做不到...
I mean, not that I meant you couldn't do it...

Suze... since I was 14 I wanted to work at Alette magazine.

73

...谁需要围巾?
...who needs a scarf?

80
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,480
在脖子上围条旧牛仔裤 就能保暖了
Wrap some old jeans around your neck, that'll keep you warm.

81
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,941
你妈就会那样
That's what your mother would do.

82
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,110
说得对 她就是这么做的
You're right, she would.

83
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,655
关键是这条围巾
The point about this scarf is that

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,284
它会成为你的象征...
it would become part of a definition of your...

85

你精神的象征
Of your psyche.

86

嗯...
Mmm... [sighs]

90
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,009
它会让我的发型看上去更昂贵
It would make my haircut look more expensive.

91
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,094
它配什么都好看
You'd wear it with everything.

92
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,554
这是一项投资
It would be an investment.

105
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,270
- 你能不能把它放到一边...? - 打折商品无法保留
- Could you put this to one side...? - I can't hold sale items.

106
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,655
- 让一下 紧急情况 - 到后面排队!
- Excuse me. It's an emergency. - [man] Back of the line!

哦 天啊! 你真该也在那儿的 
Oh, my God! You should've been there.

398
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,405
- 他怎么说的? - 嘿!

你的卡达到信用额度极限了 
The, uh, credit limit on your card was reached.

You know, I think I want my husband- to-be to propose to me in Barneys.

最近你是否发现自己沉迷于商场购物?

406
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,810

407
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,896
看到新款商品你是否心跳加速

整齐的叠堆起来的商品?

- 对! 这人说得没错  - 不
- Yes! This guy's good. - No.

410

Did you answer no to these questions and are consequently in denial?

装起来 丢了!
Just box it up and toss it!

416
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,757
简洁有序将是你的新口号

417
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,970
抱歉 你好?

[creaking]


421
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,068
在你上班途中 
[Garrett] On your way to work,

422
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,031
忽视那些橱窗里发来的诱惑之声
ignore the siren call of the store window.

423
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,411
你的新祷告文是 ''我需要这个吗?''

00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,499
这是什么?
What's this?

426
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,002
关于信用卡年利率的一千字稿件?
A thousand words on store card APRs?

427
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,714
看着像是从"傻瓜理财"书上直接抄下来的
Which looks as if it's been copied straight out of Money for Dummies.

428
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,011
不 我要的是你从某个角度 来写信用卡的年利率变化
No, I wanted a thousand words on APRs from an angle.

429
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,221
这不就是一个角度吗?
Is that not an angle?

430
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,515
除非你把''平板陈述''也称之为角度 
Not unless you call "head-on" an angle.

431
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,849
- 不 我没有  - 重写 
- No, I don't. - Try it again.

433
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,283
Rebecca?
- Rebecca? - [yelps]


434
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,456
你刚刚是否拿谷歌搜 ''写年利率的好角度''?
Did you just type "good angles on APRs" into Google?

435
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,336
是的 我拿谷歌搜了 
Yes. I Googled.

436
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,678
- 我被炒了? - 拿起你的外套

437
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,179

441
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,770
经历了空前的发展 
in the communications industry.

442
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,106
总体来说 伙计 你们公司可不是这样的
Overall, pal. Not in your company.

443
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,899
对于我们Comintex公司而言
For us, at Comintex,

444
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,860
利润反映出今年公司所得
profits reflect that this has been a year of acquisitions,

445
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:16,490
对于APL以及荷兰的光线公司Zandak都是一样的
both of APL and of the Dutch fiber-optic company, Zandak.

446
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,285
巧妙的掩盖了发放的2千4百万的奖金
Neatly masking the 24 million in bonuses

447
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,496
- 他们发给自己 -  可不是嘛
- these guys paid themselves. - Hmph. I know.

448
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,918
现在 我们所需做的 Rebecca  在这种情况下就是需要有人
Now, what we have here, Rebecca, is a situation in which someone

449
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,546
去提一些刁难的问题

452
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,429
我可没啥刁钻的问题可问的
I don't have hard-hitting questions.

453
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,723
- 我告诉你几个问题 - 我还是做笔记吧

474
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,903
[gasps, indistinct chattering]

476
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,534

Is that true?

477
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,000
长时间的犹豫 没有给出答案 
A long pause and no answer.

479
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,924
你知道我们为什么要这么做吗?
OK. You know why we did that?

480
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,926
像是种残酷的成年礼?
Some kind of cruel initiation rite?

481
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,678
听听这个
Listen to this.

482
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,348
''对于不同的人而言 证券的意义是不同的
"Security can mean different things to different people.

483
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,559
对于某些人  这就像是穿着合适的鞋子去参加派对
For some, it's going to a party wearing the right shoes.

484
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,187
这让你整晚都有安全感
This might leave you feeling secure for an evening,

485
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,148
却会让你后半生有坡脚的危险''

- 我写的  - 是你写的 
- I wrote that. - You wrote that.

487
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,653
现在 像Comintex这种公司
Now, what firms like Comintex

488
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,031
它们的虚假繁荣是建立在群众无知上的
thrive on is an endemic lack of public understanding.

489
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,866
它们瞒天过海是因为...
They get away with murder because...

490
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,371
Maisie爱喝汽水 投资了200美元
Maisie with a root beer and a $200 investment portfolio,

491
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,414
她能知道什么呢?
what does she know?

492
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,458
她怎么才能知道那些人真正干了什么呢?
What does she actually know about what those guys are doing?

493
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,627
在于别人告诉她情况 
What she's told.

494
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,963
如果她寻找答案的杂志 
And if the magazines she looks to for answers

495
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,756
不能很犀利地提出问题
aren't asking the right questions,

496
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,800
这对于Maisie来说不是一本好杂志
it isn't good for Maisie.

497
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:45,556
我希望你能用一种Maisie 也能明白的方式来阐释真相
I want you to tell the truth in a way that Maisie can understand.

498
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,810

她很犀利 诚恳 
She's sparky, honest.

507
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,936
正是我寻找的类型 
Exactly the type that I was hoping to find.

508
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,399
我想这就是为什么 Edgar West让你雇用我的原因
I assume that's why Edgar West got you to recruit me.

509
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,109
- 该死! - 哦 右曲球啊

I hired you to fix the bottom line of this magazine,

511
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,866
我们知道关键就在于广告的收入 
and we know the key to that is advertising revenue.

512
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,120
现在 你雇用我是要创造和销售一种产品 
Now, you hired me to create a product that sells,

513
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,041
- 而不是单单去卖旧产品 - 如果我倒向Edgar West这边呢
- not to sell a product. - What if I'm with Edgar West.

514
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,461
我们一起打高尔夫 他刚冷淡地跟我说 
We're playing golf, and he just turns to me, sort of nonchalantly, and says,

515
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,255
''嘿 我想知道为什么 Luke Brandon会决定雇用 
"Hey, I'd like to know why Luke Brandon decided to hire

You'll get your turn, just be patient.

524
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:29,076
每一次我都问自己''我需要这个吗?''
[Rebecca] At every point I will ask, "Do I need this?"

525
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,788
这边是新入场通道!
There's another entrance this way!

526
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,248
[all screaming]


527
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,334
[? Jordyn Taylor: Accessory]


528
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,176
哇 我需要这个羊绒手套 
[Rebecca] Well, these cashmere gloves I need

529
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,012
因为这是冬天 而我长有一双手 
as it is winter and I have... hands.

530
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,138
这就是原因
So that's all.

531
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,348
我只卖这个和这个 
I'll buy these and these alone.

532
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,016
天啊 米索尼!
[woman] My gosh, Missoni!

533
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:57,646
现在就离开 坚定且节俭
[Rebecca] Now walk away, strong and frugal.

534
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,607
哦 天啊! 璞琪的靴子
[gasps] Oh, my God! Pucci boots.

535
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,528
降价50%?
Fifty percent off?

536
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,947
我需要买这个吗?
Do I need these?

537
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,367
我需要买这个吗?我需要买这个吗?
[grunting] Do I need these? [gasping] Do I need these?

538
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,202
不
No.

539
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,622
Jeannie , 璞琪的靴子!
Jeannie, Pucci boots!

540
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,375
哦 很抱歉 我先抢到的
Uh, oh, I'm so sorry. I had 'em first.

541
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,543
但你放下来了 
But you put them down.

542
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,629
不 我知道我放下了 但是是我先看到的 所以我要买
No, I know I did, but I saw 'em first, so I'm gonna take 'em.

543
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,172
但是你把它们放下了 
Then you took your hands off them.

544
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,383
把靴子给我 免得有人要受伤!
Give me the boots, and no one gets hurt!

545
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,260
把靴子给我 把靴子给我!
Give me the boots. Give me the boots!

546
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,388
看! Burberry搞特价啦!
Look! There's a sale on Burberry!

547
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,974
这是最老套的骗术了!
[gasps] That's the oldest trick in the book!

548
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,226
- 给我! - 你竟敢...
- Give 'em! - Don't you tell me...

549
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,519
把靴子给我!
Give me the boots!

550

我排了一早上的队就为了这个!
I waited in line all morning for this!

啊! 哈哈!

[? Natasha Bedingfield: Again]


553
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,620
''你的信用卡就像是一件对折的羊绒大衣
[Rebecca] "Your store card is like a 50 percent-off cashmere coat.

初次相见时
The first time you meet,

555
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,123
它发誓会成为你最好的伴侣
it promises to be your best friend.

556
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,962
直到你看仔细  才意识到它其实不是纯羊绒的''
Until you look closely and realize it's not real cashmere."

557
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,047
你被骗了 
You've been ripped off.

558
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,466
对 你听明白了? 你听明白了 
Right. You get it? You get it.

559
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,886
- 我们都听明白了 现在你走吧  - 哈!
- We get it. Now go away. - Ha!

560

''然后 冬天来临 你发现那件大衣

561
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,474
根本不是你的朋友 
isn't actually a friend at all.

562
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,310
你应该看看衣服的细则说明 
You should have read the fine print.

563
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,771
应该仔细看清楚 自己要买的是什么东西''
Should look more closely what you're getting into."

564
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,195
你该放张相片进去 
You should put a picture in that.

565
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,574
这是个礼物 还没来得及放照片进去呢
It's a present. Haven't got 'round to filling it yet.

566
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,537
我妈从打折店里给我买过一个一样的
My mom bought me this exact one from a thrift store.

567
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,831
可能只是你这个价格的一半
Probably paid half what you paid,

568
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,041
不是说他们经常逛打折店
not that they often shop at thrift stores.

569
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,296
- 怎么了? - 写的很好 
- What? - This is good.

570
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,507
- 真的? -

571
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,968
是Rebecca BIoomwood写的?
Is it by Rebecca Bloomwood?

572
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,847
当然! 我的朋友Suze亲眼看见我写的 
Yes! My friend Suze saw me writing it.

573
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,684
我是说 你想用这个名字发表吗?
[chuckles] I mean, is that how you want your name to appear?

I don't want to be too associated with this magazine.

你说什么?
Sorry?

577
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,151
我想这样更好 
Because I just think it would be better

578
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,695
做个无名小卒胜过于名人 
to be slightly more of an everyman.

579
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,282
 就是一点神秘兮兮 
Um, a little more ooh-ooh-ohh.

580
00:33:55,366 --> 00:34:01,371
神秘 而不是... Becky? 
Mysterious, rather than just... Becky? Hmm.

Hmm.

1065
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,144
想不吸引眼球都难
She's... She's hard to ignore.

1066
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,229
- 打扰一下! - 那些菜都装好盘了?

Do you know how short-staffed we are?

1077

1095
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,568
West太太 您肯定会很高兴
Mrs. West, you'll be pleased to hear that the fish from this region

1096
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,528
因为这里的鱼可是很有催情作用的
is a particularly powerful aphrodisiac.

1097
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,071
- 噢 - 嗯 给她两份
- Oh. - Mmm. Give her two.

1098
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,158
Brandon先生  你当服务员也相当专业啊
Oh, Mr. Brandon, you serve as if you've served all your life.

1099
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,493
噢 我的大学学费就是当服务生挣的
Oh, paid my way through college waiting tables.

1100
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,620
而且很巧 这鱼和您上一期的封面女郎
Coincidentally, that fish weighs the same

1101
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,665
- 是一样重的 - 噢!
- as the girl on your last cover. - Ooh!

1102
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,418
噢 AIicia 你是鳟鱼还是三文鱼来着?
Oh, Alicia, remind me. Were you a salmon or a trout?

1103
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,586
她是鳟鱼(与婆娘同音)
You were a trout.

1104
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:53,185
噢...谢谢你刚刚帮我救场
Oh... Thanks for saving me in there.

1105
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,025
为你的相框找到照片了吗?
So have you filled your photo frames yet?

1106
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,820
不 还没有
No. Not yet.

1107
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,908
其实AIicia的照片挺合适的
You could put a picture of Alicia in one.

1108
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,204
除非没有足够的地方
Except there probably wouldn't be room

1109
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,289
放她那双蜘蛛腿般细长的双腿
for her spidery long legs.

1110
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,334
你知道吗 我总觉得
You know, I've always felt that

1111
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:21,713
"蜘蛛腿般细长"是不是太夸张了
spidery long legs were vastly overrated.

1112
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,343
我以为她是你的女朋友
I thought she was your girlfriend.

1113
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,890
不 不是
No. She's not my girlfriend.

1114
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,395
她不是你
She's not you.

1115
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,249
Erica 你打电话给她
Erica, you get her on the phone,

1116
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,668
假装她是你全世界最好的朋友
you pretend she's your best friend in the world.

1117
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,295
然后弄明白她是怎么搞成现在这样子
You find out how she got in this terrible situation.

1118
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,089
她是怎么弄得这么惨?
How did she get so far behind?

1119
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,925
都弄明白了之后 就用那些攻击她
Then you take that information and you use it against her.

1120
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,677
她为什么那么做? 是骄傲?
What are her motivators? Pride?

1121
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,512
诚实? 荣誉? 还是恐惧?
Integrity? Honor? Fear?

1122
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,348
告诉她 她将会一无所有 把她的房子弄来抵押
Tell her she'll lose everything. Slap a lien on her house.

1123
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,183
告诉她我们还会曝光给媒体
Tell her we'll print it in the papers.

1124
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,102
把她逼到悬崖边
Gotta take her to the edge of the cliff.

1125
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,188
让她以为你会把她推下去 然后在最后一秒 把她拉回来
Let her think you're gonna push her over and at the last minute,

1126
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,524
这样就能拿到你想要的了
pull her back and get what you want out of her.

1127
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,610
而且Erica 你的佣金就是这么来的
That, Erica, is how you earn a commission.

1128
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,446

[cell phone] Do not answer this call, it's Derek Smeath.

1185
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:45,787
别接电话 是Derek Smeath
Do not answer this call, it's Derek Smeath.

1186
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,676
别接电话 是Derek Smeath


1187
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,583
别接电话 是Derek Smeath

几乎是我第一个月的薪水
Pretty much my entire first month's salary.

1198
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,369

and you're getting to Alette, and...

1206
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,734
那包里的是什么?
What's in that bag?

1207
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,196
噢 是AIette为我选的衣服
Oh, that's just a dress that Alette chose for me

1208
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,864
为电视节目准备的
for the TV show.

1209
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,116
妈妈 你能去拿个杯形蛋糕吗?
Mom, can you go get a cupcake?

1210
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,078
那个多少钱?
How much did it cost?

1211
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,665
AIette可以享受很低的折扣的
Alette gets an incredible discount.

1212
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,459
你还在参加匿名戒购物会吗?
Still going to Shopaholics Anonymous?

1213
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,668
当然!
Yes!

1214
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,837
- 你说过会去的 - 我知道!
- 'Cause you promised. - I know!

1215
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,975
噢 不好意思 你是去购物狂"聚会"吗?
Oh, excuse me. Are you going to the shopaholics meeting?

1216
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,644
对
Yes.

1217
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,647
你能帮我个忙 暂时把这个放到你的车里吗?
Could you do me a favor and stow these in your trunk?

1218
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,233
拿着Barneys的袋袋到克制消费的团队里
Doesn't look good entering a self-help shopping group

1219
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,525
似乎不太好
carrying a Barneys bag.

1220
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,778
噢! 我懂你的意思
Oh! I know exactly what you mean.

1221
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,197
- 给我吧 - 好的

1222

- Hey, save me a seat, huh? - OK.

1223
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,329
谢谢!
- [Rebecca] Thank you! - [church bells tolling]

1224
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,585
我是Korch女士 我是你们这个团队新的负责人
My name is Ms. Korch. I am your new group leader.

1225
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,296
我的处事方式和上任不太一样
I do things differently.

1226
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,426
BIoomwood小姐?
Ms. Bloomwood?

1227
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,804
你愿意花钱买一些
You're willing to give away your money for things

1228
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,098
你不需要的东西 那么怎么不试试
that you don't need, so why not try giving away

1229
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,933
把你不需要的东西无偿捐出去
the things you don't need for no money.

1230
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,310
但这个是例外: 我真的很需要这个
But here's the thing: I really need those things.

1231
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,104
我会告诉你谁最需要它
I'll show you who really needs them.

1232
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,273
冷静! 冷静 勇敢点 女士
Steady! Steady. Courage, woman.

1233
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,151
- 噢 色彩斑斓 - 这是我的伴娘裙
- Oh, my. Colorful. - This is my bridesmaid's dress.

1234
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:26,030
好了! 有多少人用过这个理由 嗯?
Please! How many of us have used that one before, hmm?

1235
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:32,620
那么 你把这条裙子拿了  然后... 做点好事
OK. I just want you to take these clothes and... do good.

1236
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:38,334
BIoomwood小姐 是不是感觉解脱了? 太棒了!
Ms. Bloomwood, wasn't that liberating? Bravo!

1237
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:41,087
[all cheering]


1238
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:45,300
我要坚定意志 我要看好钱包 我不想购物!
My will is strong. My wallet is closed. I don't want to shop!

1239
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,635
我们回去 真是太高兴了
Back to the basement. I couldn't be prouder.

1240
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,140
关于我捐的那两条裙子 可能有点误会
There's been a mistake. The dresses I gave in?

1241
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,392
- 嗯 我想要回来 - 我知道了 Christy!
- Hmm. I need it back. - I see. Mm-hmm. Christy!

1242
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,893
什么事?
Yes?

1243
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,688
那两条裙子不能卖了
Can't sell those two dresses. There's been a mistake.

1244
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:01,607
- 不能退的 - 我真的需要那些裙子!
- No returns. - I really need these dresses!

1245
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,443
我明天再拿点别的东西来

1246
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,653
- 更好的 - 我们不换

1247
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:10,533
- 好 那我买回来 - 真的? 太好了
- OK, so, um, I'll buy 'em. - You will? Oh, that's great.

1248
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,327
每分钱我们都需要
Oh, really. We need every cent here.

1249
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:15,621
- 多少钱? - 110
- OK. How much? - A hundred and ten.

1250
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,999
什么? 慈善商店还这么贵?
What? How is this a charity store?

1251
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,751
这可是Barneys的正品
This is from Barneys.

1252
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,172
我知道 我的钱不够买两件
I know. OK, I don't have enough for both.

1253
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:27,592
- 这件才20 - 要不你下次再来买这件?
- This one's twenty. - Maybe come back for this one?

1254
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,511
哪件更重要?
Which is more important?

1255
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,639
您有理财烦恼吗? 谁没有呢?
Got money issues? Who hasn't?

1256
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,659
您有理财烦恼吗? 谁没有呢?


1257
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,809
啊! Tarkie... 到她了!
Oh! Tarkie, Tarkie, Tarkie, she's on!

1258
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,187
- 就是这个节目? - 嗯哪
- This is her? - Yeah.

1259
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:42,357
绿围巾女孩 Rebecca Bloomwood
The Girl in the Green Scarf, Rebecca Bloomwood,

1260
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,984
她看起来很象专家 对不 她戴的配饰怎么样?
Oh, she looks like an expert. How are her accessories?

1261
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:50,323
嘿 Janice 她在... 哪个频道?
Hey, Janice. She's in the... Whoa. What channel?

1262
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,867
理财 我一点不在行
...finance. Not my thing.

1263
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,079
- Jane - 什么事?
- Jane. - [Jane] Yeah?

1264
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,540
- Janey Janey! - 怎么了?
- Janey. Janey! - What?

1265
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,377
然后我读了你的专栏 感觉就象...
[woman on TV] ...then I read your columns, and I'm like...

1266
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,878
"天哪 终于开窍了"
"Wow. I get it."

1267
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,922
说到点子上了
Right. Which is exactly the point.

1268
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,383
因为多数财经报道都很...
Because so much financial journalism is really...

1269
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,885
- 都很无趣 - 真是深有同感!
- Is really boring. - I'm with ya on that!

1270
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,055
说得好! 继续 Bex!
Yes! Go, Bex!

1271
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,890
财经报道让人费解
It's not accessible.

1272
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,684
但需要理财的还是普通老百姓
But it's ordinary people that have the most money in savings.

1273
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,479
确实 就象我父母一样的普通人
It is. It's people like my mom and dad.

1274
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,648
啊!
Ow!

1275
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,943
你专栏中写到大衣 和我们说说...
Tell us about the coat. Tell the audience what you wrote

1276
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,821
"羊绒大衣及其价值"的寓意
about the cashmere coat and worth.

1277
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,782
- 还是你来说吧 - 不 不
- Well, that's you. - No, no.

1278
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,243
- 是他给我的灵感 - 哦...
- He inspired me. - Aw...

1279
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,995
价格和价值是有区别的
[Rebecca] It's the difference between cost and worth.

1280
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,623
从本质上来说 价值看不见摸不着
Essentially, something you can't see, can't touch,

1281
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,918
实际上 美国最无价的商品
but it's actually the most valuable commodity in America.

1282
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:47,130
- 是... - 信任
- And that's... - Trust.

1283
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,593
信任 我超爱你们
Trust. I'm loving you guys.

1284
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,263
谁会想到债务也能这么有趣呢 
Who knew that debt could be so much fun, huh?

1285
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,348
我们还有一些时间
But we just have a little bit more time.

1286
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,350
留给观众提问
We wanna get questions from the audience.

1287
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,144
在座有没有人
Is there anybody out there

1288
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,229
有理财烦恼 想与...
with any financial issues that would like...

1289
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,480
好 就你吧 先生

1290
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:08,025
我有些债务麻烦
Well... I'm having trouble with debt.

1291
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,279
好 房贷 车贷?
OK. Mortgage debt, car debt?

1292
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,912
- BIoomwood小姐的债务 - BIoomwood小姐的债务
- Ms. Bloomwood's debt. - [laughs] Ms. Bloomwood's debt.

1293
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,414
没错
That's right.

1294
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,377
我来自"城市收债代理机构"
I'm from the All City Debt Collection Agency.

1295
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,047
- 我叫Derek Smeath - 好
- My name is Derek Smeath. - [woman] Alrighty.

1296
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,092
上帝啊 这个人
Now, look, for God's sake, can I just say that this man

1297
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,970
对Rebecca纠缠一年之久
has been stalking Rebecca for the past year.

1298
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,472
没错
Yes, I have.

1299
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,766
就是想结清她的信用卡所欠款项
To recover unrepaid credit on a store card totaling

1300
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,811
9412.25美元
$9,412 and a quarter.

1301
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,314
这是真的?
- [audience gasps] - Is this for real?

1302
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:49,817
不好意思 他是她的前男友
No, I'm sorry, because he is her ex-boyfriend.

1303
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,738
真的?
Really?

1304
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,909
难怪她没把他带回来过
No wonder she didn't bring him home.

1305
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,997
真强啊 
That's good. I tell ya,

1306
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,416
看看我 你们相信我是她前男友吗?
the more you look at me, the funnier that gets.

1307
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:12,006
好吧 我的前女友
OK, well, uh, my ex-girlfriend

1308
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,883
告诉我她今天不能见我
told me she couldn't meet me today

1309
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,552
因为她在芬兰染上了传染病
because I might risk contamination with an infection

1310
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:20,515
- 可能会传染给我 - 哦!
- she picked up in Finland. - Oh!

1311
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,016
你知道她有芬兰血统吗?
[Derek] Know she was part Finnish?

1312
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,186
好 我们时间不多了
- [audience laughs] - OK, we're on limited time.

1313
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,604

1315
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,733

这些借口哪个是真的?
Which of these excuses is true?

1325

1326
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,765
请真实的Rebecca BIoomwood起立
Will the real Rebecca Bloomwood please stand up?

1327
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,774

Well, at least I don't have to worry about you being stalked!

1328
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,234
Luke 你不明白!
Luke, you don't understand!

1329
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,819
没错 我是不明白!
No, you're right, I don't!

1330
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,029
发挥一下职业精神 Rebecca
So do what I hired you to do, Rebecca,

1331
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,239
澄清事实
and make the truth clear

1332
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,866
给完全不明白的我一个交待
to somebody who absolutely doesn't understand.

1333
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,868
我喜欢购物
I shop.

1334
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,495
你撒谎就因为你喜欢购物
Oh, so you lie because you shop.

1335
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,790
好 你为什么喜欢购物?
- [stammering] - OK, OK. Why do you shop?

1336
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:29,750
- 我... - 说啊!
- Well, I... - Come on, come on!

1337
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,502
你要给我点时间...
Well, you're not giving me time...

1338
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,087
给你时间作什么? 让你再胡编乱造?
For what? To make something up?

1339
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,673
你就不能说一次真话?
Just, for once in your life, tell me the truth.

1340
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:43,139
因为购物时 世界变得更美好
Because when I shop, the world gets better.

1341
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,057
世界确实变得更美好了
The world is better.

1342
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:51,606
但后来又不美好了 我就再去购物
And then it's not anymore. And I need to do it again.

1343
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,696
你的诚实呢?
Well, what about honesty?

1344
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,992
你的信用呢?
What about credibility?

1345
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,620
我本想告诉你的
Well, I wanted to tell you,

1346
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:09,040
但我接受这份工作只是为了要进Alette
but I only took the job to get to Alette.

1347
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,638
希望你愿望成真
Well, I wish you all the best with that.

1348
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,139
Luke 真是对不起
Luke, I'm so sorry.

1349
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,477
不用 我了解 整件事就是一个谎言
No, no. I understand. The whole thing was a lie.

1350
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,691
现在终于明白了
That absolutely makes sense.

1351
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:54,585
* 你伤了我的心 你将它撕碎 *
[woman] ? You're breaking my heart You're tearing it apart

1352
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,504
* 呜 呜 *

1353
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,092
* 现在我已变得疯狂 *

1354
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,513
* 你把我的眼镜也打碎 好吗? *
? And you're breaking my glasses, too, OK?

1355
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,432
她穿的是我的伴娘服?
Is she wearing my bridesmaid's dress?

1356
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,477
Suze!
- [door slams] - Suze!


1357
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:14,980
我可以解释的!
That, I can absolutely explain!

1358
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,818
好! 解释吧
OK! Explain.

1359
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:20,945
Oh...


1360
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,449
解释啊!
Explain!

1361
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,460
Suze!
Suze!


1362
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,382
West先生 我很喜欢Luke Brandon
Mr. West. I like Luke Brandon.

1363
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:45,720
但依最近的态势看来 Brandon先生
But it would seem on recent evidence, Mr. Brandon

1364
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,973
已经失去了其客观判断力
allowed his objectivity to lapse.

1365
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,060
Brandon先生?
Mr. Brandon?

1366
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,356
[sighs]


1367
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:00,067
Rebecca BIoomwood...
Rebecca Bloomwood...


1368
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:11,078
Rebecca BIoomwood是我见过的 最有生气的
Rebecca Bloomwood was the most vivacious,

1369
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:15,875
最有趣最能鼓舞人心的女子
funny, inspiring woman I have ever met.

1370
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:21,881
现在我们知道 她的生活是个谎言
And she lived a lie. We know that now.

1371
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,928
但她在专栏中写的都是事实
But what she wrote in her columns was the truth.

1372
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,264
她有见解
She had a voice.

1373
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,768
她能让那些不懂财经的人读懂
She spoke to people who never believed

1374
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,228
而他们一旦读懂
that they could understand, and who loved it when

1375
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,856
就爱上她的文章 我也超爱
they found that they could. And I loved it.

1376
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,617
Rebecca BIoomwood让我失望
Rebecca Bloomwood let me down.

1377
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:55,206
但绿围巾女孩却从没有
But the Girl in the Green Scarf never did.

1378
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,048
[horn plays up-tempo tune]


1379
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:10,221
至于你 如果Luke Brandon及其态度
As for you, if Luke Brandon and his attitude

1380
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,640
不能胜任Dantay-West的工作
aren't fitting in at Dantay-West,

1381
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,226
就只有一种解决办法
there's really only ever one solution.

1382
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,775
或许我们应该开办一家全新的杂志
Maybe we should start a new magazine.

1383
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:28,656
一家完全发表作家见解的杂志
A magazine driven purely by the voices of its writers.

1384
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:33,786
隶属于公司 但另立门户 明白么?
A part of the company, but outside the gates, you know?

1385
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,413
听起来...不错
Yeah, sounds... Sounds great.

1386
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,959
让人意外 但 你知道...
Yeah. It's unexpected, but, you know.

1387
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:43,754
你有干劲 Brandon先生 也有远见
You have drive, Mr. Brandon, and vision.

1388
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,840
我很赞赏
I've been impressed.

1389
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,342
创办新刊会很艰辛
Oh, it'll be tough going to start,

1390
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:52,179
但Cy和我创办公司也是这么过来的
but that's the way Cy and I built this company.

1391
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:57,852
我们把公司名挂在门上的那一天 Dantay-West
On the day that we put that sign up over the door, Dantay-West.

1392
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:01,230
就知道这一决定是正确的
That was when we knew that we'd made the right decision.

1393
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,984
为新杂志干杯
So here's to our new venture.

1394
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:11,490
呃 我...
Well, I, um. I can't...

1395
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,910
真不敢相信 我要杀了她
I cannot believe it. I'm going to kill her.

1396
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:20,541
West先生 当您把公司名挂在门上时
Mr. West, when you put that sign above the door,

1397
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,878
您是想让它享誉全球吧?
you wanted to make your name in the world, didn't you?

1398
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:28,382
- 这是我最大的愿望 - 我也是
- Oh, more than anything else. - So do I.

1399
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,014
亲爱的 她会没事的
[Jane] Sweetie, she's gonna be fine.

1400
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,349
你去和她谈时 不要...
And when you talk to her, don't...

1401
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:41,896
亲爱的 实话实说 你觉得...
Sweetie, honestly, do you think it's too...

1402
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,106
"培养有经济头脑的孩子"
"Raising Financially Fit Kids."

1403
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,816
你觉得现在给她这本书是不是太晚了?
Do you think it's too late for this?

1404
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,485
亡羊补牢 犹为未晚  去书展难道你不高兴吗?
Never too late. Aren't you glad we went to that book fair?

1405
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,783
很美 是不是?
Pretty amazing, ain't it?

1406
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,244
所以你妈和我就爱来这儿
That's why your mother and I love coming out here.

1407
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,624
总能让我们想起在芬兰渡过的童年
Reminds us of our childhood in Finland.

1408
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:06,211
你妈和我觉得
Your mom and I think,

1409
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:10,341
美国经济欠债几十亿
if the American economy can be billions in debt

1410
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,468
都能挺过难关 你也能
and still survive, so can you.

1411
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:19,558
- 那车大约值13... - 不行 爸爸
- The RV's worth about 1 3... - No. Dad.

1412
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:20,643
我们想这么做
We want to.

1413
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,770
如果你把车卖了 我就杀了你
I will kill you if you sell it.

1414
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:26,941
车诠释了你 你的全部
It completely defines you. Completely.

1415
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:34,114
没有东西能诠释我 除了你和你妈 
Nothing defines me, except you and your mother.

1416
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,834
[? Greg Laswell: Girls Just Wanna Have Fun]

01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:43,600
她真是这样? 而且还达到目的了
So she really did it? And it all worked.

1419
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,145
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1420
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:48,188
你是说你不知道
You mean you don't know.

1421
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,858
真是好哇

to give her the one thing that she wants most in all the world.

1424

我是没办法摆脱她了

No, no. They're not from Indiana, they're from England.

1429
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,969
不是 爸爸 她是说查尔斯和黛安娜
No, Dad, she said Charles and Diana.

1430
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,556
我去找West先生 让他宽大处理
Yes. Well, I went to see Mr. West to petition for clemency...

1431
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,226
- 他同意了 - Luke Brandon还好吗?
- ...which he gave. - And is Luke Brandon OK?

01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:31,356
很不幸  Brandon先生不再为Dantay-West效力了
Unfortunately, Monsieur Brandon is no longer with Dantay-West.

1433
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,234
他会没事的
But he'll land on his feet.

1434
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,822
怎么说他也是Sherman家族的人  Rebecca...
He's a Sherman, after all. Rebecca...

1435
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:42,951
你可能还不知道 你在电视上的露面
You may not know this, but your appearance

1436
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,872
引发了许...多女孩的同感
on that TV show has struck a nerve with many, many girls.

1437
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,333
她们同情并理解你
They identify with you.

1441
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,099
我知道所有的打折商品

1442
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,391
没错 她知道的

实际上 都是我告诉她的
In fact, she got that from me.

1444

- 来点蛋糕? - 好

1446
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,530
别 别!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1447
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,698
要小 小 非常小
Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.

1448
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,326
- 好 - 再小一点! 再小一点!

谢谢
Thank you.

1451
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,219
你的专栏要有自己的见解
You will make your column personal.

1452
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:43,428
就写你自己的衣柜
Mm-hmm.

1453
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,597
You'll take pieces from your own wardrobe,


1454
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:47,808
就象这个 这很漂亮
like this for example. This is very pretty.

1455
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:49,768
- 很入时 - 当季流行款 我相信
- They're swell. - This season, I believe.

1456
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:52,771
这鞋是Louboutins牌子
Um, well, they're Louboutins,

1457
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,732
不能算是实惠时尚
so, I mean, well, they're not affordable fashion.

1458
01:25:55,817 --> 01:26:01,238
别担心 我们会把价格印得小小的
Fear not. Chez Alette, we print the prices very small.

1459
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,201
毕竟 要信用卡是作什么用的呢?
And after all, what are credit cards for, huh?

1460
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,911
你一定深谙其道
You must know that.

1461
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,749
是啊
Yeah, wow.

1462
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:19,256
我...深知信用卡
Yeah, no, I, um... I know all about credit cards.

1463
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,342
最后通告 催债人
And final notices and debt collectors.

1464
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:26,054
时尚杂志应该把这个也印上 对不?
Um, they should print that in the fashion magazines. Right?

1465
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,764
Mm-hmm.


1466
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,851
Rebecca 你有道德良知
Rebecca, you have a moral conscience.

1467
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:33,312
但如果你真想为我的杂志效力...
But if you want to work for my magazine...

1468
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:36,064
不 不 我非常想为Alette工作
No, no, I really... I wanna work at Alette.

1469
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,109
怎么了 宝贝?
What's the matter, baby?

1470
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:43,447
只不过 我的内心深处有种讨厌的感觉
I just, I have that really annoying feeling in the pit of my stomach.

1471
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,199
你们知道这种感觉吗?
You know that feeling when...?

1472
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,326
我知道 我知道 我脑中也会有这种感觉
Yes. I get it... I get it in the back of my head.

1473
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,369
就是... 你知道不?
[Rebecca] Yeah, when... You know what I mean?

1474
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:52,539
你想做某事 但又觉着你不该那么做?
You wanna do something, but you sort of feel like you shouldn't?

1475
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,791
- 就是那样! - 我懂了 就是心病
- That's it! - I get heartburn.

1476
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:04,551
我犯过很多错误
I just... I have made so many mistakes,

1477
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:10,390
我觉得 接受这份工作会是又一个错误
and I feel like taking this job would be another one.

1478
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:13,018
在你做决定之前 你应该知道
Before you make your decision, you should know this.

1479
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:17,564
当我离开这里 机会也会随我而去
When I leave this house, the opportunity leave with me.

1480
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,152
那你还是带着你的机会走吧
Well, then you should both go.

1481
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:28,533
这就是生活
C'est la vie.

1482
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,246
你可是Sherman家族的
- [phone rings] - [man] You're a Sherman.

1483
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,791
你就不能自己筹资吗?
Can't you finance this yourself?

1484
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,169
我想知道 你是否会支持我
I'm asking if you will back me.

1485
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:45,342
我想知道 你是否觉得我有投资价值
I'm asking if I am a good investment.

1486
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,140
好 伙计们 就这样 你们要把它看作
All right, people, this is it. I want you to think of it

1487
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:55,227
是伏在你身上的有害小猴子
as a toxic little monkey on your back.

1488
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,605
快动手 疯子! 谁掉眼泪
Do it, Freak! But anybody who cries

1489
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,984
就剪两张卡
- will have to cut two cards. - [door slams open]

我在全国电视节目上自毁了前程
I destroyed my career on national television.

1494
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:14,788
我欺骗了深爱的男人  伤害了最好的朋友
I lied to the man I love. I hurt my best friend.

1495
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:18,625
我凭空捏造出一个跟踪狂  我根本不会说芬兰语
I invented a stalker, and I don't even speak Finnish.

1496
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:22,462
但我决心改过 我需要你们的帮助
But I have a plan, and I need your help.
