1
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,360
- Okay. I'll go first. Um-
- Okay.

2
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,100
Let me say, uh, we don't
really need to be here.

3
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,110
See, we've been married
five years.

4
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,010
- Six.
- Five, six years.

5
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,570
And this is like
a checkup for us.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,780
Um, a chance
to poke around the engine...

7
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,080
maybe change the oil,
replace a seal or two.

8
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,160
Yeah.

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,990
Very well then. Let's pop the hood.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,430
On a scale of one to 10,
how happy are you as a couple?

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,830
- Eight.
- Wait.

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,270
Ten being perfectly happy
and one being totally miserable?

13
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,500
- Or-
- Just respond instinctively.

14
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,240
Okay.

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,810
- Ready?
- Ready.

16
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,380
- Eight.
- Eight.

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,250
How often do you have sex?

18
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,220
I don't understand
the question.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Yeah, I'm lost.
Is this a one-to-10 thing?

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,420
Like, is one very little,
or is one nothing?

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,190
Because, you know,
tech-technically speaking...

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,170
the zero
would be nothing.

23
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,240
That's right. And if we don't know
what one is-What's 10?

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,370
- Yeah, 'cause 10- Oh, God.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,000
- Constant. Uh-
- Unrelenting.

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,310
- N-Not stopping for, like- I mean, just-
- Nothing to eat.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,450
Like Sting.

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,580
Well, look at Sting's day job. Who else
has 60 hours a week to put in the sack?

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,860
It's not a one-to-10 scenario. It's a
basic question. How often do you have sex?

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,870
How about this week?

31
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,880
- Including the weekend?
- Sure.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,780
Describe
how you first met.

33
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,220
Uh, it was-
It was in Colombia.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,220
Bogotá.

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,990
- Five years ago.
- Six.

36
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,060
Right.
Five or six years ago.

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,720
Hey. ¿Qué pasa?

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,060
Hmm?

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,310
No.

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,080
No, no, no, no.
Está bien.

41
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,850
She's with me.
Está bien.

42
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm Jane.

43
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,830
John.

44
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,070
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet ya.

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,510
- To dodging bullets.
- To dodging bullets.

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,790
So, it speaks.

47
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,190
- But does it dance?

48
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,260
- Hiya, stranger.

49
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,270
Hiya back.

50
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,500
I think room service fled.
I did what I could.

51
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,910
Thank you.

52
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,710
Mm! Oh, that's good.

53
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,880
- I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.

54
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,820
Hey! Step right up!

55
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
try your lu-

56
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,090
How about you, little lady?
Wanna try your luck?

57
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,100
Win a prize.

58
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,100
Hmm. Yeah.
All right.

59
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,570
- Two.
- We got two over here.

60
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,700
- Do you know how to hold it?
- Step right up! Five shots. Five dollars.

61
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

62
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,710
- You gotta aim.
- [Laughing] I am.

63
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,780
Don't laugh.
I'll kill you.

64
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,620
- You didn't blink.

65
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,130
Would you like to win
a stuffed animal for your little girl?

66
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,860
- Come on.
- Ooh.

67
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,260
Everybody's a winner.

68
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,270
Do we still
get somethin'?

69
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,200
Beginner's luck.

70
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,200
- I wanna go again.
- We're goin' again.

71
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,710
Everybody's a winner.
Win a prize. Win a prize.

72
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,880
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

73
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,890
Beginner's luck.

74
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,560
Stop. Stop. You've only known
the girl for six weeks.

75
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,390
I'm in love.
She's smart, sexy.

76
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,230
She's uninhibited,
spontaneous, complicated.

77
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,830
She's the sweetest thing
I've ever seen!

78
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,880
I knew Gladys for two and a half years
before I asked her to marry me.

79
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,240
You have to have a foundation of friendship,
brother. The other stuff fades.

80
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,150
Hi.

81
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,150
So, you don't think
this is all happening a little fast?

82
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,130
You know me. I never do anything
without thinking it through.

83
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,130
What does he do?

84
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,670
He's in construction.
He's a big-time contractor.

85
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,860
A server goes down
on Wall Street...

86
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,130
she's there anytime,
day or night.

87
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,440
She's like Batman
for computers.

88
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,540
He's gone as much as I am,
so... it's perfect.

89
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,350
I give the whole thing
six months tops.

90
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,620
Eddie, I asked her
to marry me.

91
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,860
- What?

92
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,120
- I'm getting married.
- What? I can't hear ya.

93
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,660
- I'm getting married.
- I can't hear him.

94
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,790
Can you stop hittin' him?
I think he said somethin' crazy.

95
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,550
I'm getting married!

96
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm getting married!

97
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,910
- Gotta get these filters changed.
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,380
What did you think
of Dr. Wexler?

99
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,970
- His questions were a bit wishy-washy.
- Yeah. Sorry.

100
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,020
- Not the most insightful.
- No.

101
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,350
His office
is clear across town.

102
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,860
You know that 4:00 means we hit rush hour.
I'm not crazy about that.

103
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,420
- So, that's settled then, yeah?
- Okay.

104
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,890
- Okay.

105
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,480
- Dinner's at 7:00.
- Yep. I'll be there- here.

106
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,280
- Hi, babe.
- Perfect timing.

107
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,920
- It's pissin' rain out there.

108
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,760
Here's your butter.
I bring you butter.

109
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,070
- How was work?
- Eh, so-so.

110
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

111
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, I stopped off
for a drink with Eddie.

112
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,810
- This is salted.
- What?

113
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,880
It's salted.

114
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,310
Is there any other kind?

115
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,650
Unsalted.

116
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,020
Like I asked for.

117
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,460
It's fine. I'll make it work.

118
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,620
- Okay.
- Oh, I got new curtains.

119
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,630
Well?
What do you think?

120
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,140
- Huh.
- There was a struggle over the material.

121
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,210
This little tea sandwich
of a man-

122
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,510
- He got his hands on them first, but I won.
- Of course you did.

123
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,280
They're a bit green. I think we're
gonna have to reupholster the sofas...

124
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,250
and definitely get a new rug,
maybe a Persian.

125
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,080
Or we can keep the old ones.
Then we don't have to change a thing.

126
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,260
We talked about this.
You remember?

127
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,730
I remember. I remember
'cause we said we'd wait.

128
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,670
If you don't like 'em,
we can take 'em back.

129
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,810
Okay. I don't like 'em.

130
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,980
You'll get used to 'em.

131
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,910
- I like 'em.
- Yeah.

132
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,280
Huh. Zero percent A.P.R.
Till March.

133
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,510
So, part two. Here we are.

134
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,790
Only this time, you came back alone.
Why did you come back?

135
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm not sure really.

136
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,500
Let me clarify.
I love my wife.

137
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,090
Um, I want her
to be happy.

138
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,070
Uh, I want
good things for her.

139
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,940
But there are times...

140
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,480
[John Sighs]

141
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,690
- Honey, would you just-
- Five more minutes.

142
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,770
So what's the problem?

143
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,200
There's this huge space
between us...

144
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,710
and it just keeps filling up with everything
that we don't say to each other.

145
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,510
- What is that called?
- Marriage.

146
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,220
What don't you say
to each other?

147
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,390
Uh- Hmm.

148
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,860
The GMC Yukon
got three stars.

149
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,830
This looks nice.
Did you do something new?

150
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,690
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

151
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
I added peas.

152
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,770
Yeah, peas.

153
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,740
Yeah, it's the green.

154
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,710
Sweetheart,
will you pass the salt?

155
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,510
It's in the middle
of the table.

156
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,740
Oh, is that the middle
of the table?

157
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,580
Yeah. It's between
you and me.

158
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,690
Okay.

159
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,800
- How honest are you with him?
- Pretty honest.

160
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,360
I mean, it's not like
I lie to him... or anything.

161
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,810
We just, uh,
Have little secrets.

162
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,170
Everybody has secrets, you know.

163
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,200
Shit. Sorry, hon.

164
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,210
- I'll get it.
- No, I got it. I got it. Don't move.

165
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,540
- Oh, that's me.

166
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,830
- [Jane] Jesus!

167
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,670
- Honey, you scared me.
- I'm sorry, hon.

168
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,570
I was lookin' for the, uh-
You goin' out?

169
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,580
Yeah. Some clown crashed a server
in a law firm downtown...

170
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,240
and ended the world
as they know it, so, yes.

171
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,250
Mmm.

172
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,920
We promised the Colemans.

173
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,930
- I know.
- Okay.

174
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,260
I'll be there.
In and out.

175
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,330
Just a quickie.

176
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,120
It probably feels like
you're the only people going through this.

177
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,640
But I'll tell you something.
There are millions of couples...

178
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,730
that are experiencing
the same problems.

179
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,540
Uh-huh.

180
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,950
- We got a plane in an hour.
- All right.

181
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,950
Quotes. 800.

182
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,020
Prodded about possible insider trading...

183
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,290
she remarked
on national television...

184
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,420
"I want to focus
on my salad. "

185
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,430
- Brian.
- Martha Stewart.

186
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,360
- Forty.
-

187
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,990
I'll match your-
What the hell? What's this shite?

188
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,860
Sorry. Where's the can
around here?

189
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,410
- For Chrissakes.
- Take a-

190
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,100
- Hey, you guys playin' poker?
- Private game. Piss off.

191
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,150
Hey, could I sit in?
You think I can sit in?

192
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,240
What part of "piss off"
do you not understand?

193
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,380
Guys. Hey, whoa, whoa.
Be a little friendly.

194
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,480
- I got the cash. I got the ca-
- [Muttering]

195
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,150
Dude, I'm just showing you
my bankroll, man.

196
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,730
I got the money.

197
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,990
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

198
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,500
Poker-
Don't even know her.

199
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,570
So if you want me
to sit in, I'll sit in.

200
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,070
And I'll play some cards with youse.
If you don't, I won't.

201
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,110
I just-
Fine with me, I'll go.

202
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,840
- Jesus.
- Here's an empty chair.
I could sit right here.

203
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,250
That is Lucky's chair.

204
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,750
Wh-Where's Lucky?
I don't see Lucky.

205
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,050
- Lucky's not back yet.
- Then I'll sit here.

206
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,350
Unless...
I'm too hot for ya.

207
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,030
- Solid silver.
- Ooh. Raise the socks.

208
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,800
- Ooh.
- "To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."

209
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,100
- In the pot. Put it in the pot.

210
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,140
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, he's pulled something.

211
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,510
- He's pulled something.
- You're in trouble now.

212
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,610
- Sixty dollars, eh?
- In!

213
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,030
Let's play some poker!

214
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,530
- Drat!

215
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,890
You've got 14
different tells.

216
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,990
- You are bleeding William Tell.

217
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,640
- What the hell is this?

218
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,400
- Sorry, Lucky.
- Looks like you're done, pal.

219
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,410
- Thanks for the memories.
- Oh, you Lucky?

220
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,210
- Yeah.
- No kiddin'.

221
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,940
What is it, kid?
You lookin' for a job or somethin'?

222
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,020
- You are the job.

223
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,530
Pair of threes.

224
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,130
- Have you been a bad boy?
- Yes.

225
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,800
- Mm-hmm?

226
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,180
You know what happens
to bad boys?

227
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,710
- They get punished.
- Oh, yeah. Punish me.

228
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,660
Have you been selling
big guns to bad people?

229
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,460
Huh?

230
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,770
Mr. Racin.

231
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,140
Mr. Racin. You okay?

232
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,380
Oh, Colemans.

233
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,720
He's down!

234
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,690
On the sofa!

235
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
- Hey!
- Taxi.

236
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,180
- Everything okay at work?
- Yeah. Here.

237
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,310
- Yeah?
- And you? How was the game?

238
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,610
- The game was good.
- Good.

239
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,690
Nets in overtime.

240
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,090
- You been drinking?
- That's right, miss.

241
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,750
Welcome, neighbors!

242
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,850
- Hey. Hi, Susan.
- Good to see you, John.

243
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,860
- Hi.
- There you go.

244
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,060
- Oh, this is wonderful.
- Thank you.

245
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,190
Oh, I love that.

246
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,830
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you very much. So is yours.

247
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,810
Come on. Let's go
see the girls.

248
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,810
Don't stray too far,
guys.

249
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,810
You want a Cuban?

250
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,440
- Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke.
- Oh.

251
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,490
- Clean body, clean soul.
That's what Suzy says.
- Ain't that the truth?

252
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,920
- You guys have any vices?
- Well, you know.

253
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,690
- Can I get you a drink?
- Uh, yes. Chardonnay, please.

254
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,020
- Girls?
- Chardonnay.

255
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,220
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- I'll be up here at the filling station.

256
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,890
Duxbury's never gonna close that high.
I hear their stock's getting butchered.

257
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
- Hey, boys. Scotch.
- Hey, John.

258
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,940
- Yes, sir.
- It's a bloodbath over there.

259
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,410
Johnno. How'd you make out last quarter?
You take a beating?

260
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,610
- Actually, I got all my dough
buried under the toolshed.

261
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,580
- So, Chuck got the promotion.
- My God! That is so great!

262
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,580
- Fantastic!

263
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,410
- I'm so excited. We can finally
put the addition on the kitchen.

264
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,250
Oh, shoot. Not again.

265
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,830
I should wear a raincoat.

266
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,420
You know what? Would-
Can you hold her for a second?

267
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,060
- What? No. I'd rather not.
- It's all over the appliqué.

268
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,600
- Oh, no, I'm-
- Please, just-

269
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,170
Oh. Seltzer.

270
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,340
- Oh, she likes you.

271
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,390
I liked your dress tonight.

272
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,960
It was nice.

273
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,970
Thank you.

274
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,770
- Be there in the morning. Okay.
- Of course.

275
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,920
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yeah. It was- It was Dad.

276
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,120
He's a-
He thinks he has pneumonia.

277
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm sure it's just a cold,
and you know how he is. He'll be fine.

278
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,090
Yeah. Probably.

279
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,670
Maybe you should go see him.
I think he'd like that.

280
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,430
Hmm. Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I will.

281
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,540
- Good night then.

282
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,450
- Who was that?
- Huh?

283
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,750
- Who was on the phone?
- Oh, the Atlanta office.

284
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,790
There's a problem with the specs
for the dam again.

285
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,730
I'll fly in the morning.
I'll be gone a couple of days.

286
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,060
- That damn dam, huh?
- Yup, that damn dam.

287
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,200
- All right, good night, John.
- Good night.

288
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,810
Okay.

289
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,520
- There's trouble in Atlanta again.
- That's what I hear.

290
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,290
- What you got?
- I've got your boarding pass
and taxi receipts.

291
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,760
- Get rid of that gun-gum.
- You got a tissue?

292
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,000
- And your hotel bill. Now don't lose those.
- Thanks.

293
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
- The door's unlocked.

294
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,500
Mornin', pal.

295
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,740
- How you doin'?
- Same old same old. People need killin'.

296
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,510
Oh, Johnny. I might have a little
get-together this weekend... at my house.

297
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,310
Barbecue. No ladies. Dudes only.
It's gonna be awesome.

298
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,410
- Yeah. I'll talk to the missus.
- You wanna use my cell phone?

299
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,220
Maybe you wanna give her a call in case
you wanna decide to scratch your ass...

300
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,230
or use the head later,
make sure she thinks it's okay.

301
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,860
You live with your mother.

302
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,900
Why would you bring her into this?
She happens to be a first-class lady.

303
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
I don't have to check in with her
every time I wanna do somethin'.

304
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,800
She cooks, cleans,
makes me snacks.

305
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,810
I'm the dumb guy?

306
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,490
John Smith.

307
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,560
Hello, John.
- Good morning, Atlanta.

308
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,600
Quite the body count this week.

309
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,900
We have a priority one,
so I need your expertise.

310
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:25,780
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
A.K.A. "the Tank."

311
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,440
He's a direct threat to the firm.

312
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,480
D.I.A. Custody.

313
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,580
They're making a ground-to-air
handoff to heli...

314
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,990
10 miles north
of the Mexican border.

315
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,860
I need you to make sure
the target does not change hands.

316
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,190
The Tank?

317
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,350
- L-Temp Technology Staffing.
- Jane Smith confirmed.

318
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,350
Stand by for contact.

319
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,120
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.

320
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,990
You know the competition
would love to see us burn...

321
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,150
so I need you to handle this personally.

322
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,360
- Target?
- Benjamin Danz.

323
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,370
I'm rolling the specs now.

324
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,170
- We need this quick, clean and contained.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,310
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jane.

326
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,990
Yesterday's op resulted in one kill
and one agent in protective custody.

327
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,990
Not good.
We'll get him out tomorrow.

328
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,690
Another two cases of the G40's.
The grenade launchers are here.

329
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,090
Order 10 more.
All right. Go, Jas.

330
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,860
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
A.K.A. "the Tank."

331
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,870
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

332
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,940
The target's being moved across
the border to a federal facility.

333
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,940
The only point of vulnerability
is just south of the border.

334
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,410
I want G.P.S. And S.A.C.
Of the canyon...

335
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,410
and the weather report
for the last three days.

336
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,020
Target will rendezvous with the helicopter
here at a deserted airstrip.

337
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,750
We will have
one chance to strike.

338
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,130
Are we green?
- Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.

339
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,810
Red team! Red team!
This is Broadway Joe.

340
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,110
- Halftime is approaching.
- Copy that, Broadway Joe.

341
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,220
Oh, come on.

342
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,070
- You getting this?
- Affirmative. Is it a threat?

343
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,300
Countdown's initiated.
Convoy is not in the zone yet.

344
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,880
There's an idiot in the field.
He's gonna blow the charges.

345
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,490
- Ah.

346
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,440
Okay.

347
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,340
You gotta be kidding.

348
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,580
Civilians.

349
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,800
Let's see if we can't get
a tune out of this trombone.

350
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,210
We're picking up
a weapon signature.

351
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,470
Shit! Not a civilian.

352
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,110
Oh, man.

353
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,950
Asshole.

354
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,550
Convoy is in the zone!
Countdown is initiated.

355
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,310
Whoa!

356
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,750
You should so not be allowed
to buy these things.

357
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Abort! Abort!

358
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,570
I think I got I.D.'d on that hit.

359
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,080
- You ever been I.D.'d on a hit?
- Not that I'm aware of, no.

360
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,370
- Right. I think I'm in trouble.
- You get a look at 'im?

361
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,110
Little thing.
Buck 10, buck 15 tops.

362
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,150
- Maybe he's Filipino.
- Maybe.

363
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,220
I'm not even sure
it was a him.

364
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,650
Are you sayin' that you got
your ass kicked by some girl?

365
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,390
- That's right.
- Really?

366
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,400
- A pro.
- This should be easy.

367
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,470
I mean, how many hitters
do you know that are chicks? Right?

368
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,030
I'm sorry, man.

369
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,730
- You guys want any dessert?
- What do you have, honey?

370
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,570
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream?

371
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,140
- That sounds delicious.
What flavors do you have?
- Chocolate and vanilla.

372
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,140
I don't like either of those...
separately.

373
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,080
But maybe mixed together,
that could be... a nice little dish.

374
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,110
You know what I mean?
And not just a little pink spoon.

375
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,580
I'd like the whole sundae.

376
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,650
- That could be arranged.
- Perfect.

377
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,240
Could be arranged. Did you hear that?
I'd like to have her kick my ass.

378
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,550
- You know what I mean?
- Right.

379
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,630
Did you get any other details
on her besides her weight class?

380
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,060
- Laptop.
- I'm sorry? You're in
a whole zone right now.

381
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,890
I'm havin' a hard time
talkin' to you.

382
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,520
- Laptop.
- Okay, laptop.

383
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,960
I wanna know
who that bitch is!

384
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,590
- Get me that tape. Get me that tape.
- Jane.

385
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,900
- What?
- It's Father.

386
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,210
The F.B.I. Secured the package.
The window's closed, sir.

387
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,410
I told you we couldn't
afford any mistakes on this one.

388
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,050
- There was another player.
- We do not leave witnesses.

389
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,620
If this player I.D. 'd you-
You know the rules.

390
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,700
You have 48 hours
to clean the scene, Jane.

391
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,700
Lookin' forward to it, sir.

392
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,900
All right. We have a new target.
Let's find out who he is.

393
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,510
Jesus.
What did you do to it?

394
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,640
Put a campfire out with it?

395
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,010
Buy a new one.

396
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,520
This one has sentimental value
for its owner.

397
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,610
Who's that?

398
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,920
Well, Gwen,
I'm just hoping you'd tell me.

399
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,100
So, uh, why you gotta
know so bad anyway?

400
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,630
You know me.
Just tryin' to return some lost property.

401
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,830
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

402
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,430
- Are you a vegan?
- No.

403
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,530
My girlfriend is.

404
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,710
Here we go.

405
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,780
Upgraded RAM module.

406
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,980
Line three. Pick up.

407
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,290
Chip's Chinese.
Imported by Dynamix.

408
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,550
Retailed by, uh-

409
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,450
You know, I might be able
to get you a billing address.

410
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,300
All right.

411
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,460
No name.
Just an address.

412
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,100
570 Lexington Avenue.
Suite 5003.

413
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,110
New York.

414
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,110
You know the place?

415
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,420
Sweet Jesus.
Mother of God.

416
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,240
Why don't you both
go make some coffee?

417
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,460
Jane, it's your husband.

418
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,700
He's back from Atlanta.
He wants to know about dinner.

419
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,870
Tell him...
dinner's at 7:00.

420
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,500
Hi, John. Yeah,
she says dinner's at 7:00.

421
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,480
It always is.

422
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,180
Perfect timing.

423
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,250
As always.

424
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,150
- This is a nice surprise.
- I hope so.

425
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,090
- You're home early.
- I missed you.

426
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,830
Mm. I missed you too.

427
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,300
- Shall we?
- Yes.

428
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,640
Thought you only broke these out
for special occasions.

429
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,650
This is a special occasion.

430
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,480
Mm.

431
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,300
Mm!

432
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,040
Mm!

433
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,910
Mm! Pot roast.
My favorite.

434
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,580
Allow me, sweetheart.

435
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,690
You've been
on your feet all day.

436
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,100
- Thank you.
- Sure.

437
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,400
Mm.

438
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,050
So, how's work?

439
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,850
Actually, we had a-
a little trouble with a commission.

440
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,930
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

441
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,360
- Double booking with another firm.
- Huh.

442
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,430
- Green beans?
- No, thank you.

443
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,560
You'll have some.

444
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,310
I hope everything
works out okay.

445
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,780
It hasn't yet,
but it will.

446
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,850
Pot roast is my favorite.

447
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,190
Sweetheart,
could you pass the salt?

448
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,930
- Did you try something new?
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,490
Mm!

450
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,110
So, how was Atlanta?

451
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,780
Had a few problems ourselves.
Some figures didn't add up.

452
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,150
- Big deal?
- Life or death.

453
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,530
- Wine?
- Yeah.

454
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,180
- I got it.
- I got it. I'll get a towel.

455
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,400
Janey?

456
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,430
Honey?

457
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,450
Jane!

458
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,090
Jane!

459
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,390
How could I be so stupid?

460
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,080
Jane! Jane!

461
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,210
- God.

462
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,730
Oh, dear God.

463
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,960
- Oh.

464
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,070
Wait. No, no, no, no.
Accident.

465
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,670
- Honey? Accident.

466
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,640
Jane, stop the car! Now!

467
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,680
Jane!

468
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,750
You've overreacting!

469
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,090
Honey, let's not
get carried away.

470
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,680
- We don't wanna go to sleep angry.God!

471
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,130
Pull over.

472
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,030
Pull over! Pull over!

473
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,860
- Now, look-

474
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,280
We need to talk!

475
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,780
[Panting]

476
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,840
Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

477
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,290
Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

478
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,360
- Who is it?
- Open up.

479
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,730
- What the hell happened to you?
- My wife.

480
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,200
- She tried to kill me.
- Yes, she did. And you know what?

481
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,370
Gladys tried to kill me,
not with a car.

482
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,710
At least Jane was a man about it.
She was up front about it.

483
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,140
They all try to kill you-
slowly, painfully, cripplingly.

484
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,150
And then-wham.
They hurt you.

485
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,080
You know how hurt I used to be over her,
and I used to beat myself up?

486
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,180
Now I'm great.
I got dates all the time.

487
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,190
I just woke up from a thing.
I'm in my robe.

488
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,190
- You live with your mom.
- I live with my mom because I choose to.

489
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,160
Because that's the only
woman I've ever trusted.

490
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,230
Most of them
are passive-aggressive.

491
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,230
There's a whole psychology.
I've been reading books,
given what I've gone through.

492
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,960
And, uh, it's disgusting.

493
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,440
Do you know there is nothing more cruel
on this Earth than a 13-year-old girl.

494
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,730
They literally form cliques
in high school.

495
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,710
And they play cruel games on each other.
A-And test boundaries with each other.

496
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,780
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying about
you have to understand-

497
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,850
I'm hurting over here.
And you're talking about 13-year-old girls.

498
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,850
Because I'm trying
to get you past the hurt.

499
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,380
You have to understand the enemy-
what you're up against.

500
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,650
I know exactly
what you're thinkin'.

501
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,020
If she lied about that, what else
is it possible that she lied about?

502
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,320
Her job is a spy
to get information from people.

503
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,190
- French Riviera, a yacht?

504
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,200
An Iranian prince?

505
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,430
She's supposed to get close to him
and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

506
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,000
What?
What are you saying?

507
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,040
What?
Your husband is the shooter?

508
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,040
That's impossible.

509
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,940
Really?

510
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,640
This whole thing was probably
planned from the beginning.

511
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,810
Operation Stake Out Johnny. A six-year
stakeout to get information from you.

512
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,890
Mission accomplished.

513
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,960
Okay.

514
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,260
Here's the upside.

515
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,390
- You don't love him.
- No.

516
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,030
You'll kill him, and nobody's
better at that than you are.

517
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,730
Thank you.

518
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,810
And then it'll be over.

519
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,370
Mm.

520
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,710
- What if she's listening?
- What?

521
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,720
Do you think it's possible
that she rigged the house?

522
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,790
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, dude.

523
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,490
It could be very possible because of
th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff.

524
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,120
It wouldn't surprise me.
That's probably why she doesn't like me.

525
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,670
- Because she heard me call her a troll.
- You're out of your mind.

526
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,170
I'm just saying it's possible. The woman
just tried to run you over with a car-

527
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,200
That she could hear you.

528
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,770
And I don't give a shit.
I hope she is listening.

529
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,870
I hope you are listening, Jane.
You know what, I'm on to you.

530
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,970
You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he
was blinded. It's okay. She knows this.

531
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,680
But I'm not me.
I hope you're listening to me.

532
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,720
And I hope you know th-that I slept
with your friend, Jasmine. Huh?

533
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,310
- Shh.
- We're on the board.

534
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,860
I'm just saying we're on the board my man.
Come on. We're on the board.

535
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,430
You thought it was 37-0.
We got five points on the board.

536
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,220
I nailed Jasmine and she was
bad in bed, baby. Johnny, I'm not-

537
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,490
I know you're embarrassed, but, come on,
it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin' to.

538
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,000
The guys we work with, they don't know.
I'm never gonna tell them.

539
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,700
The people she works with probably got
a big laugh over this over the last six years.

540
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,830
But so what? Who cares?
That's not important.

541
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,430
Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book
have been written.

542
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,910
In the first 150 pages,
Johnny's been a clown.

543
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,540
You can write
the last 10 pages.

544
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,780
You've been smoked,
but you can write the last 10 pages.

545
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,620
Great talk, man. We should
do it more often. It was a great talk.

546
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,290
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm gonna borrow this.

547
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,330
- I like where your head's at.
- I'll do it in the morning.

548
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,900
- You okay?
- Yep. Okay.

549
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,970
- Good night.
- Good night.

550
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,410
You don't love him.

551
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,620
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Eddie.

552
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,660
- Good night, Mom.
- [Door Closes]

553
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,510
Okay, girls, let's go.

554
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,270
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.
You know the drill.

555
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,530
This is nice. Who picked this out?

556
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,170
- What is this?
- It looks like your wedding.

557
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,270
- I know what it is. What are you doing?
- Research.

558
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,940
- Background on the target.
- This room is wrapped.

559
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,010
Thank you.

to love and to cherish.

561
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,560
- Till death do us part.
- [Jane] I promise.

562
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:36,490
I, John, take you, Jane,
for my lawfully wedded wife...

- to have and to hold-
- [TV Turns Off]

564
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,170
It's all coming out of the house.

00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,460
Well done, ladies.
Let's wrap it up.

566
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:49,800
- What's going on, Mrs. Smith?
- Garden party, girls.

567
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,410
- Hi, neighbor.
- John, hey.

568
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,750
- Hey.
- Ooh, pumpkin. It's a big one.

569
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,690
Wow. I can't believe I've never been
in here before. This is great.

570
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,740
- Let's start with the living room.
- Oh, yeah.

571
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,640
- Oh. Nice floors. They teak or something?
- Yeah.

572
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,470
Fuck if I know, Martin.

573
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,710
Uh, and you won
the Golf Masters' trophy this year.

574
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,440
- Again.

575
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,810
Again. It'll be sittin'
on your mantel next year.

00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,290
Target profile is our main priority.

00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,830
Uh, with what, Jane?

581
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,940
You've reached the Smiths.

582
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,070
We can't take your call right now,
but leave a message after the tone...

583
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,080
- and we'll get back to you.
- [Beep]

584
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,980
- And search the database.
- For what? John Smith?

585
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,220
- Find him.
- Uh, Jane.

586
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,420
What?

587
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,650
- I think I found him.
- Where?

588
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,160
Here.

Heat sensor breach

- Commence scanning all floors.

591
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,870
I thought I told you
not to bother me at the office, honey.

592
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,540
- Well, you are still Mrs. Smith.
- Well, so are a lot of girls.

593
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,540
Careful, Jane. I can push the button
anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.

594
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,090
Baby, you couldn't find the button
with both hands and a map.

595
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,330
- Last warning. You need to disappear.
- [Jane] No.

00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,190
- Now.
- "D" Sector clear.

597
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,230
You really expect me
to roll over and play dead?

598
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,560
You should be used to it
after five years of marriage.

599
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,140
Six. And I'm not leaving.

You're tellin' me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

613
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,040
You're tellin’ me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

614
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,340
What I'm trying to say is
we got all this stuff here...

615
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,540
and you're trying to tell me
you couldn't take her out?

616
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:31,140
Well, now she's a problem
for both of us.

01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,390
Now my house is priority one.

01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:37,150
Just give me a hand,
will ya?

619
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,660
Please. You're driving me crazy
with the tongs in the furnace.
You're like an insane man.

620
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,930
All right.
They gave you 48 hours.

621
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,870
What do we got left here?
Twenty-three? Twenty-two?

622
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,870
Eighteen and change.

623
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,960
- You got 18 hours until they
close the book on both of you?
- [Woman] Eddie.

624
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,010
Mom! We're on high alert here!

625
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,010
I almost killed you right then!

626
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,210
You do not even realize!

627
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,210
Never mind.

628
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,680
I am so done playing games
with this broad.

629
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,690
You gotta take this bitch
out head-on.

630
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,720
Don't tell me
how to handle my wife.

631
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,190
This broad is not your wife.
She's the enemy. And she could
be outside right now!

632
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,490
Eddie.

633
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,090
Got it.

634
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,030
Now we're talkin'. Only question is
how much is it to buy a vowel?

635
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:29,400
- Blackbow Realty.
- Yes. Hi. I'm calling from l-Temp.

636
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,840
Oh, great.
How's that new penthouse working out?

637
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,780
Well, just fine.
Thank you for asking.

638
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,310
This is security.
There seems to be a problem
with your elevator, sir.

639
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,210
Do you want an engineer to come up
and, uh, see what the problem is?

640
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,220
Take your time.
I'm really quite comfortable.

641
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,720
Are you really comfortable?

642
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,790
Jane?

643
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,560
Is that you, sweetheart?

644
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,630
First and last warning, John.
Get out of town.

645
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,830
You know I'm not
goin' anywhere.

646
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,900
Oh, well, so you say.

647
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,240
But right now you're trapped in a steel box,
hanging 70 floors over nothin' but air.

648
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,040
Oh, so this is a trap.

649
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,840
He's in car three.

650
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,110
It's never gonna work, honey.

651
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:42,550
It's never gonna work because
you constantly underestimate me.

652
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:47,180
- Do I?
- You have no idea who I am.

653
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,920
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

654
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,290
Well, back at you, baby.

655
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,130
Let me guess. Shaped charge
on the counterbalance cable.

656
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,930
Two more on the primary
and secondary brakes.

657
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,900
Maybe?

658
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,730
- He found them.
- Yes. Thank you.

659
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,310
Did you also get the base charge
at the principal cable?

660
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,720
Promise to leave town,
or I'll blow it.

661
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:22,460
Okay. I give up.

662
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,530
Blow it.

663
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,330
- What?
- Go on. Blow it.

664
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,390
- You think I won't?
- I- I think you won't.

665
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,780
Okay.

666
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,610
Five, four-

667
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:42,700
- Any last words?
- The new curtains are hideous.

668
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,580
Good-bye, John.

669
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,720
- What the hell was that?
- What?

670
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,920
You said good-bye.

671
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,580
- Shut off the gas!

672
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,780
Madame.

673
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,540
Thought of a number of
lines for this moment.

674
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,620
"Thought I'd just drop in."

675
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,210
- "Hey, doll. Thanks for givin' me the shaft."
- Nice.

676
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,050
So, what did you decide?

677
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,060
I want a divorce.

678
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,130
I like it.

679
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,930
You proposed to me here,
so it has agreeable symmetry.

680
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,900
Coat, sir?

681
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,370
- May I sit?
- No.

682
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,380
[Gun Cocks]

683
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,420
- Champagne, sir?
- No. Champagne's for celebrating.

684
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,490
I'll have a martini.

685
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:40,560
I'm fine. Thank you.

686
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,960
I like the dress.

687
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:48,120
I'm in mourning.

688
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,170
You should wear it
more often.

689
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,910
So, what do you want, John?

690
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,610
We have an unusual
problem, Jane.

691
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,640
You obviously want me dead.

692
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,010
- Hmm.
- And I'm less and less concerned
of your well-being.

693
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,080
So, what do we do?

694
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,250
Do we shoot it out here?
Hope for the best?

695
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,260
Mm. Well, that
would be a shame...

696
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,730
because they would probably ask me
to leave once you're dead.

697
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,130
Dance with me.

698
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,590
You don't dance.

699
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,760
Just part of my cover,
sweetheart.

700
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,240
Was sloth part of it too?

701
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,580
Ow.

702
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,350
You think this story's
gonna have a happy ending?

703
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,290
Happy endings are just stories
that haven't finished yet.

704
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,740
Satisfied?

705
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,110
Not for years.

706
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,010
That's all John,
sweetheart.

707
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,570
Why is it
you think we failed?

708
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,550
Because we were leading separate lives?
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

709
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,550
I have a theory.

710
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:48,550
- Newly formed.
- I'm breathless to hear it.

711
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,990
- You killed us.
- Provocative.

712
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,990
You approached
our marriage like a job-

713
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,430
something to be reconned,
planned and executed.

714
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:00,090
And you avoided it.

715
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,760
What do you care,
if I was just a cover?

716
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,890
Well, who said
you were just a cover?

717
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,070
- Wasn't I?
- Well, wasn't I?

718
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,980
I have to- Excuse me.

719
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,210
No exits
up there, Jane.

720
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,150
Be cold, John.
She's a liar.

721
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,230
Be super cold.

722
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,210
Come on, honey! This way!

723
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,230
- Do you know that you're ticking?

724
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:17,110
Get back!
Get back! Get back!

725
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,710
- Limo, sir?

726
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,700
Jane Smith.

727
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,700
That's the second time
you tried to kill me.

728
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,960
Oh, come on.
It was just a little bomb.

729
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:48,040
I want you to know. I'm goin'
home, and I'm gonna burn
everything I ever bought you.

730
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,770
- I'll race you there, baby.

731
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:07,560
- You there yet?

732
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:11,620
The first time we met,
what was your first thought?

733
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,660
You tell me.

734
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,670
I thought-

735
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,830
I thought you looked like
Christmas morning.

736
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,570
I don't know
how else to say it.

737
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,170
And why are you
telling me this now?

738
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,720
I guess, in the end,
you start thinkin' about the beginning.

739
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,820
So there it is.
I thought you should know.

740
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:44,490
So how about it, Jane? Hmm?

741
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,930
I thought-

742
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,370
I thought that you were
the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.

743
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,550
- So it was all business, yeah?
- All business.

744
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:07,050
- From the go.
- Cold, hard math.

745
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,320
Thank you. That's what
I needed to know.

746
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

747
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,510
- Hey, John.

748
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,840
Hey, Bill.

749
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,110
- Uh, are you all right?
- Yeah.

750
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,520
- Okay.

751
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,790
Uh, by the way, uh, John, your car
is hangin' out over the, uh, sidewalk here.

752
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,420
- Yeah. Thanks, Bill.
- Okay. Have a good night.

753
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,520
Good night.

754
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,620
Shit.

755
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,880
You still alive, baby?

756
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,500
Your aim's as bad
as your cookin', sweetheart.

757
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,910
- Yeah.

758
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:31,980
And that's saying something.

759
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,770
- Come on, honey.

760
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,840
Come to daddy.

761
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,590
Who's your daddy now?

762
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,450
I can't do it.

763
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:06,720
Don't! Come on!

764
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,800
Come on!

765
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,200
You want it?

766
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,270
It's yours.

767
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,150
Oh, I can't-

768
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,900
Come on. Mmm.

769
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,900
Hiya, stranger.

770
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,910
Hiya back.

771
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,210
- Yeah?
- Is everything okay?

772
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,120
We heard an awful ruckus.

773
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,450
No. Everything's fine here.
Yeah. It's great.

774
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,150
So you guys are- You're fine?

775
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,250
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

776
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,760
Oh. Nice.
You guys- But are-

777
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,890
- Suzy. Martin. Officers.
- Have a nice night.

778
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,030
Looks like you're redecorating.
It's very-

779
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,540
Yeah. Shame about the teak.

780
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,720
[John] That left of yours.
A thing of beauty.

781
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,990
- You take it well.
- Thank you.

782
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:07,700
- That vacation in Aspen-
- Mm.

783
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,070
You left early. Why?

784
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,440
- Jean-Luc Gaspard.
- Oh! God! Oh.

785
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,640
- Yeah.
- I wanted him.

786
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:21,240
- Forget it.
- Wow.

787
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:25,850
You didn't hear me that night
the chopper dropped me off
for our anniversary dinner?

788
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,480
- No.
- No?

789
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,390
Mm. Percussion grenades.

790
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,460
I was partially deaf
that night.

791
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,000
- I'm slightly color blind.
- Mm.

792
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:44,470
- Retinal scarring.
- I can't feel anything in these three fingers.

793
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,650
- Three ribs. Broken eye socket.
- Mm. Oh.

794
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,660
- Perforated eardrum. Mm.
- Mmm.

795
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,890
You ever have trouble
sleeping after?

796
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,930
- Nope.
- Yeah. Me neither.

797
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:49,970
Go, go, go, go, go!
Look out!

798
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,470
Move.

799
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,810
Shoes.

800
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,550
I was given 48 hours
to take you out.

801
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,650
- Same.
- Jesus. Where's the trust?

802
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,560
What do you expect?

803
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,000
Why do I get the girl gun?

804
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:22,330
- Are you kiddin' me?
- No.

805
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,410
Thank you.

806
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:05,110
Come on! They're outside!

807
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,100
Colemans.

808
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:09,770
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.

809
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,020
I was never in the Peace Corps.

810
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,810
What? No.
I really liked that about you.

811
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,880
- Well, maybe this honesty thing
isn't such a good idea.
- No, no, no.

812
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,150
- I didn't go to M.I.T.
- Really?

813
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,360
Notre Dame.
Art history major.

814
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:30,400
- Art?
- History.

815
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,970
- It's reputable.
- Okay.

816
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,860
Fuckers get younger
every year.

817
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:06,230
I have to tell you.
I never really liked your cooking.

818
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,310
- It's not your gift.
- Hmm.

819
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,340
Baby, I've never cooked
a day in my life.

820
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:15,280
L-Temp girls cooked.

821
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,980
- Web of lies!

822
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:35,260
I like it. Deal with it.

823
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,230
- We got company.
- What?

824
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:44,980
Shit.

825
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:58,110
- Baby, hold steady. Now!
- It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.

826
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,530
Hold still!

827
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,430
This thing's all over the place.
How do you drive these things anyways?

828
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,730
Honey!

829
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,600
- Transmission's terrible.

830
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,010
- Honey, let me drive.
- I got it.

831
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,050
Move over. Move.

832
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:30,710
I'm the suburban housewife,
sweetheart.

833
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,880
- You move.
- Fine. Go.

834
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,520
- Go.
- Go.

835
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:38,600
- Go!
- Go!

836
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,600
They're bulletproof.

837
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,670
They're bulletproof.

838
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:02,680
You know, honey,
I should probably tell you.

839
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,780
I was married once before.

840
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,630
- Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

841
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:18,760
- It was a drunken Vegas thing!
- Oh, that's better!

842
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,630
- Stop it.
- That's much better. That's great.

843
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,470
Stop it.

844
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:32,350
Go, go, go!

845
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:34,710
[Groans]

846
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:42,090
- What's her name
and Social Security number?

847
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:44,290
No. You're not gonna kill her.

848
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,750
These doors are handy.

849
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:24,160
You know, sweetheart,
you're being a bit hypocritical.

850
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:26,240
It's not like
you're some beacon of truth.

851
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,510
John, my parents-

852
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:36,440
They died when I was five.
I'm an orphan.

853
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,880
Who-Who was that kindly fella
who gave you away at our wedding?

854
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:42,010
Paid actor.

855
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:47,250
- I said- I said I saw your dad
on Fantasy Island!
- I know.

856
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,560
You know, I don't even
want to talk about it.

857
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:08,300
- You got it?
- Got it.

858
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,280
- Any time.
- I got 'em.

859
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:56,660
We're gonna have to redo
every conversation we've ever had.

860
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,300
I'm Jewish.

861
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,760
[John] I can't believe I brought
my real parents to our wedding.

862
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:08,270
Disgusting. How could you
serve this to someone?

863
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:10,840
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is it possible to get this reheated? Miss?

864
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:13,170
- Miss, I'm talkin' to you. Excuse me.
- [Taps Table]

865
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:17,800
- Jesus, Johnny.
- Good morning, Eddie.

866
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,110
Morning.

867
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:23,780
It's good to see
you're okay, man.

868
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:26,380
Tell me you got smart
and that you killed that lyin' bitch.

869
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:28,460
Hmm. This lying bitch?

870
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,950
Guess it was just
wishful thinking.

871
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,960
- I'm sorry.
- [John] Eddie, we got-

872
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,400
- It's nice to see you, Jane.
- Eddie. Eddie, focus, please.

873
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,870
- We got problems.
- You got problems?

874
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,800
Crack addicts got problems, my friend.
You two are smoked.

875
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,810
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

876
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,040
John, you got the entire
agency gunnin' for ya.

877
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,770
- Probably have her agency
gunnin' for you too.
- What about you?

878
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,780
- Me?
- Where are you at?

879
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,820
Where am I at?

880
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,550
I find myself dragging my feet
this morning.

881
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:59,250
I think you owe me
a little money anyway.

882
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,660
- What do you think?
- We don't understand each other.
And I understand that.

883
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,660
But I don't need those looks from you.
I've been in his life a long time.

884
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:11,430
- Eddie, Eddie. Focus. Focus.
- I've been in his life for a long time.

885
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,530
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house.
They shot at my wife. My own company.

886
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,570
If she works for who the street...

887
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,110
says that she works for...

888
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:23,650
you're Macy's and Gimbel's.

889
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,180
She would be the WE channel,
and you would be...

890
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,840
whatever channel it is
that competes against the WE channel.

891
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,940
- Know what I'm saying? You following me?
- Mm-hmm.

892
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:34,920
Johnny, the point is simple. Once you guys
decide to get off the reservation, that's it.

893
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:37,960
- Then you're off the reservation.
- Eddie, how bad?

894
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,960
- How bad is it?
- Mm.

895
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,960
You remember Canada.

896
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,860
- Ooh.
- That was kid stuff next to
what you're up against.

897
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:46,870
- That was you?
- Oh, is that a turn-on?

898
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:49,440
- She tried to kill you with a car.
Not my business.
- Stop.

899
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,340
A good friend stays out of it.
I understand. This is the facts.

900
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,780
If you two separate from
each other, you got a shot.

901
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,850
Not a great shot, Johnny,
but you got a shot.

902
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:01,580
You two stay together,
you're dead.

903
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:05,140
Unless you can find something
that they want more than they want you.

904
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,920
Found him. He's being held in subbasement
"D" of the federal courthouse.

905
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:17,470
High security.
Motion and thermal.

906
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:20,160
Power's on a city grid.

907
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:24,260
This is as far as we go, Jane.

908
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:28,180
Right. Thanks for everything.
- Good luck, babe.

909
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,880
We have this northwesterly flow...

910
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,920
coming down through
the middle of the country.

911
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,920
So we're seeing successive areas-

912
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,080
Do one of you guys mind
changing the channel?

913
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:42,250
- One is moving in right now.
- Nick.

914
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,820
Would you please get off your fat ass
and change the channel?

915
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:49,300
I know. It's tough.
Thank you.

916
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,560
That's going to make things
even colder than they are right now.

917
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,640
Now, 52-

918
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,510
You guys go.

919
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:21,900
[Jane] Thirty-second window.
I cut the power, you grab the kid.

920
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,870
- Simple and clean. Got it?
- Got it.

921
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,840
So tell me.
How many?

922
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,440
Does it matter?

923
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:35,480
- Should I go first?
- Okay.

924
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:39,850
- I don't exactly keep count, but-

925
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:41,880
I would say...

926
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:44,720
- high 50s, low 60s.
- Mm-hmm.

927
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,620
Been around the block, but...

928
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,750
- you know, the important thing is-
- 312.

929
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,370
312?

930
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:00,360
- How?
- Some were two at a time.

931
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:09,410
- Honey.
- I'm- I'm- I'm-

932
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,620
Baby's in the crib.

933
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,390
Are you counting
innocent bystanders?

934
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:37,170
- Monitoring the perimeter?
- I checked the perimeter.

935
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:40,040
- What about the police bands?
- I am on the police bands.

936
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,270
- Connected to the main-
- This is not my first time.

937
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,410
I think we've established that.

938
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,720
All right.

939
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:55,080
Turn left.

940
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,920
Left, John.

941
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:59,150
Left!

942
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:02,630
You don't have to
talk to me like that. Okay?

943
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,670
- Be nice.
- Left, please?

944
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:07,670
I can't go left. You see?

945
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:10,430
There is no left. Look.

946
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:12,940
I have straight.
I have back the way I came.

947
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,270
There's no left.
Which way do you want me to go?

948
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:18,870
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.
- See what I'm sitting in?

949
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:21,280
See that?

950
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:23,850
- Take your time.
- Yeah. All right. Stay.

951
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:25,950
Stay there.
Wait for my mark. I'll find it.

952
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:30,920
Wait for my mark.

953
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:39,100
Almost there.
I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

954
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,340
What are you-John, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

955
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,970
Kill the lights on my signal.

956
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:57,350
Now. Kill the lights.

957
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,780
Jane, kill the lights.

958
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:02,120
- Hey. Who's that?
- Where?

959
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:05,160
[John]
No, no. Not now! Turn 'em back on!

960
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:06,430
- Idiot!

961
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:07,590
- Idiot!

962
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,760
- Here they come.
- Hey, Nick. Uncuff me.

963
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,560
Turn 'em on!
Turn 'em back on!

964
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:14,300
- Turn 'em back on!

965
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,970
- Turn it back on.
- All right.

966
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,980
- Give me light.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

967
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:26,810
- Nick.
- Shut up.

968
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,760
Give me a gun.

969
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,020
- Nick, give me a gun.
- Zip it!

970
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,340
Open the door.

971
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,480
Open the door.

972
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,890
Back there.

973
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:12,690
Look out.
Move, move, move.

974
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,530
[Groans]

975
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,990
This guy's a wily one.

976
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:28,940
Shut the door.

977
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,810
Move. Move. The other way.

978
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,480
How's this work?

979
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,260
- I told you to wait for my signal.

980
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,490
- You didn't wait for my signal.
- Well, I improvised.

981
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,690
- You deviated from the plan.
- The plan was flawed.

982
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,160
- The plan was not flawed.
- Anal.

983
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,400
- Organized.
- Jane, 90% of this job is instinct.

984
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,670
Your instincts set off
every alarm in the building.

985
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:59,300
My instincts got the job done.
May not have been the Jane show.

986
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:03,240
No. It was the John show. It was half-assed.
Like Christmas. Like our anniversary.

987
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:05,910
Like the time you forgot
to bring my mother's birthday present.

988
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:10,920
- Your fake mother's birthday.
- The point is, you are always
the first to break team.

989
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:13,990
You don't want a team. You-
You want a servant for hire.

990
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:16,920
I want someone I can count on.

991
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,690
- Jane, there's no air around you anymore.
- Oh.

992
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,700
Okay. What is that
supposed to mean?

993
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,730
It means there's no room for mistakes.
No mistakes whatsoever.

994
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,430
No spontaneity.
I mean, who can answer to that?

995
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:30,900
Well, you don't have to. Do you?
'Cause this isn't even a real marriage.

996
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:35,470
- Who are you people?
- Shut up!

997
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,640
Well.

998
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,980
So, now I realize...

999
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:44,820
you witnessed the missus and I
working through some domestic issues.

1000
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,150
- Oh.
- That's regrettable.

1001
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:52,550
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.
That would be a mistake on your part.

1002
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,220
Now tell us what you know.

1003
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,200
Why do both our bosses
want you dead?

1004
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,630
- You unders-

1005
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:04,170
Honey, please.

1006
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:07,480
Wrap it up.

1007
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:11,410
Maybe it's not such a good idea
to undermine me in front of the hostage.

1008
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,750
Sends a mixed message.

1009
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:16,320
Sorry.

1010
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,390
Girls.

1011
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,390
- Okay.

1012
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,980
- Where was I?
- "A mistake on your part."

1013
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,890
Shut up. Options.
I'm gonna lay out your options for you.

1014
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,260
- Okay? Option "A."
- If I could-

1015
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,660
Shut up.
Option "A."

1016
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:34,670
You talk. We listen.
No pain.

1017
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:37,100
Option "B."
You don't talk.

1018
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:39,870
I remove your thumbs
with my pliers.

1019
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:43,000
It will hurt.
Option "C."

1020
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:48,050
I like to vary the details a bit,
but the punch line is you die.

1021
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,620
- Benjamin.
- Okay.

1022
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,350
- We're impatient people.
- Okay.

1023
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,460
Can I get a soda?

1024
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,800
Or a juice or, uh, some-

1025
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:09,030
- "A." "A." Option "A." Aaah!

1026
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:11,900
- Oh, that hurt.
- Okay. That was a nice shot.

1027
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:19,310
- What's-You got a spasm?

1028
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:22,720
I'm tied up.
Why don't you check my back pocket?

1029
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:33,390
I'm not the target. You are.

1030
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,800
Both of you.
They found out you're married...

1031
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:40,170
so they teamed up and sent you
to the same hit to target each other.

1032
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:42,930
It was a joint task force
by both your companies.

1033
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:47,140
Two competing agents living under
the same roof. It's bad for business.

1034
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,610
- They wanted you to take each other out.
- You were bait.

1035
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,070
Well, it's entry level.
Toehold into the company.

1036
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,090
Couple hits,
they bump me up to a desk.

1037
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:59,090
It's pretty cool actually.

1038
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:01,090
You keep the photo
in your back pocket?

1039
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:04,220
- What was I supposed to do? Frame it?
- You get rid of it. You burn it.

1040
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,630
- Tradecraft 101.
- I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day.

1041
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:09,460
Just like I guess you skipped the day
about not marrying the enemy.

1042
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:12,870
You were bait,
or you are bait?

1043
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:19,400
Belt. Belt. Belt, dude.

1044
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:28,980
Two minutes.

1045
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,390
One minute.

1046
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,660
I'll get you closer.

1047
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,650
A little help.

1048
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,480
- Clear.
- Clear.

1049
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,250
Hey, I think I chipped my tooth.
Do you know if we have dental?

1050
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:24,470
My way out is a boat
standing by in La Paz.

1051
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,670
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

1052
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,340
So, at least, apart,
we know what the odds are.

1053
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:39,010
Let's just call this what it is...

1054
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,060
and what it isn't.

1055
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:48,030
All right.
So it's a crap marriage.

1056
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:51,070
All right. I'm a mess.
You're a disaster.

1057
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:53,070
We're both liars.

1058
01:46:55,570 --> 01:46:57,470
But you run,
you'll always be running.

1059
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,270
I say we stay and we fight.

1060
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:05,580
We finish this thing.

1061
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,450
Then if you wanna go, you can go.

1062
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:11,350
Oh, thank you.

1063
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:15,250
What? "Let's call this what it is."
Jesus Christ.

1064
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,630
- Stop.
- Don't.

1065
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:34,670
Oh, Jesus.

1066
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:49,220
This is
a really good store.

1067
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:36,170
- See you in the next life, Jane.
- Likewise, John.

1068
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,270
Sorry.

1069
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,310
We'll talk about this later.

1070
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:44,400
Jesus!

1071
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,490
- I didn't touch a thing.
- Yes, you did.

1072
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,480
- Sorry about the, uh, knife in-
- I don't want to talk about it.

1073
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:40,460
- I'll fly.
- I'll be bait.

1074
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:44,830
- I'm goin' clockwise, so watch my 6:00.
- All right.

1075
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:47,150
Go! Move!

1076
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,930
How's it look?

1077
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:38,200
It's a piece of cake.

1078
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:50,440
Watch these.
They tend to jam. So watch 'em.

1079
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:55,540
You favor your left, sweetheart,
so look out for right.

1080
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:12,560
Damn. That boat in La Paz
is lookin' pretty good right now, isn't it?

1081
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:19,440
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

1082
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:28,340
Shut up.

1083
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:59,540
I'm interested in the progress
you've made in the last few weeks.

1084
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,540
Uh, doin' all right, aren't we?

1085
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,540
I mean, listen.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1086
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:05,770
There were times I just wanted to-

1087
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,780
- Kill her, but, uh-
- Likewise.

1088
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:09,780
Couldn't take the shot.

1089
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:11,790
- That's a good sign.
- Who would've thought.

1090
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:13,910
- Sometimes you have to battle through.
- Hmm.

1091
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:16,990
- That's marriage, right?
- Yeah. You take your best shot and-

1092
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:20,730
- Oh. We redid the house.
- Hmm.

1093
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,800
We did. Yes, we did.

1094
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,800
- You know, there will always be challenges.
- Uh-huh.

1095
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:28,200
- Threats out there.
- Yep.

1096
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,900
But you can handle it together.

1097
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:34,880
- So far.
- Yes, we ca- So far?

1098
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,450
Oh, what is that?

1099
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,540
I'm leaving room for the unknown.

1100
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:41,980
So far.

1101
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,780
And do you feel that
your relationship styles...

1102
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:47,950
- are more conducive to the free flow-
- Ask us the sex question.

1103
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:50,890
John.

1104
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:54,390
- Uh, well, that- Ten.
