音樂什麼樣子
What does music feel like?

41
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,790
音樂  是聲音的組合
Music- a combination of sounds

42
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,130
一種表達美和思想情感的藝術

72
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,430
它能告訴瑪麗莎·維格拉我們的方位
It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are.

73
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,640
如果你覺得準備好了  打算離開這
If you think you're ready, and you want to leave here,

74
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,970
只需打開開關就行

75
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,440
但一旦觸碰開關  就別無退路
But once it's done there's no going back.

76

我不會替你做決定

想清楚這是不是你的真正所想
Be sure it's what you really want.

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,420
也是第一隻繞地飛行的動物
was the first animal to orbit the Earth.

84
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,800
1957年11月3日  她被送入外太空
She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957.

85
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
科學家認為人類
Scientists believe humans

86
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,880
無法忍受外太空的環境
would be unable to survive the conditions of outer space.

87
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,930
因此動物的航天飛行就成了
So flights by animals were used

88
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,840
人類探索外太空的先驅實驗
as experiments precursory to human missions.

89
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,050
那時的火箭是不可回收式的
A rocket was not designed to be retrievable,

90
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,000
萊卡就是去送命的
and Laika has always been, intended to die.

91
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,850
但她沒死  對嗎
But she didn't, did she?

92
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,390
還記得嗎  他們無法收回火箭
They couldn't bring the rocket back, remember?

93
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,700
記得
I remember.

94
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,020
但有時我希望你能換種方式看問題
But sometimes I wish you would read it differently.

95
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,700
當一顆行星瓦解時
When a star collapses,

96
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,580
超新星爆炸所發出的光
the supernova explosion is ten billion times

97
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,380
要比其他行星要亮百億倍
brighter than the other stars.

98
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,380
和我一起去打獵嗎

99

如果你想我陪的話
If you want.

100
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,860
隨你吧

102

那我待家
I'll stay.

103
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,870
好  好吧
Yes, good.

104
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,100
瑪麗莎·維格拉
Marissa Wiegler...

105
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
來找我吧

106
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,950
你很幸運能獵到那頭鹿

107
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,130
今天外面什麼也沒有

聞著很香

109
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,270

看起來怎麼樣
How does it look?

122
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,070

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,790
索菲  快點  就等你了
Sophie, come on, we are all waiting for you.

280
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,790
監視器顯示她在沙漠
Tacticle says she's in the desert,

281
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,840
在我們的東南方
south east of vessel we're in.

282
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,230
全力追捕海勒
Focus all operations on Heller.

283
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,410
你的意思是這女孩對我們沒價值嗎
Are you saying the girl's not of interest to us?

284
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,030
她當然有用  路易斯
Yes, of course she's of interest, Lewis.

285
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,860
但她還不會
But not an immediate threat

286
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,530
對美國的安全構成直接威脅
to the security of the United States of America.

287
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,780
埃塈J·海勒是眼下最危險的人物  以他為重
Erik Heller is the immediate threat. Focus on Heller.

288
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,560
魯拜賓館

289
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,540
你的家人呢
Where is your family?

290
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,830
-你是阿拉伯人嗎  -我是摩洛哥人
- Are you Arabic? - I am Moroccan.

291
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,600
摩洛哥  首都是拉巴特
Morocco. Capital city: Rabat.

292
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,170
著名景點包括馬拉喀什和索維拉
Places of interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.

293
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,360
信奉伊斯蘭教  語種為阿拉伯語
Religion: Islam. Language: Arabic.

294
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
我很喜歡阿拉伯語
I like Arabic very much.

295
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,160
像日語一樣  是個豐富的語言
It's like Japanese, it's big.

296
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,690
你會說阿拉伯語嗎
You speak Arabic?

297
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
當然會說
Yes, of course.

298
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,730
你的家人在哪兒
Where is your family?

299
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,030
我今晚要找個地方住
I need a room for the night.

300
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,720
但我沒錢  你能幫幫我嗎
Can you help? I have no money.

301
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,520
這是我們這兒最好的房間
It's the best we've got.

302
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,580
謝謝
Thank you.

303
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,580
每個房間都有這東西嗎
Do you have one of these in every room?

304
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,990
所有的房間都有
All the rooms are the same.

305
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,950
是電
It's electricity.

306
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,660
還用說嗎  都是現代化設備
Of course, all mod cons.

307
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,800
我對電知之甚少
I know a little about electricity.

308
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,240
人們說是愛迪生發明了電
They say Edison invented it.

309
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,560
還是富蘭克林來著
Or was it Franklin?

310
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,120
反正是個美國人
Some American I'm sure.

311
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,600
這個是電熱水壺
This is an electrical kettle.

312
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,260
專為英國人準備的
It's for the English.

313
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,550
他們喜歡自己燒水沏茶
They like to make their own tea.

314
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,010
這是什麼
What is it?

315
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,100
有這就夠不錯的了
It's the best we can do.

316
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,960
你從哪兒來
Where do you come from?

317
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,940
森林
The forest.

318
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,280
是那個德國女孩
It's the German girl.

319
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,050
穿摩洛哥寬長袍的德國佬
It's Kraut in a big Djellaba.

320
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,210
即像雛妓又像拉拉
Like quail or lesbo.

321
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,950
我覺得當個拉拉也挺不錯的
I think I'd quite like to be lesbian.

322
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,980
但我的戀人不能太胖  得像模特一樣
But not one of those fat ones, one who's like, a supermodel.

323
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,100
但也只是玩玩兒  我應該還是會嫁個男人
But who don't hold hands, and I think I'd probably marry a man.

324
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,950
什麼
What?

325
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,470
不親一個嗎
No kiss?

326
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,590
她對你來說有點太老了吧
She's a bit old for you, isn't she?

327
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,810
她是個人妖
She has male and female genetalias.

328
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,580
這就是你為之傾倒的原因吧
And you love her just the way she is.

329
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,380
我很樂意滿足他人的需求
I like to give people what they want.

330
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,260
薇拉  給我朋友來杯美酒
Vera, make my friend something sweet.

331
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,170
還是下次吧
I'll save it for when I need it.

332
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,790
你為何而來  瑪麗莎
What do you want, Marissa?

333
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,350
埃塈J·海勒還活著
Erik Heller's still alive.

334
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,520
意料之中
Of course.

335
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,680
還有那個女孩
And the girl.

336
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,930
你到底為什麼來這
Why are you here precisely?

337
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,790
我需要你
I need you.

338
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,390
需要我這個不中用的老傢伙  真是受寵若驚
You need me? Little old me! I'm very flattered.

339
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,070
我需要你的聰明才智  親愛的
I need your talents, darling.

340
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,710
我需要你幫我做點
I need you to do things

341
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,760
情報局不允許的事情
my agency will not let me do.

342
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,760
停
Stop!

343
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,080
重來
Again.

344
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,020
從頭來
Start again.

345
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,950
細節決定成敗  不是嗎
The devil is in the details, isn't it?

346
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,180
解決那個女孩還是埃塈J
It's the girl or Erik?

347
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,440
她就在摩洛哥
She is in Morocco.

348
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,650
你需要的都在信封
It's all in the envelope.

349
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,340
埃塈J就交給我吧
Let me worry about Erik.

350
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
要殺死她嗎
Shall I kill her?

351
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,490
找到她就好
Just find her.

352
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,480
瑪麗莎
Marissa.

353
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,620
她跟你預想的一樣嗎
Did she turn out as you hoped?

354
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,560
比我想的還要好
Better.

355
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,960
重來一遍
Once more.

356
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,560
再來一次
Again.

357
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,700
還告訴我許多
...and gave me lots of advices

358
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,000
關於如何花錢避稅的建議
about how to spend these money do these taxes.

359
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,340
雖然她很漂亮
You see even though she is beautiful,

360
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
但還是很會精打細算
she is actually brilliant with money.

361
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,640
別碰我
Get off.

362
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,650
比如有次紀念日  他說有1萬5千塊
Like for one of the anniversary, he said his 15 grand,

363
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,710
是買個愛馬仕凱莉包還是做個隆胸手術呢
for a Hermes kelly bag or a boob job.

364
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,760
而她卻知道  
Now she said she knew that the

365
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,840
乳房假體每十年就要更換一次
boob implant will have to be replaced every 10 years.

366
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,710
而愛馬仕凱莉包可是永不貶值
But that the Hermes kelly bag never depreciates in value.

367
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,510
隆胸就說到這兒吧
That's enough for the boob job.

368
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,670
可不是誰都懂這些的
I mean that's not just common sense.

369
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,130
所以我才喜歡她
And that's why I really love her.

370
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,840
我媽反對整形
Mum is against plastic surgery.

371
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,740
-沒錯  -甚至連化妝都很少
- I am. - Mum doesn't even wear make-up.

372
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,780
對  我覺得那很虛偽
I don't. I think it's dishonest.

373
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,900
這就是我的樣子  不喜歡拉倒
This is my face, take it or leave it.

374
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,220
如果你學過美術史和人類學的話
If you study History of Art, Anthropology...

375
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,710
瑞秋是劍橋的優等生
Rachel got a first at Cambridge.

376
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,790
你就會學到紅唇能刺激性慾
you'll learn that red lipstick mimics arousal

377
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,500
且能使人聯想起小陰唇的形狀
and suggests the geography of the labia minora.

378
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,580
-噁心  -而我的嘴唇紅得很自然
- Puke! - Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments

379
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,170
所以我根本不需要塗口紅
in my lips and so I really don't need it.

380
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,490
-太噁心了  -索菲
- Vomitory - Sophie!

381
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,590
-真難為情  -別老跟個孩子似的好嗎
- It's embarrassing. - Just grow up! All right?

382
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,500
-別跟個孩子似的  -對
- Grow up? - Yeah

383
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,940
可是昨天媽媽還讓我 
Oh, because yesterday mum was saying

384
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
別像個小大人似的
how I shouldn't act beyond my years.

385
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,860
她確實被弄糊塗了  親愛的
No, it does leave her with mixed messages, darling.

386
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,920
因為咱們都想告訴她
Because we're trying to

387
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,430
如何過個快樂的童年
communicate to her how to enjoy childhood.

388
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,150
我只想讓她別再說噁心
I just want her to stop saying vomitory, all right?

389
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,830
這可不好笑
Oi, It's not funny.

390
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,740
漢娜  漢娜
So, Hanna. Hanna?

391
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,590
我很佩服你這麼小就獨自旅行
I'm quite impressed about you traveling around on your own.

392
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,790
我父親鼓勵我學會自立
My father encourages me to be independent.

393
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,180
真不錯
You see, that's wonderful.

394
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,130
我在你這年紀的時候也是個背包客
I was back packing at your age.

395
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,180
那你父親人呢
And where is he, your father?

396
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,740
我花了整整一個美妙的夏天環遊希臘
I spent a heavenly summer, just island hopping around Greece.

397
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,540
環遊希臘
Island hopping around Greece!

398
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,840
怎麼了  挺好的  真的
What? No. It's valuable.

399
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,190
不同的閱歷造就了不同的人  
Our experience makes us who we are.

400
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,330
對嗎  孩子們
Isn't that right, kids?

401
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,790
漢娜  你父母還在一起嗎
So Hanna, is your mum and dad still together?

402
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,170
我母親去世了
My mother is dead.

403
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,210
瞧你問的  老爸
Nice one, dad!

404
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
真替你難過  我母親也在我小時候就去世了
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young, so...

405
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,830
沒關係  很久以前的事了
It's all right. It happened a long time ago.

406
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,530
漢娜
Hanna,

407
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,000
你媽媽怎麼去世的
what did your mum die of?

408
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,610
三發子彈
Three bullets.

409
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,580
天吶  太可怕了
Oh my god, That's appalling!

410
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,590
聲音的組合
Combination of sounds

411
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,350
一種表達美
with a view to beauty of form

412
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,810
和思想感情的藝術
and expression of emotion..

413
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480
檢驗報告

414
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,850
異常
"Abnormal."

415
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,790
萬一下雨了呢
What happen if it rains?

416
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,230
那你就要淋濕了唄
Well, you going to get wet. Aren't you?

417
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,870
因為天窗被人打破了
Because someone broke the sunroof.

418
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,970
-你媽和我  -是你父母
- The thing is me and your mother are... - Your mother and I...

419
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,010
你媽和我  你父母
The thing is me and your mother, your mother and I

420
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,850
都是成年人  不像你們倆
are responsible adults... not as you two.

421
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,570
我的指甲又感染了
My fungus nail infection's back.

422
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,110
你是誰
Who are you?

423
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,810
你們找那個女孩幹什麼
What do you want from the girl?

424
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,730
我是她的舅舅
I am her uncle.

425
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,230
我們都很擔心她
We are very concerned about her.

426
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,220
我不知道你到底要找什麼
I don't know what you're looking for.

427
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,040
她來過  很友善  然後就離開了
She came, she was nice, she left.

428
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,020
說對了
Bingo!

429
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,160
可不是嘛
Voila!

430
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,250
車上的人已經結賬走了嗎
The van has checked out?

431
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,820
今天剛走
Today.

432
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,830
往北還是往南去了
North or south?

433
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,070
去渡口了  他們要坐渡輪去西班牙
The ferry. They caugh the ferry to Spain.

434
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,380
借你的筆用一下行嗎
Can you lend me your pen?

435
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,590
我已經聯繫了國際刑警
I've contacted Interpol.

436
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,680
誰給你的權利
On whose authority?

437
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,960
沃特  我們不能再隱瞞下去了
Walt. We can't keep this to ourselves anymore.

438
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,860
-你沒聽我說嗎  -他殺了兩個警察
- Were you not listening? - He killed two policemen.

439
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,960
情況變複雜了  我們已無法控制
He's reframed the situation. It is out of our control.

440
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,800
那就讓一切重回掌控之中  路易斯先生
Then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis.

441
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,270
除了我沒人能再見到埃塈J·海勒
I am the first and the last person Erik Heller will see.

442
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,420
懂了嗎
Are we clear?

443
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,480
你聽懂了嗎
Are we clear?

444
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,750
-路易斯先生  -遵命
- Mr. Lewis? - Yes, madam.

445
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,030
巫婆死了

446
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,790
天吶  你怎麼在這
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?

447
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,930
天窗是你打破的吧
The sunroof, was it you?

448
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,990
我是不是不該這麼做
Would it be very bad if it was?

449
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,390
也就是說你一直都在我們的車上
You mean you were in the van, the whole time?

450
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,410
要是我爸知道了一定會犯心臟病的
My dad would have a heart attack if he found out.

451
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,440
-你會告訴他嗎  -漢娜  你瘋了嗎
- Will you have to tell him? - Hanna, you are so mental!

452
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,450
我當然不會告訴他
Of course I'm not going to tell him.

453
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,440
我覺得你很厲害
I think it's brilliant.

454
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,410
-那你有地方待嗎  -沒有
- Have you got anywhere to stay? - No.

455
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,370
現在有了  你可以跟我待在一起
Yes, you do. You're staying with me.

456
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,580
可以嗎
I am?

457
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,740
當然可以
Yeah, obviously.

458
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,880
我可以把你藏起來  但你得答應我一個條件
I'm sneaking you in, on one condition.

459
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,090
什麼條件
What?

460
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,000
那些西班牙男孩  帥極了
These boys. Spanish. Gorgeous.

461
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,500
不  別回頭  他們像球員一樣皮膚健康
No, don't look. Don't go all pruny about it, like footballers.

462
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,550
也沒有修眉什麼的
Haven't got their eyebrows waxed, or anything!

463
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,980
-好  -總之我們今晚要出去玩  你也來
- Good. - Anyway, we're going out tonight and you have to come.

464
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,440
-好吧  -天吶  你真好說話  瘋丫頭
- All right. -God, you're not hard to convince! Perv.

465
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,850
什麼
Who?

466
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,440
你有什麼衣服穿嗎
Have you got anything to wear?

467
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,170
你可不能穿這個  看起來像個德國瘋子
You can't wear those, you look like some mad German.

468
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,100
害怕嗎
Are you scared?

469
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,810
有什麼可怕的
Of what?

470
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,300
我們現在要接吻嗎
Are we going to kiss now?

471
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,300
你願意嗎
Would you like to?

472
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,440
接吻會帶動34塊面部肌肉
Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles

473
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,780
以及112塊肢體肌肉
and 112 postural muscles.

474
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,470
而其中起主導作用的是
The most important muscle involved

475
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,340
口輪匝肌
is the orbicularis oris muscle,

476
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,680
因為要靠它來噘起嘴唇
because it is used to pucker the lips.

477
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,910
漢娜  你這個瘋子
Hanna, you mentalist!

478
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,280
跟你朋友說  我就是想吻她一下
Please tell your friend I wanted just a kiss.

479
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,870
漢娜
Hanna!

480
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,180
-我該放開他嗎  -不然你以為呢
- Should I let him go? - As opposed to what?

481
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,120
當然  快放開他
Yes, you should let him go!

482
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,770
我要走了
I'm going to go now.

483
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,080
好
Okay.

484
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,750
今晚很美好
It was nice.

485
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,730
是你嗎  索菲
Sophie, is that you?

486
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,790
是睡魔來了
It is the sandman.

487
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,200
繼續睡吧
Go to sleep.

488
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,650
天吶  你跟個土匪似的  真丟人
Oh, my god. You acted like a bandit. It's embarrassing.

489
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,960
-我怎麼了  -我真服你了
- Like what? - Oh, I can't believe you.

490
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,720
喂  媽媽
Hello, mama.

491
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,900
我知道你對我很失望
I know you're disappointed in me.

492
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,260
我懂  抱歉  媽媽
I know it. I am very sorry, Mama.

493
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,280
但是  我也許找到了一個好辦法
But... But maybe I've found a way to make it better.

494
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,240
我參與了一個項目
I'm in a programme now.

495
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,070
一個讓嬰兒更強壯的項目
A programme to make babies stronger.

496
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,540
是個美國的項目  很科...
It's an American programme, very scien...

497
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,170
你是怎麼進來的  維格拉女士
How did you get into my house, Mrs. Wiegler?

498
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,740
我是來找埃塈J的
I'm looking for Erik.

499
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,840
他說你已經死了
He said you were dead.

500
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,620
也就是說你見過他
So you've seen him?

501
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,060
他只捎過口信
He sent word.

502
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,030
漢娜在哪兒
Where is Hanna?

503
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,630
你沒有過孩子吧
Did you ever have children of your own?

504
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,120
我有其他重要的事做
I made certain choices.

505
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,410
那你永遠也無法體會 
Then you will never understand

506
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,880
失去孩子的痛苦
what it is like to lose your child,

507
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,570
以及發生的一切
to not know what happened.

508
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,150
年復一年的漫長等待
The years of waiting,

509
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,190
無數次向窗外望去
of watching from the window.

510
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,710
靜靜地等待
And waiting...

511
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,300
等待

01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,000
萊比錫城  我住在那

如果我們是朋友的話

520
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,730
就應該坦誠相待

521

I mean, you're a freak and everything, but I like you.

有些人想要傷害我

不知道
I don't know.

537
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,710
我都不知道你到底是誰
I mean I don't really know who you are, do I?

538
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,450
本該如此
That's just it.

539
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,300
我都不瞭解自己

544
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,350
你接下來要幹什麼呢
What are you going to do?

545
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:28,390
我要去柏林

From Grimms fairy tales?

548
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,160
沒錯
That's right.

549
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,890
既然你這麼說
If you say so.

550
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,970
我又說錯話了嗎
Did I say the wrong thing again?

551
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,120
這個給你

552
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,070

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,050
你看上去糟透了  要不要喝點茶
Wow, you look rough! Do want some tea?

557
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,600
我喝過了  誰是漢娜
I had some. Who's Hanna?

558
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,500
在摩洛哥跟我們一起吃飯的女孩
The girl we ate dinner with in Morocco.

559
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,040

She's here, or was. She came out with me last night.

560
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
她怎麼來的  跟她父親一起嗎
How did she get here? Is she with her father?

561
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,760
不是  她自己來的
No, she came on her own.

562
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,600
什麼
What?

563
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,030
人們有自己教育孩子的方式
Look, other people have their own style of parenting.

564
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,390
他提倡獨立性
He's promoting independence.

565
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,460
她像個孤兒一樣  是我太保守了吧
She's like an orphan! Call me conservative.

566
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,820
-你真的很保守嗎  親愛的  -我才不是
- Are you really conservative, darling? - No, I'm not.

567
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,500
我說我們可以順路帶她去里昂
I said we'll give her a lift to Lyon.

568
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,960
我們下一站是去里昂吧
We are going to Lyon, aren't we?

569
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,150
我找到了早餐
I found breakfast.

570
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,610
好噁心啊
That's gross!

571
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,110
我們發現他了  我們發現海勒了
We've got him! We have Heller.

572
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,840
聽到了嗎  帶他去見維格拉  
Do you read me? Bring him to Wiegler.

573
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,720
她會安排審問
She will id an interview.

574
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,960
她是那樣說的嗎  
Is that what she said?

575
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,860
兩分鐘前剛確認過
Confirmed with her two minutes ago.

576
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,320
瑪麗莎  靠
Marissa, damn it!

577
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,950
在鄉下我覺得很踏實
I feel so grounded in the countryside.

578
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,390
城市讓我窒息
The city stifles me,

579
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,660
壓抑著我的情緒  創造力和精神
emotionally, creatively, spiritually.

580
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,110
這樣的地方讓我們更接近上帝
Places like this bring us closer to God.

581
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,330
上帝
God?

582
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,810
不是很現代的感覺
Well, not any modernistic sense.

583
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470
佛祖  克利須那  我們的上帝
Buddha, Krishna, the God within.

584
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470
克利須那是印度教的神祇

585
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,530
無論你信仰什麼
Whatever you believe in.

586
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,680
你有信仰嗎  漢娜
What do you believe in, Hanna?

587
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,190
沒有
Nothing.

588
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,250
你沒事吧
Everything alright?

589
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,660
我想是的
I think so.

590
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,000
我不知道孩子是不是能聽到我說話
I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear me,

591
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,220
但在夜晚我能感受到她
but at night I feel her.

592
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,230
我希望她能聽到我說話
I hope she hears me.

593
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,910
你也曾有這樣的感覺嗎  媽媽
Was it like this for you, mama?

594
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,960
我想我知道她的樣子
I think I know what she looks like.

595
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,610
當我閉上眼睛就能看到她
I can see her when I close my eyes.

596
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,820
我能聽到她在我身體  胎動
I can hear her inside me. Movings.

597
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,000
我是不是很傻  我想應該是個女孩
Do you think is that silly? Oh, I think it's a girl.

598
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,070
希望是
I hope so.

599
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,610
埃塈J
Erik ...

600
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,200
怎麼了
What?

601
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,130
老天  路易斯
Oh for Christ's sake, Lewis.

602
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,600
你好  瑪麗莎
Hello, Marissa.

603
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,670
我聽說你死了
I heard you were dead.

604
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,540
是你女兒告訴你的嗎
Did your little girl tell you that?

605
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,060
-你在聽什麼  -自救
- What are you listening to? - Self help.

606
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,780
你需要幫助嗎
Are you in need of help?

607
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,760
很高興聽你說話
It's good to hear you.

608
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,160
路易斯  派技術組

609
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,700
沒想到我們還有機會說話
I didn't imagine we'd have the chance to talk.

610
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,320
你還沒抓到她吧  你沒那本事
You don't have her, do you? You're not that good.

611
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,720
埃塈J  你真會調情
Oh, Erik! You're such a flirt.

612
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,770
技術組馬上到  
Tech's on the way.

613
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,570
你曾是個出色的特工  埃塈J
You were a good agent, Erik.

614
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,840
看你現在這德行真讓人心疼
Sad to see you go dumb.

615
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,740
我錯過了什麼
What did I miss?

616
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,550
我不能再這樣做了
I couldn't do it anymore.

617
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,230
那些我們做過的事
The things we did.

618

約翰娜的事我很抱歉
I... I'm sorry with Johanna.

619
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,220
不止漢娜  還有所有那些人

620
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,300
為什麼現在回來
So, why come back now?

621
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:50,870
技術組的人
Tech guys.

622
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,180
我問你呢  埃塈J
I asked you a question, Erik?

623
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,320
埃塈J  你還在嗎
Erik, are you still there?

624
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,840
行動  出發 
Move. Get up.

625
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,110
靠  靠  靠
Shit ... shit ... shit ...

626
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,640
漢娜  我想我們迷路了
Hanna, I think we're lost.

627
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,590
-我得靠邊停下  -別這樣做
- I have to pull over. - No, don't.

628
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,870
看不清地圖
Can't see the map.

629
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,480
停下來了吧  我想撒尿
Have we stopped? I need to pee.

630
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,190
別走太遠哦  寶貝
Don't want you going too far right now, love.

631
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,180
我覺得你還是別動的好  索菲
I think you should stay where you are, Sophie.

632
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,480
怎麼了  漢娜
Hanna, what's going on?

633
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,640
穩住

01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,850
-我們到里昂了嗎  -還沒
- Are we are in Lyon? - No, we're not.

635
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,690
你想怎樣都行  就是別跟著我
Whatever you do, don't follow me!

636
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,820
答應我別跟著我
Promise not to follow me.

637

閉嘴  別說話

642
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,340
漢娜
Hanna.

643
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,660
太奇怪了  完全沒道理
Definitely odd. Disconnected.

644
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,990
我覺得我和孩子關係不錯
You know, I like to think that I have a rapport with kids.

645
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,020
我跟他們處得不錯
You know, I get with them.

646
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,740
先生  這種時候

647

我尤其痛恨我的工作

是啊  我懂

真的真的很難受
This is very, very difficult.

650
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,510
但有時候孩子們也不是好東西
But sometimes children are bad people too.

651
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:09,520
-別哭了  -我什麼都不會告訴你
- Stop crying. - I'm not telling you anything!

652
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,170
-你認識這個男孩嗎  -不認識

653
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,850
他認識你  你的朋友很危險

654
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,490
我什麼都不知道

-她撒謊了  -顯然

-說求你  -求你了

669

沒關係  我不會告訴任何人

不是給你用的  親愛的

但是我們其他人需要紙和電腦

706
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,920
這樣我們就不用

707
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,500
當面問人們的名字了

708

你長得很好看

你就是這樣走路的  親愛的

720
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,540

沒有魔術

722
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,340
沒有音樂
No music.

723
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,040
我會教你的

他知道的不多
He doesn't know much

730
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,090
或者他很會撒謊

他認識約翰娜
