8
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,630
五个人就容易成为目标 一个人则能躲开
Five men is a juicy opportunity. One man is a waste of ammo.

9
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,470
别让沙子堵塞枪口  小心行事
Keep the sand out of your weapons! Keep those actions clear!

10
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,980

走出去就死定了
This is all we've got between us and the Almighty.

25
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,860
这滩头的每一处都被瞄准了
Every inch of this beach has been pre-sighted.

26
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,840
留下来必死无疑

31
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,670

50
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,670
是原定的集合点 但却没有支援部队
Where we're supposed to be, but no one else is.

51
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,210
大家都走散了

67

D1缺口是在右边还是左边?
Dog One exit. It's the cut to the right, or was it left?

不  维尔维里在左边 这里才是D1缺口
No. Vierville is to the left. This is Dog One.

82
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:24,590
他们在痛宰我们 根本没有机会战斗  不公平
They're killing us and we don't have a fucking chance! That ain't fair!

83
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,070

97
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,040
放进去  继续
Come on, put it in. Keep it moving.

98
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,900

101
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,050
你不会死的  别看
You're not going to die. You're fine. Just don't look at it. Don't look at it!

102
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,950
用爆破筒来攻击  让开
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

103
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,600
准备爆破  准备爆破

105
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,530
准备爆破
Fire in the hole!

106
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,610
可以反攻了  找掩护 到沙坑的另一边
We're in business! Defilade! Other side of the hole!

107
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,690
给他吗啡
Give him some morphine.

108
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,760
行了  走吧
That's it, let's go.

109
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,770
检验过了  注射吗啡
Inspected, morphine.

110
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,360

优先处理
Priority.

112

他死了
He is gone

113
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,960
混蛋  过去
Son of a bitch! Get in there.

114
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,200
可恶  我动不了 梅利西  刺刀给我
-Fuck,I can't move!   -Mellish,give me your bayonet.

115
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,470
中士

Two MG-42s, two mortars. Add 20, left 30.

117
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,840
那有掩护物  若装甲车登陆后 会是最好的发射位置
There's defilade, but it's a good firing position if we can land the armour.

118
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,010
我们得打开这个缺口
We've got to get this draw open!

119
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,170
莱宾、梅利西  上吧 找到掩护就猛烈开火
-Reiben, Mellish! Let's get in the war!  -Take cover and put fire on that crew.

122
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,520
去吧
Go, go, go!

123
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,070
敌军的炮火很厉害
It's a goddam firing squad.

124
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
要逃出这里  只有这样
It's the only way we can get everybody out of here.

125
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,550
肖特、佩森、麦唐纳、帕克斯 你们是下一组!
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes! You're next!

126
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,150
何不干脆给我们眼罩 不就行了吗?
Why not just hand out blindfolds, Captain?

127
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,590
唯有出去拼命  开火
All we can do here is die! Covering fire!

128
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,160
快...
Go, go, go!

129
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,890
快点... 去你的
Come on, come on, come on! Go, God damm it!

130
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
杰克森 是
-Jackson.  -Sir.

131
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,110
看见那弹坑吗? 在那里应能躲开机枪的攻击
See that impact crater? should give you defilade from the machine gun position.

132
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,380
躲进去好好表现枪法 等我的命令
Get in there and give me some fire discipline. Wait for my command.

133
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,860
去吧
Go!

134
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,610
若你妈看见你这样 会很担忧的
If your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset.

135
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,510
我还以为你就是我妈呢
I thought you were my mother.

136
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,380
别远离我  天主
Be not Thou far from me, O Lord.

137
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,250
主啊  很抱歉我曾经激怒你
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee.

138
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,230

I'll give you "comrade", you son of a bitch!

151
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,090
小心  转过去
Look out! Turn around, turn around.

152
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,300
去干掉他们
Flush them out!

153
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,350

Send in the dozers. I'm waiting here to tie in my flanks.

157
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,030
什么?
What?

158
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,370
什么? 抱歉  我听不懂你在说什么
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand what you're saying!

159
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,870
他说什么?
What did he say, what did he say?

160
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,050
我洗过手准备吃饭了

And now it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

164
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,590

他们是兄弟
The three men're brothers,sir.

191
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,840
他们的妈妈会在下午 接到这三封电报
I just learned that this afternoon their mother's going to get all three telegrams.

192
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,220
在抢滩前一晚 他们的四弟跟随101空降师
There's also a fourth brother who parachuted in with 101st Airborne -

193
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,720
在诺曼第某处跳伞
the night before the invasion. He is somewhere in Normandy.

194
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,290
他还活着吗? 不知道
-Is he alive?   -We don't know.

195
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,130
跟我来
Come with me.

196
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,640
该死
Goddammit.

197
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,300
四兄弟都在第29师的 同一个连队服役
All four were in the same company in the 29th Division -

198
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,170
但苏利文兄弟在朱诺送命后 我们便分开了他们
but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau.

199
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,550
能联络上四弟詹姆斯吗?
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

200
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,090
不能  他空降在距纽维15哩的 内陆  深入了敌区
No. He was dropped 15 miles inland near Neuville, behind German lines.

201
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,350
根本无法知道他空降在哪里
Mac, there is no way you can know where he was dropped.

诺曼第有很多 被空投错误的部队
There are misdrops all over Normandy.

204
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,300
就算瑞恩能安然降落 也无法找到他
Assuming Private Ryan even survived the jump, he could be anywhere.

205
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,600
可能他早已阵亡
In fact, he's probably K.I.A.

206
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,300
老实说  若我们派出搜救部队
And frankly, if we go sending some sort of rescue mission, -

207
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,350
他们就得穿越德军固守区
flat-hatting throughout German reinforcements along our advance, -

208
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,450
那一定也会阵亡的
they're going to be K.I.A., too.

224
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,000
“因你们为自由 付出了重大的代价”
"upon the altar of freedom. Yours very sincerely and respectfully," -

225
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,420
“林肯敬上”
"Abraham Lincoln."

226
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,430
那孩子还活着 我们要派人去找他
That boy is alive. We are going to send somebody to find him.

227
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,630
然后带他远离战场
And we are going to get him the hell out of there.

228
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,950
奥哈马海滩 登陆后第三天

229
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,350
后勤官在海滩 寻找被炸毁的碉堡
The Quartermaster's up the beach a way. Look for a blown-up bunker.

-Miller,Charlie Company.  -Go on in,Captain.

231
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,000

If we don't off-load the Shermans by 0600 -

232
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,070
一整师的部队 就会被困在卡伦坦
we'll have a division stuck at Carentan with its pants around its ankles.

233
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,550
再说明一下
Well, you let me know of it.

234
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,010
让C连死守维尔维里 直到装甲兵开到
Let Charlie Company hold at Vierville 'til we can get the armour there.

236
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,550
原本空降师该打开缺口的 但他们却投错地方
Airborne was supposed to win an open door for us, but misdropped, -

237
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,600
全都失散了  你的情况如何?
and scattered all their sticks into the wind. What's your situation?

238
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,850

They got four Shermans and some deuce-and-a-halves.

241

这两处的布雷区很大
These two minefields are actually one big one.

242
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,190
我们到了中心地带 发现地雷的密度很高
We went up the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed high-density field.

散片型地雷、A-200 连侦测器都无法找到
pot mines, A-200s, the little wooden bastard the detectors don't pick up.

245
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,750
这里埋了T43型大地雷 大概想炸我们的坦克
Here, they placed big mushrooms, Teller mine 43s, I guess for our tanks, -

246
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,240
从这里到村庄的边缘
from here right up to the edge of the village, right here.

247
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,470
已记下位置  通知了工兵
We marked them and called the engineers.

248
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,160
有遇上反抗吗? 没想像的那么强
-Resistance?  -We had higher support expectations.

249
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,710
有一连没配大炮的346步兵
There was a company without artillery. Wehrmacht. 346th Infantry.

250
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,040
由卡夫加帕指挥 我们俘虏了23人
Von Lucke Kampfgruppe. We ended up with 23 prisoners.

We turned them over to MPs from the 29th.

252
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,750
我军的伤亡呢?

253
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:07,980
伤亡人数是...35死  70人伤
Well, the figure is... We're 35 dead, times two wounded.

254
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,150
他们就是不肯放弃那些重炮
They just didn't want to give up those 88s.

255
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,960
任务很艰巨  所以才找你
It was a tough assignment. That was why you got it.

256
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,540

是上级直接交办的
It's straight from the top.

260
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,860
我希望你和我带一队人 到纽维去执行公关任务
I wish. You and I are taking a squad to Neuville on a PR mission.

261
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,120
由你带队吗?
Oh, are you leading a squad?

262
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,590
一位二等兵死了三兄弟 所以能回家
A private in the 101st lost three brothers and he's got a ticket home.

263
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,960
为何要去纽维呢? 他们觉得他在那里
-Why Neuville?  -They think he's there.

264
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,070
他是被错投的空降部队之一
Part of all those Airborne misdrops.

265
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,370
现在兵荒马乱 要找一名士兵很难
It won't be easy finding one soldier in the middle of this goddam war.

266
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,600
就像大海捞针般
Like finding a needle in a stack of needles.

267
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,300
那连上兄弟怎么办?
What about the company?

268
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,640
最好的跟我们 其他的加入B连
We take the pick of the litter, the rest goes to Baker.

269
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,910
天啊  他们夺走了你的连?
Jesus Christ! They took away your company?

270
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,220
部队是军方的  我们唯有遵命
It wasn't mine, it was the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

271
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,220
给我莱宾、杰克森、韦德 贝斯里和卡帕佐
Get me Reiben on BAR, Jackson, Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

272
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,450
贝斯里死了 那找梅利西
-Beasley's dead.  -Alright,Mellish then.

273
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,500
有人会法语吗? 据我所知没有
-Do have a guy who speaks French?    -Not that I know of.

274
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,930
塔尔博特呢? 今早死了
What about Talbot? This morning.

275
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,200
我要去找个翻译员
I'm going to try and dig up another interpreter.

276
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,430
到滩头的车辆调度场集合
Assemble at the battalion motor pool on the beach.

277
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,080
该怎么办? 听着  什么?
What are we going to do? Listen up. What?

278
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,050
我要用大块乳酪塞进你的屁股 好让你棺材盖国旗回家
Go home wrapped in the American flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass.

279
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,450
我以为你喜欢塞屁股的 什么?
I thought you liked it in the ass. What?

280
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,050
立正
Attention!

281
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,850
稍息  我要找提摩西厄本下士
As you were. I'm looking for Corporal Timothy Upham.

282
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,050
是  我就是厄本
Yes, I'm Upham.

283
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,420
你会说法语和德语? 是  长官
-Do you speak French and German?    -Yes, sir.

284
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,620
有没有口音? 法语有
-How's your accent?   -Slight one in French.

285
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,930
但德语很纯正 很好
-My German's clean.    -Very good.

286
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,830
你已被派给我了 收拾行囊  我们要到纽维去
You've been re-assigned to me. Grab your gear, we're going to Neuville.

287
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,480
这是何时更新的? 早上八点半
-When was this updated?    -As of 8:30 this morning.

288
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,870
这是12SS坦克部队 还有两队人向南推进
This is the 12th SS Panzer. These are the two axes advancing south.

289
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,070
纽维有德军 我知道  下士
There are Germans in Neuville. I understand, Corporal.

290
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,950
纽维有很多德军 有问题吗?
There are a lot of Germans in Neuville. You've got a problem with that?

291
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,650
我没作战过 只懂绘制地图和翻译
Please consider that I've never been in combat. I make maps and translate.

292
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,060
我需要会法语和德语的人
I need someone who speaks French and German.

293
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,360
原来的两位阵亡了 我从新兵训练后就没拿过枪
My two guys were killed. I haven't held a weapon since training.

294
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,000
基本训练时开过枪吧?
Did you fire the weapon in Basic training?

295
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,640
开过  长官 那去准备一下
-Yes, sir.   -Well, then get your gear.

296
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,210
长官  我能带...
Sir, may I bring...

297
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,640
能带打字机吗?
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

298
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,850
是  长官
Yes, sir.

299
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,320
谢谢你
Thank you very much.

300
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,620
那是纪念品吗? 不是
-Is that a souvenir?    -No, sir.

301
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,590
慢慢来
Take your time.

302
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,930
下士  凡事都有好的一面
You should look on the bright side of things, Corporal.

303
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,300
是 还有  这个也没有用
-Yes. -For one thing, you don't need those.

304
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,570
但你需要这个 对  要这个
-You'll need that.   -Yes. I'll need this, not that.

305
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,000
你好 干嘛?
Hey! Hey!

306
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,440
你是不是想找死?
You want your head blown off?

307
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,510
别再用你的爪子碰我 回去你的岗位
Don't touch me with those rat claws again. Get the fuck back in formation!

308
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,520
我只是想问你来自哪里
I was just wondering where you're from.

309
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,120
卡帕佐  对吧? 滚开  下士
-Caparzo,is it?  -Drop dead,Corporal.

310
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,520
知道了
Gotcha.

311
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,360
每次你向上尉敬礼 就会惹来德军袭击他
Every time you salute the Captain,you make him a target for the Germans.

312
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,470
对不起 帮帮忙  别那么做
-I'm sorry.  -Do us a favour.Don't do it.

313
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,300
尤其是 当我站在他旁边时  懂吗?
Especially when I'm standing next to him.Capisci?

314
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,600
懂了 下士  那是什么书?
-Capisco.  -Corporal,what's your book about?

315
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,100
当心你的枪 对不起
Watch your rifle. Sorry.

316
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,250
是关于行军时 发展手足之情的方法
It's about the brotherhood that develops between soldiers during war.

317
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,080
手足之情? 你懂什么是手足之情?
Brotherhood? What do you know about brotherhood?

318
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,310
要注意这砘
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

319
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,080
你何不去问上尉是哪里人呢?
Why don't you ask the Captain where he's from?

320
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,690
去问他  他什么都会告诉你的
Ask the Captain. He'll tell you everything you want to know about him.

321
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,130
解释给我听
Explain the maths of this to me.

322
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,270
八个人为何要 冒险救一个人呢?
Where is the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?

323
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,400
20度  有人想回答吗?
20 degrees. Anybody wants to answer that?

324
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,700
莱宾  想想那可怜虫的妈妈吧
Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother.

325
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,030
医护兵  我也有妈妈
Hey, Doc, I've got a mother.

326
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,570
你有妈妈  中士也有妈妈
You've got a mother, Sarge has got a mother.

327
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,270
我敢说上尉也有妈妈
Shit, I bet even the Captain's got a mother.

328
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,250
也许上尉没有  但我们全都有
Maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us.

329
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,750
“不问原因  只求为国牺牲”
"Their's is not to reason why their's is but to do and die"

330
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,250
下士  那是什么鬼意思?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Corporal?

331
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,790
我们都该死吗?
We're all supposed to die?

332
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,660
厄本说的是我们的职责 是  长官
-Upham's talking about our duty.  -Yes, sir.

333
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,890
我们全都得服从命令
We all have orders to follow.

334
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,200
是的  长官  谢谢 就算任务是“苦差”?
Yes, sir. Thank you. Even if the mission is "FUBAR"?

335
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,900
这才更加要服从
Especially if the mission is "FUBAR".

336
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,310
“苦差”是什么? 是德语
-What's "FUBAR"?  -It's German.

337
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,640
没听过
Never heard of that...

338
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,980
长官  我对此有点意见
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

339
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,880
说出来听听吧
By all means, share it with the squad.

340
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,320
我的想法是
From my way of thinking, -

341
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,290
这次任务 浪费了宝贵的军事资源
this mission is a misallocation of valuable military resources.

342
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,330
是吗?继续
Yeah? Go on.

343
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,130
我觉得上帝赐给我打仗的天分
It seems to me that God gave me a sepcial gift made me a fine instrument of warfare.

344
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,170
莱宾  听好  这样抱怨才对 继续  杰克森
Reiben,pay attention.Now, this is the way to gripe.Continue,Jackson.

345
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,810
要是他派我这个狙击手
If He was to put me and this sniper rifle anywhere up to and including -

346
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,210
到希特勒一哩范围内
one mile of Adolf Hitler with a clear line of sight, sir...

347
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,650
大家就能收拾行囊回家 战争就结束了  阿们
Pack your bags, fellas, the war is over. Amen.

348
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,080
乡巴佬  这主意不错
That's brilliant, bumpkin.

349
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,120
上尉  你呢?你不会抱怨吗?
What about you, Captain? You don't gripe at all?

350
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,590
我是上尉  身负重任 不会向你抱怨
I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.

351
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,590
上级永远是发牢骚的对象
Gripe always go up.

352
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,600
你向我发牢骚 我向我上级发牢骚  如此类推
You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers, and so on.

353
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,670
我不会在你面前发牢骚 你是突击队员  应该明白
I don't gripe in front of you. You should know that as a Ranger.

354
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,540
对不起  就当你不是上尉 或我是少校吧
I'm sorry, but let's say that you weren't a captain or that I was a major.

355
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,480
你会说什么?
What would you say?

356
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,580
那样我就会说 这项任务棒极了
In that case, I'd say, "This is an excellent mission" -

357
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,220
意义重大  值得我全力以赴
"with a valuable objective worthy of my best efforts."

358
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,990
而且我对瑞恩的母亲 感到深切的悲痛
"Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private Ryan" -

359
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,460
为了慰藉她 我愿意赔上我与部下的性命
"and I'll lay down my life and those of my men, especially yours, Reiben," -

360
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,160
尤其是你  莱宾
'to ease her suffering."

361
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,900
他很棒 我喜欢他
He's good. I love him.

362
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,150
算了
Fine!

363
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,520
打雷! 闪电!
-Thunder!  -Flash!

364
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,530
厄本  到那边去 莱宾  你们四个过去
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

365
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,310
去吧!
Go, go, go, go!

366
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,820
很高兴看见你 希尔中士  救星来了
You are a sight for sore eyes. Sergeant Hill, our reliefs showed up.

367
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,120
有多少人? 八个  但不是救兵
-How many are you?   -Eight. We're not your relief.

368
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,590
为什么? 我们来找二等兵瑞恩
What do you mean, sir? We're here for a Private Ryan.

369
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,230
谁? 瑞恩?为什么?
Who? Ryan? What for?

370
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,730
他在这里吗? 大概在镇的另一边
-Is he here?  -Maybe on the other side of the town.

371
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,430
周围都有德军  很难通过
It's hard to get to. The Germans punched a hole in our centre.

372
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,570
我军给德军切断 他叫什么名字?
-They cut us right in two.  -What's his name,again?

373
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,870
瑞恩  詹姆斯瑞恩 隶属101空降师
Ryan, James Ryan. He dropped in with the 101st.

374
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,100
高德曼  找传令兵来 传令兵
Goldman, get me a runner! Runner!

375
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,210
来吧
Come on!

376
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,320
琼斯  让开
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

377
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,920
我们为东面的炮火所阻
We got stopped by fire from the eastward.

378
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,750
德军聚集了两个团的兵力
The Germans have been reinforcing two regiments all day.

379
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,020
已经有四十五分钟没有动静
It's been quiet for 45 minutes.

380
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,670
德军正把火力集中于西面
The Germans concentrate their fire westward.

381
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,170
谁在广播? 达伍德迪撒多夫
Who's that on the loudspeaker? Dagwood Duesseldorf.

382
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:50,870
友善的政战官
Our friendly neighbourhood morale officer.

383
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,340
“自由神像完蛋了”
"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."

384
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,910
想扰乱我们军心
That's disconcerting.

385
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,620
笨蛋  你爹的包皮已给割掉了
Your father was circumcised by my rabbi, you prick!

386
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,480
躲好
Cover!

387
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,100
去吧
Go!

388
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,960
去你的臭混蛋 伏下
You sadistic fucking animals! Get down.

389
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,030
敌人知道我军通讯中断 所以针对传令兵
They know we're not in direct contact. They'll single out the runners.

390
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,790
为什么要射杀他们?
Why do they shoot them up?

391
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,560
不能留活口  以防军情外泄 我们也会这样做
As long as his lungs are working, he carries the message. We'd do the same.

392
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,300
不  我们不会 韦德  准备起程
No, we wouldn't! Wade! Get them ready to travel.

393
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,340
博伊德 来吧
Boyd! Come on!

394
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,210
再试一遍  设法通知 汉米尔上尉  我们正赶过去
Try again! Let Captain Hamill know we're coming.

395
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,680
纽维其他地方怎么样?
What's the rest of Neuville like?

396
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,680
接着会看到两层建筑物 有很多窗户
The next block's got two-storey buildings. A lot of windows.

397
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,950
有一广场可作藏身之用
There's a square with good cover.

398
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,560
带我去  中士  留在这里
Show me. Sarge, hold right here!

399
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,190
遵命
Yes, sir!

400
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,990
别在这里挨打  到里面躲避
Stay out of this enfilade and use the buildings.

401
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,140
到左边去  边走边开火 我们各派两人
Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot. Two of yours, two of mine.

402
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,830
黑斯亭斯、高德曼  到前面去
Hastings, Goldman! Up front!

403
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,640
莱宾、卡帕佐 通讯仍受敌军干扰
Reiben, Caparzo. They're still jamming us.

404
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,900
尽快到角落去  小心行事
Short runs, high and low at the corners. It's going to be tight.

405
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,480
准备进行近身战  去吧
Be prepared for close contact. Go.

406
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,150
厄本  跟霍瓦特中士待在一起
Upham! You stay with Sergeant Horvath.

407
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,380
上尉  我会像内裤般粘着他
Stay here! I'll wear him like underwear, Captain. You stay with me.

408
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,470
广场闸口在大楼的尽头
Past the end of the block are the gates of the square.

409
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,640
好 好的
Good. Alright.

410
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,740
莱宾  上尉从哪里来的?
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

411
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,680
猜中的话有奖 奖金三百块
If you figure it out, you'll get a prize. 300 bucks, last I heard.

412
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,370
大家下注  最少五块
The company's got a pool. Five bucks gets you in.

413
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,950
就在拐弯处  躲到闸门后面去
It's around this corner. Defilade right up to those gates.

414
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,800
一定有人知道他来自何方
Somebody must know where he's from.

415
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,970
我跟他一起那么久也毫无头绪
I've been with him since Casserene Pass. I don't have a clue.

416
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:37,010
我的足踝很痛 战事没结束已经要坐轮椅
My ankles are killing me. I'll need a wheelchair before the war is over.

417
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,470
老天  就跟老妇一样
That's it! Oh, my God! That ankle is like an old woman.

418
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,050
就像...老天
Like an old... Oh, God!

419
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,580
莱宾?你连他上哪所学校 也不知道?
Reiben. So you don't even know where he went to school?

420
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,020
他没念书 是军部用大兵尸体组装而成
He didn't go to school. They assembled him at OCS out of dead Gls.

421
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,560
我知道他的来历
Pay attention to detail. I know where he's from and what he did -

422
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,860
因为我看得仔细
because I pay attention to detail.

423
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:03,330
厄本  别信他的鬼话
Hey, Upham! Careful you don't step in the bullshit.

424
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,140
去吧 打雷
Do it. Thunder!

425
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,870
打雷  不然开火
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

426
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,070
梅利西、卡帕佐  过来
Mellish, Caparzo, come here!

427
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,720
叫他们表明身分
Tell them to show themselves.

428
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,300
问问德军在哪里
Ask them where the Germans are.

429
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,010
他说什么? 孩子
What is he saying? Something about the children.

430
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,370
孩子? 他想我们带走孩子
Kids? He wants us to take them.

431
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,310
不行  不能带走孩子
No, no. We can't take the kids.

432
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:58,010
不可以  不行
We can't take the kids! No, no!

433
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,190
他们以为这样较安全 跟着我们不会安全
They think they'll be safe. They won't be safe with us!

434
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,160
你疯了?听从上尉的命令
Are you nuts? Listen to the Captain!

435
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,670
他们以为孩子会安全一点
They think they'll be safe with us.

436
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:15,310
什么地方也不会安全 卡帕佐  交回孩子
It's not safe anywhere. Caparzo! Put that kid back!

437
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,010
卡帕佐  把孩子还给他们 请放心
Caparzo, put the girl back! It's OK, it's OK.

438
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,370
交回孩子
Give that kid back!

439
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,280
厄本  怎么说请放心? 他让我想起外甥女
Upham, how do you say, "It's OK?" I can't. She reminds me of my niece.

440
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,420
把孩子交回去
Get the kid back up there!

441
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,020
最少也该把她带到下个市镇
We should at least take her to the next town.

442
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,320
我们有任务在身 不是来救孩子
We're not here to do that, we're here to follow orders!

443
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,660
中士  把孩子接过来
Sarge, take this goddam kid!

444
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,530
躲好
Cover, cover!

445
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,240
糟糕
No!

446
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,340
可恶  哪里射过来的?
Goddammit! Where did that come from?

447
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,110
听到枪声前他已倒地
He was on the ground before we heard the shot.

448
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,360
是我就会到那里
That's where I'd be.

449
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,090
我看不到 450码外  也许在阴暗处
I didn't see it. 450 yards, maybe a shade under.

450
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,060
大家别冒险出去 那枪手很厉害
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas. This sniper's got talent!

451
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:25,610
别哭  我带你找爸妈
Please don't cry. I'll take you back to Mama and Papa. Please don't cry.

452
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,110
来吧
Come on.

453
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,010
卡帕佐
Carpy!

454
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,400
上尉 撑着  卡帕佐
Captain! Hold on, Caparzo.

455
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,330
扶我起来  我走得动
Help me up. I can walk.

456
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,160
卡帕佐  别动
Caparzo, stay still!

457
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,910
两格  风向偏左
Two clicks. Left wind.

458
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,950
笨蛋
Fish!

459
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,860
上尉?看到他吗?他怎么了?
Captain, can you see him? How is he?

460
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,160
韦德  别乱来
Wade, you stay put.

461
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,530
上尉  他哪里中枪?
Where is he shot, Captain?

462
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,600
看得到他吗? 别出去
Can you see him? You stay there!

463
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,170
可恶  躺下来
Damn it! Stay down!

464
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,010
你怎么了?你中了枪 要我照顾吗?
What's the matter with you? Am I going to take care of you if you get hit?

465
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,050
笨蛋  过来
Fish, come over here!

466
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,840
卡帕佐  躺下来别动
Carpy, put your head down! Why can't you put your head down?

467
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,560
天主  我信靠你
Oh, my God, I trust in Thee.

468
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:59,570
别让我蒙羞  别让敌人战胜我
Let me not be ashamed. Let not my enemies triumph over me.

469
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,050
抄下来  替我寄出去
Copy it. Copy it and send it for me.

470
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,810
放下来  你自己寄
You're going to send it yourself. Put it down!

471
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,990
信沾了血 我知道
-It's got blood on it!   -I see it.

472
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:27,490
给我爸的  沾了血  笨蛋
It's... It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

473
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,260
打中了  伏下
We got him. Stay down.

474
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,540
伤得很重? 胸口中弹  或许肺给打中了
How bad is it? Chest, maybe lung shot.

475
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,220
把大炮放到街上
Get that.30 up the street!

476
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,560
报告情况 上面安全
Detail! Clear, up!

477
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,330
下面安全
Clear, down!

478
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,810
老早说过不能带孩子
That's why we can't take children.

479
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,630
霍瓦特中士  检查武器
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

480
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,320
厄本  把水壶装满
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

481
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,830
希尔中士 是的  长官
-Sergeant Hill.   -Yes, sir.

482
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,230
召集弟兄  在广场西北角集合
Gather your men. We'll form up at the northwest corner of the square.

483
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,000
杰克森 是
-Jackson.   -Sir!

Mellish. Check the tower, hustle back here. Right now, go!

485
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,590
去他的瑞恩
Fuck Ryan!

486
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,140
打雷 闪电  进来吧
Thunder! Flash! Come on in!

487
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,010
我们在找汉米尔上尉
Hey, guys. We're looking for Captain Hamill.

488
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,010
那边  过了广场就到 过了广场
Down there, across the square. Across the square.

489
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,380
提防狙击手
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

490
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,590
请坐
Sit down.

491
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,400
吉米  叫汉米尔上尉过来
Jimmy T. Go and find Captain Hamill. Bring him here.

492
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:29,570

-What? Up there?   -How should I know? Go and look!

493
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,540
谢谢你  智障
Thank you, you moron.

494
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:38,310
先在这里休息一下
Alright. You guys just flake out here for a while.

495
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,590
我要把石子倒出来
Let me get this goddam hitchhiker out of my boot.

496
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,570
放下武器 立刻放下
Put your weapons down! Drop them now!

497
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,440
我会开枪的

500
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,160
上面安全了
Clear, up!

501
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,740
可恶
Shit, shit!

502
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,240
上面安全了
Clear, up!

503
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,380
下面也安全了
Clear, down!

504
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,760
这样子够让人变老了
Enough to make you old.

505
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,330
但愿如此
Let's hope so.

506
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,280
101师前导部队的汉米尔 第二突击队的米勒

01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,680
我们在找二等兵瑞恩 他是你的属下
We're looking for a Private Ryan. He's part of your outfit.

509
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,910
有可能找到他吗?
Any chance that you policed him up?

510
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,460
路上的情况如何? 风光明媚  弹药快用光了
How was the road in? Scenic. We lost most of our ammo.

511
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,630
还死了一位队员
Not to mention one of our men.

512
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,100
中尉 把火箭筒调换到右边的路旁
Lieutenant! Redeploy that bazooka to the right side of the road.

513
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,530
去带瑞恩过来
And get Ryan up here!

514
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,260
瑞恩...到前面来
Ryan! Ryan! Front and centre! Ryan!

515
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,210
我们的大爷来了
Here comes our boy.

516
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,480
我早说他是个混蛋
I told you he was an asshole.

517
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,220
二等兵瑞恩报到 稍息
Private Ryan reporting as ordered. At ease.

518
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,200
第二突击队的米勒上尉 有话跟你说
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers, wants a word with you.

519
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,630
这边
This way.

520
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,070
蹲下吧
Alright. Take a knee.

521
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,450
二等兵  有个坏消息要告诉你
Private, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

522
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:33,320
这真是让人难以启齿...
Well, there isn't any really easy way to say this, so...

523
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,600
我就直说吧  你的兄弟死了
...so I'll just say it. Your brothers are dead.

524
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,520
我们奉命来找你
We have orders to come and get you...

525
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,760
你可以回家了
...because you're going home.

526
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,980
老天  我兄弟死了
Oh, my God! My brothers are dead!

527
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,770
我本想带他们去钓鱼的
I was going to take them fishing when we got home.

528
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,540
对不起  詹姆斯 真是不知该说什么
I'm so sorry, James. I can't tell you how much.

529
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:38,160
他们是怎样死的? 阵亡
-How did they die?   -They were killed in action.

530
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,350
没有可能
That can't be.

531
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,630
他们才在念中学
They can't be my brothers. They're still in grammar school.

532
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,030
你是詹姆斯瑞恩? 对
-You're James Ryan?   -Yeah.

533
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,340
爱阿华州的 詹姆斯法兰西斯瑞恩?
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

534
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,940
明尼苏达州的 詹姆斯腓德利克瑞恩
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

535
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,440
那表示我弟弟没事吗? 对  我确信他们很好
-Does that mean my brothers are OK?   -Yeah,I'm sure they're fine.

536
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,590
你确定? 我们找的不是这个瑞恩
Are you sure? We're looking for a different Ryan.

537
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,230
只是误会而已
It's just a big foul-up.

538
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,860
你怎么能确定? 怎么知道是不是又弄错了
How can you be sure? How do you know that the foul-up isn't -

539
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,050
原来是他的弟弟没事
that his brothers are OK, and...

540
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,320
中尉 麻烦你了
Lieutenant. I'm sorry for the trouble.

541
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:30,700
我在离开前才刚给他们写信 我得回家去了
I just wrote them a letter before I left. I've got to get home.

542
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:35,720
我要立刻回家  我想回家
I've got to get home right now. I want to go home.

543
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,750
我们的瑞恩在哪里呢? 不知道
Where is our Ryan? Don't know.

544
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,970
可以跟指挥官联络一下吗? 瑞恩隶属于什么单位?
Are you in touch with your CO? What unit's Ryan in?

545
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,150
506团的B连 那个断脚的砘锸506团的
Baker Company, 506th. The guy with the broken foot's in 506th.

546
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,820
我想是C连吧 你想?
-Charlie, I think.   -You think?

547
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,790
瑞恩?我不知道...老天
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

548
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:55,470
你们在哪里降落? 维尔维里
-Where was your dropzone?    -Vierville.

549
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,390
维尔维里?那怎会到这来的?
Vierville? How did you end up here?

550
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,690
问倒我了 C-47受到猛烈的攻击
You got me, sir. The C-47 took heavy fire.

551
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,390
机师拼命闪避炮火
Pilot went crazy turning every which way.

552
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:08,740
跳伞时炮火更猛 情况混乱  我就来了这里
We took more fire in the drop. It got messy. I ended up here.

553
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,040
我没见过我的队友 天晓得他们在哪里
I haven't seen a single guy from my stick. God knows where they are.

554
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,880
有B连的人谈到空降区在哪吗
Did anybody from Baker Company talk about where the dropzone was?

555
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,380
没有  但大家的集合点一样
No, but they had the same rallying point as us.

556
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,490
指出来
Show me.

557
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,850
我们累透了 再待三小时  入夜后出发
My men are beat. We'll hold up here for three hours and pull out after dark.

558
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,760
这镇上有三星级饭店什么的吗
Got anything left in this town, like a three-star hotel?

559
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,070
有干净的床单、枕头 和客房服务吗?
Something with clean sheets, soft pillows and room service?

560
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,670
舒适的教堂如何? 也好
-How about a nice, comfy church? -We'll take that.

561
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,700
有什么消息?战况如何?
What have you heard? How is it all falling together?

562
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,070
我们攻下了滩头堡 但蒙蒂却慢条斯理的进军康城
We got the beachhead secured,but Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

563
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,310
要他准备好我们才能撤军 大家高估他了
-We can't pull out'til he's ready,so...  -That guy's overrated.

564
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,010
我同意 要拿下康城才能攻取圣罗
-No argument here.  -You take Caen to take Saint-L8.

565
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,820
要攻取瓦隆尼先要拿下圣罗 瓦隆尼之后是瑟堡
-You gotta take St-L8 to take Valognes. -Valognes,you've got Cherbourg.

566
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,460
瑟堡之后是巴黎 最后是柏林
-Cherbourg,you've got Paris.  -Paris,you've got Berlin.

567
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,140
然后就能回家
And then that big boat home.

568
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,100
你在这里能帮到我很多 但我了解你的任务
I could really use you around here, but I understand what you're doing.

569
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,430
是吗? 我也有几个兄弟
-You do?  -I've got a couple of brothers myself.

570
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,770
原来是这样 祝你好运
Oh. Good luck.

571
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,470
谢谢 不  我是说真的
-Thank you.   -No, I mean it.

572
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,740
找他出来  带他回家
Find him. Get him home.

573
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,680
你的手怎么了?
What's with your hand?

574
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,260
不知道
I don't know.

575
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,440
在朴次茅斯上船后就是这样
It started in Portsmouth when we went down for embarkation.

576
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,260
偶尔会这样 你该找别的工作
-It comes and goes.  -You have to find yourself a new job.

577
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,100
这工作不适合你了
This one doesn't seem to agree with you any more.

578
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,710
干嘛?
What?

579
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,950
干嘛? 没什么
-What?   -Nothing.

580
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,890
在安济奥那小子叫什么名字?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio?

581
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,080
用手倒立走路那个
The one who walked on his hands -

582
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,060
唱着空中飞人之歌那个?
and was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze?

583
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,060
维驰奥 维驰奥
Vecchio. Vecchio!

584
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,440
不错  他是个笨蛋
Yeah, Vecchio. He was a goofy kid.

585
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,910
喜欢在别人的外套上尿出 一个“V”字  代表维驰奥
I remember he used to pee a "v" on everybody's jackets. For "vecchio".

586
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,050
代表胜利 维驰奥
For victory. Vecchio.

587
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,450
他长得很矮 是个侏儒吧?
He was so short. He was a midget, wasn't he?

588
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,460
那他怎么能当上突击队队员?
Yeah, how did he get to be a Ranger?

589
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,260
他的脚给打断了 所以用手走路
He got shot in the foot once, walking on his hands.

590
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,270
走得很快
He could walk faster on his hands.

591
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,340
跑得更加快
He could run faster on his hands.

592
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,770
维驰奥
Vecchio. Yeah.

593
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,750
卡帕佐
Caparzo.

594
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:15,190
每当一位弟兄死去
You see, when you end up killing one of your men, -

595
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,100
就要告诉自己  这样能拯救
you tell yourself it happened so you could save the lives of -

596
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,530
二、三、四或十条人命
two, three, or ten others.

597
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,210
甚至是一百人
Maybe 100 others.

598
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,810
你知道我当指挥时 有多少部下阵亡吗?
Do you know how many men I've lost under my command?

599
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,280
多少? 94个
-How many?  -94.

600
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:44,360
但那代表我救了 十倍那么多的人吗?
But that means I've saved the lives of ten times that many, doesn't it?

601
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:49,420
甚至是二十倍?
Maybe even 20, right? 20 times as many?

602
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,030
事情就是这么简单
And that's how simple it is.

603
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,400
就是这样把任务与属下之间
That's how you rationalise making the choice -

604
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,670
所做的选择合理化
between the mission and the men.

605
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,750
但这次任务正是救人
Except that this time the mission is a man.

606
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,050
这个瑞恩最好值得我们去救
This Ryan had better be worth it.

607
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:21,490
他回家后最好能行医救人
He'd better go home and cure some disease -

608
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,860
或发明长寿灯泡什么的
or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb or something.

609
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:30,500
我想十个瑞恩也抵不了 一个卡帕佐或维驰奥
For the truth is that I wouldn't trade ten Ryans for one Vecchio or Caparzo.

610
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,500
阿们
Amen.

611
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:38,100
你看  又来了 长官
Look, there it goes again. Sir.

612
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,170
还好吧?
Are you alright?

613
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:50,420
两小时后出发?小睡片刻吧
We'll move out in two hours. Why don't you get some sleep?

614
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:54,420
不知道他怎么能做到的 什么?
-I don't know how he does it.  -What's that?

615
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,150
如此熟睡  你看
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

616
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,330
他躺下就睡着了
The guy's lights-out the minute his head hits the pack.

617
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,870
因为问心无愧 有句话怎么说?
-Clear conscience.  -What's that saying?

618
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,370
神与我们同在 那谁与敌军同在?
God's on our side, who could be on theirs?

619
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,540
若神与我们同在 谁会是我们的对手?
"If God be for us, who could be against us?"

620
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,840
不错  我说了什么?
Yeah, what did I say?

621
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:16,210
想睡着的话  保持清醒就行了
The trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

622
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,080
为什么  韦德?
How is that, Wade?

623
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:23,190
我妈当实习医师时 习惯在夜间工作
When my mother was an intern she used to work through the night -

624
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,820
白天睡觉
and sleep through the day.

625
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,160
只有她回家  我们才能聊天
The only time we talked was when she'd get home.

626
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:36,290
我总会躺着  尽量保持清醒 但从没成功过
I used to lie in bed and stay awake as long as I could,but it never worked

627
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,800
越不想睡  就越快睡着
because the harder I tried the faster I'd fall asleep.

628
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,240
但在家里没关系 因为妈会回家
That wouldn't have mattered in my house.Ma would've come home,

629
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,580
把我弄醒  聊至天亮 聊天时她总是不嫌累
shook me awake,chatted me up 'til dawn.She was never too tired to talk.

630
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:53,050
也许她在那个时候 才有机会讲话
That's probably the only time she could get a word in.

631
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,420
有趣的是 有时她下班时间早了
Funny thing is,sometimes she would come home early

632
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,990
我会假装睡着
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

633
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,030
谁?你妈? 对
-Who, your mum?  -Yeah.

634
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,970
她会站在门口看着我
She'd stand in the doorway looking at me,

635
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,040
我就闭眼装睡
and I would just keep my eyes shut.

636
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,080
我知道她特地早些回来
And I knew that she just wanted to find out about my day,

637
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:29,780
跟我聊天  了解那天的生活
that she came home early just to talk to me.

638
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,690
但我却仍然不动 假装已经熟睡
And I still wouldn't move. I'd still pretend to be asleep.

639
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,140
我也不知道为何会那样做
I don't know why I did that.

640
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:03,090
只有几个钟头  闭嘴睡觉吧
We've only got a couple of hours. Shut up and go to sleep.

641
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,330
上尉?长官?
Captain? Sir?

642
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,560
下士

-You know Emerson, sir?   -I know some.

to suggest that we wait until it gets up to 1,000. I think it's...

要是活不了那么久呢?
What if we don't live that long?

660
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,280

In the meantime other guys keep showing up. One, two, six at a time.

然后有军官来把散兵凑成部队
Then some officer will come along, patch together a mixed unit, -

682
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,960
再次出发作战
and head off to make trouble.

683
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:11,370
我们在找101师 506B连的二等兵瑞恩
We're looking for a Private Ryan, Baker Company, 506th of the 101st.

You got me. A lot of guys come in and out.

689
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,790
手放头上
Hands over your head.

690
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,530
别停下来!
Keep moving!

691
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:45,130
我是犹太人
I'm Jude, you know.

692
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,570
无法把他弄出来  要有绞车
I couldn't pry him out of there. I need a winch.

693
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,370
是的
Yeah.

694

01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:08,420
有些天才提议 在机舱焊接钢板
Some genius had the great idea of welding steel plates onto our deck

697
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,990
以免地面的炮火伤及上将
to keep the General safe from ground fire,

698
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,330
但他们到空降前才告诉我们
but they forgot to tell me until just before we were getting airborne.

699
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,060
就像开货运列车飞行般?
That's like trying to fly a freight train. OK?

700
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,900
负荷过重  地面炮火又猛烈
Gross overload. Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

701
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,980
我为了保持平衡 手几乎都弄断了
I nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.

702
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,480
脱勾时我已经尽力了
When we released I cut as hard as I could,

703
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,980
尝试保持高度  以免失速
trying to gain some altitude and keep her from stalling.

704
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:39,060
最后像陨石一样掉下来 结果变成这样
We came down like a fucking meteor. And this is how we ended up.

705
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,890
其他飞机总算顺利着陆
The others stopped easy enough, though.

706
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,660
我们的飞机太重了
We were just too damn heavy, you know?

707
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:53,100
草地湿滑  而且是下坡
The grass was wet. Downward slope and all.

708
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,600
死了22人
22 guys dead.

709
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,850
全为了一个上将? 一个人
-All that for a general?  -One man.

710
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,850
这种事很多 “苦差”
There's a lot of that going around. "FUBAR."

“苦差” “苦差”
-"FUBAR."  -"FUBAR."

712
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:14,450
“苦差” 都说对了
"FUBAR."  -You all got that right.

713
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,360
我在德语字典中 查不到“苦差”
I looked it up in a German dictionary. "FUBAR"'s not there.

714
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,090
厄本  那边也有伞兵
Upham! There are more paratroopers out there.

715

你觉得有那小子吗? 有的话  我会找到的
-Do you think that little prick's in there?  -If he is,I'm going to find him.

722
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,990
我敢说那混蛋... 我打赌他还活着
I bet that son of a bitch... I've got money saying he's still alive.

723
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,000
赌十块我会先找到 来看这里有什么
0 bucks says I nail him first. Let's see what we've got in here.

724
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,070
你没希望了 你认为他在这里面吗?
You mugs don't stand a chance. Do you think he's in here?

那混蛋在哪里?
Where's this son of a bitch?

730

别混在一起  分开一点

莱宾  闭嘴好吗?
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben?

733

别吵架 你不高兴吗?
Everybody be friends. Cranky there, huh?

734
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:36,270
有优胜者了 你说什么?

一无所获 什么比三条大?
It means "nothing". What beats three of a kind?

739

我赢了  同花顺
I've got you beat. Straight flush.

742
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,370
你偷看我的牌  你作弊
You're looking at my cards. You're cheating.

743
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:07,510

Fucking unreal, this guy. Can you read that shit?

744

老天  你看这可怜的砘 大概不能防弹吧
Jesus, look at this poor bastard! I guess they're not bulletproof.

745

应该不能
I guess not.

746
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:18,480
这砘锩荒源 跟你的那里一样
I don't like what's between his ears.It's like what's between your legs.

747
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:22,090
对极了 杰克森  说得没错
We've got to give him that. That's not bad for you, Jackson.

好吧 放回去
Alright. Put them back in there.

751
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,180
他不在这里
He's not here.

752
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,160
也许我们该分头去找吧?
Maybe we should split into groups?

753
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,590
到树林里去叫他的名字
Just wander the woods calling his name.

754
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,530
他迟早会听到的  瑞恩

755
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,300
上尉  这也不是办法
That might be a little hard to do, Captain.

756
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:21,280
也许本地人见过他 瑞恩  詹姆斯瑞恩?
Maybe the locals have seen him. Ryan, James Ryan?

757
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,140

I think so. Bring him up.

762
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,440
你认识二等兵瑞恩? 你要大声一点

768
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:14,600
不  是詹姆斯法兰西斯瑞恩
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

769
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,890
给我纸笔
Give me a pencil. Something to write on.

770
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,590
快点  铅笔
Quick, a pencil!

771
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,740
小铅笔给你
Here you are, a small one.

772
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:29,610
写下来  詹姆斯法兰西斯瑞恩 爱阿华州?
Write this down: "James Francis Ryan? Iowa?"

773
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:33,620
你认识他吗?你自己看
"Do you know him?" Read the message! Look!

774
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:40,060
我当然认识他 知道他在哪里吗?
-Yeah, of course I know him.  -Does he know where he is?

775
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:47,400
我们偏离了降落区二十英里
Yeah, we missed our dropzone by about 20 miles

776
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,800
降落的地方好像是 布鲁维里什么的
and ended up way over by "Bumville" or some damn place.

777
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,060
我跟他和其他人 正要到了这里集合
Him, me and a couple of others were coming here to the rally point.

778
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:59,910
却遇到一位上校 正召集弟兄前往兰姆勒
We ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to Ramelle.

779
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:02,170
兰姆勒? 去防守一座桥
Ramelle? To babysit a bridge.

780
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,320
那是我最后一次看见他 好极了  谢谢
-That's the last I've seen of him.  -Great! Thank you!

781
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,610
写谢谢  你看  谢谢 不客气
-Write "Thank you". Read. Thank you.  -You're welcome!

782
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,550
大家过来
Assemble on me.

783
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,490
谢谢你  中尉
Thank you, Lieutenant.

784
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,130
兰姆勒
Ramelle.

785
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:25,570
我们在这里 兰姆勒在麦德里特河畔
We're here. There. Ramelle is on the Merderet River,right here.

786
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,860
在我们的西南方
Just to the southwest of us.

787
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:30,370
你知道那座桥吗?
You know anything about that bridge we just talk about?

788
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,980
知道  瑟堡一直是盟军的目标
Yeah. The target has always been Cherbourg.

789
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:40,310
要占领深水港  才能攻占巴黎 而隆美尔也知道
We can't push on Paris until we take a deep water port and Rommel knows that.

790
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:45,010
他会试着把装甲部队 运过麦德里特河
He's going to try to get his armour across the Merderet River anyway he can.

791
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:50,060
这样就能在我们 进攻瑟堡时夹击我们
That way he can hit us in the flank when we make the turn for Cherbourg.

792
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:56,000
所以有桥梁的村庄 都成了重要的据点
That makes any village on the river with a bridge solid gold real estate.

793
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,650
走吧
Let's go.

794
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,790
上尉
Captain.

795
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,870
那是什么?
What the hell is that?

796
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,050
废弃的雷达站
A radar site. It's got to be out of action.

797
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,180
下面的沙坑里有敌人
Looks like we've got something in that sandbag bunker under the station.

798
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:23,380
看到吗? 对  我也这么想
-See it?   -Yeah, that's my guess, too.

799
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:28,490
那是什么? 机枪  或许是MG-42
-What is it?    -Machine gun, probably MG-42.

800
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:32,560
那些人就是被它干掉的? 也许瑞恩也在里面
-Is that what got those guys?  -Maybe one of them is Ryan.

801
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,700
不  他们是82队的 你的运气才没那么好
No, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.

802
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:40,670
我不知道你们的脚程 但若我们悄悄地绕道
I don't know how fast you are, but if we detour this way quick and quiet,

803
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:42,570
德军就不会知道我们在这里
the Krauts will never even know we were here.

804
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:47,580
为何不绕道走?
What I'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?

805
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:51,510
我明白  但不能够这样
I hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.

806
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:56,610
我支持莱宾的说法 避开那些机枪就行了
I'm with Reiben. I mean, we left those 88s.

807
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,330
空军可不会专程来 对付一挺机枪
For the Air Force. They're not going to spend ordnance on one machine gun.

808
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:04,790
上尉
Captain.

809
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:10,930
绕路还是能达成任务 这并不是我们的任务  对吧?
We can skip it and still accomplish our mission. This isn't our mission, right?

810
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,330
梅利西  你想这样做吗?
Is that what you want to do, Mellish?

811
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:16,010
任由其他部队中伏?
Leave it here so they can ambush another company?

812
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:21,940
不  我只是说 这并非我们的目标
No, I'm simply saying it's seems an unnecessary risk given our objective.

813
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,580
我们的目标是打胜仗
Our objective is to win the war.

814
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:32,020
我有不安的预感
It's just that I don't have a good feeling about this one.

815
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,530
你何时有过好的预感了?
When was the last time you felt good about anything?

816
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:02,280
好吧  三个人冲前开火
Alright. Three runners with suppressing fire.

817
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,680
梅利西  你跑右边  我跑中间
Mellish. You hook to the right, I'll go up the middle.

818
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,820
谁跑左边?
Who's going left?

819
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,630
谁跑左边?
Who's going left?

820
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,470
我去
I'll do it.

821
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,040
我跑左边 好
-I go left.   -Alright.

822
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,610
厄本  跟杰克森对调 而你待在后面
Upham, switch off with Jackson and you linger in the rear.

823
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,120
我们向前猛攻  迫他换子弹
We advance and keep pressure on him 'til he has to change out his barrels.

824
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,890
然后就扔手榴弹
We should be able to hit them from grenade range.

825
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,990
也许我该跑中间? 你那种跑法?我想不必
-Maybe I should go up the middle?   -The way you run? I don't think so.

826
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:46,450
也许我该跑左边 也许你该闭嘴
-Maybe I should go left,sir.  -Maybe you should shut up!

827
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,530
莱宾  尽管开火
Reiben, base of fire.

828
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,470
把弹药带在身边
Mags and clips where you can reach them

829
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,410
负责主攻的多带些手榴弹
and extra grenades for the base runners.

830
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,320
山上安全了  干掉了四个 厄本
Hill's clear. Four down and dead! Upham!

831
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:35,130
收拾装备带上来 我们需要水和药物
Grab the gear and get up here! We need water and extra dressing.

832
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:40,130
从药包里把吗啡拿出来
Get the morphine out of the medical kit!

833
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,950
混蛋 撒上磺胺粉
Son of a bitch! Get some sulfa on there.

834
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,290
把我的腿抬高 行了
Move my legs up. I got them.

835
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,150
快倒磺胺粉 听我说
Pour sulfa. Listen to my voice.

836
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,520
你会没事的  医师
You're going to be alright, Doc.

837
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,290
没事的  很快就能上医疗船
You're fine. You're going on a hospital ship.

838
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,170
倒多一点 把腿抬起
More sulfa! Move my legs up.

839
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:10,200
把腿抬高 行了
Put my legs up. I've got them.

840
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,330
你会没事的 没事  医生
You're going to be OK. It's alright, Doc.

841
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,480
厄本  把水壶给我! 快
Upham, give me your canteen! Come on.

842
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,900
我们会带你离开的 压着伤口
We're going to get you out of here. Put some pressure on it.

843
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,270
我中弹了?伤势如何? 替他注射吗啡
Am I shot? How does it look? Give him some morphine.

844
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,470
伤势如何? 你会没事的
How does it look? You're going to be OK.

845
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,270
要注射吗啡了
Here comes the morphine.

846
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,990
被射中脊椎了吗?
Am I shot in the spine?

847
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:35,100
没事的 是不是射中脊椎?
You're OK. Am I shot in the spine?

848
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,280
抬起他 把他翻过去
Lift him up. Move him over.

849
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,150
压着伤口 轻点
Put some pressure on. Easy, easy.

850
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:46,930
没事的  医生
It's OK, Doc. It's alright.

851
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:51,130
韦德  子弹穿了出去 你背后有个弹孔
Wade, you've got an exit wound. It's in the small of your back.

852
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:54,780
那个洞有多大? 像橡果那么大
-How big is the hole?   -It's about the size of an acorn.

853
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:57,410
好了 放下他
It's fine. Put him back.

854
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:03,750
压住伤口
Put some pressure on it. Put some pressure on it.

855
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,550
压住伤口
Put some pressure on it!

856
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,520
用力一点
Put some more pressure on it.

857
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:13,320
哪里流血较多吗?
Is there anything bleeding worse than the others?

858
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:16,690
有  这里 知道在哪里吗?这里
Yeah, right here. Do you know what it is? Right here.

859
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:20,350
我把你的手放到上面 我们正压着伤口
I'll put your hand on it. We got some pressure on there.

860
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,410
就是这里
That's the one.

861
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,670
天啊  那是我的肝脏
Oh, my God! My liver! It's my liver!

862
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:30,110
教我们该怎么救你
Tell us what to do. Tell us how to fix you.

863
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,940
我们该怎么办?告诉我们
What can we do? Tell us what to do.

864
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:39,280
给我一点吗啡
I could use a little morphine.

865
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,610
多一点吗啡
More morphine, sir.

866
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:45,760
好
OK. OK.

867
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,260
如何? 给他吧
-Sir? What?   -Give it to him.

868
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:55,030
给他吧
Give it to him.

869
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:03,610
我不想死 韦德  我们正在注射
I don't want to die! Here you go, Wade. Here it comes.

870
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:10,220
再注射一剂
Give him another one.

871
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,520
妈...
Mama...

872
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,290
妈...
Mama.

873
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,130
我想回家...
I want to go home, I want go home.

874
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,870
妈...
Mama, Mama, Mama...

875
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:36,600
妈...
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama...

876
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:19,010
莱宾  抓住他
Reiben, hold him!

877
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,970
等一下
Not yet!

878
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:46,150
先叫他替韦德掘坟
First make him mark and cover Wade's body for Grave Detail.

879
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:50,910
也替那些伞兵掘坟
Same thing for the paratroopers down there.

880
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,650
拿走他的装备  查问他
Strip that stuff off him. Check him for intelligence.

881
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:57,820
问这混蛋  韦德是不是他杀的 快问
Ask this piece of shit if he shot Wade! Ask him!

882
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,490
有用吗? 有
-Does it matter?   -It does!

883
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:05,960
闭上你的脏嘴
Shut up with that filthy pig Latin.

884
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,810
杰克森  你中弹了吗?
Jackson, are you hit?

885
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:15,070
只是擦伤罢了
It just skinned the arm.

886
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,680
把伤口处理好 你跟中士留意周围
Get it cleaned and dressed. You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

887
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:26,910
他求我们别杀他 厄本  我不管他说什么
He says, "Please don't shoot." I don't care what he says, Upham.

888
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,120
长官?你要让他们杀他?
Sir? Sir, are you going to let them kill him?

889
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:36,460
这是不对的 那你去帮他埋尸体
This is not right, sir. You can help him with the bodies.

890
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,930
怎么了?
What is happening?

891
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:34,140
美国人
American.

892
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,250
我喜欢美国人
I like American.

893
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:46,150
轮船威里
Steamboat Willie.

894
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:50,730
轮船威里 轮船威里  美国人
Steamboat Willie. Steamboat Willie. American.

895
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:07,880
他说他还没完成 那是你的想法  来吧
He says he's not finished. That's what you think. Come on.

896
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,720
求求你  我喜欢美国人
Please! I like America!

897
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,930
美国什么都好
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

898
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:26,600
美国什么都有
Go fly a kite! Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

899
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:33,270
贝蒂小姐  好性感
Betty Boop! What a dish.

900
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:35,570
贝蒂嘉宝  腿很美
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

901
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,450
我说你看到吗?
I say can you see

902
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:48,590
我说你看到吗?
I say can you see

903
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:50,880
我说...
I say...

904
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,460
去你的希特勒
Fuck Hitler.

905
01:37:01,470 --> 01:37:03,460
去你的希特勒
Fuck Hitler!

906
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:16,410
长官  他说他替韦德难过...
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade. He says he's sorry about Wade.

907
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,250
上尉
Captain!

908
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:21,980
上尉  你也知道这样做不对的
Captain, this isn't right. You know this.

909
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:26,990
他是战俘  他已经投降了
He's a prisoner. He surrendered. He surrendered, sir!

910
01:37:37,410 --> 01:37:39,030
叫他...
Tell him...

911
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:46,210
朝那方向走一千步 然后脱掉蒙眼布
to march 1,000 paces in that direction.Then he can take off the blindfold.

912
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,080
向盟军自首
He turns himself in to the first Allied patrol.

913
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,880
你在说笑吗?放他走?
Are you kidding? We're letting him go?

914
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:54,780
莱宾  他是战俘 不能带着他走
He's a POW, Reiben. We can't take him with us.

915
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:59,590
我军自会处置他 算他命大
Our guys will pick him up. That was a close shave.

916
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,760
真幸运
Lucky Strikes.

917
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,800
带我去看球赛
Take me out to the ball game...

918
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,700
万一他被敌军救回 又会回来作战的
Only if he doesn't get picked up by his own and get thrown back into circulation.

919
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:19,150
上尉  你白白放过了敌人 简直白痴
Captain, you just let the enemy go. This is such bullshit.

920
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:23,180
没错 白痴?这是白痴?
You all got that right. Bullshit? This is bullshit?

921
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:25,950
难道可以射杀战俘? 这样是有违军法的
Shooting a prisoner is OK? It's against the rules!

922
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:30,560
军法跟你的新朋友一起走了
The goddam rules just walked off with your new friend.

923
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:35,430
上尉  这样做是对的吧?
But I guess that was the decent thing to do, Captain?

924
01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:45,540
收拾东西  出发吧
Get your gear. Let's go.

925
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,210
你们听到了  收拾东西
You heard him. Gear up.

926
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,540
上尉刚下了命令 对
The Captain just gave you an order. Yeah.

927
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,480
就像他下令攻下机枪台一样 真是大英雄
Like the one he gave to take this machine gun. That was a real doozy.

928
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:00,120
你太过分了
You're out of line!

929
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,290
他命令我们拿下这里真是英明
That was one hell of a call coming to take this nest,

930
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:06,430
但我们却因此丧失了一位队友
but what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.

931
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:09,890
瑞恩妈妈一定很高兴 知道她的小宝贝的性命
I hope Mama Ryan's really happy knowing that little Jimmy's life

932
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,460
比我们两位队友的还重要
was more important than two of our guys!

933
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:15,660
但我们还没找到他吧?
But then, we haven't found them, have we?

934
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,870
你... 别碰我
Hey... Get off me!

935
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:21,440
莱宾  起来
Reiben, get up.

936
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:26,080
拿起东西  入列
Gear up. Fall in.

937
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:33,220
我要退出这项任务
I'm done with this mission.

938
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:40,580
等等
Hey! Hey!

939
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,450
长官... 你不能背弃上尉
Sir... Don't you walk away from your captain!

940
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,890
莱宾  给我回来 不
-Reiben, get back in line!   -No, sir.

941
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,800
我宁可坐牢也不想继续了
I'll spend the rest of my life in the stockade rather than go on.

942
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,400
我不会再问你的了 上尉
I'm not going to ask you again. Captain!

943
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,010
白痴 入列
This is bullshit! Fall in!

944
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:57,440
你要因为瑞恩而杀我? 不  是因为我讨厌你
-Are you going to shoot me over Ryan?   -No, because I don't like you.

945
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:59,840
他想走  就让他走吧
If he wants to go, just let him go!

946
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:03,280
你不管吗? 上尉  你看到了吗?
Are you letting this happen? Captain! You see this?

947
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:06,420
上尉  瑞恩已经死了
Captain. Sir, Ryan's dead.

948
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:09,020
白痴 这里情况不妙
Bullshit! We have a situation here.

949
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,620
我有很强的第六感
I have a sixth sense. I know it in my bones.

950
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,490
你不杀德军却要杀我?
We didn't kill the Kraut. Now you're going to shoot me.

951
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,990
他比你好 下手吧
-He's better than you.  -Just do it!

952
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:21,600
打我的腿... 我要打你的大嘴巴
-Put one in my leg...  -I'll shoot you in your big mouth!

953
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,460
废话少说  开枪吧
Put your money where your mouth is and do it!

954
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:26,300
你总是那么多说话
You don't know how to shut up.

955
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:31,100
上尉  求求你 赌金有多少了?
-Captain, please!  -What's the pool on me up to?

956
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:34,610
你是个懦弱的混蛋 中士  我在等你开枪
-You are a coward son of a bitch!  -I'm waiting, Sarge.

957
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,880
赌金累积到有多少了?
What's the pool on me up to right now?

958
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:40,380
有多少了?
What's it up to?

959
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:43,420
三百块吗?
What is it? 300 dollars, is that it?

960
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,860
我是个老师
I'm a schoolteacher.

961
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:52,700
我教英文作文
I teach English Composition...

962
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,270
在宾夕法尼亚州一个叫 艾德里的小镇
in this little town called Addley, Pennsylvania.

963
01:40:55,470 --> 01:41:00,600
这十一年来我在 汤玛斯爱迪生高校任教
In the last 11 years, I've been at Thomas Alva Edison High School.

964
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:07,080
在春季我是棒球教练
I was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.

965
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,850
我真该死
I'll be doggone.

966
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:14,490
我在家乡告诉人家我的职业时
Back home, when I tell people what I do for a living

967
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,390
他们觉得“一看就知道”
they think, 'Well, that figures."

968
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:23,190
但到了这里
But over here, it's...

969
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:27,700
却成为了一个大秘密
a big, big mystery.

970
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:32,870
我想我变了一点
So, I guess I've changed some.

971
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,410
有时我想我改变了很多
Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much

972
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:41,670
回家后也许妻子会不认得我
my wife is even going to recognise me whenever I get back to her...

973
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:46,450
或许我不能向她...
and how I'll ever be able to...

974
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:51,590
诉说像今天这种事情
tell her about days like today.

975
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,990
瑞恩
Ryan...

976
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:00,690
我对瑞恩一无所知  我才不管
I don't know anything about Ryan. I don't care.

977
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:02,900
他跟我毫无关系 那只是个名字
He means nothing to me, it's just a name,

978
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:10,340
但要是到兰姆勒带他回家
but if going to Ramelle and finding him so he can go home,

979
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:14,350
能让我回到妻子身边
if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, then...

980
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:17,540
我会接下这项任务
...then that's my mission.

981
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:24,090
你想退出?你想去作战?
You want to leave? You want to go off and fight the war?

982
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:28,960
没关系
Alright.

983
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:36,090
我不会阻止你 我甚至会替你申请
Alright, I won't stop you. I'll even put in the paperwork.

984
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:41,110
我只知道每多杀一个人 我就离开我的家越远
I just know that with every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel.

985
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:10,830
昔日的回忆涌现
by memories of days gone by

986
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:17,600
孤独中你嘲弄我
In my solitude you taunt me

987
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:22,570
勾起不死的记忆
with memories that never die

988
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:27,610
我坐在椅上  满怀绝望
I sit in my chair filled with despair

989
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:32,780
比任何人都要哀伤
There's no one could be so sad

990
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:37,420
看着坐着的地方 尽是阴霾
With gloom everywhere I sit and I stare

991
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:42,120
我很快就会疯掉
I know that I'll soon go mad

992
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,430
有坦克  躲好
Half-track! Cover!

993
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:13,090
是谁开枪?
Who's doing the shooting? Who's doing the shooting?

994
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:36,020
准备行动  攻击左边
Get ready to move. Take their left flank!

995
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,450
慢着  提防有诈
Hold on and make sure they're down.

996
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:03,100
我们是101师  要出来了
101st! We're coming out!

997
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,020
装甲兵第二师
That was a recon. element, 2nd SS.

998
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:17,880
我们正在等待情报 一定是他们了
We've been expecting a probe. That must have been it.

999
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:23,090
第二突击队C连米勒上尉
Captain Miller, Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1000
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,390
501师E连汉德森下士
Corporal Henderson, Easy Company, 501st.

1001
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,430
506团第一队瑞恩 506团第三队托恩比
Ryan, First of 506th. Toynbee, Third of 506th.

1002
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:35,370
詹姆斯法兰西斯瑞恩? 对  你怎么会知道?
-James Francis Ryan?  -Yes,sir.How did you guess that?

1003
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:52,490
看来敌方攻势猛烈 对  是小组部队的进攻
-Looks like you got hit pretty hard.  -Yes,sir.Small unit action.

1004
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:59,230
他们的88公厘炮威力强劲
They came in and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1005
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:08,140
要是你们就是救兵 我可要投诉
Tell you what. If you're our relief, I'm going to file a complaint.

1006
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:10,810
我不会怪你
I wouldn't blame you.

1007
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:14,240
谁是你的指挥官?
Who's your CO?

1008
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:17,080
原本是简宁斯上尉
It would've been Captain Jennings.

1009
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:20,410
但现在唯有以下士充当指挥
I'm afraid the best we can muster up now is a corporal.

1010
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,830
那你们为何来这里?
So what are you guys all about?

1011
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:28,550
我们为他而来  瑞恩
We're here for him. Ryan.

1012
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,630
我?
Me, sir?

1013
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:42,810
你是爱阿华州的 詹姆斯法兰西斯瑞恩吧?
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1014
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:48,140
对  爱阿华州佩顿市 这是怎么回事?
Yes, sir. Peyton,Iowa, that's correct. What is this about?

1015
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,880
你兄长阵亡了
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1016
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:01,800
哪个?
Which ones?

1017
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:06,660
全部
All of them.

1018
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:17,300
真的?
On the level?

1019
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:22,010
恐怕是真的
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1020
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,220
大概要一段时间才能接受
You might want to take some time with this.

1021
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:28,720
要是你想到什么地方...
If there's someplace you want to go and...

1022
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,330
是怎么回事? 瑞恩的兄弟去世了
-What's this all about?  -Ryan lost his brothers.

1023
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,560
哪个? 全部
-Which one?  -All of them.

1024
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:54,580
你们专程跑来告诉我?
You came all the way out here to tell me that?

1025
01:48:56,950 --> 01:49:00,180
你要回家
You're going home.

1026
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:03,120
我们奉命带你回去
Our orders are to bring you back.

1027
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,820
带我回去?
Bring me back?

1028
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:15,200
下士  我并非想落井下石 但军令如山
Corporal,I don't mean to leave you more short-handed,but orders are orders.

1029
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,030
想跟什么人联络吗?
Any communications about when you will be relieved?

1030
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,170
我们也不知道南方的情况
We can't tell. We don't know what's happening south of us.

1031
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:24,740
但我的命令不许我擅离职守
My orders don't include me abandoning my post.

1032
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:27,570
一切以这道命令作准
I understand that, but this changes things.

1033
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,050
我不认同
I don't see that it does, sir.

1034
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:35,280
这是美军参谋长的命令
The Chief of Staff for the US Army says it does.

1035
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:37,690
我们奉命死守这座桥
Our orders are to hold this bridge at all costs.

1036
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:40,990
我方战机已经把麦德里特河的 所有桥梁炸断
Our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the Merderet,

1037
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,990
除了瓦隆尼和这里两处
with the exception of two: one at Valognes and this one.

1038
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,690
要是给德军拿下 我们就要退守
If the Germans take it, we'll have to displace.

1039
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:51,840
部队的任务是一回事 但你要离开了
Private.It's one thing that your outfit wants to stay,but your party's over here.

1040
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:53,940
援军到达前我不能离开
I can't leave before the reinforcements are here.

1041
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:56,540
三分钟内收拾行装
You've got three minutes to get your gear.

1042
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:00,480
那他们怎么办 混蛋
-What about them,there's barely...  -Hey,asshole!

1043
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:04,580
我们两位队友已经为你送命
Two of our guys already died trying to find you.

1044
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:13,030
真的? 不错
-Sir?  -That's right.

1045
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,940
他们叫什么名字? 艾文韦德和艾德林卡帕佐
-What were their names?  -Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1046
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:30,630
韦德和谁?
Wade and?

1047
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:33,680
卡帕佐
Caparzo.

1048
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:48,330
没有理由要这样
It doesn't make any sense.

1049
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:54,600
这样没道理 我何德何能  可以先走?
It doesn't make any sense, sir. Why do I deserve to go?

1050
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,670
为何不是他们? 他们也同样努力
Why not any of these guys? They all fought just as hard as me.

1051
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:05,740
你死后传讯员就要跟...
Is that what they're supposed to tell your mother

1052
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:09,010
你母亲这样说?
when they send her another folded American flag?

1053
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:19,520
跟她说你在这里找到我
Tell her that when you found me I was here,

1054
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:22,490
我要跟军中其他手足一起
and I was with the only brothers that I have left,

1055
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:26,780
我怎样也不会离弃他们
and that there was no way I was going to desert them.

1056
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,170
她应该会明白 我不会离开这座桥
I think she'll understand that. There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1057
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,280
现在怎么办?
What are your orders?

1058
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:23,080
中士  我们进入了 一个奇异的国度
Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here.

1059
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,850
一切都异乎寻常
Our world has taken a turn for the surreal.

1060
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:29,490
但问题始终要解决
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1061
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:33,560
我不知道  你觉得怎样?
I don't know. What do you think?

1062
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:36,260
你不会想知道
You don't want to know what I think.

1063
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,500
不  我想知道
No, Mike, I do.

1064
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:47,580
我其中一个想法是 如他所言  他何德何能?
Part of me thinks the kid's right. What's he done to deserve this?

1065
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:51,780
他既然想留下来 我们就干脆回去
If he wants to stay here, fine. Let's leave him and go home.

1066
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:54,650
不错
Yeah.

1067
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:59,990
但我还有一个想法 要是我们也留下来
But another part of me thinks, "What if by some miracle we stay

1068
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,960
会缔造什么奇迹呢?
and actually make it out of here?"

1069
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,070
有天我们回想此事
Some day we might look back on this and decide that

1070
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:11,750
也许会觉得在这场混帐战争中
saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we pulled out of

1071
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,770
拯救瑞恩是唯一的好事
this whole godawful, shitty mess.

1072
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:23,780
这是我的想法 上尉  如你所言
That's what I was thinking, sir. Like you said, Captain.

1073
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:30,440
我们会留下来 一起为团聚战斗
We do that, we all earn the right to go home.

1074
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,390
兄弟
Oh, brother...

1075
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:40,970
就只有这些
This is everything.

1076
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:47,300
0.230机枪、17枚手榴弹 11个霍金斯地雷
You've got the.230 calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1077
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:50,700
你有两支火箭筒 但只能发射八次
You've got two bazookas, but they've only got eight rounds left.

1078
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,040
还有各式小手枪
And assorted small arms.

1079
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:56,480
本来有0.60迫击炮  但已损毁
We had a.60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.

1080
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,300
敌军坦克压过来 吐口水攻击好了
Might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.

1081
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:04,120
敌军当然会动用坦克 你意下如何?
Which they're sure to do. What are you thinking, sir?

1082
01:54:04,330 --> 01:54:07,730
我提议进行夹击
I'm thinking I'm going to whip around the flanks.

1083
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:15,330
要把他们引到大街
Unless we can draw them up the main road between the buildings,

1084
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:19,020
用瓦砾造一个瓶颈
where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck

1085
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:21,430
让坦克无用武之地? 可以的话
-Disable him?   -If we can.

1086
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:25,270
造个六十吨的路障 然后展开夹击
Make a 60-tonne roadblock. Then we've got a fighting chance at her flanks.

1087
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:27,600
好  分散他们  别让他们集结
Good. Split them up, don't let them mass.

1088
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:30,680
然后逐一击破  再退回大桥
Hit them hard one-on-one, and fall back to the bridge.

1089
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:35,220
下面放一台机枪 另一台置于高处
Machine gun on the move down here, number two up high to piss on them.

1090
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,870
计划就是这样  杰克森
That would be the idea. Jackson!

1091
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:42,430
可以的话  我想你去钟楼
If we can, I'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1092
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:45,660
知道 我会给你安排帮手
Yes, sir. I'll give you some company.

1093
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:51,800
也好  还要0.30狙击枪 和一千发子弹
Some company couldn't hurt. A.30 with about a 1,000 rounds would be OK.

1094
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:53,970
帕克  有份优差
Parker, job opportunity.

1095
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:55,960
这主意不错
It's not the worst idea ever,

1096
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:59,840
但胜负关键在于 把坦克弄到街上让我们夹击
but everything depends on getting the tank down the road for us to knock out.

1097
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:03,380
你有什么主意?
How the hell do you plan on doing that?

1098
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:06,240
他说得对  空降师的队友刚说
He's right. As our colleague from Airborne pointed out

1099
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,710
我们有的是口水
what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.

1100
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:12,760
但把坦克引来后  如何应付?
How do we stop the tank if we get it to commit?

1101
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,430
先用兔子引它追赶
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1102
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:18,120
接着攻击坦克的履带
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1103
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:20,120
对  但用什么攻击?
Yeah, but with what?

1104
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,390
用粘附式炸弹 粘附式炸弹?
-We could try a sticky bomb.  -Sticky bomb, sir?

1105
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,760
你编出来的吧?
Sir, are you making that up?

1106
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:33,170
不  你可以去翻翻作战手册
No, it's in the field manual. Check it out, if you want to.

1107
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:37,510
手册不知道在那里 你尽管讲解一下
We seem to be out of field manuals. Perhaps you could enlighten us.

1108
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:40,950
有炸药吧?黄色炸药 还是B成分炸药?
You have some demolition, don't you? TNT or Composition B?

1109
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:45,340
很多  桥那里的B炸药 足以把桥炸断两次
Plenty. I've got that bridge wired with enough Composition B to blow it twice.

1110
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:47,040
那拿一点出来
You can spare some, then.

1111
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:54,190
塞满军装袜子
You take a standard GI sock, cram it full with Composition B,

1112
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:59,400
再加进导火线  表面涂满机油
and rig up a simple fuse. Then you coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1113
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,000
炸弹扔出  就能粘附于目标物
That way, when you throw it, it should stick.

1114
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,670
有粘力  所以叫粘附式炸弹
It's a bomb that sticks. It's a sticky bomb.

1115
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:09,810
有更好的方法  尽管说出来
Come up with a better way to knock the tracks off a tank, I'm all ears.

1116
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:13,530
这主意不错  大家要缴袜了
This is good. Now we have to surrender our socks!

1117
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:29,660
拉上去
Haul away.

1118
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:47,710
选择攻击范围 与钟楼组成交叉火力网
Select the field of fire. Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1119
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:49,850
我负责12到9
I can cover 12 to 9 from here.

1120
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:56,610
慢慢来 行了
Easy! I've got her!

1121
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,660
这是地雷
Here are the mines.

1122
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:45,810
要配置得当才行
For being the best we can do,

1123
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:50,870
前头的机枪位置不太好
that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position.

1124
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:54,980
应该放到这里
And this position right here...

1125
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:59,240
这是最后防线
This is the Alamo.

1126
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,820
要是退到这里 最后一个活人负责炸桥
They push us this far, the last man alive blows the bridge.

1127
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:05,890
导火线能烧三十秒  告诉大家
We've only got a 30-second delay on the fuse, so tell everyone

1128
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:10,720
点火后快逃  不然性命不保
that if you're last you'd better hurry or you'll not live long.

1129
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,530
上尉?我有什么任务?
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1130
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:20,100
留在我两英尺之内  不许有异议
Never more than two feet away from me. And that's not negotiable.

1131
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:24,540
跟我去拿弹药
I'm going to get some ammo. Come on.

1132
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,910
厄本  听着 是的
Hey, Upham, listen to me. Yes.

1133
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:32,480
你在听吗? 是的
-Are you listening?  -Yes.

1134
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:36,310
我们会不断东奔西跑
We're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches,

1135
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:41,050
你要运送弹药  随传随到 不然我们就死定
so you've got to be Johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo,or we're dead.

1136
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,690
你明白吗? 随传随到
-Do you understand?  -Johnny-on-the-spot.

1137
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:46,760
你没事吧? 没事
-Yeah. Are you alright?  -Yeah.

1138
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:51,190
我们从英国出发时 也会分发香烟
When we shipped out of England we got cigarettes

1139
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:54,170
我却说“谢谢  我不抽烟”
and I said, "No, thank you. I don't smoke."

1140
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:02,800
形势很凶险吧? 难以置信
-Quite a situation, huh?  -Unbelievable.

1141
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:08,820
这差事混帐得不得了
Yeah. "Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition", right?

1142
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:11,490
不错
You've got that right.

1143
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:16,620
“苦差” 对
-"FUBAR"!   -Alright!

1144
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:18,060
很痛
Ouch.

1145
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:22,360
这可不是玩的
Yeah, well... It's going to be a real show, huh?

1146
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:24,500
知道了
Yeah, OK.

1147
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:32,470
放轻松
Take it easy.

1148
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:35,040
“苦差”
"FUBAR."

1149
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:15,980
是谁的歌声?
Who's that singing, sir?

1150
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:18,150
艾迪斯皮雅福
Edith Piaf.

1151
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:22,920
她为何这么伤心?
What is she so upset about?

1152
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:28,260
情人离异 但他的面容历历在目
Her lover left her, but she still sees his face everywhere she goes.

1153
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:31,330
就是这样
That would do it.

1154
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:03,730
生命中就只有你
"Even life itself only represents you."

1155
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:09,130
梦着你拥我入怀
"Sometimes I dream that I'm in your arms."

1156
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:12,770
什么?她曾经唱过 是副歌
What was that? She sang it before. The chorus.

1157
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:14,710
副歌
The chorus.

1158
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:17,810
每当你耳语喃喃
"And you speak softly in my ear."

1159
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:24,480
都让我闭目静听
"And you say things that make my eyes close."

1160
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:28,620
感觉美妙
"And I find that marvellous."

1161
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:32,060
厄本
Again, Upham...

1162
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:37,500
老实说  你使我兴奋莫名
...to be honest, I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1163
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,190
棒极了
Marvellous.

1164
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:43,170
这首歌很哀伤  开始时她唱着
It's a really melancholy song. At the beginning of the song she says:

1165
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:49,180
你离去后  我就伤心绝望
"And then one day you left me and I've been desperate ever since."

1166
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:52,350
漫天满地  都是你的影子
"I see you all over the sky, I see you all over the earth."

1167
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:55,980
再听多几首这种歌 不用德军开枪
Any more songs like this, the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1168
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:58,850
我就割脉自杀了
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1169
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:01,490
厄本  你好奇怪
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1170
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:03,660
对不起  是艾迪斯
I'm sorry. It's Edith, you know.

1171
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:05,660
可知道这首歌让我想起什么?
You know what that song reminds me of?

1172
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:10,030
瑞雪太太在我出发前的一番话
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz and what she said when I left for Basic.

1173
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:12,670
她说“别碰我”?
What? "Don't touch me?"

1174
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,340
不  她是公寓管理员的妻子
No. She's our Super's wife.

1175
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:21,970
她到我妈的店买衣服 胸围有44EE
She comes into my mum's shop to try a few things. She's like a 44 Double E.

1176
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,840
不得了
Double E? They're massive.

1177
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:25,410
好大的奶奶
Those are big titties.

1178
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:29,580
我骗她穿42D的衣服 我们在更衣室里
I've got her convinced that she's a 42 D. So we're in the dressing room

1179
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:33,780
她尝试挤进那件丝带束腰
and she tries to get into this side-cut,silk-ribboned,triple-panel girdle

1180
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:36,360
还有神奇胸罩
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1181
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,890
很好看  都挤了出来
It's beautiful. She's pouring out of this thing.

1182
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,830
很紧吗? 不  很好看
-Is it tight?  -No, it's beautiful.

1183
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:45,160
她看得出我的小弟 像自由神像般又大又硬
She sees me and can tell I've got a hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1184
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:48,740
于是她叫我冷静
She says, "Richard, calm down", and she says,

1185
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:52,840
又说要是在战场上难过害怕
"Over there, if you see anything that upsets you, if you're scared,"

1186
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:59,450
就闭眼想想它们
"I want you to close your eyes and think of these, you understand?"

1187
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:02,170
我说我明白了
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1188
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:17,770
你没事吧?
Are you alright, sir?

1189
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,400
我在数拍子
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1190
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:29,510
你在老家真的是老师?
Is it true you were a teacher back home?

1191
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:33,440
对 我是当不上老师的了
-Yes.   -That's something I could never do.

1192
02:03:33,650 --> 02:03:37,780
我家兄弟都不听老师的话
Not with the way me and my brothers treated our teachers. No, sir!

1193
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,550
我教过上千个你这样的孩子
I had a thousand kids like you.

1194
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:53,070
我想不起哥哥的容貌
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1195
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:58,110
怎样努力也想不起来 你试过这样吗?
I've been trying and I can't see their faces at all. Has that happened to you?

1196
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,740
你要想想发生过的事
You've got to think of a context.

1197
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:04,870
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

1198
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,810
不能只想他们的样子 要想些具体事情
You don't just think about their faces, you think about something specific,

1199
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:11,350
你们的共同经历
something you've done together.

1200
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:17,860
我想家的时候  想得很具体
When I want to think of home, I think of something specific.

1201
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:21,860
我想起后院的吊床
I think of my hammock in the backyard, -

1202
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:27,440
或者是妻子戴起我的旧手套 修剪玫瑰花丛
or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.

1203
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:36,200
有一晚两个哥哥把我弄醒
This one night, two of my brothers woke me up in the middle of the night.

1204
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:41,280
说要给我惊喜
They said they had a surprise for me.

1205
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:44,650
他们带我到谷仓阁楼
They took me to the barn up into the loft

1206
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:48,760
原来大哥丹尼...
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1207
02:04:48,990 --> 02:04:51,980
跟爱莉丝贾汀在里面
with Alice Jardine!

1208
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:59,030
想像一下  那女孩从一株 丑陋的树上掉下来
Picture a girl who just took a nosedive from the ugly tree

1209
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:02,470
会让所有树枝都给压断
and hit every branch coming down!

1210
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:06,330
丹尼脱去她的衬衫
And Dan's got her shirt off...

1211
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:13,280
接着要把胸罩也脱下时 肖恩突然大叫
So he's trying to get her bra off and all of a sudden Sean screams out

1212
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:17,440
“丹尼  你年纪还小 不可以这样”
"Danny, you're a young man. Don't do it!"

1213
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:22,680
爱莉丝贾汀马上大叫 跳了起来
Alice Jardine hears this and she screams and jumps up

1214
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:26,330
想冲出去 但她的头给衬衫蒙着
and tries to run out, but she's got her shirt over her head.

1215
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:30,360
所以撞到墙壁  晕倒了
She runs into the wall and knocks herself out.

1216
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:34,470
丹尼很生气  追着我们
Now Dan is so mad at us. He starts coming after us,

1217
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:39,010
但爱莉丝晕倒了  他要弄醒她
but at the same time Alice is unconscious. He's got to wake her up.

1218
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:41,910
于是一手抓着她的腿猛拉
He grabs her by a leg and drags her

1219
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:45,450
一手拿着铲子追赶肖恩
and at the same time he picks up a shovel and goes after Sean!

1220
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:50,550
肖恩说“你干嘛打我? 我是在帮你”
And Sean says, 'Why are you trying to hit me? I just did you a favour!"

1221
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:55,320
丹尼更加生气  乱挥铲子
This makes Dan more angry. He tries to swing this thing.

1222
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:59,220
最后铲子脱手  打破了火油灯
He loses his shovel. It goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1223
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:05,030
爆炸着火  谷仓几乎给烧掉
The thing explodes. The whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.

1224
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:22,450
这就是最后一晚 丹第二天就上战场去
That was it, that was the last... Dan went off to Basic the next day.

1225
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:26,320
这是四兄弟最后一次共聚
That was the last night the four of us were together.

1226
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,550
已经过了两年
That was two years ago.

1227
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,720
天啊
Oh, my.

1228
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:38,530
再说说妻子和玫瑰花丛的事
Tell me about your wife and those rose bushes.

1229
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:43,640
不  那些事要留给自己
No. No, that one I save just for me.

1230
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:50,870
敌人从东面开来
Enemy from the east.

1231
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:57,100
两台虎式坦克  两辆装甲车
He sees two Tiger tanks, two Panzer tanks.

1232
02:07:57,350 --> 02:08:01,250
五十人以上的步兵队伍
Infantry. 50 plus change.

1233
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:13,120
分散  各就各位 莱宾  去当兔子
Disperse! You know what to do. Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1234
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:17,600
厄本  躲起来 梅利西、汉德森  准备开火
Upham, get some cover. Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1235
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,290
大家检查武器
Everybody check your ammo!

1236
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:25,200
莱宾  祝你好运 不用祝福  我生来幸运
-Good luck,Reiben!  -I don't need any luck,I was born lucky!

1237
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:41,590
拿着五枚曳光弹 知道  照亮两端
One in five tracer. Yes, and tracers point both ways.

1238
02:08:41,790 --> 02:08:45,060
去检查顶端的空间
Why don't you check the head space and she should run.

1239
02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:56,340
厄本  快点
Upham, hustle up!

1240
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:49,990
厄本下士  这里没有0.30机枪
Corporal Upham. We don't have a.30 calibre machine gun here.

1241
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:55,650
梅利西和钟楼的 杰克森才需要这个
Either Mister Mellish or Mr Jackson in the bell tower needs that.

1242
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:58,960
厄本  杰克森有子弹 去拿给梅利西
Upham! Jackson's fine, turn around to Mellish!

1243
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:24,220
有很多步兵  不知道会否上钓
There's a ton of infantry. I don't know if they took the bait, though.

1244
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:50,620
还有口香糖吗?
Have you got any more of that?

1245
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:38,660
装甲车没有上当
The Panzers didn't take the bait.

1246
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:46,440
步兵团正向左进发
The infantry's moving to the left.

1247
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:49,810
一辆装甲车跟二十人刚刚开过
A half-track just went by with about 20 troops.

1248
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:32,480
梅利西、汉德森  移位
Mellish, Henderson! Displace!

1249
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:57,510
点火
Do it, now! Light it up! You! Light it!

1250
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:13,190
右边有三十人  设法截停他们
30 infantry on the right flank. Get over there, find a hole and stop them!

1251
02:14:13,390 --> 02:14:15,860
移位
Displace!

1252
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,470
厄本
Upham!

1253
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:46,190
目标清除 去吧
Clear! OK, go!

1254
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:48,150
德国人
Krauts!

1255
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,990
向右边进攻
Right flank!

1256
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:30,530
伏下
Get down, get down!

1257
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:40,070
厄本  0.30子弹
Upham! Thirty cal, hurry!

1258
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:43,510
告诉上尉  左翼快失守
Find the Captain, this flank's going to fold!

1259
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,900
车子还在动
Traversing! He's still in this fight!

1260
02:16:42,410 --> 02:16:44,970
瑞恩  伏下
No! Ryan, get down, get down!

1261
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:00,080
瑞恩
Ryan!

1262
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:20,140
瑞恩
Ryan!

1263
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:23,740
闭嘴 放开我
Keep your mouth shut Get off me!

1264
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:25,680
你没事吧? 放开我
-Are you alright?  -Get off of me!

1265
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:28,350
上尉  我也没事  谢谢
I'm fine too, Captain. Thanks.

1266
02:17:28,580 --> 02:17:33,040
夹击他们  扔手榴弹过去
Hit them from both sides. Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1267
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:38,530
手榴弹
Grenade!

1268
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:43,230
是二十毫米机枪
20 mill! 20 mill!

1269
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:45,090
是重型机枪  干掉它
Flak gun, 20 mm. Take it out!

1270
02:17:58,550 --> 02:18:01,950
机枪给覆盖着  打不到
Heavy weapon in defilade below! I ain't got a shot!

1271
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:10,820
钳子队形  帕克 目标在八点钟方向
Pincer move! Parker! Targets eight o'clock, low!

1272
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:13,120
愿天主赐我力量
God grant me strength.

1273
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:29,740
去吧  移位
Let's go, displace! Come on!

1274
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:49,330
厄本  躲好
Cover! Upham, cover!

1275
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:07,610
0.30子弹用光了
I'm out of.30 calibre.

1276
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:13,580
天主赐我力量  教我的手打仗
Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teaches my hands to war -

1277
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:16,160
教我的指头作战
and my fingers to fight.

1278
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:29,190
天主是我的堡垒 我的高塔和解脱者
My goodness and my fortress. My high tower and deliverer.

1279
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:35,340
我的盾牌  我的依靠
