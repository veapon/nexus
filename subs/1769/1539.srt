1
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:15,967


2
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:19,967
你知道吗, 现实生活就是这样有趣
Real life is a funny thing, you know.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,837
我想我们大多数人都害怕当我们到了生命的尽头时
I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life

4
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:30,322
回首, 后悔那时候我们没有说出来
and looking back, regretting the moments we didn't speak out.

5
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:36,325
那些我们没有说我爱你的时刻
When we didn't say I love you.

6
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:39,927
那些我们应该说对不起的时刻
When we should have say I'm sorry.

7
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,152
所以, 有一段时间的沉默
So there is a time for silence

8
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,048
有一段时间去等待你的机会
and there is a time for waiting your turn.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,677
但是如果你知道你的感受
But if you know how you feel

10
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:54,347
你如此清楚的知道你要说什么, 你懂的
and you so clearly know what you need to say, you know it.

11
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:00,855
我觉得你不应该等下去
I don't think you should wait.

12
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,180
你应该现在就说出来
I think you should speak now.

13
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:12,980
Sparks Fly - Taylor Swift

14
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:22,092
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

15
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:41,458
你的每一个动作就好像暴雨旋风一般划过我的心上
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm

16
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,707
而我就像一座纸牌搭起的房子般脆弱, 轻易的被你攻入
And I'm a house of cards

17
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:49,110
你是那种能让我不计后果迷上的人, 我应该远离
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running

18
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,457
但是我知道, 我就像小磁铁一样离不开磁场
But I kinda know that I won't get far

19
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,409
你就这样站在我的面前
And you stood there in front of me

20
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,885
距离是如此的近, 我可以触碰到你
Just close enough to touch

21
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:06,338
距离是如此的近, 但愿你不能看清
Close enough to hope you couldn't see

22
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,622
我正在想的事情
What I was thinking of

23
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:11,376
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

24
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,033
我和你约在瓢泼大雨之中
Meet me in the pouring rain

25
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,443
亲吻在街边的人行道上
Kiss me on the sidewalk

26
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:18,510
将所有的痛楚都带离了我
Take away the pain

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:25,699
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
Cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile

28
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,309
宝贝, 你绿色的眼睛就这样得到了我的心
Get me with those green eyes, baby

29
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:30,720
就好像绚丽的灯光都黯然失色
As the lights go down

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,188
当你不在我身边的时候, 有些东西会萦绕于脑际, 难以忘却
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

31
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:46,216
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

32
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:59,621
我的理智忘记了提醒我自己
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea

33
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:04,435
你是一个容易让我入迷的坏念头
You touch me once and it's really something

34
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:08,995
你会发现我比你想象中的更美好
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

35
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:12,020
我对于外面的世界保持我的小戒心
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world

36
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,391
但是, 和你在一起的时候, 我却毫无防备
But with you I know it's no good

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,858
我可以按捺自己的心思, 耐心的等待, 但我希望你能够
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

38
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,835
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

39
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:29,348
我和你约在瓢泼大雨之中
Meet me in the pouring rain

40
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:31,754
亲吻在街边的人行道上
Kiss me on the sidewalk

41
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,620
将所有的痛楚都带离了我
Take away the pain

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,779
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
Cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile

43
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,757
宝贝, 你绿色的眼睛就这样得到了我的心
Get me with those green eyes, baby

44
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,553
就好像绚丽的灯光都黯然失色
As the lights go down

45
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:50,292
当你不在我身边的时候, 有些东西会萦绕于脑际, 难以忘却
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

46
00:03:50,292 --> 00:04:00,953
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

47
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:19,120
我的手指穿过你柔软的头发
I run my fingers through your hair

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
看着灯火就这样的消失在你的光芒下
And watch the lights go wild

49
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,113
就让你美丽的双眼一直注视着我
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me

50
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:31,436
这样的错误让我感觉如此美妙
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right

51
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:35,402
我领上楼梯时
And lead me up the staircase

52
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:39,242
你会温柔的在我耳边说着悄悄话吗？
Won't you whisper soft and slow

53
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:44,148
你已经彻底迷住了我的心
I'm captivated by you baby

54
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:47,076
如同烟火般灿烂于天际
Like a firework show

55
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:50,298
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

56
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:55,332
我和你约在瓢泼大雨之中
Meet me in the pouring rain

57
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,926
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

58
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:04,190
将所有的痛楚都带离了我
Take away take away the pain

59
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,453
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

60
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,294
我和你约在瓢泼大雨之中
Meet me in the pouring rain

61
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:16,511
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

62
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,934
将所有的痛楚都带离了我
Take away take away the pain

63
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,443
放下所有的事情吧
Drop everything now

64
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,005
我和你约在瓢泼大雨之中
Meet me in the pouring rain

65
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,409
亲吻在街边的人行道上
Kiss me on the sidewalk

66
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,305
将所有的痛楚都带离了我
Take away the pain

67
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:37,511
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
Cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile

68
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,667
宝贝, 你绿色的眼睛就这样得到了我的心
Get me with those green eyes, baby

69
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,433
就好像绚丽的灯光都黯然失色
As the lights go down

70
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:47,009
当你不在我身边的时候, 有些东西会萦绕于脑际, 难以忘却
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

71
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:58,445
我好像能看见, 当你微笑的时候, 火花正在绽放
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

72
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:04,951
宝贝, 火花正在绽放
and sparks fly oh baby

73
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,157
Mine - Taylor Swift

74
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:52,060
你头也不回的离开了你所生活的那个小镇, 到大学里兼职当餐厅服务生
You were in college, working part time, waiting tables left a small town, never looked back

75
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,043
我当时就是个飞行隐患, 生怕会随时坠落
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling

76
00:07:56,535 --> 00:08:00,795
想知道为什么我们明知爱不持久却还要继续
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

77
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,352
这叫人如何相信？
I say, Can you believe it?

78
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,078
正当我们两人靠在沙发上
As we're lying on the couch

79
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,767
瞬间我明白了
The moment I could see it

80
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,702
没错, 我现在看清了
Yes, yes, I can see it now

81
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:19,973
还记得我们曾经坐在水池边吗？
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water

82
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,082
你第一次用你的手臂把我紧紧搂住
You put your arm around me for the first time

83
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,949
你变成了我的俘虏
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

84
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:32,296
你是我拥有过最好的东西
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

85
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,877
向前倒带, 我们一起乘风破浪
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together

86
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:43,560
在你家有一个专门放我的东西的抽屉
And there is a drawer of my things at your place

87
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,494
你知道了我的秘密, 也终于懂了我的矜持
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded

88
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:52,036
你说过我们永远不会犯我父母犯过的过错
You said we'd never made my parents' mistakes

89
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,667
但我们有账单要付
But we've got bills to pay

90
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,837
我们什么也没有弄清楚
We got nothing figured out

91
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:03,543
当我们难以承受的时候
When it was hard to take

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,476
没错, 这就是我所烦恼的
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

93
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:11,551
还记得我们曾经坐在水池边吗？
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water

94
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,805
你第一次用你的手臂把我紧紧搂住
You put your arm around me for the first time

95
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,369
你变成了我的俘虏
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

96
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,252
你是我拥有过最好的东西
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

97
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:27,367
还记得当整个城市的灯光在水中浮现吗？
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?

98
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,483
你看到我第一次开始相信
You saw me start to believe for the first time

99
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,462
你变成了我的俘虏
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

100
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:40,191
你是我拥有过最好的东西
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

101
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:58,301
我依然记得我们在凌晨吵的那场架
And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.

102
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:02,327
你说事情全部都失去了我们的控制
You said everything was slipping right out of our hands

103
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:08,552
我边哭边跑出门, 然而你一直跟着我到街上
I ran out crying, and you followed me out into the street

104
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:15,896
我硬撑着道了别
Braced myself for the goodbye

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,923
因为这就是我所了解的一切
Cause that's all I've ever known

106
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:23,998
你让我大吃一惊
And you took me by surprise

107
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,332
你说你永远不会让我孤身一人
You said I'll never leave you alone

108
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:50,859
你说你还记得我们是怎样坐在水池旁的
You said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water

109
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,929
你还说你记得每一次你看着我就像第一次一样
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time

110
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:58,726
你说你曾经喜欢上一个粗心的爸爸的细心女儿
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter

111
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,728
你说我是你拥有过最好的东西
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

112
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,958
我们会走到最后的
(Hold on), we'll make it last

113
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,980
永不回头, 永不后悔
(Hold on, never turn back)

114
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:14,660
你变成了我的俘虏
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

115
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:18,433
你是我拥有过最好的东西
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

116
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,807
你能相信吗？
Do you believe it?

117
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,878
我们会走到最后的
We're gonna make it now

118
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,671
我已经看到我们的未来了
And I can see it

119
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:35,862
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) (I can see it now)

120
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,794
欧, 芝加哥伊利诺斯州的朋友们, 大家好
Oh hello Chicago, Illinois.

121
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:29,130
我叫泰勒
My name is Taylor.

122
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:40,039
欢迎来到爱的告白世界巡回演唱会
And welcome to the Speak Now World Tour.

123
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,462
我说, 今天早些时候, 我正坐在我的化妆室
You know I was sitting in my dressing room a little earlier today.

124
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,757
然后呢
And uh

125
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:02,767
我听到你们的尖叫声穿过这个混凝土墙
I heard you guys screaming through the concrete walls of this arena.

126
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,498
然后我对自己说...
And I thought to myself ...

127
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,583
我对自己说没有什么反应出这将会是一群很棒的的歌迷
I thought to myself: nothing says this is going to be an amazing crowd

128
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,158
就像能够听到他们的尖叫声穿透混凝土墙
like being able to hear them screaming through concrete walls.

129
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,305
天哪, 我就是
Man I just ...

130
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,098
站在这里望向你们, 我变得如此的着迷
I get so fascinated standing here from this view point.

131
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:32,765
这里有着今晚能望见每个人的绝佳视野
It's an excellent view of everybody here tonight.

132
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:35,294
我能看见每一个人
And I can see everyone.

133
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,661
我能看见我最好的朋友都在那边
I can see the best friends who came all laid up over there.

134
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,835
我能看见你们在最上边那里举着'SWIFT'标志的灯
I can see you all the way up of the top with the 'SWIFT' light-up sign.

135
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,568
我还能...
I can...

136
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:47,607
然后我变得...
And I get ...

137
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:53,364
我变得对在这里每个人的故事如此地着迷
I get so fascinated by the individual stories in this room.

138
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:58,464
我是说我想到这个事实
You know I mean I just think about the fact that

139
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,556
你们做了'Long Live'的标志
you guys who made the 'Long Live' sign back there.

140
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,034
那肯定需要好几个小时才能做好
That must have taken hours.

141
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:09,606
在这里的每个人之前为了今晚能来到这, 都排队等过了很久才能挤进同一个会场
And everyone here who waited in line and piled into the same room to be here tonight.

142
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,461
这对我来说就是如此的令人着迷
It's just so fascinating to me.

143
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,975
我是如此地感激, 因为所有故事里面最重要的
And I am so thankful because the main story of it all

144
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:27,893
这里最重要的事就是你们13500个人都决定和我一起度过星期五的夜晚
the main story line here is that 13500 of you decide to spend your Friday night with me.

145
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:40,063
我希望那你们不介意我来告诉你们我的一些故事
And I was hoping you would be alright with you if I would tell you some of my stories.

146
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:47,365
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

147
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,422
Go!!!

148
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:06,757
The Story Of Us - Taylor Swift

149
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:17,897
我一直这样认为, 在未来的某一天, 我们会这样告诉别人关于我们的故事
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us

150
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:21,126
我们眼神第一次交汇和花火悄然绽放的那一瞬间
How we met and the sparks flew instantly

151
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,107
所有人都会说：看, 他们是如此幸运（的找到彼此）
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"

152
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,142
曾经, 我知道我的座位, 一定是紧紧挨着你的那一个
I used to know my place was a spot next to you

153
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:34,886
现在, 我只能站在那里, 试图找到一个没有人的空位
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat

154
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:38,676
最近, 我甚至不知道你在我们这个故事的那一页游荡？
lately I don't even know what page you're on

155
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:43,729
一个简简单单的复杂
Oh, a simple complication

156
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:47,802
错误着带领我们远离了爱情
Miscommunications lead to fall out

157
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,171
有好多好多的事情, 我希望你知道
So many things that I wish you knew

158
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:55,057
有好多好多的阻拦, 我希望我能穿越
So many walls up I can't break through

159
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,304
现在, 我一个人站在这里
Now I'm standing alone

160
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:58,873
在一个充满欢声笑语的房间里
In a crowded room

161
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,864
你没有说一个字
And we're not speaking

162
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:04,248
我是如此渴望知道
And I'm dying to know

163
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,889
这伤痛是不是伤害着你
Is it killing you

164
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,742
像汲取我生命一样
Like it's killing me?

165
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:10,897
自从那些命中注定传说
I don't know what to say

166
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,861
被粉碎
Since a twist of fate

167
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:14,592
我就已经说不出什么
When it all broke down

168
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,791
那个关于我们的故事
And the story of us

169
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,321
已经宛如悲剧一般
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

170
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:22,781
下一个篇章
Next chapter

171
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,207
我们是如何让结局变成这样的呢？
How'd we end up this way?

172
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,388
我紧张的不停的拉扯着自己的衣服
See me nervously pulling at my clothes

173
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:36,309
试图自己看上去忙碌一点
And trying to look busy

174
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:40,147
你也在尽自己最大的努力躲开我的视线
And you're doing your best to avoid me

175
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:44,829
我开始这样认为
I'm starting to think one day

176
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:46,650
我会这样告诉人们, 那个关于我们的故事
I'll tell the story of us

177
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:50,113
那个关于我是如何将我自己迷失在有你的篇章里
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here

178
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:55,356
但是你一直紧紧拥抱着自己的自尊, 那应该是你抱紧我的方式
But you held your pride like you should have held me

179
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,242
我害怕看见结局
Oh, we're scared to see the ending

180
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:03,175
但是为什么我们却假装这一切不算什么
Why are we pretending this is nothing?

181
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:06,915
我很想告诉你, 我想你, 但是我不知道如何传达我的思念
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how

182
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:10,658
我未曾听见过这般响亮的寂静
I've never heard silence quite this loud

183
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,813
现在, 我一个人站在
Now I'm standing alone

184
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:14,310
一个充满欢声笑语的房间里
In a crowded room

185
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,258
你没有说一个字
And we're not speaking

186
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,417
我是如此渴望知道
And I'm dying to know

187
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:20,865
这伤痛是不是伤害着你
Is it killing you

188
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:24,091
像汲取我生命一样
Like it's killing me?

189
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,386
自从那些命中注定的传说
I don't know what to say

190
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,305
被粉碎
Since a twist of fate

191
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:30,225
我就已经说不出什么
When it all broke down

192
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,329
那个关于我们的故事
And the story of us

193
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,186
已经宛如悲剧一般
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

194
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,508
我能看见你们跳起来吗
Can I please see you jump?

195
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,834
这好似一场比赛
This is looking like a contest

196
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:11,928
最能表演出“毫不在乎”的人会赢得最后的奖赏
Of who can act like they care less

197
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:16,837
但是我却更喜欢有你在我身旁的时光
But I liked it better when you were on my side

198
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,405
战争蓄势待发
The battle's in your hands now

199
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,493
但是, 我会卸下我的盔甲
But I would lay my armor down

200
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:30,595
如果你更希望这场战争爆发, 那么, 我会拿起我的武器
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight

201
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:35,838
有好多好多的事情, 你希望我能了解
So many things that you wish I knew

202
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:39,770
但是, 这个故事的末篇已经拉开的序幕
But the story of us might be ending soon

203
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,709
现在, 我一个人站在
Now I'm standing alone

204
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,441
一个充满欢声笑语的房间里
In a crowded room

205
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,532
你没有说一个字
And we're not speaking

206
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,543
我渴望知道
And I'm dying to know

207
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,089
这伤痛是不是伤害着你
Is it killing you

208
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,458
像汲取我生命一样
Like it's killing me?

209
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,468
自从那些命中注定
I don't know what to say

210
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:57,387
被粉碎
Since a twist of fate

211
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,401
我就已经说不出什么
When it all broke down

212
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,412
那个关于我们的故事
And the story of us

213
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:17,841
已经宛如悲剧一般
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now...

214
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,836
你没有说一个字
And we're not speaking

215
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:22,799
我渴望知道
And I'm dying to know

216
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,439
这伤痛是不是伤害着你
Is it killing you

217
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,714
像汲取我生命一样
Like it's killing me?

218
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,968
自从那些命中注定的幻想
I don't know what to say

219
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,646
被粉碎
Since a twist of fate

220
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,657
我就已经说不出什么
cause we're going down

221
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,670
那个关于我们的故事
And the story of us

222
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,919
已经宛如悲剧一般
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

223
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,757
这个故事, 已经谢幕
The end

224
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,118
Our Song - Taylor Swift

225
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:56,904
我坐在他车子的副驾驶位子上, 顶着乱糟糟的头发
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car

226
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,960
他一只手握着方向盘
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel

227
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:03,180
另一只手在我心上
The other on my heart

228
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,050
我随意张望, 把收音机的声音关小
I look around, turn the radio down

229
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:06,832
他说宝贝怎么了？
He says baby is something wrong?

230
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,729
我说没什么, 我只是在想为什么我们没有一首我们的歌
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song

231
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:15,208
然后他说...
And he says...

232
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,547
我们的歌是那扇关上的门
Our song is the slamming screen door

233
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:20,260
当我晚上偷偷溜出去, 敲你的窗户的时候
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window

234
00:25:20,494 --> 00:25:23,770
是我们讲电话时你悄悄的话语
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

235
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,883
因为已经是深夜, 并且你妈妈不知道
Cause it's late and your mama don't know

236
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,852
我们的歌是你的笑声
Our song is the way you laugh

237
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,129
第一次约会“天啊, 我没有吻她, 但是我应该吻的”
The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"

238
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,650
当我回到家...在我结束祷告前
And when I got home ... before I said amen

239
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:42,318
问上帝能不能让一切再来一次
Asking God if he could play it again

240
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:51,832
在一天结束后, 我沿着台阶走进前门廊
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day

241
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,595
所有的事都搞砸, 弄得一团糟
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on

242
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,686
被丢弃, 被浪费
And lost and thrown away

243
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,037
通向我可爱的床的途中, 穿过走廊
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed

244
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:05,543
我几乎没有注意到沿途的玫瑰
I almost didn't notice all the roses

245
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:08,400
还有那纸条上写着：
And the note that said...

246
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:10,831
我们的歌是那扇关上的门
Our song is the slamming screen door

247
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,785
当我晚上偷偷溜出去, 敲你的窗户的时候
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window

248
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:17,108
是我们讲电话时你悄悄的话语
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

249
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,490
因为已经是深夜, 并且你妈妈不知道
Cause it's late and your mama don't know

250
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,273
我们的歌是你的笑声
Our song is the way you laugh

251
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,500
第一次约会“天啊, 我没有吻她, 但是我应该吻的”
The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"

252
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,927
当我回到家...在我结束祷告前
And when I got home ... before I said amen

253
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:36,900
问上帝能不能让一切再来一次
Asking God if he could play it again

254
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,457
我听了每一张专辑, 听了收音机
I've heard every album, listened to the radio

255
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:56,321
等待着某些事情发生
Waited for something to come along

256
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:59,651
这种感觉很好, 就像我们的歌一样...
That was as good as our song...

257
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,875
因为我们的歌是那扇关上的门
Cause our song is the slamming screen door

258
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:05,872
当我晚上偷偷溜出去, 敲他的窗户的时候
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window

259
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,867
是我们讲电话时他悄悄的话语
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

260
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,158
因为已经是深夜, 并且他妈妈不知道
Cause it's late and his mama don't know

261
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:13,265
我们的歌是他的笑声
Our song is the way he laughs

262
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:16,501
第一次约会“天啊, 我没有吻她, 但是我应该吻的”
The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, man I should have"

263
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:21,972
当我回到家...在我结束祷告前
And when I got home ... before I said amen

264
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:40,642
问上帝能不能让一切再来一次
Asking God if he could play it again...

265
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:48,000
我坐在他车子的副驾驶位子上, 顶着乱糟糟的头发
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car

266
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,577
我拿起一支钢笔和一条旧餐巾
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin

267
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:56,237
然后写下我们的歌
And I... wrote down our song

268
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,011
你们真的叫的好大声
You guys are really really loud.

269
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,023
哇！！！
Wow!!!

270
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,345
我喜欢这样。我喜欢和你们一起呆着
I love it. I love hanging out with you guys

271
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:50,136
就因为你们吼声大, 你们会和我一起跳舞, 你们知道所有的歌词
because you're loud and you're daning and you know all the words

272
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:53,086
并且你们人非常非常好, 这点我很感激
and you're also very very nice which I appreciate.

273
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:54,956
你们就是好
You guys are.

274
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:07,824
你们这样好对我来说意义真的很大
You know the nice thing you guys being nice really means a lot to me

275
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:11,280
因为在我生命当中, 我遇到过这种人
because in my lifetime I've run into people who

276
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:13,955
他们没你们这么好
aren't quite as nice.

277
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:19,229
其实他们更加卑鄙
They're in fact more mean.

278
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:22,526
Mean - Taylor Swift

279
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:25,318
你, 带着你那好似刀
You, with your words like knives

280
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,264
剑一般犀利话语来伤害着我
and swords and weapons that you use against me

281
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:32,295
你, 曾经好不留情的把我撞倒两次
You, have knocked me off my feet again

282
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,397
让我失去的知觉
Got me feelin' like a nothing

283
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:37,998
你, 用着你那好似指甲在黑板上划着一般刺耳的声音
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

284
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,246
在我轻轻呼吸的时候大声喊叫着
Callin' me out when I'm wounded

285
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:43,852
你, 捉弄着一个弱势的人
You, pickin' on the weaker man

286
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:52,646
你可以用一阵轻柔微风, 将我吹倒
You can take me down with just one single blow

287
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:57,467
但是, 你不知道, 你真的不知道
But you don't know what you don't know

288
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:03,227
总有一天, 我会住在一个让人大呼“棒极了”的城市
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city

289
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:07,485
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

290
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,926
总有一天, 我会变的足够强壮, 这样你就不能再伤害到我
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

291
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:19,047
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

292
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:22,414
为什么你如此卑鄙？
Why you gotta be so mean?

293
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:29,575
你, 你那两头倒的墙头草
You, with your switching sides

294
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,714
你那如野火般散布的谎言, 还有你的羞辱
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

295
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:36,593
你, 又一次的指出我的不足之处
You, have pointed out my flaws again

296
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,166
就好像我没有看见它们一样
As if I don't already see them

297
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,079
我, 低下我的头经过你的面前
I walk with my head down

298
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:44,684
不想让你看见我, 因为我没有办法在你脑海中留下好印象
Tryna block you out 'cause I never impress you

299
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:49,035
我仅仅想找回以前那种”不错”的感觉
I just wanna feel okay again

300
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:53,575
我真希望, 你会被四处攻击
I bet you got pushed around

301
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,478
有人可以让你感到刺骨钻心的寒冷
Somebody made you cold

302
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:59,004
但是, 就让这个无止尽的来回就此了结吧
But the cycle ends right now

303
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,810
因为你没有办法让我变得和一你样卑鄙
Cause you can't lead me down that road

304
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:04,858
你不知道, 你真的不知道
And you don't know what you don't know

305
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:10,562
总有一天, 我会住在一个让人直呼“棒极了”的城市
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city

306
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:14,821
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

307
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,301
总有一天, 我会变得足够的强壮, 让你没有办法伤害到我
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

308
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:26,784
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

309
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,873
为什么你一定要这样卑鄙呢？
Why you gotta be so mean?

310
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,165
我已经可以预见几年后的你, 坐在路口角落的酒吧里
And I can see you years from now in a bar

311
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,253
和路人讨论着正在上演的橄榄球
Talkin' over a football game

312
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,107
你大声的说着你的想法, 但是
With that same big loud opinion but

313
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,104
没有人在听
Nobody's listening

314
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:59,264
筋疲力尽却还怒气冲冲地叫嚷着不值得一提的往事
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

315
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:06,613
醉醺醺的嘟囔着你认为我是如何不会唱歌
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing

316
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,741
你真的很卑鄙
All you are is mean

317
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:17,721
你的生活真的是, 卑鄙
All you are is mean

318
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,079
谎话连篇
And a liar

319
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:20,623
可悲的
And pathetic

320
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,358
孤单一人
And alone in life

321
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:27,879
真是卑鄙, 卑鄙, 卑鄙, 还有, 卑鄙
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

322
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:33,773
总有一天, 我会住在一个让人直呼“棒极了”的城市
But someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city

323
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:40,188
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

324
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:45,617
总有一天, 我会变得足够的强壮, 让你没有办法伤害到我
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

325
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:50,064
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

326
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,760
为什么你一定要这样卑鄙呢？
Why you gotta be so mean?

327
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:57,355
总有一天, 我会住在一个让人直呼“棒极了”的城市
Someday I'll be livin' in a big old city

328
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:01,316
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

329
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:03,500
(为什么你一定要这样卑鄙呢？)
(Why you gotta be so mean?)

330
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,995
总有一天, 我会变得足够的强壮, 让你没有办法伤害到我
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

331
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:13,775
而你将得到的只是, 无止尽的卑鄙
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

332
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:20,399
为什么你一定要这样卑鄙呢？
Why you gotta be so mean?

333
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:40,155
Back To December, Apologize, You're Not Sorry - Taylor Swift

334
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:59,881
我真的很高兴你能抽出时间来看我
I'm so glad you made time to see me

335
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,297
最近怎么样呢？告诉我吧, 你的家人都怎么样呢？
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?

336
00:36:03,624 --> 00:36:09,383
我已经很久没有看见他们了
I haven't seen them in a while

337
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:13,315
你最近过的不错, 比以前忙了许多
You've been good, busier than ever

338
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:16,797
我们简短的谈论着工作和天气
Small talk: work and the weather

339
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:22,532
你开始警惕起来, 我知道为什么
Your guard is up and I know why

340
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:26,634
因为你还清楚的记得,
Because the last time you saw me will still

341
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:29,349
上一次, 我对你的伤害
burn in the back of your mind

342
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:35,293
你送给我玫瑰, 我却没有珍惜的让她们就这样消逝
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

343
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,897
我把自己的骄傲吞到肚子里
So this is me swallowing my pride

344
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:44,558
站在你的面前, 说道对于那一晚, 我真的对不起
Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night

345
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,658
我一直试图回到那个十二月
And I go back to December all the time

346
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:53,168
自由了, 剩下的却只有想念你
It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you

347
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:58,644
我真的希望我能在那个时候意识到自己做了什么
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

348
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:04,727
我回到那个十二月, 改变一切把所有是事情都变成正确的
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright

349
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:10,439
我一直都试图回到那个十二月
I go back to December all the time

350
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,196
最近, 我一直辗转无眠
These days I haven't been sleepin'

351
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:30,751
彻夜回想, 在你生日的那一天
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'

352
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:36,599
我就是这样的离开, 我没有打电话给你
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

353
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:40,155
我一直都在回忆着夏天, 那些美好的时光
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times

354
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:44,373
我坐在副驾驶的位置上, 看着你的笑脸
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side and

355
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:50,126
秋天来临时, 我是如此的爱你
I realized I loved you in the fall

356
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:53,727
然后, 寒冷就这样袭来, 黑暗的日子
And then the cold came, the dark days

357
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,816
当恐惧就这样潜入我的心里
When fear crept into my mind

358
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:02,951
你给了我你所有的爱, 我给你的却是 再见
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

359
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,601
我把自己的骄傲吞到肚子里
So this is me swallowing my pride

360
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:13,246
站在你的面前, 说道对于那一晚, 我真的对不起
Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night

361
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:17,455
我一直试图回到那个十二月
And I go back to December all the time

362
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,967
自由了, 剩下的却只有想念你
It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you

363
00:38:21,246 --> 00:38:26,585
我真的希望我能在那个时候意识到自己做了什么
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

364
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:29,392
我回到那个十二月
I go back to December

365
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:32,946
改变一切, 改变自己的想法
Turn around and change my own mind

366
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:37,976
我一直试图回到那个十二月
I go back to December all the time

367
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:54,556
我想念你略带褐色的皮肤, 你甜蜜的微笑
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile

368
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:57,272
你对我是那么的好
So good to me, so right

369
00:38:57,597 --> 00:39:02,185
还有在那个九月的夜晚, 你是如何把我挽入你的怀中
And how you held me in your arms that September night

370
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:05,855
你第一次看见我哭泣
The first time you ever saw me cry

371
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,179
也许这是一个梦想般的假设
Maybe this is wishful thinking

372
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:12,219
一个没头没脑的梦想
Probably mindless dreaming

373
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:16,949
如果我们能够再爱一次, 我发誓我会真的爱你
If we loved again I swear I'd love you right

374
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,218
我会选择回到那个时间, 改变一切。但是我不能
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't

375
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:31,084
如果你的心门对我紧锁着, 我能理解
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

376
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,822
然后你说
And you said

377
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:51,896
现在说对不起已是太迟, 真的太迟
It's too late to apologize, it's too late

378
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:58,774
你说过现在说对不起已是太迟, 真的太迟
You said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

379
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,583
我把自己的骄傲吞到肚子里
This is me swallowing my pride

380
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:08,227
站在你的面前, 说道对于那一晚, 我真的对不起
Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night

381
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:12,249
我回到那个十二月,
And I go back to December

382
00:40:12,674 --> 00:40:16,225
自由了, 剩下的却只有想念你
It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you

383
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:22,075
我真的希望我能在那个时候意识到自己做了什么
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

384
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,458
你说你不是真心对不起
You said you're not sorry, no oh no oh

385
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:38,196
你不是真心对不起
And you're not sorry, no oh no oh

386
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:53,880
你不是真心对不起
Hey you're not sorry, no oh no oh

387
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,220
嗨, 是我, 请留言
Hey, it's me, leave a message, make it hot

388
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,500
现在自己到角落站着好好想想你都做了什么
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

389
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:39,033
Better Than Revenge - Taylor Swift

390
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:51,843
我们的故事开始于 在那年夏天结束的时候
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer

391
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,247
曾经, 我拥有一切, 我拥有梦寐以求的他
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him

392
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:58,616
她就这样闯入了我们的世界, 带走了他。让我们来听听那些响起的掌声吧
She came along, got him along, and let's hear the applause

393
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:02,175
她带走他的速度比你说完“第三者破坏法”还快
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

394
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:05,265
我不曾怀疑, 也不曾料想到事情会这样发生,
I never saw it coming, nor did I suspected it

395
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:08,633
我实在是太低估了, 她, 这个我正在对付的人
I underestimated just who I was dealing with

396
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,775
她应该知道她带来的伤痛, 好像把我当成鼓一般的疯狂敲击
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum

397
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,560
她也低估了我, 这个她正在从我这里偷取的人
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

398
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:19,348
她不是圣人, 她不是你认为的那样完美
She's not a saint and she's not what you think

399
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:22,718
她只是一个演员
She's an actress, Whoa

400
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,045
她做的那些事让她变得有名
She's better known for the things that she does

401
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,226
“床垫上的那些事”
On the mattress, Whoa

402
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:31,003
不久之后, 她就会发现
Soon she's gonna find

403
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:33,923
在操场窃取别人“玩具”
Stealing other people's toys on the playground

404
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,931
并不会让你交到更多的朋友
Won't make you many friends

405
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,623
她应该记住
She should keep in mind

406
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:38,695
她应该牢牢的记住
She should keep in mind

407
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:43,091
我不能做出任何比复仇更好的事情了
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha

408
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,921
她的生活好像派对不断, 总能在宾客名单上看见她的名字
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list

409
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,289
她看着我, 就好象我还被“那件事”影响着, 而她已经彻底摆脱了一样
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it

410
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,383
我认为她一直紧皱着眉头会是一个小麻烦
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling

411
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:00,969
她认为我有心理问题
And, she thinks I'm psycho

412
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,468
因为我喜欢把她的名字和一些东西押韵的并排在一起
Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but

413
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:06,091
但是复杂巧妙的世故, 并不得意于你的穿着, 或你认识那些“人”
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know

414
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:09,373
也不是你把别人踩在脚底下只为让自己爬的更高
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

415
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:11,659
难道他们在幼稚园的时候没有教导过你吗
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school

416
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:12,929
所以, 现在我来决定一切
So it's up to me

417
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:16,111
那些典雅的裙子并没有给你高贵的气质
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

418
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:20,271
她不是圣人, 她不是你认为的那样完美
She's not a saint and she's not what you think

419
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,413
她只是一个演员
She's an actress, Whoa

420
00:43:23,923 --> 00:43:26,869
她做的那些事让她变得有名
She's better known for the things that she does

421
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:30,145
“床垫上的那些事”
On the mattress, Whoa

422
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:31,784
不久之后, 她就会发现
Soon she's gonna find

423
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,888
在操场上窃取别人“玩具”
Stealing other people's toys on the playground

424
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,886
并不会让你交到更多的朋友
Won't make you many friends

425
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,148
应该记住
She should keep in mind

426
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,461
她应该牢牢的记住
She should keep in mind

427
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:46,498
我不能做出任何比复仇更好的事情了
There is nothing I do better than revenge

428
00:43:57,132 --> 00:44:00,037
亲爱的, 我只是一件让你揉揉眼睛就过去的小事
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey

429
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:03,175
你也许能够得到他, 但是, 你没有听说吗？
You might have him, but haven't you heard

430
00:44:03,594 --> 00:44:06,632
亲爱的, 我只是一件让你揉揉眼睛就过去的小事
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey

431
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:12,576
你也许能够得到他, 但是我会是那一个微笑到最后的那一个
You might have him, but I always get the last word

432
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:18,425
喔
Whoa

433
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:26,010
她不是圣人, 她不是你认为的那样完美
She's not a saint and she's not what you think

434
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:29,331
她只是一个演员
She's an actress, Whoa

435
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:32,653
她做的那些事让她变得有名
She's better known for the things that she does

436
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:35,882
“床垫上的那些事”
On the mattress, Whoa

437
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:37,476
不久之后, 她就会发现
Soon she's gonna find

438
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,236
在操场上窃取别人“玩具”
Stealing other people's toys on the playground

439
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,436
并不会让你交到更多的朋友
Won't make you many friends

440
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:44,120
她应该记住
She should keep in mind

441
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,431
她应该牢牢的记住
She should keep in mind

442
00:44:45,712 --> 00:44:48,988
我不能做出任何比复仇更好的事情了
There is nothing I do better than revenge

443
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:52,452
我不能做出任何比复仇更好的事情了
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing

444
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:55,865
我并不认为你知道
Cause I don't think you do, Oh

445
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:59,096
你还固执的认为, 你知道你犯下的错误吗？
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing

446
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:01,857
我不认为你知道, 你真的不知道
I don't think you do, I don't think you do

447
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:03,482
就让那些掌声来传达
Let's hear the applause

448
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:10,016
你确实应该得到一些掌声
See you deserve some applause

449
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,262
因为你真的比以前好了很多
Cause you're so much better

450
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:16,950
她带走他的速度比你说完“第三者破坏法”还快
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

451
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:45,251
Speak Now - Taylor Swift

452
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,271
我, 不是那样的女孩
I am not the kind of girl

453
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:50,798
那样, 随随便便的就闯进
Who should be rudely barging in

454
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,281
雪白圣洁的教堂
On a white veil ocassion

455
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,419
你, 也不是那样的男孩
But you are not the kind of boy

456
00:48:56,844 --> 00:49:00,624
那样, 随随便便的和一个人携手一生
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

457
00:49:01,466 --> 00:49:04,459
我悄悄的溜了进来, 你的朋友们都在
I sneak in and see your friends

458
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:09,048
还有, 她的那些家人们, 打扮的好似蜡像一般, 好不自然
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastells

459
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:12,930
而你的她, 正穿着包不住陷的酥皮点心一样的礼服,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid

460
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:17,517
在某一个角落, 对着伴娘大吼大叫
Somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

461
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:24,769
这, 一定不是你曾经幻想中的画面吧
Thiiiiis iiis surely not what you thought it would be

462
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:31,843
我, 一定是把自己迷失在了梦境里
IIIIIII lose myself in a daydream

463
00:49:32,212 --> 00:49:34,225
直冲了进去, 说道
Burst in and say

464
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:37,359
“不要说我愿意, 快点逃走吧”
Don't say yes runaway now

465
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:39,441
“当你离开教堂的时候,
I'll meet you when you're out

466
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:42,038
我会在小草丛生的后门等你”
of the church at the back door

467
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,455
“不要等待, 也不要说誓言里的一个字”
Don't wait or say a single vow

468
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,425
“你需要听我把话说完”
You need to hear me out

469
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:50,846
当我还有机会的时候
And they said speak now

470
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:01,352
婚礼应有的欢乐, 正悄然变化着
Fun gestures are exchanged

471
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:03,454
管风琴的乐声
And the organ starts to play

472
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:05,797
也演变成了死亡进行曲
A song that sounds like a death march

473
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:09,258
我把自己隐藏在了帘幕的后面
And I am hiding in the curtains

474
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,994
看起来, 我并没有被那个“可爱的”“即将成为你新娘”的人邀请
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

475
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:20,023
她, 经过来宾的时候, 像个选美皇后似的, 骄傲的仰着下巴
Sheeee floats down the aisle like a pagent queen

476
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:27,656
但是, 我知道你希望, 那个人, 是我
But IIIIII knooooow you wish it was me

477
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:29,473
你希望, 即将牵着的, 是我的手
You wish it was me

478
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:30,555
难道不是吗？
Don't you

479
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:33,809
“不要说我愿意, 快点逃走吧”
Don't say yes runaway now

480
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,586
“当你离开教堂的时候,
I'll meet you when you're out

481
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:38,537
我会在后面的小门等你”
of the church at the back door

482
00:50:38,908 --> 00:50:41,903
“不要等待, 也不要说誓言里的一个字”
Don't wait or say a single vow

483
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:43,778
“你需要听我把话说完”
You need to hear me out

484
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,586
当我还有机会的时候
And they said speak now

485
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:50,004
“不要说我愿意, 快点逃走吧”
Don't say yes runaway now

486
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:51,856
“当你离开教堂的时候,
I'll meet you when you're out

487
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,483
我会在小草丛生的后门等你”
of the church at the back door

488
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,038
“不要等待, 也不要说誓言里的一个字”
Don't wait or say a single vow

489
00:50:58,313 --> 00:50:59,670
时间正一点一滴的流逝
Your time is running out

490
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:03,417
这一刻, 还是有机会的时候
And they said speak now

491
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,523
牧师庄重的声音响起
I hear the preacher say

492
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:26,419
“有意见的人, 请现在说吧。不然, 请不要再提起, 直到地老天荒”
Speak now or forever hold your peace

493
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:27,636
寂静淹没了一切
There's the silence

494
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:28,572
这是我最后的机会了
There's my last chance

495
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,492
我, 站了起来, 手不停的晃动着
I stand up with shaking hands

496
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,468
眼光, 都洒在了我的身上
All eyes on me

497
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:42,361
教堂里每个人都惊讶的看着我
Horrified looks from everyone in the room

498
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:45,916
但是, 我却只是, 望着你
But I'm only lookin at you

499
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,081
我, 不是那样的女孩
I am not the kind of girl

500
00:51:50,284 --> 00:51:52,469
那样, 随随便便就闯进
Who should be rudely barging in

501
00:51:52,691 --> 00:51:54,576
雪白圣洁的教堂
On a white veil ocassion

502
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:58,130
你, 也不是那样的男孩
But you are not the kind of boy

503
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:02,389
那样, 随随便便的和一个人携手一生
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

504
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:06,508
“不要说我愿意, 快点逃走吧”
Don't say yes runaway now

505
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,614
“当你离开教堂的时候
I'll meet you when you're out

506
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:11,331
我会在小草丛生的后门等你”
of the church at the back door

507
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:14,745
“不要等待, 也不要说誓言里的一个字”
Don't wait or say a single vow

508
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:16,476
“你需要听我把话说完”
You need to hear me out

509
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:19,427
当我还有机会的时候
And they said speak now

510
00:52:19,662 --> 00:52:22,750
然后, 你会告诉我“让我们一起逃离这里吧”
And you'll say let's run away now

511
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,380
“当我脱下礼服的时候, 我会去教堂后面那个小门见你”
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door

512
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:31,031
“亲爱的, 我没有说那誓言上的一个字”
Baby I didn't say my vows

513
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:36,230
真的好幸运, 当我们还有机会的时候, 你在我的身边。
So glad you were around when they said speak now

514
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:44,303
“让我们一起逃走吧”
Let's runaway now

515
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:47,944
“亲爱的, 我没有说那誓言上的一个字”
Baby I didn't say my vows

516
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:53,986
真的好幸运, 当我们还有机会的时候, 你在我的身边。
So glad you were around when they said speak now

517
00:55:30,647 --> 00:55:32,568
你们真是令人难以置信
You guys are absolutely unbelievable.

518
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:33,714
就像我想的一样
It's like I'm imaging you.

519
00:55:34,605 --> 00:55:36,441
你们太不可思议了
You got amazing. Thank you

520
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:48,770
我说
You know

521
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:51,045
我觉得
I think uh

522
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:52,540
我觉得在我的脑海
I think in my mind

523
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:57,502
我有点喜欢把不同的乐器分类到具有不同情感色彩的声音当中, 就像
I kinda categorize different instruments a sounding like different emotions like

524
00:55:58,911 --> 00:55:59,659
就像, 额
like uh

525
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:02,356
比如对我来说, 大提琴听起来很悲伤
for example like for me a cello sounds sad

526
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:09,330
然后我正在弹的这个夏威夷四弦琴听起来很欢快, 你觉得呢？
and uh a ukulele I'm playing right now that sounds really happy ,don't you think

527
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:25,403
这是我几年前在夏威夷弄到的
I got this in howaii a few years ago and uh...

528
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:27,608
我一直想在演唱会给你们演奏
I've always wanted to play for you in a concert

529
00:56:27,894 --> 00:56:28,782
但感觉
But it felt like...

530
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:34,723
感觉如果我要为你们演奏, 我必须演奏演奏一首欢快的歌曲, 你们觉得呢？
it felt like if I was gonna play it for you I'd have to
play it on a very happy song, don't you think

531
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:55,788
就像一首关于坠入爱河或是第一次度过人生当中最好的一天的歌曲
You know like a song about falling in love or having a best first day of your entire life

532
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,284
你懂的, 就那些事（不知道是不是我想的那些事 r(s3t)q）
you know things like that

533
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:08,002
因为我感觉, 感觉那些事不只让你觉得高兴
because I feel like I feel like those things not only make you feel happy

534
00:57:08,102 --> 00:57:12,592
它们还让你感到无所畏惧
but they also make you feel fearless

535
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:20,379
Fearless, I'm Yours, Hey, Soul Sister - Taylor Swift

536
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:28,806
我们的路上, 有很多景致
Somethin'bout the way

537
00:57:29,368 --> 00:57:32,127
小道看起来像刚被雨打湿
The street looks when it's just rained

538
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:35,638
人行道的条纹反着光
There's a glow off the pavement

539
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:38,027
你和我走到车前
You walk me to the car

540
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:43,642
但你知道么, 我想请你和我跳一支舞, 就在这里
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there

541
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:47,858
在这停车场的中心
In the middle of the parking lot

542
00:57:47,858 --> 00:57:50,765
耶
Yeah

543
00:57:51,373 --> 00:57:59,422
嘿, 嘿, 嘿~
Hey, hey, hey~ (hey, soul sister)

544
00:58:01,341 --> 00:58:03,734
沿着路行驶
Drivin' down the road

545
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:06,866
想知道你是否有察觉
Wonder if you know

546
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:12,435
我用尽全身力气地不想这么快被你迷住
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now

547
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:15,148
你的一举一动都散发着魅力
You're just so cool

548
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,330
你把手从发间穿过
Run your hands through your hair

549
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:23,995
不经意的动作, 却让我抵抗不了你
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

550
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:29,983
没有什么事会让我觉得比这更美好了
And I don't know how it gets better than this

551
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,428
你拉着我的手, 不回头地向前跑
You take my hand and drag me head first

552
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:35,513
我不怕冒险
Fearless

553
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:41,519
不知道是为什么, 和你在一起我可以舞蹈
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

554
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:45,327
穿着我最精致的裙子, 哪怕是在暴风雨中
In a storm in my best dress

555
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:49,108
我不怕冒险
Fearless

556
00:58:58,889 --> 00:59:01,512
宝贝请开的慢些
So baby drive slow

557
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:07,365
直到我们离开了这个小镇的大道
Till we run out of road in this one horse town

558
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:13,118
我多么想一直坐在你旁边的座位
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat

559
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:16,441
你用你的眼睛深深地望着我
You put your eyes on me

560
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:22,199
现在加州已经捕捉了所有记忆
Californian now capture every memory

561
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,908
没有什么事会让我觉得比这更美好了
And I don't know how it gets better than this

562
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:31,974
你拉着我的手, 不回头地向前跑
You take my hand and drag me head first

563
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:33,983
我不怕冒险
Fearless

564
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:39,681
不知道是为什么, 和你在一起我可以舞蹈
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

565
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,518
穿着我最精致的裙子, 哪怕是在暴风雨中
In a storm in my best dress

566
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,353
我不怕冒险
Fearless

567
00:59:55,989 --> 01:00:03,011
我绝不, 绝不再犹豫
I won't hesitate no more, no more (I'm yours)

568
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:10,683
一刻也不能再等, 我是你的
It cannot wait, I'm yours(I'm yours)

569
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:18,798
嘿, 嘿, 嘿~
Hey, hey, hey~ (hey, soul sister)

570
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:26,660
因为没有什么事会让我觉得比这更美好了
Cauz I don't know how it gets better than this

571
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:30,361
你拉着我的手, 不回头地拽着我向前跑
You take my hand and drag me head first

572
01:00:30,361 --> 01:00:32,159
我不怕冒险
Fearless

573
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:38,339
不知道是为什么, 和你在一起我可以舞蹈
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

574
01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:42,619
穿着我最精致的裙子, 哪怕是在暴风雨中
In a storm in my best dress

575
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,259
我不怕冒险
Fearless

576
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:19,315
当我12岁左右时, 我开始写歌
When I started writing songs when I was about 12

577
01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:20,863
然后额
And uh

578
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:22,208
你知道那时候
you know back then

579
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,629
那最初更有点像是一种爱好
it kind of started out something that was like more of a hobby

580
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:27,043
我真的喜欢写歌
I really liked doing it

581
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:32,708
然后写歌变成一种每日放学后的活动
And then it became something that was like a daily after-school activity

582
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,859
再然后写歌变成所有我曾想做的事
And then it became all that I ever wanted to do

583
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,490
所有我曾梦想的事
all I ever thought about dreamed about

584
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,269
它完完全全变成我的一切
It became absolutely everything to me

585
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,382
我从心底里感谢你们
And I thank you from the bottom of my heart

586
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:45,964
为使得一些事对我来说意义重大, 你们为我创造的一条歌唱事业道路
for making something that means that much to me, a career path

587
01:01:53,495 --> 01:02:00,274
我倾向于写一些关于爱情和关系的歌
I... uh I tend to write a lot of songs about love and relationships that tends to be

588
01:02:00,274 --> 01:02:02,943
那些都是歌的主题
the main topic covered

589
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,623
我觉得这是因为
And I think it's because

590
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:12,164
当我们强烈地感受到一些事的时候, 我们最需要音乐来表达
we need music the most when we're feeling things really intensely

591
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:15,029
我觉得你生命当中最深刻的是
And I think the most intense times in your life are

592
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:17,819
当你陷入爱河或者分手的时候
when you're either falling in love or losing it

593
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,661
你们觉得呢
Don't you think

594
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,481
我觉得
And I think...

595
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:33,786
我觉得我应该归入绝望的浪漫主义那一类
I think I fall into the category of the hopeless romantics

596
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:35,140
我觉得你们也是
And I think you do too

597
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,258
因为你们也在这里
because you're here

598
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:44,499
我明白了一些事
I see the things

599
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:45,942
关于我们的极其微妙的事
the tricky thing about us

600
01:02:46,925 --> 01:02:49,267
关于绝望的浪漫主义的极其微妙的事就是
the tricky thing about the hopeless romantics is that

601
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:51,852
当我们爱上某人
when we fall in love with someone

602
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:52,896
当我们打招呼的时候
when we say hello

603
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,952
这是神奇的
and it's magical

604
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:02,164
我们从没想象过某天问候可能变成最后的见面
We never imagined that hello could someday turn into a goodbye

605
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,268
当我们第一次接吻的时候
And when we have first kiss with someone

606
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:05,107
这是神奇的
and it's magical

607
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:07,429
我们从没
We never

608
01:03:08,929 --> 01:03:10,033
从没
ever

609
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,989
想象过某天那可能变成最后一次亲吻
imagine that someday that could turn into a last kiss

610
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:23,036
Last Kiss - Taylor Swift

611
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,277
我依旧记得你脸上的表情
I still remember the look on your face

612
01:03:42,638 --> 01:03:46,819
点亮了凌晨1点58分的夜空
Lit through the darkness at 1:58

613
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:49,058
那些耳边轻轻划过的, 你说的悄悄话
The words that you whispered

614
01:03:49,378 --> 01:03:51,120
那是我们之间的小秘密
For just us to know

615
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,504
你告诉我, 你爱过我
You told me you loved me

616
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:55,891
那就请告诉我, 你为什么要离开
So why did you go

617
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,042
去了很遥远的地方
Away

618
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:07,823
去了很遥远的地方
Away

619
01:04:23,173 --> 01:04:25,235
我寻回了我的记忆
I do recall now

620
01:04:25,584 --> 01:04:27,293
我记得那雨滴的味道
The smell of the rain

621
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:29,678
好像一秒前, 才降落到路面上般晶莹剔透
Fresh on the pavement

622
01:04:29,993 --> 01:04:31,830
我逃离了那架即将离开地面的飞机
I ran off the plane

623
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:34,406
那个七月的第九天
That July 9th

624
01:04:34,766 --> 01:04:36,330
我能感受到你心的跳动
The beat of your heart

625
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,290
即使在厚厚的外衣的包裹下
It jumps through your shirt

626
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:40,863
依旧能感受到你臂膀带来的温暖
I can still feel your arms

627
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:45,030
但是, 现在, 我独自一人, 坐在地板上
But now I'll go sit on the floor

628
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,792
穿着残留你气味的衣服
Wearing your clothes

629
01:04:48,123 --> 01:04:50,107
我所知道的是
All that I know is

630
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:56,404
我不知道怎么样才能成为, 你会怀念的那一个
I don't know how to be something you miss

631
01:04:57,195 --> 01:05:03,657
不曾想过, 那会是我们最后的一个吻
Never thought we'd have a last kiss

632
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:17,086
不曾料到 , 我们的结局尽会是这样
I never imagined we'd end like this

633
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:24,013
你的名字, 永远留于我的唇齿之间
Your name, forever the name on my lips

634
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:28,601
我清楚的记得
I still remember

635
01:05:28,944 --> 01:05:30,704
你步调的摆动
The swing in your step

636
01:05:31,097 --> 01:05:35,199
在生活这场派对里, 又一次的成功的炫耀着
The life of the party, you're showing off again

637
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:37,912
我揉了一揉我的眼睛
And I roll my eyes and then

638
01:05:38,242 --> 01:05:39,979
然后, 你拉我进入这场舞会
You pull me in

639
01:05:40,325 --> 01:05:42,314
我不是一个喜欢跳舞的女孩
I'm not much for dancing

640
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,098
但是, 为了你, 我在脚底开出花朵
But for you I did

641
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:46,711
因为, 我爱上了
Because I love your handshake

642
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:49,146
你和我父亲握手的方式
Me and my father

643
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,313
我爱上了, 你走路时总是把手放在口袋里的样子
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets

644
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:58,177
你是如何在我喋喋不休的时候突然吻我
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something

645
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:02,391
没有一天, 我不怀念这个“粗鲁的打断方式”
There's not a day when I don't miss those rude interruptions

646
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:06,601
但是, 现在, 我独自一人坐在地板上
But now I'll go sit on the floor

647
01:06:06,972 --> 01:06:09,457
穿着残留着你气味的衣服
Wearing your clothes

648
01:06:09,813 --> 01:06:11,845
我所知道的是
All that I know is

649
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:17,461
我不知道怎么样才能成为, 你会怀念的那一个
I don't know how to be something you miss

650
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:24,900
不曾想过, 那会是我们最后的一个吻
Never thought we'd have a last kiss

651
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:38,705
不曾料到 , 我们的结局尽会是这样
Never imagined we'd end like this

652
01:06:39,072 --> 01:06:45,354
你的名字, 永远留于我的唇齿之间
Your name, forever the name on my lips

653
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:06,741
现在, 我只能看着照片里的你, 想象着我还像以前一样偷偷的看你睡着的样子
So I'll watch you live in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

654
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:15,913
我感受着你忘记我的方式, 就好像以前我感受着你的呼吸
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

655
01:07:16,205 --> 01:07:25,271
我一直和我们以前的朋友保持着联系, 只是为了能从他们那里知道, 你最近过的好不好
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are

656
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:30,749
希望你在一个很美妙的地方
Hope it's nice where you are

657
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:35,185
希望那里的阳光都是温柔的
And I hope the sun shines

658
01:07:35,494 --> 01:07:37,384
希望是一个好天气
And it's a beautiful day

659
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:39,869
希望有一些东西, 能够让你想起
And something reminds you

660
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:41,971
你曾经希望你还在我身边
You wish you had stayed

661
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:46,462
你可以改变天气, 可以改变地点
You can plan for a change in weather and town

662
01:07:46,885 --> 01:07:51,564
但是, 我从未想过你会改变你的心
But I never planned on you changing your mind

663
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:59,873
但是, 现在, 我独自一人坐在地板上
So I'll go sit on the floor

664
01:07:59,873 --> 01:08:02,693
穿着你残留着你气味的衣服
Wearing your clothes

665
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,006
我所知道的是
All that I know is

666
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:10,862
我不知道怎么样才能成为, 你会怀念的那一个
I don't know how to be something you miss

667
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:18,446
不曾想过, 那会是我们最后的一个吻
Never thought we'd have a last kiss

668
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:31,782
不曾料到 , 我们的结局尽会是这样
I never imagined we'd end like this

669
01:08:32,116 --> 01:08:38,567
你的名字, 永远留于我的唇齿之间
Your name, forever the name on my lips

670
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:45,167
就像我们最后的一个吻
Just like our last kiss

671
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:01,833
永远留于我的唇齿之间
Forever the name on my lips

672
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:11,233
就像我们的结局
Just like our last

673
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:22,830
你们这里有很多令人惊叹的乐队
You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world.

674
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:23,825
你们知道吗？
Did you know that?

675
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:39,550
Drops Of Jupiter - Taylor Swift

676
01:10:45,685 --> 01:10:48,210
他已从神奇的太空之旅归来
Now that he's back in the atmosphere

677
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:56,500
秀发上带着木星（丘比特）的眼泪
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey

678
01:10:57,436 --> 01:11:00,376
他夏日般的热情和风雨般的步伐
He acts like summer and walks like rain

679
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:08,668
令我感到了时光的流逝
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey

680
01:11:09,551 --> 01:11:12,406
他从月球归来后
Since the return from his stay on the moon

681
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:20,460
像春天一般的聆听, 像六月一样健谈
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

682
01:11:21,813 --> 01:11:25,790
告诉我, 你是否穿越了太阳的光辉
Tell me did you sail across the sun

683
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:31,127
是否看到了银河, 是否找到了星光消逝的地方
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded

684
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,169
也许天堂真的只是一个虚无缥缈的梦想
And that heaven is overrated

685
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:38,213
告诉我, 你是否爱上了一颗流星
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star

686
01:11:38,612 --> 01:11:40,705
没有永恒伤疤的流星
One without a permanent scar

687
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:48,290
当你在星空中寻求自我的时候, 是否想到了我
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

688
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:11,954
他结束了完美的太空假日
Now that he's back from that soul vacation

689
01:12:12,297 --> 01:12:20,474
正在归途中穿越星座
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey

690
01:12:20,802 --> 01:12:23,794
他边听莫扎特边练跆拳道
He checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo

691
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:32,219
令我感叹时光的交错
Reminds me that there's a wound to grow, hey, hey

692
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,400
现在这个连星际旅行都经历过的他
Now he's back in the atmosphere

693
01:12:35,442 --> 01:12:39,868
我真的很害怕, 他会认为我是一个胆小的懦夫
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane

694
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:44,270
她会说我从来没有飞翔的胆量, 也永远不会体验到着陆的快感
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

695
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,256
告诉我, 风儿是否令你倾心
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet

696
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:53,300
你是否得以和日出之光共舞
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day

697
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:56,001
一起回到了那灿烂的银河
And head back to the Milky Way

698
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:59,886
金星（维纳斯）的美丽是否带给了你惊喜
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind

699
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:02,647
这一切是否实现了你所有的梦想
Was it everything you wanted to find

700
01:13:02,932 --> 01:13:08,733
当你在星空中寻求自我的时候, 是否想到了我
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

701
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,976
你能想像这样的生活吗：没有爱, 没有自豪, 没有油炸鸡块
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken

702
01:13:22,343 --> 01:13:26,327
即使有时我知道你是错的
Your best friend always sticking up for you

703
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:29,616
你最好的朋友, 还总是和你站在一起
Even when I know you're wrong

704
01:13:29,616 --> 01:13:31,739
你能想像你没有了与爱人的第一次共舞
Can you imagine no first dance

705
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,229
没有了浪漫的情调, 没有了五个小时的电话缠绵
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation

706
01:13:36,564 --> 01:13:42,219
你没有了曾经拥有的最好的咖啡, 没有了我
The best soy latte that you ever had and . . . me

707
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:54,387
告诉我, 风儿是否令你倾心
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet

708
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:59,726
你是否得以和日出之光共舞
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day

709
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,159
一起回到了那灿烂的银河
And head back to the Milky Way

710
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:06,463
告诉我, 你是否爱上了一颗流星
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star

711
01:14:06,787 --> 01:14:09,037
一颗没有永恒伤疤的流星
One without a permanent scar

712
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:13,623
当你在星空中寻求自我的时候, 是否想到了我
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

713
01:14:14,138 --> 01:14:21,608
呐 呐 呐 ...
Na na na ......

714
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,973
哦...
Oh......

715
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:36,175
呐 呐 呐 ...
Na na na ......

716
01:14:36,175 --> 01:14:39,919
你能想像这样的生活吗：没有爱, 没有自豪, 没有油炸鸡块
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken

717
01:14:39,919 --> 01:14:44,984
即使有时我知道你是错的
Your best friend always sticking up for you

718
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,692
你最好的朋友, 还总是和你站在一起
Even when I know you're wrong

719
01:14:48,032 --> 01:14:49,847
你能想像没有了与爱人的第一次共舞
Can you imagine no first dance

720
01:14:50,136 --> 01:14:54,479
没有了浪漫的情调, 没有了五个小时的电话缠绵
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation

721
01:14:54,825 --> 01:15:00,145
没有了曾经拥有的最好的咖啡, 没有了我
The best soy latte that you ever had and . . . me

722
01:15:25,302 --> 01:15:37,001
You Belong With Me - Taylor Swift

723
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:44,531
如果你可以看到我才是由始至终都理解你的人
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

724
01:15:44,937 --> 01:15:50,623
一直陪着你, 为什么你就是不明白
been here all along so why can't you see

725
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:54,318
你属于我
You belong with me

726
01:15:54,643 --> 01:15:56,378
你属于我
You belong with me

727
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:06,860
你正和女朋友聊电话, 她很不高兴
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset.

728
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,653
她因为你说的某些话而发火
She's going off about something that you said

729
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:16,035
她不像我, 领会你的幽默感
Cuz she doesn't, get your humor like I do

730
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,604
我在房间里, 又是一个平凡的星期二晚上
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night

731
01:16:21,904 --> 01:16:25,392
我在听那种她不喜欢的音乐
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

732
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:30,822
她不像我对你如此了解
And she'll never know your story like I do

733
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,285
但她穿短裙
She wears short skirts

734
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,166
我穿T恤
I wear T-shirts

735
01:16:36,476 --> 01:16:37,896
她是啦啦队队长
She's cheer captain

736
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:39,715
而我却坐在露天看台上
And I'm on the bleachers

737
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:42,246
希望你会有一天醒来发现
Dreaming about the day when you wake up

738
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:44,724
你理想中的女孩
And find what you're looking for

739
01:16:45,061 --> 01:16:46,687
一直就在你身边
Has been here the whole time

740
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:50,811
如果你可以看到我才是由始至终都理解你的人
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

741
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:56,943
一直陪着你, 为什么你就是不明白
Been here all along so why can't you see

742
01:16:57,263 --> 01:17:01,010
你属于我
You belong with me

743
01:17:01,341 --> 01:17:02,837
你属于我
You belong with me

744
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:34,711
你穿着你的旧牛仔裤和我一起在街上闲逛
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

745
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:38,413
我不禁开始想象, 原本就应该是这样
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be

746
01:18:38,698 --> 01:18:42,293
在公园长椅上我一边傻笑一边在想
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

747
01:18:42,638 --> 01:18:45,150
嘿, 这居然如此容易
Hey isn't this easy

748
01:18:45,485 --> 01:18:49,316
你的笑容可以照亮整个城镇
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

749
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:53,312
自从她把你抛弃之后我已经有一段时间没有看到了
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

750
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:54,528
你说你没事
You say you're fine

751
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:56,443
我知道你应该更加坚强
I know you better then that

752
01:18:56,862 --> 01:19:00,042
嘿, 这样的女孩你为什么还紧追不放
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

753
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:02,106
她穿高跟鞋
She wears high heels

754
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:03,786
我穿运动鞋
I wear sneakers

755
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,853
她是啦啦队队长
She's cheer captain and

756
01:19:06,202 --> 01:19:07,485
而我却坐在露天看台上
I'm on the bleachers

757
01:19:07,857 --> 01:19:10,761
希望你会有一天醒来发现
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

758
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:12,537
你理想中的女孩

01:19:12,828 --> 01:19:14,411
一直就在你身边

760
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:22,178
如果你可以看到我才是由始至终都理解你的人
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

761
01:19:22,506 --> 01:19:28,312
一直陪着你, 为什么你就是不明白
Been here all along so why can't you see

762
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:32,710
你属于我
You belong with me

763
01:19:33,601 --> 01:19:37,110
我站在你家的后门口等着你
Standing by and waiting at your back door

764
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:40,338
一直等着你, 你怎么还不明白
All this time how could you not know

765
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:43,147
亲爱的
Baby....

你属于我
You belong with me

768
01:20:00,976 --> 01:20:04,441
我想起你开车到我家
I remember you drivin' to my house

769
01:20:04,816 --> 01:20:06,173
在半夜的时候
In the middle of the night

770
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,089
我才是那个当你要哭时
I'm the one who makes you laugh

771
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:10,105
让你笑的那个人
When you know you're about to cry

772
01:20:10,693 --> 01:20:11,696
我知道你最喜欢的歌
And I know your favorite songs

773
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:13,806
你也告诉了我你的梦想
And you tell me about your dreams

774
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:15,392
我想我知道你的归宿
Think I know where you belong

775
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:19,415
我想你属于我
Think I know it's with me...

776
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:45,436
你难道看不出我才是由始至终都理解你的人
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

777
01:20:45,534 --> 01:20:47,643
一直陪着你

一直等着你

亲爱的你怎么还不明白

亲爱的, 你属于我

Been here all along

786
01:21:17,393 --> 01:21:20,862
为什么你就是不明白
So why can't you see

787
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:25,041
你属于我
You belong with me

788
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:29,713
我站在你家的后门口等着你
Standing by and waiting at your back door

789
01:21:30,025 --> 01:21:31,129
一直等着你
All this time

790
01:21:31,443 --> 01:21:33,097
你怎么还不明白
How could you not know

791
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:39,930
亲爱的, 你属于我
Baby you belong with me

792
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,476
你属于我
You belong with me

793
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,482
你属于我
You belong with me

794
01:21:46,137 --> 01:21:50,443
你有没有想过也许就是这样
Have you ever thought just maybe

795
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:54,286
你属于我
You belong with me

796
01:21:54,286 --> 01:21:56,240
你属于我
You belong with me

797
01:23:02,946 --> 01:23:07,714
Dear John - Taylor Swift

798
01:23:26,577 --> 01:23:28,720
那些我围绕在你周围的夜晚
Long were the nights

799
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:33,627
是那么的漫长
When my days once revolved around you

800
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:41,306
低头数着自己的步子
Counting my footsteps

801
01:23:41,357 --> 01:23:48,983
祈祷着, 这一次我的世界不会再次的垮塌
Prayin' the floor won't fall through, again

802
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:55,580
那时, 妈妈告诫我“我是迷失了自己”
My mother accused me of losing my mind

803
01:23:55,954 --> 01:24:01,616
但是我却对她发誓, 我很好
But I swore I was fine

804
01:24:02,646 --> 01:24:06,716
你为我描绘了一片湛蓝的天空
You paint me a blue sky and go back

805
01:24:07,076 --> 01:24:09,711
转过身时却已是大雨倾盆而下
And turn it to rain

806
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:17,297
我好像生活在你设计的象棋游戏里
And I lived in your chess game

807
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:21,972
每一天, 你都会换上新的规则
But you changed the rules every day

808
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:30,446
我不知道, 今晚电话另一头的
Wonderin which version of you

809
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:37,604
是哪一个你
I might get on the phone, tonight

810
01:24:38,258 --> 01:24:40,694
我放弃了继续走下去
Well I stopped pickin' up

811
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:46,589
就让这首歌告诉你为什么
And this song is to let you know why

812
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:53,376
亲爱的约翰
Dear John

813
01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:59,519
现在, 我知道你已经离开
I see it all now that you're gone

814
01:24:59,883 --> 01:25:03,359
难道你觉得我还太年轻
Don't you think I was too young

815
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:05,648
还是不碰为好？
To be messed with

816
01:25:05,974 --> 01:25:08,037
一个女孩, 穿着美丽的裙子
The girl in the dress

817
01:25:08,408 --> 01:25:14,220
一路哭泣着朝着家走去
Cried the whole way home

818
01:25:14,633 --> 01:25:17,676
我早应知道
I shoulda known.

819
01:25:26,804 --> 01:25:29,283
也许我应该责怪我
Well maybe it's me

820
01:25:29,637 --> 01:25:34,105
和我那盲目的乐观主义
And my blind optimism to blame

821
01:25:38,085 --> 01:25:41,828
也许我应该责怪你, 还有你那
Maybe its you and your sick need

822
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:46,320
“给了爱, 然后立刻将爱抽离你心底”的坏习惯
To give love then take it away

823
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:53,158
你会把我的名字放在
And you'll add my name

824
01:25:53,469 --> 01:25:56,856
那份长长的“背叛者名单里” 吧
To your long list of traitors

825
01:25:56,856 --> 01:26:01,804
我真的不能理解
Who don't understand

826
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:05,173
回忆当时, 懊悔着
And I'll look back in regret

827
01:26:05,503 --> 01:26:08,168
他们对我的劝告“尽最大努力, 跑得越快越好”
How I ignored when they said

828
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:14,116
就这样的被我无视
Run as fast as you can

829
01:26:14,498 --> 01:26:17,857
亲爱的约翰
Dear John

830
01:26:18,213 --> 01:26:23,705
现在, 我知道你已经离开
I see it all now that you're gone

831
01:26:24,364 --> 01:26:27,593
难道你觉得我还太年轻
Don't you think I was too young

832
01:26:27,901 --> 01:26:29,882
还是不碰为好？
To be messed with

833
01:26:30,241 --> 01:26:32,372
一个女孩, 穿着美丽的裙子
The girl in the dress

834
01:26:32,663 --> 01:26:38,263
一路哭泣着朝着家走去
Cried the whole way home

835
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:41,957
亲爱的约翰
Dear John

836
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:47,714
我知道这一切都是错误
I see it all now it was wrong

837
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:51,942
难道你不认为19岁真的太年轻
Don't you think nineteen's too young

838
01:26:52,314 --> 01:26:56,341
被邀请进你那黑暗的, 扭曲的游戏吗？
To be played by your dark twisted games

839
01:26:56,655 --> 01:27:02,475
当我如此爱你的时候
When I loved you so

840
01:27:02,772 --> 01:27:06,736
我应该早就知道
I shoulda known

841
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:18,243
你真的是一个说“对不起”的行家
You are an expert at sorry

842
01:27:18,546 --> 01:27:21,237
让每一字都那么的含糊不清
And keeping lines blurry

843
01:27:21,594 --> 01:27:24,420
我从来没有在你的那些“考察”里
And never impressed by me

844
01:27:24,788 --> 01:27:26,579
给你留下深刻的印象
Acing your tests

845
01:27:26,895 --> 01:27:29,945
那些原本美丽的现在却
All the girls that you run dry

846
01:27:30,296 --> 01:27:32,376
毫无生气的眼睛背后
Have tired lifeless eyes

847
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:39,024
是你的无情燃尽了她们的泪滴
Cuz you burned them out

848
01:27:39,412 --> 01:27:42,117
在被你烈火般灼伤之前
But I took your matches

849
01:27:42,438 --> 01:27:44,946
我已离开了你的游戏
Before fire could catch me

850
01:27:44,946 --> 01:27:50,405
所以, 现在不要看着有我的方向
So don't look now

851
01:27:51,624 --> 01:27:54,572
我就如烟火般
I'm shining like fireworks

852
01:27:54,788 --> 01:28:01,006
在你悲伤孤独的小镇上空灿烂的绽放着
Over your sad empty town

853
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:20,581
喔
Oh woah oh

854
01:28:20,956 --> 01:28:24,466
亲爱的约翰
Dear John

855
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:30,415
现在, 我知道你已经离开
I see it all now that you're gone

856
01:28:30,732 --> 01:28:34,269
难道你觉得我还太年轻
Don't you think I was too young

857
01:28:34,573 --> 01:28:36,415
还是不碰为好？
To be messed with

858
01:28:36,573 --> 01:28:38,715
一个女孩, 穿着美丽的裙子
The girl in the dress

859
01:28:39,034 --> 01:28:48,589
一路哭泣着朝着家走去
Cried the whole way home

860
01:28:48,882 --> 01:28:54,161
现在, 我知道你已经离开
I see it all now that you're gone

861
01:28:54,725 --> 01:28:58,469
难道你觉得我还太年轻
Don't you think I was too young

862
01:28:58,822 --> 01:29:00,297
还是不碰为好？
To be messed with

863
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:03,312
一个女孩, 穿着美丽的裙子
The girl in the dress

864
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:08,917
写下一首给你的歌
Wrote you a song

865
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,256
你早就应该知道
You shoulda known

866
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:28,968
你难道不认为我太年轻了吗？
Don't you think I was too young

867
01:29:32,015 --> 01:29:34,492
你真的应该早就知道
You shoulda known.

868
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:25,714
Enchanted - Taylor Swift

869
01:32:31,374 --> 01:32:36,941
我在这里, 在这样的夜晚里, 还是一样, 勉强的笑声, 虚伪的微笑
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles

870
01:32:37,293 --> 01:32:40,781
那个地方, 也还是一样的, 疲乏而孤单
Same old tired, lonely place

871
01:32:43,025 --> 01:32:45,833
虚伪毫无保留的如铜墙铁壁般将我包围
Walls of insincerity

872
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:52,198
还是一样, 飘忽不定的眼神, 空空荡荡的房子, 但是就在你出现的那一瞬间, 这一切立即消失的无影无踪
Shifiting eyes and vancancy vanished when I saw your face

873
01:32:52,519 --> 01:33:02,451
我的零零碎碎的词字, 只能拼凑出“我已经对你着了迷 ”
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

874
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:09,282
你的眼睛悄悄向我传达着“我们以前见过吗？”
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"

875
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:16,818
来自这个拥挤空间的另一个角落, 你完美的侧脸已踏上了通向我心房的道路
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me

876
01:33:18,032 --> 01:33:21,074
一段俏皮的小交流, 就这样有了开始
The playful conversation starts

877
01:33:21,444 --> 01:33:28,141
回应着你传达的每一个神态, 就好象悄悄的传递着我们秘密的小纸条
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy

878
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:37,923
那就是, 我已经对你着迷
And it was enchanting to meet you

879
01:33:39,092 --> 01:33:49,623
我的零零碎碎的词字, 只能拼凑出“我已经对你着了迷 ”
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

880
01:33:54,073 --> 01:33:59,779
如此绚丽的夜晚, 你会就这样让它成为记忆里的一个片段吗？
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go

881
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:05,674
我小小的惊讶着, 涨红了脸走在回家的路上
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home

882
01:34:05,963 --> 01:34:11,384
我用了好久好久的时间来猜想, 你是否知道
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

883
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:19,295
我已经对你着迷
I was enchanted to meet you

884
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:25,380
有这样一个问题, 在我脑海里徘徊
The lingering question kept me up

885
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:28,329
凌晨2点, 谁才是你心中那一个呢？
2 am, who do you love?

886
01:34:28,707 --> 01:34:31,978
我无法将这个问题从我脑海中删去, 直至我完完全全的清醒
I wonder till I'm wide awake

887
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:37,082
此时, 我正心思不宁的在房间里来来回回的走动
Now I'm pacing back and forth

888
01:34:37,399 --> 01:34:39,840
祈祷着, 此刻, 你就在房门的另一面
Wishing you were at my door

889
01:34:40,135 --> 01:34:44,331
打开门后, 你会对我说
I'd open up and you would say

890
01:34:44,642 --> 01:34:53,088
嗨, 我已经对你着了迷
Hey, it was enchanted to meet you

891
01:34:55,705 --> 01:35:08,574
我现在只知道, 我已经对你着了迷
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

892
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:15,925
如此绚丽的夜晚, 你会让它就这样过去吗
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go

893
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:21,772
我小小的惊讶着, 涨红了脸走在回家的路上
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home

894
01:35:22,077 --> 01:35:28,967
我用了好久好久的时间来猜想, 你是否知道
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

895
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:39,368
这个夜晚是如此的完美无瑕, 你会就这样让它成为记忆里的一个片段吗？
This night is flawless, don't you let it go

896
01:35:39,729 --> 01:35:45,217
我小小的惊讶着, 在那里独自跳着舞
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone

897
01:35:45,605 --> 01:35:50,835
我用了好久好久的时间来猜想, 你是否知道
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

898
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:58,228
我已经对你着迷
I was enchanted to meet you

899
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:22,893
我双手合十, 祈祷着这将会成为我们故事的第一页
This is me praying that this was the very first page

900
01:36:23,214 --> 01:36:25,792
而不是这个画上句号前的话语
Not where the story line ends

901
01:36:26,209 --> 01:36:31,692
脑海里不停的回放着你的名字, 直到你再一次出现在我的面前
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again

902
01:36:32,043 --> 01:36:37,593
这些就是保留在我心底的词句, 就和我马上就要离开的事实一样
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon

903
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:44,233
我已经迷上了你
I was enchanted to meet you

904
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:54,578
希望你不要爱上别人
Please don't be in love with someone else

905
01:36:54,884 --> 01:37:00,192
希望你不要让我一直等着你
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

906
01:37:00,487 --> 01:37:06,370
希望你不要爱上别人
Please don't be in love with someone else

907
01:37:06,712 --> 01:37:11,799
希望你不要让我一直等着你
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

908
01:37:12,289 --> 01:37:17,956
希望你不要爱上别人
Please don't be in love with someone else

909
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:23,756
希望你不要让我一直等着你
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

910
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:42,217
如此绚丽的夜晚, 你会让它就这样过去吗
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go

911
01:37:42,545 --> 01:37:48,064
我小小的惊讶着, 涨红了脸走在回家的路上
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home

912
01:37:48,393 --> 01:37:57,948
我用了好久好久的时间来猜想, 你是否知道
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

913
01:37:59,913 --> 01:38:05,529
这个夜晚是如此的完美无瑕, 你会就这样让它成为记忆里的一个片段吗？
This night is flawless, don't you let it go

914
01:38:05,864 --> 01:38:11,519
我小小的惊讶着, 在那里独自跳着舞
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone

915
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:17,322
用了好久好久的时间来猜想, 你是否知道
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

916
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:23,824
我已经对你着迷
I was enchanted to meet you

917
01:38:28,484 --> 01:38:34,432
希望你不要让我一直等着你
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

918
01:41:08,387 --> 01:41:15,049
Haunted - Taylor Swift

919
01:41:30,289 --> 01:41:33,428
你, 和我, 走在一条脆弱易碎的道路上
You and I walk a fragile line

920
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:36,611
其实, 我的心里一直都很清楚
I have known it all this time

921
01:41:36,764 --> 01:41:40,273
但是, 我不曾想到, 我会亲眼见证它的破碎
But I never thought I'd live to see it break

922
01:41:42,283 --> 01:41:44,905
黑暗正慢慢的将我吞噬, 寂静恐怖的将我淹没
It's getting dark and its all too quiet

923
01:41:45,227 --> 01:41:47,387
已经无法相信这一切的一切
And I can't trust anything now

924
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:51,744
无法弥补的错误, 正在将你包围
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake

925
01:41:54,174 --> 01:41:59,883
努力的屏住呼吸, 但请不要再迷失你自己了
Oh,holding my breathe, won't lose you again

926
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:05,743
你的眼睛, 也失去了温暖的光芒
Something's made your eyes go cold

927
01:42:06,073 --> 01:42:09,116
我请求着, 不要就这样把我丢下
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

928
01:42:09,402 --> 01:42:11,926
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

929
01:42:12,272 --> 01:42:17,729
有些事情走向了错误的方向, 你曾经是我的世界
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted

930
01:42:18,078 --> 01:42:21,004
请求着, 不要就这样离我而去
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

931
01:42:21,322 --> 01:42:23,811
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

932
01:42:24,148 --> 01:42:26,102
当你不在身边的时候, 我无法呼吸
Can't breathe whenever you're gone

933
01:42:26,395 --> 01:42:29,847
已经没有办法回到过去, 我饱受着煎熬
Can't turn back now I'm haunted

934
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:44,871
坐在这里, 脑海里浮现的是我们曾经的一切
Stood there and watched you walk away

935
01:42:45,343 --> 01:42:47,536
眼前却是你渐渐远去的场景
From everything we had

936
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:52,498
但是, 我对你说过的话, 还是源于我的心底
But I still mean every word I say to you

937
01:42:53,247 --> 01:42:56,662
他, 也许会试着带走我的痛苦
He will try to take away my pain

938
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:59,336
他, 也许能让我微笑
And he just might make me smile

939
01:42:59,689 --> 01:43:04,342
但是, 我一直都希望, 那个人是你
But the whole time I'm wishin he was you instead

940
01:43:05,463 --> 01:43:10,938
努力的屏住呼吸, 再也不会见到你
Oh, holding my breath, won't see you again

941
01:43:11,303 --> 01:43:17,069
有些事情让我一直犹豫不决
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

942
01:43:17,379 --> 01:43:20,204
我请求着, 不要就这样把我丢下
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

943
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,103
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

944
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:28,869
一些什么事情正走向无法挽回的境界, 你曾经是我的世界
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted

945
01:43:29,234 --> 01:43:32,092
请求着, 不要就这样离我而去
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

946
01:43:32,405 --> 01:43:34,853
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

947
01:43:35,165 --> 01:43:37,381
当你不在我身边的时候我无法呼吸
Can't breathe whenever you're gone

948
01:43:37,674 --> 01:43:40,795
已经没有办法回到过去, 我饱受着煎熬
Can't turn back now I'm haunted

949
01:43:51,654 --> 01:44:08,941
我知道, 我真的知道, 我一直都知道
I know, I know, I just know

950
01:44:09,593 --> 01:44:15,492
你还没有离开, 你不能就这样离开
You're not gone, you can't be gone

951
01:44:15,805 --> 01:44:16,738
不能就这样离我而去
No

952
01:44:16,861 --> 01:44:19,536
我祈求着, 不要就这样把我丢下
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

953
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,336
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

954
01:44:22,641 --> 01:44:24,678
有些事情走向了错误的方向
Something's gone terribly wrong

955
01:44:25,001 --> 01:44:28,190
无法完成那些我们已经揭开的篇章
Won't finish what you started

956
01:44:28,476 --> 01:44:31,414
祈求着, 不要就这样把我丢下
Come on, come on don't leave me like this

957
01:44:31,737 --> 01:44:34,192
我以为你已经清楚一切
I thought I had you figured out

958
01:44:34,552 --> 01:44:38,979
当你离开的时候, 我无法呼吸, 无法回到过去
Can't breathe whenever you're gone can't go back

959
01:44:38,979 --> 01:44:40,118
我饱受着煎熬
I'm haunted

960
01:44:41,049 --> 01:44:50,315
喔, 喔, 喔, 喔, 喔
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

961
01:44:51,392 --> 01:44:54,949
我们走在一条易碎的道路上
You and I walk a fragile line

962
01:44:55,369 --> 01:44:58,737
一直以来, 我都知道
I have known it all this time

963
01:44:59,032 --> 01:45:01,646
但是我从没想过我会眼看着它破碎
Never ever thought i'd see it break

964
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:05,245
从没想过, 会是这样
Never thought i'd see it

965
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:51,926
这张最新的专辑《爱的告白》受到很多东西的启发
This last album "Speak Now" was inspired by a lot of things

966
01:45:52,252 --> 01:45:53,421
都是发生在我的生活当中
that happened to me in my life

967
01:45:53,655 --> 01:45:56,652
但有一首歌受到的启发是
But one thing that inspired the song was um

968
01:45:58,242 --> 01:46:01,146
几年前, 我们进行我们第一次的巡回演唱
we went on our very first headlining tour a few years ago

969
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:05,405
我曾站在那里
And I used to stand there before

970
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,858
我走上舞台并聆听观众
I would go on stage and listen to the crowd

971
01:46:08,858 --> 01:46:13,148
发出最令人惊奇的尖叫声
making the most amazing magical loud screaming sounds

972
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,626
那就是我说的叫声
That is exactly the sound I'm talking about

973
01:46:32,847 --> 01:46:35,338
然后我听见
And I hear and I

974
01:46:35,338 --> 01:46:38,527
首先我会坐在那然后思考
first of all  I ... I would sit there and think

975
01:46:39,134 --> 01:46:42,090
我不敢相信我在生命当中能够听到那种声音
I can't believe I get to hear that sound one time in my life

976
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,338
然后呢
And uh...

977
01:46:43,462 --> 01:46:45,430
我有这个旋律萦绕在我的脑海
and I would get a melody stuck in my head

978
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:50,107
这个旋律一直在我脑海中回荡, 直到
And I could never get this melody out of my head until

979
01:46:50,107 --> 01:46:52,438
我最终把它写进一首歌中
I finally wrote it into a song

980
01:46:52,438 --> 01:46:54,797
我把那首歌叫做“万岁”
And uh I called that song "Long Live"

981
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:01,342
感谢你们为我们呐喊
Thank you so much for screaming for us

982
01:47:01,718 --> 01:47:05,229
这首歌是完全百分之百为你们准备的
This song is so completely a hundred percent for you

983
01:47:10,195 --> 01:47:19,741
Long Live - Taylor Swift

984
01:47:27,044 --> 01:47:29,947
我告诉自己, 要一直记得那一刻
I say remember this moment

985
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:34,861
印刻在脑海里
In the back of my mind

986
01:47:36,461 --> 01:47:40,018
那时的我们, 站在那里, 不停地挥动手臂
The time we stood with our shaking hands

987
01:47:40,275 --> 01:47:43,810
看台的人群, 开始疯狂起来
The crowds in stands went wild

988
01:47:45,931 --> 01:47:49,020
曾经, 我们是王国里的国王与王后
We were the kings and the queens

989
01:47:50,517 --> 01:47:53,371
他们呼喊着我们的名字
And they read off our names

990
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:58,711
繁星下, 你的舞步向我诉说着
The night you danced like you knew our lives

991
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:02,501
我们的生活会就此改写
Would never be the same

992
01:48:04,554 --> 01:48:07,597
你扬起你的头, 好似英雄一般
You held your head like a hero

993
01:48:09,334 --> 01:48:12,092
在史册的那一页
On a history book page

994
01:48:14,152 --> 01:48:16,960
这, 是一个年代的末篇
It was the end of a decade

995
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:21,924
却是一个新时代的开始
But the start of an age

996
01:48:24,726 --> 01:48:28,189
万岁！ 那些我们并肩穿越的困难艰险
Long live the walls we crashed through

997
01:48:28,386 --> 01:48:32,684
王国的光芒如此耀眼, 只因为你和我
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

998
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:37,413
我在大声呼喊着, “万岁, 那些我们一起创造的奇迹“
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made

999
01:48:37,583 --> 01:48:40,316
就让那些虚伪的人, 冲我们来吧
And bring on all the pretenders

1000
01:48:40,475 --> 01:48:45,275
总有一天, 我们会被世人铭记
One day we will be remembered

1001
01:48:46,755 --> 01:48:49,840
我告诉自己, 要记得这感受
I said remember this feeling

1002
01:48:51,713 --> 01:48:54,287
传阅着这些照片
I passed the pictures around

1003
01:48:56,347 --> 01:49:01,495
照片里的我们, 站在角落里等待着
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines

1004
01:49:01,727 --> 01:49:04,352
祈祷着这一刻的来临
Wishing for right now

1005
01:49:05,751 --> 01:49:08,890
这时, 我们是这个世界的统治者
We are the kings and the queens

1006
01:49:09,217 --> 01:49:13,105
你, 用你的棒球帽交换了一顶皇冠
You traded your baseball cap for a crown

1007
01:49:15,159 --> 01:49:18,434
当他们授予我们奖杯的那一刻
When they gave us our trophies

1008
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:23,587
我们将它高举过头顶
And we held them up for our town

1009
01:49:24,992 --> 01:49:28,451
愤世嫉俗的人暴跳如雷
And the cynics were outraged

1010
01:49:29,525 --> 01:49:32,193
惊声尖叫着：这实在是荒谬可笑！
Screaming, this is absurd

1011
01:49:34,118 --> 01:49:37,718
因为那些穿着带有破洞牛仔裤的小偷们
Cause for a moment a band of thieves

1012
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:44,502
曾经统治着这个世界
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

1013
01:49:44,829 --> 01:49:48,292
万岁！ 那些我们并肩穿越的困难艰险
Long live the walls we crashed through

1014
01:49:48,476 --> 01:49:52,738
王国的光芒如此耀眼, 只因为你和我
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

1015
01:49:53,068 --> 01:49:57,279
我大声呼喊着：万岁, 那些我们一起创造的奇迹
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made

1016
01:49:57,514 --> 01:50:00,570
就让那就虚伪的人, 冲着我们来吧
And bring on all the pretenders

1017
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,589
我无所畏惧
I'm not afraid

1018
01:50:03,711 --> 01:50:06,845
万岁！那些我们一起挪移的山峦
Long live all the mountains we moved

1019
01:50:07,035 --> 01:50:09,465
我生命中的那一段时间
I had the time of my life

1020
01:50:09,632 --> 01:50:11,715
曾和你一起与邪恶战斗
Fighting dragons with you

1021
01:50:12,556 --> 01:50:16,212
我大声呼喊着：就让那一刻的微笑, 一直在你的脸颊
I was screaming, long live the look on your face

1022
01:50:16,392 --> 01:50:19,253
就让那些虚伪的人, 冲着我们来吧
And bring on all the pretenders

1023
01:50:19,715 --> 01:50:23,746
有一天, 我们会被世人铭记
One day we will be remembered

1024
01:50:27,764 --> 01:50:31,556
坚持住, 直到那一刻, 世界为你旋转
Hold on to spinning around

1025
01:50:31,838 --> 01:50:36,422
五彩缤纷的纸屑, 漫天飞舞
Confetti falls to the ground

1026
01:50:36,647 --> 01:50:43,116
就让记忆里的美好, 扶持着我们, 不再坠落
May these memories break our fall

1027
01:51:03,964 --> 01:51:06,680
我们非常喜欢在你们城里游玩
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town

1028
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:08,378
你们是如此的让人惊讶
And you've been so amazing to us

1029
01:51:08,378 --> 01:51:13,244
我是说你们知道每一句歌词, 你们整个晚上都在跳舞
I mean you guys know every single word and you've danced this entire night

1030
01:51:13,244 --> 01:51:16,547
这对我和台上每个人来说意味着一切
And it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage

1031
01:51:16,547 --> 01:51:17,708
谢谢你们
Thank you

1032
01:51:22,997 --> 01:51:25,944
你用一点点的时间
And you take a moment

1033
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:29,826
向我起誓
And promise me this:

1034
01:51:31,838 --> 01:51:34,553
一直站在我的身边, 哪怕是沧海桑田
That you'll stand by me forever

1035
01:51:35,319 --> 01:51:39,671
但是, 如果有一天, 上帝阻止了命运的脚步
But if god forbid fate should step in

1036
01:51:41,265 --> 01:51:44,262
将我们的结局改写为“再也不见”
And force us into a goodbye

1037
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,473
也许在未来的某一天, 你有了孩子
If you have children someday

1038
01:51:50,952 --> 01:51:53,573
当他们指着这些照片的时候
When they point to the pictures

1039
01:51:55,349 --> 01:51:58,070
请告诉他们, 我的名字
Please tell them my name

1040
01:52:00,734 --> 01:52:04,762
告诉他们, 那时, 人群是如何的开始疯狂
Tell them how the crowds went wild

1041
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:09,533
告诉他们 , 我是多希望, 他们能够闪亮
Tell them how I hope they shine

1042
01:52:10,658 --> 01:52:14,069
万岁！那些我们一起穿越的困难
Long live the walls we crashed through

1043
01:52:14,259 --> 01:52:19,500
曾经, 我与你分享着生命
I had the time of my life with you

1044
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,242
万万岁！那些我们一起穿越的困难
Long, long live the walls we crashed through

1045
01:52:23,524 --> 01:52:27,875
那个王国的光芒如此耀眼, 只因为你和我
All the candlelight shined just for me and you

1046
01:52:28,483 --> 01:52:32,651
我曾经放声大喊：万岁, 那些我们一起创造的奇迹
And I was screaming, long live all the magic we made

1047
01:52:32,837 --> 01:52:35,646
就让那就虚伪的人们, 冲着我们来吧
And bring on all the pretenders

1048
01:52:35,927 --> 01:52:38,405
我无所畏惧
I'm not afraid

1049
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:42,106
吟唱着：万岁, 那些我们一起挪移的山峦
Singing long live all the mountains we moved

1050
01:52:42,286 --> 01:52:44,818
我曾经和你一起
I had the time of my life

1051
01:52:44,972 --> 01:52:47,065
与邪恶战斗
Fighting dragons with you

1052
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:51,466
万万岁！你脸上的神情
Long, long live the look on your face

1053
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:54,601
就让那些虚伪的人们, 冲着来吧
And bring on all the pretenders

1054
01:52:55,165 --> 01:53:01,903
总有一天, 我们会被世人铭记
One day we will be remembered

1055
01:53:53,652 --> 01:53:58,896
我禁不住注意到, 今晚这是一群有着非常闪耀的亮光的观众
I can't help but notice this is a very sparkly glittery crowds tonight

1056
01:53:58,896 --> 01:53:59,596
我觉得
I think...

1057
01:54:04,891 --> 01:54:06,710
我看见有些人带了些很亮的东西
I see some of you brought things light up

1058
01:54:07,136 --> 01:54:11,006
不如每个有手机或者手电筒的人
What if what if everybody who has like a cellphone or

1059
01:54:11,081 --> 01:54:13,297
我不知道谁随身携带手电筒
flashlight. I don't know who carries around a flashlight

1060
01:54:13,297 --> 01:54:14,294
如果你带了的话
But if you do

1061
01:54:15,183 --> 01:54:16,777
你们能为我把它高高举起吗？
could you put it up in the air for me?

1062
01:54:25,105 --> 01:54:26,696
噢, 真好看
Oh that's pretty

1063
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,539
你知道有件事
You know the thing

1064
01:54:35,964 --> 01:54:40,406
关于人生的事就是每次你学到新的一课
the thing about life is that every time you learn a new lesson

1065
01:54:41,815 --> 01:54:44,359
在附近, 总会有另一个等着你
There is just another one right around the corner

1066
01:54:44,359 --> 01:54:46,833
你永远都不会知道所有的事
You know, you never know everything

1067
01:54:48,334 --> 01:54:51,159
我觉得对我来时, 我有点放弃, 就像
I think you know for me I just kind of giving up and I'm like

1068
01:54:51,159 --> 01:54:54,095
跟我将要知道的相比, 我现在一无所知
I know nothing compared to what I'm going to know some day

1069
01:54:55,115 --> 01:54:59,283
不久前我就没有觉得我懂得每件事了
And uh I stoped thinking I knew everything a while ago

1070
01:54:59,514 --> 01:55:06,112
我觉得最后一次我认为我懂得每件事是在十五岁的时候
I think last time I thought I knew everything I was uh... fifteen

1071
01:55:08,826 --> 01:55:13,134
Fifteen - Taylor Swift

1072
01:55:18,047 --> 01:55:21,745
你做完深呼吸, 穿过了门
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors

1073
01:55:21,932 --> 01:55:26,051
这是你开学第一天的早晨
It's the morning of your very first day

1074
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:32,462
你向那些新朋友们打招呼
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while

1075
01:55:32,629 --> 01:55:36,678
试着与每个人好好相处
Try and stay out of everybodys way

1076
01:55:39,247 --> 01:55:43,260
你才刚刚一年级, 你将在这里
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here

1077
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:48,597
在这个小镇度过接下来的四年
For the next four years in this town

1078
01:55:48,827 --> 01:55:54,167
心里偷偷盼望着哪个高年级男生瞧过来对你说：
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say

1079
01:55:54,314 --> 01:56:01,932
“我以前怎么没在这一带见过你？”
You know I haven't seen you around before

1080
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:10,168
因为当你还是十五岁, 有人告诉你他们爱你
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

1081
01:56:10,636 --> 01:56:13,448
你会全然相信
You gonna believe them

1082
01:56:13,912 --> 01:56:17,331
当你还是十五岁
And when you're fifteen

1083
01:56:17,569 --> 01:56:24,397
就感觉没有什么是需要琢磨的
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out

1084
01:56:25,474 --> 01:56:28,514
只需要数到十, 就会信以为真
Well count to ten, take it in

1085
01:56:28,747 --> 01:56:39,693
这就是在你知道你是谁之前那十五岁的青春
This is life before you know who you're gonna be at fifteen

1086
01:56:49,855 --> 01:56:54,113
你坐在班级里, 挨着一个叫阿比盖尔的红发女孩
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail

1087
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:57,254
不用多久你们就成了最好的朋友
And soon enough you're best friends

1088
01:56:59,965 --> 01:57:03,805
嘲笑着那些自以为魅压群芳的女孩
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool

1089
01:57:03,971 --> 01:57:07,548
我们总是想着尽早离开这里
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

1090
01:57:09,373 --> 01:57:15,361
而后你有了你人生的初次约会, 他开来一辆车
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car

1091
01:57:15,563 --> 01:57:19,620
你就感觉像是在飞
And you're feeling like flying

1092
01:57:20,088 --> 01:57:24,354
妈妈在焦虑地等候, 而你却已相信他就是你的唯一
And your mama's waiting up and you think he's the one

1093
01:57:24,503 --> 01:57:29,541
你们在屋子里彻夜狂欢
And you're dancing round your room when the night ends

1094
01:57:29,775 --> 01:57:32,401
彻夜地
When the night ends

1095
01:57:32,588 --> 01:57:39,325
因为当你还是十五岁, 有人告诉你他们爱你
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

1096
01:57:39,509 --> 01:57:42,365
你会全然相信
You gonna believe them

1097
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:48,591
当你还是十五岁, 你的初吻
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss

1098
01:57:48,823 --> 01:57:54,439
会让你飘若天仙
Makes your head spin round well

1099
01:57:54,627 --> 01:58:02,676
在你的人生里有着比/和橄榄球队的男孩约会更重要的事情
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team

1100
01:58:03,664 --> 01:58:07,544
但在十五岁, 我不曾懂得
I didnt know it at fifteen

1101
01:58:18,402 --> 01:58:23,599
你曾等着满足自己所有的愿望和幻想
When all you wanted was to be wanted

1102
01:58:23,799 --> 01:58:29,171
真希望现在的你回到过去告诉自己是多么天真
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

1103
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:37,595
那时我曾发誓有一天要嫁给他
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday

1104
01:58:37,791 --> 01:58:41,568
但后来我又发现了自己更重要的梦想
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

1105
01:58:44,005 --> 01:58:49,616
而阿比盖尔则把自己拥有的一切都给了一个男孩
Abigail gave everything she had to a boy

1106
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:55,613
一个最后变了心的男孩。我们相拥而泣...
Who changed his mind and we both cried

1107
01:58:55,893 --> 01:59:02,943
因为当你还是十五岁, 别人告诉你有人爱你
Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

1108
01:59:03,142 --> 01:59:06,120
你会全然相信
You gonna believe them

1109
01:59:06,402 --> 01:59:16,418
当你还是十五岁, 不要忘记在跌倒之前看看脚下的路
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

1110
01:59:17,959 --> 01:59:21,612
我发现时间可以治愈好一切
But I've found that time can heal most anything

1111
01:59:21,824 --> 01:59:25,871
而且你还可以发现曾经你会变成什么样的人
And you just might find who you're supposed to be

1112
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:35,839
而在十五岁时, 我不曾知晓这个答案
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

1113
01:59:41,405 --> 01:59:54,135
啦...
La la la la la ... la la la la la ... La la la la la...

1114
01:59:54,451 --> 01:59:57,397
这是你的第一天
Your very first day

1115
01:59:58,990 --> 02:00:01,427
深呼吸, 女孩
You take a deep breath girl

1116
02:00:01,798 --> 02:00:07,419
做着深呼吸勇敢地穿过那些门
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

1117
02:00:11,646 --> 02:00:30,781
啦...
La la la la la ... la la la la la ... La la la la la...

1118
02:00:31,158 --> 02:00:35,649
这是你的第一天
Your very first day

1119
02:00:43,922 --> 02:00:51,927
Love Story - Taylor Swift

1120
02:00:59,087 --> 02:01:02,881
第一次见到你时, 我们都很年轻
We were both young when I first saw you

1121
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:06,623
闭上眼睛, 即回到过去
I close my eyes and the flashback starts

1122
02:01:06,828 --> 02:01:13,179
夏天的夜风中我站在那里, 站在露台上
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

1123
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:19,117
看着闪烁的灯光, 看着舞会, 看着裙摆舞动
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

1124
02:01:19,443 --> 02:01:22,584
看到你穿过人群
See you make your way through the crowd

1125
02:01:22,766 --> 02:01:29,411
并说你好, 我不知道
And say hello, little did I know

1126
02:01:31,386 --> 02:01:34,895
你就是罗密欧, 你扔着小石子
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

1127
02:01:35,055 --> 02:01:38,587
我爹爹嚷嚷：“不要招惹朱丽叶！”
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

1128
02:01:38,912 --> 02:01:45,608
我在楼梯上哭泣, 请求你不要走
And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go

1129
02:01:46,074 --> 02:01:47,340
我说：
And I said

1130
02:01:47,712 --> 02:01:51,643
“罗密欧, 带我走, 去一个我们可以独处的地方
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

1131
02:01:51,821 --> 02:01:55,339
我会一直等你, 我们能做的只能是离开（私奔, 呵呵……）
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

1132
02:01:55,668 --> 02:01:59,506
你是我的王子, 我是你的公主
You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess

1133
02:01:59,707 --> 02:02:01,470
这是一个爱情故事
It's a love story

1134
02:02:01,705 --> 02:02:04,140
宝贝, 只需说, 我愿意”
Baby, just say yes

1135
02:02:07,788 --> 02:02:11,347
于是我溜到花园里去见你
So I sneak out to the garden to see you

1136
02:02:11,772 --> 02:02:14,902
我们轻轻悄悄, 因为如果被人们发现, 我们只有死路一条
We keep quiet cause we've dead if they knew

1137
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:21,407
所以闭上你的双眼, 暂时逃离此地
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while

1138
02:02:22,896 --> 02:02:23,876
喔, 喔, 喔
Oh, oh, oh

1139
02:02:23,876 --> 02:02:27,391
因为你是罗密欧, 我是一个红字
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

1140
02:02:27,575 --> 02:02:31,038
而我爹爹又说了：“不要招惹朱丽叶！”
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

1141
02:02:31,224 --> 02:02:37,826
但你是我的一切, 我请求你不要离开我
But you were everything of me, I was begging you please don't go

1142
02:02:38,713 --> 02:02:39,790
我说：
And I said

1143
02:02:40,117 --> 02:02:44,009
“罗密欧, 带我走, 去一个我们可以独处的地方
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

1144
02:02:44,173 --> 02:02:48,073
我会一直等你, 我们能做的只能是离开（私奔, 呵呵……）
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

1145
02:02:48,255 --> 02:02:51,910
你是我的王子, 我是你的公主
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

1146
02:02:52,103 --> 02:02:53,787
这是一个爱情故事
It's a love story

1147
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,934
宝贝, 只需说, 我愿意”
Baby, just say yes

1148
02:02:56,175 --> 02:03:00,337
“罗密欧, 救救我, 试着告诉我如何去感受
Romeo save me try to tell me how it feels

1149
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:03,985
这份爱很艰辛, 但很真实
This love is difficult, but it's so real

1150
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:08,060
不要害怕, 我们会理出头绪
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess

1151
02:03:08,248 --> 02:03:09,976
这是一个爱情故事
It's a love story

1152
02:03:10,162 --> 02:03:12,691
宝贝, 只需说, 我愿意”
Baby, just say yes

1153
02:03:27,438 --> 02:03:34,829
我厌倦了等待, 总在想, 你是否还会回来
I got tired of waiting, wondering if you were ever coming around

1154
02:03:35,203 --> 02:03:39,507
我对你的信念正渐渐消逝
My faith in you was fading

1155
02:03:40,072 --> 02:03:43,253
在镇外遇见你时
When I met you on the outskirts of town

1156
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:44,471
我说：
And I said

1157
02:03:44,648 --> 02:03:48,450
“罗密欧, 救救我, 我觉得非常孤独
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone

1158
02:03:48,627 --> 02:03:52,469
我一直等你, 但你却全不露面
I'll keep waiting for you but you never come

1159
02:03:52,659 --> 02:03:56,122
这是否是我的空想, 我完全不知道作何感想”
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think

1160
02:03:56,366 --> 02:04:00,004
他跪在地上, 拿出一枚戒指
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

1161
02:04:00,172 --> 02:04:00,887
并说道：
And said

1162
02:04:00,887 --> 02:04:04,534
“嫁给我吧, 朱丽叶, 你再也不会孤独
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone

1163
02:04:04,767 --> 02:04:08,371
我爱你, 这便是我确知的全部
I love you and that's all I really know

1164
02:04:08,534 --> 02:04:12,487
我跟你爹爹谈过了, 去挑一件婚纱吧
I talked to your dad you'll pick out a white dress

1165
02:04:12,770 --> 02:04:14,550
这是我们的爱情故事
It's a love story

1166
02:04:14,741 --> 02:04:19,414
宝贝, 只需说, 我愿意”
Baby, just say yes

1167
02:04:19,859 --> 02:04:27,223
喔, 喔
Oh, oh

1168
02:04:28,999 --> 02:04:36,537
我们相识时, 彼此都很年轻
We were both young when I first saw you

1169
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:16,000
我爱你们
I love you

1170
02:06:38,999 --> 02:06:46,537



1171
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:58,200
98场演出, 17个国家, 3个大洲
《爱的告白》环球巡演2011

1172
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:08,700
致谢：
这张专辑献给那些在巡演中或坐, 或站, 一同陪伴我的美好而善良的人们, 因为有了你们的存在, 我的巡演被装点得更加美丽。致那些不可思议的人们, 谢谢你们陪我度过这段时光

1173
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:11,900
“我觉得你不应该等下去, 你应该现在就说出来”
