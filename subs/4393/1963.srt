1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074

00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:48,395
THE SESSIONS

3
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:56,488
<i>Mark O'Brien has been going
to UC Berkeley since 1978.</i>

4
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:59,965
<i>That's O'Brien in the motorized
gurney heading for class last week.</i>

5
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,135
<i>He had polio when he was 6 years old.</i>

6
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,826
<i>The disease left his body crippled
but his mind remained sharp and alert,</i>

7
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,915
<i>and since he wanted to be a writer,</i>

8
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,509
<i>Mark O'Brien entered Cal to major
in English and learn his trade.</i>

9
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:18,588
<i>He wrote this poem for us about
school here, and about graduation.</i>

10
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,673
Graduation.

11
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:24,400
Today I hear the crowd’s applause.

12
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:27,954
Receive congratulations from my friends.

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,971
Today I ask if I’ve found
a place among the rest,

14
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,781
who studied, read, wrote,

15
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:40,660
and passed the test in cap and gown.

16
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,823
Today, I hope you see
a man upon the stage.

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,974
<i>Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage
and perseverance overcome obstacles.</i>

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,157
<i>With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill
Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News.</i>

19
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,327
Breathing.

20
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,123
Look you.

21
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:38,311
This most excellent canopy, the air,

22
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:42,840
presses down upon me at
15 pounds per square inch,

23
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:47,018
a dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean,

24
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,614
teasing me with its
nearness and immensity.

25
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:54,083
And all I get is a thin stream of it.

26
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:59,586
A finger’s width of the rope
that ties me to life.

27
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,654
Shit!

28
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,521
Okay, just focus.

29
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,861
Scratch with your mind.

30
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,906
Okay, your mind.

31
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,211
Scratch with your mind…

32
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:40,729
Good morning.

33
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,846
Good morning.

34
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:08,974
You're late.

35
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:18,740
Joan.

36
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,065
I swear this was one crazy bitch,

37
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,198
who’d swing me about
enough to scare me,

38
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:30,567
but careful enough so she could say:
“Now what was all the yelling about?

39
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,698
You polios are screamers. Always were.”

40
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:38,095
I didn’t say a word,

41
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,055
but typed my skinny novel in my head,

42
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,422
and thought about revenge.

43
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,115
Would you mind if I asked you a favor?

44
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:04,525
What, you need help moving furniture?

45
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:11,122
I need an advance on my
pay, like two weeks.

46
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:14,003
And that's not exactly
asking too much, is it?

47
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,731
What if you don't last another two weeks?

48
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:23,599
It was a real drag that I was no longer
allowed to use my other gurney,

49
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,255
the self-propelled one.

50
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:29,096
It had caused a couple of
spectacular accidents.

51
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:35,515
Basically, in spite of all the mirrors,
I couldn't see where I was going.

52
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,510
Mary's fear and apprehension
slowly gave way to pride and purpose.

53
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,351
Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John,

54
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:47,578
felt the power of this wondrous woman.

55
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,424
It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,

56
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,711
that gave Mary
the courage she was lacking,

57
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:59,261
and she gave thanks saying:
“My soul doth magnify the Lord,

58
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:03,062
and my spirit hath rejoiced
in God my Saviour”.

59
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:07,154
May the spirit of the Lord be amongst
you and remain with you always.

60
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,671
I’m definitely a true believer.

61
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,476
But I believe in a God
with a sense of humor.

62
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,663
A wicked sense of humor.

63
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:22,154
One who created me in His own image.

64
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,818
Hello. I don't think we've met.

65
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,595
I'm Father Brendan.

66
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,202
I’m Mark O’Brien.

67
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,972
I knew Father Seamus very well.

68
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,793
I'm sorry that he's not here any more.

69
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,377
As are many others.
I'll do my best to fill his shoes.

70
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:43,517
I understand you'd like me
to hear your confession.

71
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:44,762
Yes, I would.

72
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,597
I told my attendant to come back
in half an hour, is that okay?

73
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:50,526
I'm in no rush.

74
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,983
I can be a bit time consuming,
but I’m worth the trouble.

75
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,616
I’m here for you Mark.

76
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,851
Look…

77
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,696
This is not exactly a confession,
I haven't yet done the deed.

78
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,786
I was hoping to sort of
get a quote in advance.

79
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,852
What's on your mind?

80
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:20,543
The most immediate thing on my mind
would be one of my attendants, Joan.

81
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,098
I'm thinking of getting rid of her.

82
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:25,783
It's an evil thought, but I can't help it.

83
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:29,504
— Is she dishonest, or incompetent?
— No, neither of those.

84
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:31,702
She looks at me the wrong way.

85
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,522
It's that "you need me
more than I need you" look.

86
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:40,287
I'd like to show her she's wrong, just
for the evil satisfaction it will give me.

87
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,905
Is that a sin, Father?

88
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,008
Well, it obviously troubles you.

89
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:52,050
Yes, it troubles me a lot, because
maybe it's really a power trip.

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,400
You know. It's me against her.
Me against the world.

91
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,431
I really wouldn't worry about that.

92
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:01,486
The question is whether you
like having her around.

93
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,909
— I can't stand her.
— Well then get rid of her.

94
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,953
If I were in a position to choose,
I'd find someone nice.

95
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,700
Even it was a power trip.

96
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:12,674
Then I have your blessing to fire her?

97
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,338
Unofficially, yes.

98
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,318
That's good enough for me.

99
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:42,623
Amanda.

100
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:50,568
Amanda would have been a pretty girl
to touch, to hold, to kiss.

101
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,825
Do you have any experience?

102
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,630
No, none at all.

103
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,315
That sounds perfect.

104
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,199
So, how long can you stay out?

105
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,302
Three or four hours.

106
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,565
Depends how much fun I’m having.

107
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:20,033
As she glided through crowds of lives,
she couldn't leave me lying there

108
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:24,296
dried out bubble gum stuck
on the underneath of existence.

109
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:30,785
She took me on a picnic once,
with her boyfriend and another couple.

110
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,033
Lust crackled in the air.

111
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,022
But what did the boyfriend think?

112
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,650
That I was in his way?

113
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:49,051
I'm always in somebody's way, I
thought, the sun in my eyes.

114
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,882
And?

115
00:09:58,418 --> 00:09:59,538
What?

116
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,100
And, do you touch him?

117
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,569
Yeah, I do everything.

118
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,051
Any other questions?

119
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,794
— It's gross.
— What?

120
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:13,852
What'd you say?

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,735
Okay, look. No need to be defensive,
okay? I'm not exactly threatened

122
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,352
by this guy.
— Yeah? Why not?

123
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,722
God, he's a much more a man than you are.

124
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:28,309
So what does your boyfriend think of me?

125
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,911
He's an asshole. It doesn't
matter what he thinks of you.

126
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,643
I'm interested in the
opinion of an asshole.

127
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:38,315
He thinks that you are
some kind of Svengali,

128
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,448
and that you're gonna
hypnotize me into your cult.

129
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:42,756
He's right.

130
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,759
He says he can already see changes.

131
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:54,947
Her perfect, pale skin,
her Tudor court face,

132
00:10:55,478 --> 00:11:00,741
her strong, fleshy legs
drove me into ecstasies of despair.

133
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,901
All I wished for were hands that moved,

134
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,150
just to touch her.

135
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,423
That would have been enough.

136
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,017
So with her gentle fearless heart,
she took me in.

137
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:22,792
I thrived in her garden,
and wanted more.

138
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,806
This you must have.

139
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,529
What?

140
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,172
I love you.

141
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Did she reciprocate your feelings?

142
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,381
She didn't seem to.

143
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,349
Well, sometimes people can be
very shy about their emotions.

144
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:16,507
Well…

145
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,651
in case she didn't get it the first time,

146
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:22,096
I told her again that I
was in love with her,

147
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,217
and wanted to marry her,
thinking it might swing things.

148
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:28,251
— Did it?
— Yes.

149
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,089
She left.

150
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:45,384
Amanda could have been a pretty girl
to touch, to hold, to take to bed.

151
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,621
I wish I knew what to say.

152
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,178
I mean, welcome to the human race,

153
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,531
every day somebody breaks
somebody else's heart.

154
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,013
And as I said, I'm here for you.

155
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,677
I just wish I had something
more useful to offer.

156
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:05,767
All I have are these vague
ideas about life and death

157
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,621
that priests are equipped with.

158
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,363
Have you considered sharing
your feelings with a therapist?

159
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:12,781
Not really.

160
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,533
Father…

161
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,057
I think I need a hug.

162
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:22,612
— A hug?
— Yeah.

163
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:43,132
— Hi. Vera?
— Yes.

164
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,976
— I'm Rod.
— Hi.

165
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,869
I usually do four to midnights.

166
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,127
But we can switch as necessary.

167
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,884
Have you had any experience?

168
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,359
Some.

169
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:12,118
Would you get that, please.

170
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,498
Hullo?

171
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,981
It's Sandy, from Pacific News Service.

172
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:29,966
Could you press that button and
put it on the speaker phone, please.

173
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,304
Hi, Sandy.

174
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:36,921
Hi, Mark, how you doing?

175
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,651
I'm good.

176
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,774
I have a new attendant.

177
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:43,368
She answered the phone, her name's Vera.

178
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,951
Welcome, Vera.

179
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,502
Thank you.

180
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,379
Mark, we're doing a series of articles
that I think might interest you.

181
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,613
The subject is 'Sex and the disabled'.

182
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:57,270
It would involve interviewing
people in the Berkeley area.

183
00:14:58,156 --> 00:14:59,356
But why now?

184
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:01,138
Because we've got the money now.

185
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,888
But if you're working on something else,
then we can talk about it later.

186
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,769
No…

187
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,837
now is fine.

188
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,262
Great!

189
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,263
There was no escaping it.

190
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:23,792
A door had opened which I could not close,

191
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,188
and in invisible writing it said:

192
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,337
“Do not enter”.

193
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:39,512
Most positions like that one
are pretty much impossible.

194
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,658
I don't know if you can
quite visualize it,

195
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,705
but it's called a lateral, or
sideways reverse cowgirl.

196
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:50,861
It's okay. it's just a question of
depth of penetration for most people,

197
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:54,444
like my partner, for instance.
It doesn't really matter to me.

198
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,853
I mean, I just get just as excited
when he licks my nipples,

199
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,608
when he bothers to do that.

200
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,094
I think your tapes ran out.

201
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:16,237
Do you want to continue?

202
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,627
Uh… That's okay Carmen.

203
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,390
I think I've actually got
enough to work on. Thanks.

204
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,911
Okay well, can you call
if you need anything,

205
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:27,505
and let me give you Greg's number,

206
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,145
'cause he's full of thinks
you wouldn't think were possible.

207
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,371
Oral sex is a matter of taste.

208
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:37,071
And one thing that really works in my
favor is that I smoke so much weed that

209
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,297
my taste buds are pretty jaded.

210
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,944
This gives me a great deal of
stamina in the tongue department,

211
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,780
and stamina is key in cunnilingus.

212
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:56,314
Who are these people?

213
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,279
I feel like an anthropologist
interviewing a tribe of headhunters.

214
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,375
Hi.

215
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,293
It's good to see you.
How are things?

216
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:13,853
— Well…
— I'm sorry.

217
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,846
Things are a little confusing,
Father Brendan.

218
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:22,895
I would appreciate your advice as a
friend… if you know what I mean.

219
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,143
Sure. And I understand what you mean.

220
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:32,641
Do you remember at one point you
suggested I might see a therapist?

221
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,469
— Yes.
— Well…

222
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:38,998
one way or another, it's a long story,
I ended up seeing a therapist.

223
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,516
A particular sort of therapist.

224
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,359
A sex therapist.

225
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:49,937
Good morning UC Berkeley.

226
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,488
May I please speak to
someone in the Center

227
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,572
for Sexuality and Disability, please.

228
00:17:55,749 --> 00:18:00,300
I'm sorry sir, the Center for Sexuality
and Disability has been shut down.

229
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,653
— Thank God.
— Sir?

230
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,536
I'm sorry I have bothered you.

231
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:07,929
It's no bother…

232
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,423
Oh, Sir, before you go, I can
give you a phone number

233
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,657
for one of the therapists
who used to work there.

234
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,299
Would you like that?

235
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,235
It's fine, we can—

236
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:21,416
— Everything's gonna work just fine.
— I don't like this, just forget about it.

237
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,329
— Mark, you wanna see this woman or not?
— No!

238
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,766
— Well, it's too late.
— What floor?

239
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:25,917
18th floor.

240
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,257
What sort of chance do you give me?

241
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,249
Of achieving your romantic fantasy?

242
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,038
Very small to minute.

243
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,501
Oh look, you don't have
to pull any punches.

244
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,184
You can be direct with me.

245
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:42,059
Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist.

246
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,021
I try to help people with sex
problems that can be addressed.

247
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,451
Your problem, I understand, is
that you have never had sex.

248
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:52,272
That's correct.

249
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,883
Would I be correct in assuming
you're unable to masturbate?

250
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:55,781
Correct.

251
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,305
Has anyone done it for you?

252
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:58,358
No.

253
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,857
Have you ever asked anyone?

254
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,535
Not specifically.

255
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,573
I asked someone to
marry me once, she declined.

256
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,113
Does that come close to masturbation?

257
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:12,412
You know, being with the person you love

258
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,263
is not the only way of expressing
yourself sexually.

259
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,232
There are people called sex surrogates.

260
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,325
Oh?

261
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,687
My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan.

262
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,362
Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed
bath in front of my attendant.

263
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,296
All I feel is shame and mortification,
while other men apparently get pleasure.

264
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:35,549
I'm sorry if I sound angry.

265
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,058
Don't worry about it. Go on.

266
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,939
This therapist…

267
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:51,916
suggested I could work
with a sexual specialist,

268
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:56,186
have sex with someone
known as a sex surrogate,

269
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,527
who would be sensitive
to my unusual needs.

270
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,785
I've been giving it some thought.

271
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,157
Hold on.

272
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,561
What do you mean “have sex”?

273
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,429
Well, when a man and
a woman love each other,

274
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,554
— then they have—
— No, I understand what it—uhm…

275
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,009
Are we talking about sexual intercourse?

276
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,575
— I think so.
— Outside marriage?

277
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,942
I did do my best on the
question of marriage.

278
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:26,769
What's the difference between this
sexual specialist and a common prostitute?

279
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:30,782
I don’t know, but I think
there’s a difference.

280
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,777
— How old are you?
— Thirty-eight.

281
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,625
Why exactly now?

282
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,650
I never had any cash before.
That's a major factor.

283
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,765
And I'm probably getting close
to my use-by date.

284
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,270
And this is what you want my advice on?

285
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:01,603
Fornication?

286
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:04,106
Your advice as a friend.

287
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:08,318
And do I have the deciding vote,
so to speak?

288
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:12,376
Well, let's just say I value your advice
just as much as I do the therapist's.

289
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,648
You're serious about this?

290
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,835
I think sex is a serious matter.

291
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:23,287
It’s one of the most persistent
themes in the bible. So…

292
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:31,937
is it possible for me to know a woman
in the biblical sense, so to speak,

293
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,761
And…

294
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,662
and do I want to find out?

295
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,965
— You want my opinion?
— Please.

296
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,189
In my heart I feel like He’ll give
you a free pass on this one.

297
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,105
— Go for it.
— What?

298
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,245
— Go for it.
— Really?

299
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:11,691
Yes. If you feel up to it.

300
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,646
Do you feel up to it?
— To tell the truth…

301
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:16,998
I'm scared.

302
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,628
Well then we should pray.

303
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,184
Sweet Jesus,

304
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:35,663
Mark and I sit at your feet and pray
that You bless this little journey,

305
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:38,662
this one small step for a man.

306
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:42,232
I really feel proud of myself,

307
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:46,848
imposing on someone I hardly know,
to fornicate in their home.

308
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:50,137
Get over it. It's perfectly normal.

309
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,146
— Tada!
— Wow!

310
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,440
There are all sorts of useful
things in that drawer there,

311
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,253
if you guys feel like exploring.

312
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:05,219
That's okay, I'll bring
my own sheets and towels.

313
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,144
No. Everything will be provided.

314
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:10,969
I'm really honored that you asked me.
It'll be great karma for the house.

315
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,922
Great karma for the house?!

316
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,582
My God, the pressure, already.
I can't stand it.

317
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,053
Hey, this is Tony.

318
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,677
Hi, this is Laura White.
Is Cheryl in, please?

319
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,210
Cheryl!

320
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:34,059
— What is it?
— Phone!

321
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,130
She's coming.

322
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,333
I'm not your girlfriend.

323
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,578
When someone calls, particularly
someone you don't know,

324
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,202
you can use the word 'Mom'.

325
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,396
Hullo, this is Cheryl.

326
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,526
Hi, it's Laura.

327
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:54,030
I haven't heard from you for a while.

328
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:55,374
How are you?
— Pretty well.

329
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,576
Look, I called to ask
how you would feel,

330
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,467
about working with a
severely disabled client.

331
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:02,240
I'm…

332
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,242
Could you hold on one second.

333
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,760
Tony! Get a glass!

334
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:13,249
Hey, cut that out!

335
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:15,695
Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.

336
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,886
Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen–Greene.
May I speak to Mark?

337
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,175
I—Uh—yeah, could you hold a second?

338
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:33,062
What? What am I doing here? Yes or no?

339
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,130
Come on, make up your mind.

340
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:42,767
Yeah, go ahead.

341
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:47,310
— Hello, this is Mark.
— Hi Mark, this is Cheryl.

342
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,294
Laura called to introduce you.

343
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:51,831
I understand you'd like to meet,
is that right?

344
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,030
Uh…

345
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:56,297
Yes.

346
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,942
I could see you on the
thirteenth, at eleven o'clock.

347
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,716
Would that be any good for you?

348
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,317
Oh, uh…

349
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,915
Yes, I think that would be fine for me.

350
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:10,181
Where you from?

351
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,290
Boston. You?

352
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:15,124
— Salem. Small world.
— Uh.

353
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,013
We will talk for a while to begin with,

354
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:21,607
and then, when you're ready, we'll start
doing some body awareness exercises.

355
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,533
Holy Mother of God.

356
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,571
What are “body awareness exercises"?

357
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:50,514
— Which one?
— Doesn't matter.

358
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,204
Will you stop acting like you're
going to your own execution.

359
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:55,953
I'm not acting.

360
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,806
Okay, the purple one.

361
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,624
Just try and think about something else.

362
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,738
Baseball, for example.

363
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,048
That's what they usually tell boys to do.

364
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,962
Baseball. You mean like hope
I make it to second base?

365
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,968
That's helpful.

366
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,980
Okay. Right, be like that.

367
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,404
Alright.

368
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,130
Maybe she forgot.

369
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:32,523
Yeah, she forgot, or she got the date
wrong, we should just forget it.

370
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,211
Let's go back. Come on.

371
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,796
She has not forgotten.
You see?

372
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:39,591
Hi.

373
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:41,622
Hi.

374
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,663
Okay, I'm going.

375
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:00,771
I'll be back around one,

376
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:03,888
but if you guys have finished early,
you can just let yourselves out. Okay?

377
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,749
— Okay.
— Have fun.

378
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,219
Thanks, bye.

379
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,041
Bye.

380
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:17,012
What time is it?

381
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:19,993
Twelve after eleven.

382
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:23,274
Oh, I think there's a strong possibility
she's had second thoughts.

383
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:27,018
And if she does arrive, she would
be perfectly within her rights

384
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:28,374
to turn around and run.

385
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,753
Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.

386
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:10,378
No, that's fine. Come in.
I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers.

387
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:13,290
— Nice to meet you.
— Nice to meet you too.

388
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,629
Hi, Mark O’Brien.

389
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,828
Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.

390
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,154
I'll be back, in say, two hours?

391
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:30,621
— Yes, perfect.
— Okay.

392
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:36,985
So…

393
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:38,877
Your money's on the desk, over there.

394
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,696
Yes it is. Thank you.

395
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:47,275
That was the wrong way to start off.

396
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,359
It really was. Shall we start again?

397
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:51,484
Please, you start.

398
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:56,122
Although the aim is for us
to have sex, I'm not a prostitute.

399
00:28:56,178 --> 00:28:59,347
You don't have to pay me up front.
I’ve nothing against prostitutes,

400
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:02,386
but there’s a difference.
We can talk about that later.

401
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,691
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,545
The other thing is, there's a limit to
the number of sessions we can have.

403
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:10,038
Did Laura mention that when you saw her?

404
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:12,851
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

405
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,960
The limit is six. That gives us
plenty of opportunity to explore.

406
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,613
So, I understand you are
able to have an erection.

407
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:23,165
Yes, but not by choice.

408
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,805
Do you know how many men there are

409
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,039
who would give anything
for a natural erection?

410
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,998
Is this your place?

411
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:30,753
No, it's a friend's.

412
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,932
The only bedroom furniture I have
at my place is an iron lung.

413
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:40,172
I've been wondering maybe
about possibly buying a futon,

414
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,641
yeah, in case the need arose.

415
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,109
Might be worth thinking about.

416
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,725
I've got the space, I think.

417
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,484
It can be expensive though, a nice…

418
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:51,848
futon, I mean, how much do you
think a good one would cost—

419
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,289
Mark, take a deep breath…

420
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,627
then let go.

421
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:03,848
Do I seem anxious?

422
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,629
You do a little.

423
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:10,718
So Laura tells me you're a poet.
What's it like to be a poet?

424
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:14,385
It's a way of living
inside your own head,

425
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:16,590
which is where I spend most of my time.

426
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:17,993
But not today.

427
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,691
Nice shirt, by the way.

428
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,575
Thank you.

429
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:25,483
So I'm gonna ask you
some basic questions, okay?

430
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:26,818
Sure.

431
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:31,564
Explain to me, so that I really understand
exactly what the iron lung is for?

432
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,304
Well, it keeps me breathing.

433
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:36,958
I can spend a few hours outside of it,
with my portable respirator,

434
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:39,082
depending on how I feel, but…

435
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,138
I work and sleep in the iron lung.

436
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:45,864
And how do you feel right now?

437
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,522
Out of my league.

438
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:50,329
I meant your breathing.

439
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:52,026
Oh… fine.

440
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,223
In fact, better than usual.

441
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,424
That’s great.
Shall we get undressed?

442
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,148
Do you have any areas
of unusual sensitivity?

443
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,687
Any parts of your body
you don’t want me to touch?

444
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,220
I have normal sensitivity all over.

445
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,973
I'm not paralyzed exactly, it’s just
my muscles don’t work too much.

446
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,155
— You can touch me anywhere.
— That's great.

447
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,302
Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!

448
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:42,327
— What, what's wrong?
— Holy Mother of God!

449
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,971
— My fingers! My fingers, they're caught!
— It's okay, okay.

450
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:47,409
I've got it, I've got you.
Don't worry.

451
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,383
Be careful, please.

452
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:52,855
Mark…

453
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,859
I'm gonna be really careful with you.

454
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,516
I don't want to hurt or
injure you in any way,

455
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:03,835
and it’s really not sexy
when you yell at me. Okay?

456
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,141
I won't yell at you any more.

457
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:13,261
But you’ll tell me calmly the
moment anything starts to hurt.

458
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:14,942
Yes.

459
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:19,542
Here we go.

460
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,732
Piece of cake, uh?

461
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,410
Nice shirt.

462
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:39,303
You already said that.

463
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,420
Did I?

464
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,563
I'm gonna slide these down.

465
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:03,329
Okay, just be careful with my feet,
okay. My feet, be careful.

466
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:04,995
— Hold your breath.
— Okay.

467
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:07,847
Oh, hang out, be careful,
that's a new pant!

468
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,660
You're ready?

469
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,753
Oh.

470
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:38,446
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

471
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:43,700
So the difference between
me and a prostitute

472
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,935
is the prostitute wants
your return business. I don't.

473
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:50,466
I’m here to help you learn
about your sexual feelings,

474
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,589
so you can share them
with a future partner.

475
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,714
Mark, I want you to tell me

476
00:33:56,432 --> 00:34:00,195
how it feels each time I touch
a different part of your body. Okay?

477
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:05,677
Well, whenever I'm naked, everyone
else in the room is always dressed.

478
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:09,814
And now that I'm in bed with another
naked person, it's rather confusing.

479
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:11,314
Why is it confusing?

480
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,510
I'd always expected that God, or

481
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:17,243
my parents, would intervene to keep
this moment from ever happening.

482
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:18,682
Not this time.

483
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,732
So if something feels good, you tell me,

484
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:25,758
if something feels ticklish or bothers
you, I want you to let me know,

485
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,174
I don’t want you to tolerate anything.

486
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,310
I’m gonna start with the top of your head.

487
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:40,255
Soft hair.

488
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,784
It’s really nice to the touch.

489
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,276
— Does it feel good?
— It does.

490
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:00,674
That feels weird.

491
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,229
Weird good or weird bad?

492
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,585
Just weird.

493
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:12,518
Feels good.

494
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,314
Still good?

495
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,737
Everything good so far, except the ear.

496
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:21,209
Are these the body awareness exercises?

497
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,178
You're clever to have worked that out.

498
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,610
People tell me I'm very perceptive.

499
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:29,438
Mark, would you like
to see what I feel like?

500
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:01,441
You touch one, you have to touch
the other, it's sort of a war.

501
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:03,053
Okay.

502
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:07,705
Αrе yоu wеаrіng соlоgnе?

503
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:08,765
Yes.

504
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:12,066
I like it. I usually like
cologne. And I like that.

505
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:17,353
So Mark, I’m going to move my
hand along your body…

506
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:20,803
down to your penis, and if you feel me…

507
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:21,802
Oh!

508
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,033
Ooh…

509
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:28,497
— Nice job.
— Yeah.

510
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,318
I thought there'd be more to it.

511
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:33,932
Not that it was unpleasant.

512
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,792
After all, I was in bed
with a naked woman.

513
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:41,275
She complimented me on
my shirt and my hair.

514
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:43,737
She held my penis.

515
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,955
I haven't even seen my penis
for over thirty years.

516
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:51,748
Am I sharing too much, Father?

517
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,459
No, I’m used to it.

518
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,799
So, uhm, next week.

519
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,869
Friday the twentieth, same time?

520
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:11,612
That's good for me.

521
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:14,037
Next time we'll start
to work on intercourse.

522
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,468
Were you afraid at the
thought of seeing me?

523
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,585
Oh God, I was terrified.

524
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:25,069
You should be proud of yourself.
You did great, we've made real progress.

525
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,435
Can I ask you something?

526
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,013
Sure. What would you like to ask?

527
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,362
Anything, really.

528
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:32,143
Just tell me something about yourself.

529
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:33,827
Anything.

530
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:34,904
Okay.

531
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:37,909
I'm a very private person.

532
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,167
I have a private life, I need you to
be aware of that, but that's about it.

533
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:44,870
This therapy is about you.
— Hello.

534
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:46,615
Welcome back.

535
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,508
Perfect timing.

536
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,938
I hope you guys kept the noise down.

537
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,863
What was it like, how do you feel?

538
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:04,668
Cleansed and victorious.

539
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,699
Doesn't get any better than that.

540
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:09,461
How about your first time?

541
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,858
— Don't wanna remember that.
— How was it like?

542
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,885
It wasn't all that pleasant.

543
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,789
I mean, it was consensual and everything,
and I really was in love with the guy,

544
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:22,370
but his dick seemed enormous
to me, I didn't think it would fit.

545
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:23,823
It was scary.

546
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,163
He was nice.
I guess he couldn't help it.

547
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,350
Was he Chinese?

548
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:32,061
Are you kidding? I only hung out
with white guys at high school.

549
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:33,406
Why is that?

550
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:35,719
I don't know. To stick it to
my mum and dad, I suppose.

551
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:38,484
Are they happy now you
have a Chinese boyfriend?

552
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,342
They're happy, I'm happy.

553
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:42,764
What's his dick like?

554
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:45,128
Uh, perfect size.

555
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,410
Why do you call it a
dick instead of a penis?

556
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:52,536
Penis sounds like some vegetable
you don't want to eat.

557
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,881
— Huh huh.
— Dick sounds like what it is.

558
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,377
The thing is…

559
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,908
it was all over so damn quickly.

560
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:07,345
Yeah, tell me about it.

561
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,288
First session.

562
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:21,082
Mark O'Brien is the oldest of four
children and raised Catholic.

563
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,832
He was extremely nervous.

564
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:28,296
He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt,
but I think more out of fear than pain.

565
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:33,287
He cannot masturbate, he's had only
the occasional kissing experience.

566
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:36,317
He is capable of achieving
an erection easily,

567
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,291
but the unusual curvature of his body

568
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,598
could be a serious
obstacle to intercourse.

569
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:18,992
I just started working
with this gentleman,

570
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:23,824
he spends almost his entire life
trapped in a big metal box.

571
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:28,962
Did you hear what I said?

572
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:34,321
Yes. Yes.

573
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:38,165
You’re a saint.

574
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:00,807
“Sometimes the head of
the penis may be too large

575
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:03,604
to penetrate the vaginal
opening smoothly,

576
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:10,007
in which case the application of
lubricant is recommended to avoid

577
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,794
possible…” Oh, my God!

578
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:20,333
So, what's on the menu today?

579
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,807
We're attempting intercourse.

580
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,926
Uh-huh. A big one.

581
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:28,090
What do you think of it?
Intercourse.

582
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,679
Overrated, but necessary.

583
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,497
There's plenty of other ways
of achieving the same result,

584
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:39,348
but somehow you don't feel you've actually
done it till you've gone all the way in.

585
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:49,444
I want you to look at me this time.

586
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:53,636
Come on, give it a try, open your eyes.

587
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:01,029
Do you like watching me undress?

588
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:02,964
I do.

589
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:08,494
So from now on…

590
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:12,703
you’re gonna start to listen
to the signals from your body…

591
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,158
that way you'll be able
to have some control…

592
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,274
Oh God!

593
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:18,803
Damn!

594
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:21,896
Shit.

595
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:24,978
I did it again.

596
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:28,528
This time, I ejaculated on her thigh.

597
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,436
I felt cursed…

598
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:36,677
that the whole enterprise was cursed.

599
00:42:37,673 --> 00:42:40,435
It seemed like a totally just punishment.

600
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,691
God wasn't actually denying my sexuality.

601
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
He was just pointing out to me
how useless it was.

602
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:53,671
It's amazing to me how often God
is brought into the sex act.

603
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:56,710
I understand that even
amongst nonbelievers.

604
00:42:56,728 --> 00:43:00,749
the most common expression
of sexual ecstasy is “Oh, God!”

605
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:07,169
Okay, I don't want to hear any
more about God cursing you.

606
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,585
I want the credit.

607
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:12,613
It was my overpowering beauty
that did it, it took you by surprise.

608
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:14,699
Now, where were we?

609
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,497
What do you mean, where were we?

610
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:19,553
I’m gonna touch you…

611
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,573
I’m touching you…

612
00:43:23,956 --> 00:43:26,375
and when we both feel you’re aroused…

613
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,713
like now…

614
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:30,583
I’m gonna guide you inside me.

615
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,407
Is there anything I need to do?

616
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:38,441
Just close your eyes, feel your body,
that's all you need to do.

617
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:48,745
— No, it won't fit. It's not going to fit.
— No. Mark, it will fit just fine.

618
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:52,188
— No, it's dangerous. It's too big.
— It's not too big. Relax.

619
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,803
— No. It won't fit. It'll hurt.
— Mark! Mark! Stop. Stop.

620
00:43:57,341 --> 00:44:01,260
I promise you, nothing bad will happen.

621
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:04,758
Let's try again while you're still hard.

622
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:13,054
Shit! Shit!

623
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,339
Shit.

624
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,887
I'm really sorry.

625
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,640
Stop being sorry.

626
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:25,578
And stop reading those stupid sex manuals.

627
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:31,784
There's still some time left, we can talk.

628
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:36,067
or you can suck my nipples,
that went well.

629
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,661
Or, which would you like to do first?

630
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:45,146
I believe the root of his anxiety
is his parents and his religion.

631
00:44:45,531 --> 00:44:47,931
He believes he doesn't deserve sex.

632
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:51,288
He believes he is responsible for his
little sister's death at the age of seven,

633
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:53,405
because his mother was
too busy looking after him.

634
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,855
We discussed his fantasies,
which were mostly masochistic.

635
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:00,862
Again, the idea of being punished.

636
00:45:02,186 --> 00:45:07,604
He's never seen female genitalia before,
and seems quite frightened or sort of it.

637
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:11,077
My worry now is that
it's never gonna happen.

638
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:14,929
I'm never gonna have intercourse
with Cheryl, or any other woman.

639
00:45:15,491 --> 00:45:17,891
Maybe intercourse would
prove I was an adult.

640
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,884
Maybe I don't want to cross that line.

641
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:23,976
Maybe…

642
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,435
this was a bad idea.

643
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:30,232
Do you want to know what I think?

644
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:31,345
Please.

645
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,439
Forget the psychobabble.

646
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:39,007
I grew up on a farm. Even the animals
need a couple of times to get it right.

647
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:42,063
May I suggest you try it
and enjoy it more?

648
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:45,028
Don't worry about the technical stuff.

649
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:46,561
You're a poet.

650
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:48,886
Be romantic.

651
00:45:57,573 --> 00:45:58,693
No.

652
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:02,385
Uh maybe.

653
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,990
Uh yes. Thanks, it's good.

654
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:19,301
— You nervous?
— A little.

655
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:22,485
— Want a shpritz?
— Yes, of course I would.

656
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:35,232
I have a good feeling about
today, a very good feeling.

657
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:35,997
Good.

658
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:38,244
I had a terrible feeling it
was never going to happen,

659
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,939
but I think today's the day.

660
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,385
— Can I make a suggestion?
— Please.

661
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,150
Stop thinking about it.

662
00:46:47,525 --> 00:46:49,585
Couldn't have wished for nicer weather.

663
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,335
You're not listening, are you?
Stop thinking about it.

664
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:53,942
Beautiful weather.

665
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:10,908
Oh, my God, Mark!

666
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:14,486
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

667
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,208
She was very apologetic.

668
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:24,408
Look, it may not be exactly
what we had in mind, but

669
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:27,571
I noticed a couple of blocks
from here a pretty nice motel.

670
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:29,401
It might be worth checking out.

671
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,542
Why not.

672
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:48,285
Do you have anything on the ground floor?

673
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:50,567
I've got a single.

674
00:47:50,793 --> 00:47:52,892
— How much?
— Thirty-five plus tax.

675
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:57,128
My boss is the gentleman in the gurney.

676
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,680
He's supposed to be having a
therapy session right now,

677
00:47:59,706 --> 00:48:02,430
but the facility we normally
use had a scheduling mix-up.

678
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:06,137
We just need the room for two hours.
Can you do it twenty cash?

679
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:11,798
So there's a soda machine
around the corner.

680
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:12,634
Thanks.

681
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:15,754
— And an ice machine if you need it.
— I'm sure it'll come in handy.

682
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,265
Okay, that's it.

683
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:35,656
I've got a book to read. I'll be hanging
around the reception if you need me.

684
00:48:36,008 --> 00:48:37,128
Thanks.

685
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:47,026
Very atmospheric.

686
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:50,237
Some people find motels exciting.

687
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:53,838
Do you think I could be
one of those people?

688
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:55,286
Of course.

689
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:06,746
Another shirt.

690
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,785
As in racy and sophisticated?

691
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,264
You took the words right out of my mouth.

692
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:17,666
What's wrong with your boss?

693
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,589
Basically, he can only move his head.

694
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:25,667
So uh…

695
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:28,281
What sort of therapy are they doing?

696
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:30,953
They're having sex.

697
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,520
You're shitting me.

698
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:40,200
Okay, I'm shitting you.

699
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:42,408
Oh no, come on, tell me for real.

700
00:49:43,216 --> 00:49:44,971
What are they actually doing?

701
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:49,422
Well, today, after some
appropriate foreplay,

702
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,586
they're gonna try to
achieve full penetration.

703
00:50:07,157 --> 00:50:08,277
Are you okay down there?

704
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,438
I'm choking.

705
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:13,605
— Oh my God.
— The mouth piece.

706
00:50:14,493 --> 00:50:16,313
The mouth pi—

707
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,990
Thank you.

708
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,391
I guess that one's off the
menu until further notice.

709
00:50:43,105 --> 00:50:45,376
Come on, lighten up.

710
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:58,637
Pony girl, Pony girl, won't
you be my pony girl?

711
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:04,186
My dad used to sing that to my
little sister Karin before she died.

712
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:09,557
She was kind of a sad little girl.
It didn't do much good.

713
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:15,402
I'm really sorry that the last time I saw
her, I fought with her, I made her cry.

714
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:23,171
My parents could have left me
in the nursing home, you know.

715
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:29,051
But they found out the average
life expectancy for polios

716
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:32,578
in nursing homes was 18 months.

717
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,533
They took me home.

718
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,110
They gave me a life.

719
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:45,029
They gave up theirs.

720
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:50,880
Mark, I'm just going to go the
bathroom for a quick pee.

721
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,834
And when I come back, we're
going to achieve full penetration.

722
00:51:54,976 --> 00:51:57,376
But before I go, I want
you to close your eyes.

723
00:51:57,744 --> 00:52:00,420
— Is this a game?
— It's not a game, just do as I say.

724
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:01,996
Close your eyes.

725
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:13,073
Picture yourself as a six
year old boy at the beach.

726
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:16,173
Can you do that?

727
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:21,377
Yes, very easily.

728
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:23,952
Describe some of your feelings.

729
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:26,836
I feel exhilarated…

730
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:31,500
running along the Atlantic Ocean…

731
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,305
feeling the wind and…

732
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:37,820
the wet sand between my toes.

733
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,530
Do you really feel like him?

734
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,487
Yes, I really feel like him.

735
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:45,956
And can you really picture him?

736
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:47,774
I don't understand what you mean,

737
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:50,524
I said I can feel like him.
Of course I can picture him.

738
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:56,022
From the outside, I mean as
an adult, as you are now,

739
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:02,416
looking at him with his crew
cut and his little face?

740
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:11,941
Yes.

741
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:15,132
And are you mad at him?

742
00:53:17,116 --> 00:53:20,423
Do you blame him for getting polio?

743
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,764
Was it his fault?

744
00:53:56,454 --> 00:54:00,054
She either forgot to close the bathroom
door, or didn't bother to close it.

745
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:04,542
I found the sound of her peeing
incredibly erotic,

746
00:54:05,115 --> 00:54:08,698
and the sound of her tearing off toilet
paper incredibly intimate.

747
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:13,724
By the time she came back
I had a terrific boner.

748
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:22,925
Go on.

749
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:26,903
I'm gonna rub the tip of
your penis around my vulva.

750
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:30,364
And when it's ready, I'll guide you in.

751
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:35,662
Breathe slowly and think
of something delicious.

752
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:55,214
Aah–Aahh!

753
00:55:13,462 --> 00:55:15,262
They've been a long time.

754
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:17,908
Yeah.

755
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,831
— You got a boyfriend?
— Yes.

756
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:31,756
I grew up in Salem,
raised Catholic, like you,

757
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:35,778
but the church did not appreciate
my attitude towards sex.

758
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,002
— You had an attitude towards sex?
— I did, I liked it.

759
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:43,032
They think they threw me out,
but I threw them out.

760
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:47,767
So for years I didn't believe in anything,
and now I'm converting to Judaism.

761
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:50,629
I guess it's good to have
some kind of insurance.

762
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,524
Oh, I didn’t think of that.

763
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:53,930
Then why are you doing it?

764
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:57,188
My husband asked me to do it
before his grandmother dies.

765
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:03,616
The idea is, if it makes her happy and
him happy, it will do the same for me.

766
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:06,901
The fact that I’m happy already,
doesn’t seem to be relevant.

767
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,680
What does your husband do?

768
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,370
He's a philosopher.

769
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:11,938
Wow! At the university?

770
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:13,592
No, in his own mind.

771
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,665
He runs the house, plays
guitar, thinks a lot.

772
00:56:27,403 --> 00:56:28,963
It's getting late.

773
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:41,825
Look, you did great today.
You were fantastic.

774
00:56:42,076 --> 00:56:46,081
You're a fully fledged male
homo-sapiens endowed

775
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:50,494
with a handsome and substantial penis
which now has a proven track record.

776
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,643
You should be thrilled.

777
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:54,698
Was I really inside you?

778
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,128
You were really and truly inside me.

779
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,784
— For how long?
— At least five or six seconds.

780
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:02,563
Is that all?

781
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:05,079
That's a long time for some people.

782
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:08,577
You were pretty excited, I don't
know what you were thinking about.

783
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:12,761
Yeah, it's you—

784
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:17,909
It was—these all a jumble of sensations.

785
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,686
Well, you definitely achieved penetration.

786
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:27,293
It was penis–vagina all the way, and
you definitely get an A for orgasm.

787
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,135
Cheryl?

788
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:36,785
Did you come?

789
00:57:38,627 --> 00:57:40,187
No, Mark, I didn't.

790
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,510
Can we try for that next time?

791
00:57:45,223 --> 00:57:46,783
Is that what you want?

792
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:48,966
Yes…

793
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,568
that's what I want.

794
00:57:53,747 --> 00:57:54,947
Okay then.

795
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:09,263
How's it going?

796
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,872
— Hi, how you doing?
— Good, good, come on in.

797
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:15,644
— How are ya?
— Still exhausted.

798
00:58:15,776 --> 00:58:17,691
— Beer?
— No, I'm okay.

799
00:58:17,738 --> 00:58:19,612
— Oh you need a glass?
— That'd be great.

800
00:58:21,048 --> 00:58:22,168
So…

801
00:58:23,197 --> 00:58:25,616
On reflection, how do you feel?

802
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:27,357
It was okay.

803
00:58:27,492 --> 00:58:30,083
I liked some of the other stuff,
this is just as much or better,

804
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:31,638
but I'm glad it's behind me.

805
00:58:31,722 --> 00:58:34,115
So am I. Congratulations.

806
00:58:34,282 --> 00:58:36,102
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

807
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:40,303
When this is all over, I'm gonna
write an article about it.

808
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:42,241
After all, sex sells.

809
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:43,862
Seriously.

810
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,691
So you're only doing this for the money.

811
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:48,011
Oh, absolutely.

812
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:51,199
That makes me feel so much
better about everything.

813
00:58:51,957 --> 00:58:55,798
What is she like? Cheryl. You've
never really said anything about her.

814
00:58:56,853 --> 00:58:59,253
She's the most wonderful
person on the planet.

815
00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:01,803
How is it going?

816
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:05,762
He reads too many books. He has it in
his head that after meeting three times,

817
00:59:05,781 --> 00:59:10,474
we should be able to have penetrative
sex which results in simultaneous orgasm,

818
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:11,706
Boom! Just like that.

819
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,440
That's very funny.

820
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,067
Yeah I guess it is.

821
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:17,300
What do you think of him?

822
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,530
Cheryl?

823
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,138
I like him.

824
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,560
What are you thinking about?

825
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:46,526
Nothing.

826
00:59:49,946 --> 00:59:51,506
I don't believe you.

827
00:59:53,826 --> 00:59:56,826
Okay, I was just thinking about
the whole conversion thing.

828
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,048
I still don't believe you.

829
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:15,814
Then, whatever it is, I guess I’m
not in the mood for talking about it.

830
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:21,874
So?

831
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:25,525
What do you think?

832
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:37,873
Hullo, this is Cheryl.

833
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,210
Hey.

834
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:42,297
— Mark?
— Hey.

835
01:00:42,336 --> 01:00:44,736
Can we meet somewhere for coffee?

836
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:48,474
Somewhere nice. My treat.

837
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:53,646
I don't usually meet with clients
outside of working hours, you know that.

838
01:00:54,258 --> 01:00:56,358
We'll have to talk business.

839
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:04,832
Mark appears to be indulging in
typical transference behavior.

840
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:08,878
We know this is not unusual
after first successful intercourse,

841
01:01:08,896 --> 01:01:11,596
but I think he is
particularly susceptible.

842
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:28,213
He cannot help seeing me as the
multi-functional, all-purpose woman,

843
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:32,719
mother, sister, schoolmistress,
whore, lover and best friend.

844
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:38,357
At the same time, his anxiety about
sexual performance has diminished.

845
01:01:54,063 --> 01:01:55,748
You look stunning.

846
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,579
— Thank you.
— You're welcome.

847
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:05,006
Could you put my cup
right on the edge there.

848
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:05,998
Sure.

849
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:08,248
Right on the edge.

850
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,843
And stick the straw
in my mouth, please?

851
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:13,851
— Is that okay?
— Perfect.

852
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:17,028
Sir, I'd wait a couple of minutes.
That coffee is kind of hot.

853
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:19,623
— Thanks.
— You're welcome.

854
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:22,963
So, what shall we talk about?

855
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,834
We don't have to do much talking.

856
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:28,353
I just want to be seen with you in public.

857
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:33,249
And I want people to say “hey, who’s
that gimp with that beautiful blonde?

858
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:35,624
How did he get so lucky?”

859
01:02:41,198 --> 01:02:44,016
If some old girlfriend from
school you hadn’t seen for years

860
01:02:44,034 --> 01:02:48,289
showed up here suddenly, like right
now, how would you introduce me?

861
01:02:49,843 --> 01:02:51,403
As your boyfriend?

862
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:53,853
As my husband.

863
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:55,859
Why not go all the way.

864
01:02:58,343 --> 01:02:59,622
Really?

865
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,567
We're pretending, right?

866
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:04,596
So…

867
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,055
Sure.

868
01:03:12,252 --> 01:03:14,070
Love poem for…

869
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:16,807
for uh…

870
01:03:18,202 --> 01:03:20,022
No one in particular.

871
01:03:21,725 --> 01:03:23,125
Tell me…

872
01:03:24,257 --> 01:03:25,657
Tell me…

873
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:29,168
Tell me. Let me…

874
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,499
Let me…

875
01:03:35,614 --> 01:03:37,014
Let me write…

876
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:08,282
Really? Really hon? You're the one
that's always said it can't get personal?

877
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:11,946
That's a whole other thing.
What are you doing opening my mail?

878
01:04:11,984 --> 01:04:14,266
That was scented, I assumed
it was just junk mail.

879
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:17,200
Even less reasons to open it.
Where is it? Give it to me.

880
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,575
You're not getting it.

881
01:04:18,857 --> 01:04:20,409
This is none of your business.

882
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:22,229
You're still not getting it.
I threw it out.

883
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:26,118
— You didn't.
— I fucking did!

884
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:28,935
What's up?

885
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,101
Would you ask your mother
to pass the salt, please?

886
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,264
Cheryl, would you please pass the salt?

887
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:07,145
Listen, I'm… I'm sorry.

888
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,169
I know, I—I really upset you before.

889
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:11,026
No no no, you didn’t.

890
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:12,992
I’m fine.

891
01:05:13,115 --> 01:05:14,691
— You sure?
— Yes.

892
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:20,460
I promise.
— Really?

893
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,899
Yes, in fact, I’ve come
around to your point of view.

894
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:24,754
You were right.

895
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,320
You’re usually right about these things.

896
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:41,741
It was… quite a nice poem, really.

897
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:46,573
Nothing astounding,
but it's heartfelt, and then…

898
01:05:46,936 --> 01:05:48,736
and then…

899
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:51,186
Everything is great.

900
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:54,215
I just need to get to sleep.

901
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:58,351
Okay.

902
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:02,356
Good night.

903
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,057
Let me touch you with my words.

904
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,650
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.

905
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:17,082
Amanda?

906
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:27,782
I haven't seen you in a while.

907
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,009
I know.

908
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,990
I'm sorry.

909
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:34,509
I'm, uhm…

910
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:36,823
Well, I'm going to Germany.

911
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:40,168
So I wanted to say goodbye
to you before I left.

912
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:43,125
Why are you going to Germany?

913
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:45,075
To study German.

914
01:07:45,164 --> 01:07:46,364
For how long?

915
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:50,638
Hum… One or two years maybe.

916
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:55,188
But… we should keep in touch.

917
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:57,707
But why go to Germany?

918
01:07:58,501 --> 01:08:01,092
It's the only place in the world
where humor is forbidden.

919
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:07,192
What?

920
01:08:09,395 --> 01:08:11,358
You could always make me laugh.

921
01:08:17,044 --> 01:08:19,465
I love you, Mark.

922
01:08:24,205 --> 01:08:26,427
— I really do.
— Really?

923
01:08:26,757 --> 01:08:29,157
Yes, I love you, but not in that way.

924
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:32,462
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

925
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,210
Blah, blah, blah.

926
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,060
The same old story.

927
01:08:36,935 --> 01:08:38,615
I'm sorry.

928
01:08:57,127 --> 01:09:00,297
I think it's great what you're
doing with this surrogate lady.

929
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:02,194
Well, it could have been you.

930
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:08,989
Yeah, it could have been, but… it wasn't.

931
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:17,956
I had this faint hope that she would
show the slightest hint of jealousy.

932
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,067
It shows you how naive I am.

933
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:27,448
The fact that I was no longer a virgin,
that I was a ‘made man', so to speak,

934
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,056
made no difference to her at all.

935
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:36,539
You want to go out some time?

936
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,038
No, I don't think so.

937
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:41,929
What, your boyfriend?

938
01:09:42,203 --> 01:09:44,233
No, I'm busy, that's all.

939
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:50,839
What's wrong with this, anyway?
We're having a nice time, aren't we?

940
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,010
It's okay.

941
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,069
Well if you have things to do,
I can go to do a walk,

942
01:09:58,088 --> 01:09:59,522
if you're busy and come back later.

943
01:09:59,554 --> 01:10:01,983
No no, stay.
Stay.

944
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:06,620
So come on, tell me.

945
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,932
What kind of a therapist is she, really?

946
01:10:09,964 --> 01:10:12,766
I told you the first time,
she's a sex therapist.

947
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:18,258
Today they're working
on simultaneous orgasm.

948
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,540
What's that?

949
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,348
Boy, am I glad to see you.

950
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:32,496
Don't you say that to all the girls?

951
01:10:32,614 --> 01:10:34,414
Yes, but I always mean it.

952
01:10:56,429 --> 01:10:58,229
Remember about your breathing.

953
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:03,257
Concentrate on breathing
out rather than in.

954
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:10,551
Mark was able to achieve an erection
as soon as I put my mouth upon him.

955
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:13,753
He did the controlled breathing,
as I had suggested,

956
01:11:13,794 --> 01:11:17,369
and I was able to get on top
and guide him in quite easily.

957
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:23,376
Is it in? Is it really in?

958
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:24,991
Yes, it's really in.

959
01:11:27,307 --> 01:11:28,867
I couldn't believe it.

960
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,239
I was finally there.

961
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,355
Too soon, I came.

962
01:11:37,112 --> 01:11:39,512
But she kept holding me inside her.

963
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:46,206
Then a look of pleasure brushed
lightly over her face…

964
01:11:47,363 --> 01:11:50,572
as though an all-day itch
were finally being scratched.

965
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:01,964
She put her hands down on the bed by
my shoulders and kissed my chest.

966
01:12:07,331 --> 01:12:09,731
This act of affection moved me deeply.

967
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:16,732
I almost wept.

968
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:21,121
No one had ever done anything like that.

969
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:29,915
It was so unexpected…

970
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:32,281
and natural.

971
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:43,377
I love you.

972
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,121
I love you, too.

973
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:50,092
Did you come, yeah?

974
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:52,051
Yes.

975
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:56,616
Mark is breathing well and
learning to pace himself.

976
01:12:57,108 --> 01:13:00,723
There is no real physical impediment
to a variety of sexual activities,

977
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:02,878
given the right sort of partner.

978
01:13:04,376 --> 01:13:08,991
His deeper emotional needs are outside
the scope of my potential involvement.

979
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,601
What happens when…

980
01:13:22,115 --> 01:13:23,675
What happens when what?

981
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:27,949
When people become attached to each other.

982
01:13:29,089 --> 01:13:31,329
— What people?
— Just people.

983
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,160
What's the chemistry of it all?

984
01:13:35,465 --> 01:13:37,611
When people are attracted to each other.

985
01:13:37,642 --> 01:13:38,960
Are you attracted to me?

986
01:13:38,995 --> 01:13:40,395
God, no.

987
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,810
We're just talking hypothetically.

988
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,967
Hypothetically…

989
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:47,925
they write poems…

990
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,224
they have sex.

991
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,614
And what happens next?

992
01:13:55,317 --> 01:13:57,552
After poetry and sex?

993
01:13:59,337 --> 01:14:00,936
Nothing or everything.

994
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:03,998
The rest is by negotiation, as it were.

995
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,590
What do you mean?

996
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:09,629
I mean, you can leave it
at love and attraction,

997
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:14,668
or you can make things complicated,
like most people do.

998
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:18,921
Have you?

999
01:14:21,951 --> 01:14:23,151
Yes.

1000
01:14:24,818 --> 01:14:26,729
Then afterwards…

1001
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:32,206
there was this… moment.

1002
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:38,256
Τhіѕ glіmрѕе оf thе аwful ѕаdnеѕѕ tо соmе.

1003
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:46,199
Can I use the phone?

1004
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:47,279
Sure.

1005
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:48,491
Would you call their room.

1006
01:15:01,552 --> 01:15:04,130
What shall we do next time?
Any requests?

1007
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,087
Mark?

1008
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,575
I'm thinking.

1009
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:15,426
We have two sessions
left, is that correct?

1010
01:15:16,602 --> 01:15:17,802
That's right, or…

1011
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,720
Or, what?

1012
01:15:20,774 --> 01:15:22,334
Or, we could stop now.

1013
01:15:25,059 --> 01:15:27,867
— You mean, make this the last session?
— Yes.

1014
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:36,383
What do you think we should do?

1015
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,781
It's not we, it's you, Mark.
It's up to you.

1016
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,980
I want to know how you feel.

1017
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,865
— That doesn't come in to it.
— Yes, it does.

1018
01:15:44,663 --> 01:15:47,063
I don't just write poems to anyone.

1019
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:50,924
Mark, what do you want me to say?

1020
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,817
How much I was touched by that?

1021
01:15:54,224 --> 01:15:57,456
How special this has been to me?

1022
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,169
It's not gonna help you,
it's gonna make it worse.

1023
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:09,158
So you're saying that…
the sixth session, that will be it?

1024
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:10,788
That will be it.

1025
01:16:13,585 --> 01:16:17,871
If it's any consolation, it’s also
hard for me to think about it.

1026
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:23,420
Then maybe we should pull the plug now.

1027
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:24,732
I think we should.

1028
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:32,075
I guess you might as well save that money.
Buy yourself a futon.

1029
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:41,531
Just a second!

1030
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:52,957
Bye, Mark.

1031
01:16:55,245 --> 01:16:56,205
Bye.

1032
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:07,088
Is everything all right?

1033
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:09,845
He did great. See you. I'm
sorry, I have to run.

1034
01:17:45,055 --> 01:17:46,615
You forgot this.

1035
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:52,527
I wanted to believe that because
of Cheryl, my life had changed.

1036
01:18:52,542 --> 01:18:53,996
But it hadn't.

1037
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:58,371
I just kept thinking, is that it?

1038
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:03,174
Is that all there is?

1039
01:19:05,763 --> 01:19:07,563
I think you’ve done a great thing.

1040
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,068
So, is this your first time?

1041
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,205
— It is, I'm converting.
— Oh, wonderful.

1042
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:30,336
Come here, I need to look at your hands,
your fingernails, and your toe nails.

1043
01:19:30,996 --> 01:19:32,556
So, what do you do?

1044
01:19:33,968 --> 01:19:36,479
— I don't think you'd understand.
— You can try me.

1045
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:38,151
Okay.

1046
01:19:38,978 --> 01:19:40,362
I'm a housewife.

1047
01:19:40,762 --> 01:19:43,561
— Why shouldn't I understand?
— Maybe I was mistaken.

1048
01:19:43,827 --> 01:19:44,637
Turn around.

1049
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:49,673
And drop your robe halfway, I'm gonna
check for any loose hairs on your back.

1050
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:53,969
That looks good, I'll take the robe
and you can let your hair down now.

1051
01:19:55,277 --> 01:19:57,337
I see you're very comfortable being naked.

1052
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,313
Never been one of my problems.

1053
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,839
Sometimes new brides
come with their mothers.

1054
01:20:04,196 --> 01:20:07,743
Do I have to take this off?
Can I please leave this on?

1055
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,691
They've never been naked before.

1056
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,424
No honey, it all has to come off.

1057
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:14,721
— And it does?
— And it does.

1058
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:20,234
They stand on the edge of that pool
with nothing to cling to but themselves.

1059
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,420
Nothing to hide behind.

1060
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:24,901
This is your body.

1061
01:20:25,628 --> 01:20:28,841
This is the body that God crafted for you.

1062
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:35,048
Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now.

1063
01:20:41,006 --> 01:20:42,566
This is your body.

1064
01:20:50,347 --> 01:20:51,965
This is your body.

1065
01:21:18,827 --> 01:21:20,927
Well, I can do it tomorrow.

1066
01:22:01,472 --> 01:22:05,501
The person you are calling is not in.
Please lave a message.

1067
01:22:06,978 --> 01:22:09,983
Rod. I need your help.

1068
01:22:10,357 --> 01:22:14,143
The power's gone out, including
the pump on the iron lung.

1069
01:22:14,283 --> 01:22:17,944
I'd say I've got about three hours
before I start to turn blue.

1070
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:23,612
I hope you get this in time.
It's Mark. I'll try 911.

1071
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,702
Shit.

1072
01:22:49,419 --> 01:22:51,219
So this is how it ends.

1073
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:14,219
Mark. Can you hear me, Mark?

1074
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,349
Can you hear me?

1075
01:23:18,115 --> 01:23:20,489
Mark. Come on now.

1076
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:27,619
They'll be letting you go today.

1077
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:31,666
Whoever looks after you will leave the
portable respirator switched on at night,

1078
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,435
fully charged, so you'll have
at least one back-up system.

1079
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,000
Okay?
— Okay.

1080
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:38,924
How close was I?

1081
01:23:40,525 --> 01:23:41,725
To what?

1082
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:46,433
You know, the—
that tunnel thing and the…

1083
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:52,228
light, and the voice saying
'don't go near the light'.

1084
01:23:54,615 --> 01:23:55,957
Is that what you remember?

1085
01:23:56,027 --> 01:23:57,857
No, I assume I passed out.

1086
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:02,185
But before that, I remember
feeling sorry for myself.

1087
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:06,431
— Do you feel relieved now?
— No.

1088
01:24:07,171 --> 01:24:10,200
Relieved that Rod got
to me in time, but I…

1089
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,715
still feel sorry for myself.

1090
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:17,050
Well, I'm sure there's
a cure for that, huh?

1091
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:19,307
Do you wanna talk to someone, or…?

1092
01:24:20,064 --> 01:24:22,301
I feel comfortable talking to you.

1093
01:24:23,802 --> 01:24:27,640
Well, I'm… just a volunteer,
not a therapist.

1094
01:24:29,091 --> 01:24:31,491
I can recommend you
to someone if you want.

1095
01:24:31,718 --> 01:24:34,731
I'm—I'm sorry to be rude, I'm just

1096
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:39,506
smiling at the idea that a therapist
could do anything useful for me right now.

1097
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:41,184
My priest couldn't.

1098
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,004
Are you religious?

1099
01:24:43,362 --> 01:24:46,742
Yes, I would find it
absolutely intolerable

1100
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,154
not to be able to blame
someone for all this.

1101
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:57,122
Are you?
— No.

1102
01:24:57,908 --> 01:25:03,257
I don't go to any church and I
don't think about God very much.

1103
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:09,405
I do believe there's a…
mysterious logic, or…

1104
01:25:10,499 --> 01:25:12,762
poetry to life.

1105
01:25:13,494 --> 01:25:16,426
— I guess that makes me a spiritual type.
— Oh yes.

1106
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:19,126
That would count.

1107
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:25,411
Would you like me to visit you?

1108
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:27,858
— Are you married?
— No.

1109
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,980
Do you have a steady boyfriend?

1110
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:32,304
No.

1111
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:34,734
Then please visit as often as you can.

1112
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:37,699
— Bye.
— Bye.

1113
01:25:37,755 --> 01:25:40,495
— Take care.
— Hey, hang on a second.

1114
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:42,990
What?

1115
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:46,057
There's just one more
thing I want to tell you.

1116
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:47,598
What's that?

1117
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:51,947
I'm not a virgin.

1118
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,277
Go ahead.

1119
01:26:01,301 --> 01:26:03,439
Thank you for sharing that with me.

1120
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:11,775
I'm flabbergasted.

1121
01:26:11,956 --> 01:26:15,008
She adores me. She'll do
anything for me, and

1122
01:26:15,102 --> 01:26:18,031
And I can get pretty kinky sometimes.

1123
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:21,048
Here I was, ready to offer
comfort to the forlorn.

1124
01:26:21,214 --> 01:26:23,236
That's supposed to be my specialty.

1125
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:26,402
Now I guess I'll throw
away that little speech.

1126
01:26:26,624 --> 01:26:30,488
No, no. Please make the little speech.

1127
01:26:31,515 --> 01:26:33,075
I'd love to hear it.

1128
01:26:33,184 --> 01:26:34,919
Okay, fine. Here goes.

1129
01:26:35,169 --> 01:26:36,729
The meaning of love.

1130
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,503
Love is a journey.

1131
01:26:39,723 --> 01:26:41,283
I like it already.

1132
01:26:45,315 --> 01:26:48,148
That's it, that’s all of I’ve got.
I told you it’s short.

1133
01:26:48,355 --> 01:26:50,187
Love is a journey.

1134
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:11,523
I met Susan five years before I died.

1135
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:15,148
She was the love of my life.

1136
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:20,813
We had the same priorities,
baseball pretty much came first,

1137
01:27:21,253 --> 01:27:24,086
and we wrote each other mushy poems.

1138
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:30,818
I never expected it, nor did she, but
that's often the way things turn out.

1139
01:27:36,806 --> 01:27:38,906
They say there is a cup of life.

1140
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:42,254
But you see, they're
half empty or half full.

1141
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:45,043
depending on how you feel about things.

1142
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,764
Of course, the two halves were never even.

1143
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:51,436
Not in my case, that's for sure.

1144
01:27:52,202 --> 01:27:56,152
Look at all the years I've had a
durable crap I've had to put up with.

1145
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,463
That fills most of the cup.

1146
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:05,227
But in the little bit that's left,
what do I have to show for myself?

1147
01:28:06,665 --> 01:28:12,529
At the very least, three beautiful
women who all loved me,

1148
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:16,299
and who will all show up at my funeral.

1149
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:21,695
His was a dynamic voice
in a paralyzed body.

1150
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:27,623
A life lived fully long after
he should have been dead.

1151
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:33,159
And against all odds by Mark's
own admission, he knew love,

1152
01:28:34,011 --> 01:28:36,501
emotional and physical love.

1153
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:42,608
And in this way, Mark lived his life,
day by day by day,

1154
01:28:43,369 --> 01:28:49,497
breath by breath
by breath, for 49 years.

1155
01:28:49,903 --> 01:28:53,403
He loved, and he was loved.

1156
01:28:58,184 --> 01:29:02,010
And now, Susan Fernbach will read
one of Mark's favorite poems.

1157
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:11,559
This is called…

1158
01:29:12,718 --> 01:29:15,114
Love Poem for No One in Particular.

1159
01:29:19,615 --> 01:29:22,275
Let me touch you with my words.

1160
01:29:23,516 --> 01:29:26,784
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.

1161
01:29:27,814 --> 01:29:30,460
Let my words stroke your hair,

1162
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:34,514
slide down your back
and tickle your belly.

1163
01:29:35,755 --> 01:29:40,815
For my hands, light and
free-flying as bricks,

1164
01:29:40,995 --> 01:29:46,867
ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse
to carry out my quietest desires.

1165
01:29:48,124 --> 01:29:51,426
Let my words enter your mind,

1166
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:54,403
bearing torches.

1167
01:29:55,091 --> 01:29:57,815
Admit them willingly into your being,

1168
01:29:58,287 --> 01:30:00,995
So they may caress you gently…
