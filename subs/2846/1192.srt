1
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:30,713
蒂凡尼的早餐
Breakfast at Tiffany's

2
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,215
嘿
Hey.

3
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,725
宝贝，发生何事？
Hey, baby. What's going on here?

4
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,394
你好
Oh , hi .

5
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,250
戈莱利小姐
Miss GoIightIy.

6
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,088
改天、改天…
Some day. . . Some day. . .

7
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,132
戈莱利小姐
Miss GoIightIy.

8
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,052
发生何事？
What happened to you , anyway?

9
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,763
你去了女厕，接着我就见不到你
You take off for the powder room and that's the Iast I see you .

10
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,516
-哈利…
-哈利是另一人
-Now, reaIIy, Harry. . . -Harry was the other guy.

11
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,769
我是席德阿巴克
你喜欢我，记得吗？
I'm Sid . Sid Arbuck. You Iike me, remember?

12
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,523
戈莱利小姐，我抗议
Miss GoIightIy, I protest!

13
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,110
很抱歉，我失去了钥匙
Oh , darIing , I am sorry, but I Iost my key.

14
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,028
那是两周前的事
But that was two weeks ago.

15
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,781
你不能继续按铃
You cannot go on and keep ringing my beII .

16
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,993
这骚扰到我，你要配备新钥匙
You disturb me ! You must have a key made !

17
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,662
这也没用处，我只会继续弄丢钥匙
But it won't do any good . I just Iose them aII .

18
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,081
别这样，你喜欢我，你知道的
Come on , baby. You Iike me. You know you do.

19
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,416
我仰慕你
I worship you , Mr Arbuck,

20
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,210
-晚安，阿巴克先生
-宝贝，等等，怎么了？
-but good night, Mr Arbuck. -Baby, wait a minute. What is this?

21
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,463
你喜欢我，我很受欢迎
You Iike me. I'm a Iiked guy.

22
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,256
你喜欢我，你知道的
You Iike me, baby. You know you do.

23
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,216
我不是为你的五名朋友写了支票吗？
Didn't I pick up the check for five peopIe?

24
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,634
我甚至不认识他们
Your friends. I've never seen them before.

25
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,053
你去女厕时向我要零钱
And when you asked for a IittIe change for the powder room ,

26
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,889
我给了你五十元
what do I give you? A $50 biII .

27
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,558
我不是有权来找你吗？
Now doesn't that give me some rights?

28
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,186
三十秒后我会报警
In 30 seconds I going to caII the poIice !

29
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,981
经常受到骚扰，我无法入睡
AII the time disturbance ! I get no sIeep !

30
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,817
我需要休息，我是艺术家
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

31
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,820
我要通知一队警员来
I am going to caII the vice squad on you !

32
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,740
别发怒，我不会再这样做
Don't be angry, you dear IittIe man , I won't do it again .

33
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,033
若你答应不发怒
If you promise not to be angry,

34
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,827
我或答应跟你拍照
I might Iet you take those pictures we mentioned .

35
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,079
何时？
When?

36
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,290
找天吧
Sometime.

37
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,585
任何时候
Anytime.

38
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,378
晚安
Good night.

39
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,633
抱歉打扰你，但我无法开启楼下的门
I'm sorry to bother you , but I couIdn't get the downstairs door open .

40
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,680
他们给我上层的钥匙
I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

41
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,141
我却不能开启楼下的门
I couIdn't get the downstairs door open .

42
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,689
我说他们给我上层的钥匙
I said , I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

43
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,276
我却不能开启楼下的门，抱歉打扰你
I couIdn't get the downstairs door open . I'm sorry to wake you .

44
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,028
没问题
That's quite aII right.

45
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,032
任何人也会碰上这事，经常会发生，晚安
It couId happen to anyone, quite frequentIy does. Good night.

46
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,825
我不想…
I hate to. . .

47
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,538
我不想麻烦你，但你可否再帮帮忙？
I hate to bother you , but if I couId ask one more favour

48
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,665
我可以借用电话吗？
couId I use the phone?

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,710
当然可以
Sure.

50
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,712
有何不可
Why not?

51
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,797
谢谢
Thank you .

52
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,425
这儿…
WeII , this is

53
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,470
很不错
a nice IittIe pIace you've got here.

54
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,474
-你也是刚搬进来吗？
-不，我已搬来一年
-You just moved in , too, huh? -No. I've been here about a year.

55
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,809
电话在那儿
The phone's over there.

56
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,646
以往在那儿
WeII , it was.

57
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,231
我记起了
Oh , I remember.

58
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,485
我把它放在皮箱子里，用来阻隔那声响
I stuck it in the suitcase. Kind of muffIes the sound .

59
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,786
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,997
-它没事吗？
-当然
-Is he aII right? -Sure.

61
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,500
它很好，猫咪，是吗？
Sure. He's okay, aren't you , cat?

62
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,543
可怜的老猫
Poor oId cat.

63
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,506
可怜兼没有名字的猫
Poor sIob. Poor sIob without a name.

64
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,300
我没有权替他起名
The way I Iook at it, I don't have the right to give him one.

65
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,804
我们不属于对方，我们只是某一天在河边相遇
We don't beIong to each other. We just took up by the river one day.

66
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,472
我不想拥有任何东西
I don't even want to own anything

67
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,517
直至我遇到顺意的事吧
untiI I find a pIace where me and things go together.

68
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,187
我也不知道该往哪儿找，但我知道那种感觉
I'm not sure where that is, but I know what it's Iike.

69
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,273
就像蒂芙尼
It's Iike Tiffany's.

70
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,943
蒂芙尼？你是指那珠宝店吗？
Tiffany's? You mean the jeweIIery store?

71
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,528
对
That's right.

72
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,905
我对蒂芙尼为之疯狂
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

73
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,950
听着
Listen .

74
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,078
你曾有满脸通红的时候吗？
You know those days when you get the mean reds?

75
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,831
你是指沮丧的时候吧
The mean reds? You mean Iike the bIues?

76
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,999
不
No.

77
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,252
沮丧是因为长胖或下雨
The bIues are because you're getting fat or maybe it's been raining too Iong .

78
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,254
你只是心情不佳
You're just sad , that's aII .

79
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,840
满脸通红很可怕
The mean reds are horribIe.

80
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,260
你突然很害怕，却不知道原因
SuddenIy you're afraid and you don't know what you're afraid of.

81
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,388
-你曾有这种感觉吗？
-当然
-Do you ever get that feeIing? -Sure.

82
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,182
每当我有这种感觉时…
WeII , when I get it, the onIy thing that does any good

83
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,768
我就立刻跳上计程车前去蒂芙尼
is to jump into a cab and go to Tiffany's.

84
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,563
这样可使我立刻冷静下来
CaIms me down right away.

85
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,857
蒂芙尼很宁静和高贵
The quietness and the proud Iook of it.

86
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,443
坏事不可能在那儿发生
Nothing very bad couId happen to you there.

87
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,528
在现实生活中…
If I couId find a reaI-Iife pIace

88
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,322
如果我能找到像蒂芙尼这样的地方…
that made me feeI Iike Tiffany's, then . . .

89
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,452
接着我会买家具，替猫咪起名
Then I'd buy some furniture and give the cat a name.

90
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,998
抱歉，你有事要办
I'm sorry. You wanted something .

91
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,083
你要借电话
The teIephone.

92
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,586
我本该与某人见面
It's just that I was supposed to meet somebody.

93
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,797
现在是周四早上十点，对吗？
I mean , this is 1 0: 00 Thursday morning , isn't it?

94
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,800
我从罗马回来，所以不太肯定
I just got off a pIane from Rome and I'm not too sure.

95
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,636
是周四吗？
Thursday. Is this Thursday?

96
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,181
-我想是吧
-周四？不可能的
-I think so. -Thursday! Oh , no, it can't be !

97
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,849
真讨厌
It's too gruesome.

98
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,189
周四为何那么讨厌？
WeII , what's so gruesome about Thursday?

99
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,358
没什么，除了我永不记起周四的来临
Nothing , except I can never remember when it's coming up.

100
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,360
周三晚上我总不入睡
Wednesdays, I generaIIy just don't go to bed at aII

101
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,821
因为我要在十时四十五分起来
because I have to be up to catch the 1 0:45.

102
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,741
他们对探访时间有严格要求
And they're so particuIar about visiting hours.

103
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,618
可否替我找…
WouId you be a darIing and Iook under the bed

104
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
床下的鳄鱼皮鞋？
and see if you can find a pair of aIIigator shoes?

105
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,747
当然可以
Sure.

106
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,793
我要换衣服
I've got to do something about the way I Iook.

107
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,046
女孩不能脸色苍白的去星星
I mean , a girI just can't go to Sing Sing with a green face.

108
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,756
星星？
Sing Sing?

109
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,967
我一向认为这监狱的名字很古怪
Yes, I aIways thought it was a ridicuIous name for a prison .

110
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,055
较像一间歌剧院会取的名字
Sing Sing , I mean . It sounds more Iike it shouId be an opera house or something .

111
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,057
黑色鳄鱼皮鞋
BIack aIIigator.

112
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,894
所有探访者都悉心打扮
You know, aII the visitors make an effort to Iook their best. It's onIy fair.

113
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,022
所有女士也穿戴漂亮，真感动
ActuaIIy, it's very touching , aII the women wearing their prettiest things.

114
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,608
我爱看他们的装扮，还有孩子们的
I just Iove them for it. And I Iove the kids, too.

115
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,527
那是太太带去的孩子们
I mean the kids the wives bring .

116
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,029
在那儿见到孩子应该感可悲
但其实不是
It shouId be sad seeing kids there, but it isn't.

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,282
他们头上结了蝴蝶结，鞋子擦得发亮
They aII have ribbons in their hair and Iots of shine on their shoes.

118
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,992
你会以为他们要去吃点心
You'd think there was going to be ice cream .

119
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,787
我像在替你准备…
Now, as I understand it, what we're doing is getting you ready

120
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,248
-去星星探访人
-对
-to visit somebody at Sing Sing . -That's right.

121
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,126
从男人送的耳环…
You can aIways teII what kind of person a man reaIIy thinks you are

122
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,169
就知道他的为人
by the earrings he gives you .

123
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,338
它可以看穿人心
I must say, the mind reeIs.

124
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,673
我想知道那人是谁？
May I ask whom?

125
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,259
什么？我要探望谁吗？
Whom what? Oh , whom I go to visit, you mean?

126
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,969
我就是这个意思
I guess that's what I mean .

127
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,012
我不知道应否谈论这事
I don't know that I shouId even discuss it.

128
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,390
但他没有禁止我告诉别人
WeII , they never toId me not to teII anyone.

129
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,934
你定要立誓不透露半句
You must cross your heart and kiss your eIbow.

130
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,727
我尽力吧
I'II try.

131
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,772
你可能看过有关他的报导
他是沙里托马图
You probabIy read about him . H is name's SaIIy Tomato.

132
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,107
沙里托马图？
SaIIy Tomato?

133
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,483
别扮作受惊
WeII , don't Iook so shocked .

134
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,776
他们不能证明…
They couId never prove for a second

135
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,487
他是黑帮分子
that he was even part of the Mafia, much Iess head of it, my dear.

136
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,282
但他确实有逃税
The onIy thing they did prove was that he cheated his income tax a IittIe.

137
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,951
我只知道他是仁慈的老人
Anyway, aII I know is that he's a darIing oId man .

138
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,287
他从来不是我的情人
Oh , he was never my Iover or anything Iike that.

139
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,497
他入狱前我不认识他
In fact, I never knew him untiI after he was in prison .

140
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,790
但现在我喜欢他
But I adore him now.

141
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,626
过去七个月，我每逢周四去探访他
I mean , I've been going to see him every Thursday for seven months.

142
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,129
他不付钱，我也愿意去
Now I think I'd go even if he didn't pay me.

143
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,381
-鞋子
-我只找到一只
-Shoes. -I couId onIy find one.

144
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,845
他付钱给你？
He pays you?

145
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,014
或者说是他的律师付钱
That's right. Or anyway his Iawyer does.

146
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
我怀疑他不是律师
If he is a Iawyer, which I doubt, since he doesn't seem to have an office,

147
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,310
他只有留言机
onIy an answering service.

148
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,313
他经常要我到汉堡天堂找他
And he aIways wants to meet you at Hamburger Heaven .

149
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,151
找到了，谢谢
There you are, you sneak. Thank you .

150
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,193
别客气
You're weIcome.

151
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,237
裙子
Dress. Dress.

152
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,657
有了，手袋和帽子也有了
Here we are. Bag and a hat, too.

153
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,035
都有了
There we are.

154
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,830
七个月前，这个叫奥肖内西的律师问我…
Anyway, about seven months ago, this so-caIIed Iawyer, Mr O'Shaughnessy,

155
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,999
你可愿意去探访寂寞老人
asked me how I'd Iike to cheer up a IoneIy oId man

156
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,418
换取一百元周薪
and pick up $ 1 00 a week at the same time.

157
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,130
我说他找错人了
I toId him , "Look, darIing , you've got the wrong HoIIy GoIightIy."

158
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,925
好孩子很容易赚到这笔钱
A girI can do as weII as that on trips to the powder room .

159
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,843
女孩进入女厕
I mean , any gentIeman with the sIightest chic

160
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,095
任何人也愿意给她五十元
wiII give a girI a $50 biII for the powder room .

161
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,848
再给五十元计程车费
And I aIways ask for cab fare, too. That's another $50.

162
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,351
接着他说那老人叫沙里托马图
But then he said his cIient was SaIIy Tomato.

163
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,312
沙里在《艾摩》见到我
He said dear oId SaIIy had seen me at EImo's or somewhere

164
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,481
远远已被我吸引
and had admired me  la distance.

165
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,317
我可以每周去探访他吗？
So wouIdn't it be a good deed if I were to visit him once a week?

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,528
我怎可拒绝，这真是浪漫
WeII , how couId I say no? It was aII so wiIdIy romantic.

167
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,449
我看来怎样？
How do I Iook?

168
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,119
非常好看，你使我眼前一亮
Very good . I must say I'm amazed .

169
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,581
全赖你帮忙
You were a darIing to heIp, I couId never have done it without you .

170
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
-手袋
-欢迎随时找我
-Bag . -CaII me anytime.

171
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,255
我在楼上，只要我尽快搬进来
I'm just upstairs, or I wiII be as soon as I get moved in .

172
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,132
再见，猫咪
Bye, cat.

173
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,642
你跟他谈话一小时，就可得到一百元？
You mean he gives you $ 1 00 for an hour's conversation?

174
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,811
奥肖内西先生说的
WeII , Mr O'Shaughnessy does as soon as I meet him

175
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,146
我说出天气报告就有报酬
and give him the weather report.

176
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,232
此事与我无关
Look, it's none of my business, but it sounds to me

177
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,025
但你或会惹上麻烦
Iike you couId get in a Iot of troubIe.

178
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,069
替我拿着好吗？
HoId this for me, wiII you?

179
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,824
天气报告是什么？
And what do you mean , "weather report"?

180
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,702
传口讯
Oh , that's just a message I give Mr O'Shaughnessy.

181
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,162
只是想确定我曾到访
So he'II know I've reaIIy been up there.

182
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,581
沙里会说…
SaIIy teIIs me things to say Iike

183
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,792
“古巴有飓风
"There's a hurricane in Cuba"

184
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,837
“巴勒莫多云”，一些类似的东西
and , "It's cIoudy over PaIermo." Things Iike that.

185
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,549
别担心，我懂得照顾自己
You don't have to worry. I've taken care of myseIf for a Iong time.

186
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,267
计程车
Taxi !

187
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,068
-我永远不能办得到
-很容易的
-I never couId do that. -It's easy.

188
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,995
保罗
PauI .

189
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,706
我知道我迟了
I'm Iate. I know it.

190
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,170
别说你没进去，你没有钥匙吗？
Don't teII me you were Iocked out? Didn't you get the key?

191
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,214
很抱歉
Oh , darIing . I'm so sorry.

192
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,968
不，我有钥匙
No, I got the key, aII right.

193
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,263
戈莱利小姐让我进去
Miss GoIightIy, my neighbour, was kind enough to Iet me in .

194
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
她要去星星监狱
Miss GoIightIy's on her way to Sing Sing .

195
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,310
-什么？
-当然是去探望别人
-Oh? -Just visiting , of course.

196
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,938
戈莱利小姐，她是法伦逊太太，我的设计师
Miss GoIightIy, Mrs FaIenson , my decorator.

197
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,067
-你好
-你好
-How do you do? -How do you do?

198
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,321
让我看看你
DarIing . Let me Iook at you .

199
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,907
-你说完了吗？
-旅程很可怕吗？
-Are you through? -Was the fIight absoIuteIy ghastIy?

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,700
我有急事
I'm in a terribIe rush .

201
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,995
中央车站，请尽快
Grand CentraI Station , and step on it, darIing .

202
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,958
我和你真的只分开三周吗？
Is it reaIIy onIy three weeks since I Ieft you in Rome?

203
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,960
好像分别很久了
Seems Iike years.

204
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,463
-你看过寓所吗？
-还没看过
-You seen the apartment? -Not yet.

205
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
是我不对
I know it was wicked of me, but I couIdn't resist.

206
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,718
我先替你打点一切
I went ahead and fixed it up without you .

207
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,178
我认为很好看
I think it's darIing of course

208
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,516
若你不喜欢
我们可以改掉一切，重新布置
but if you absoIuteIy hate it, we can rip everything up and start from scratch .

209
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,029
戈莱利小姐
Miss GoIightIy!

210
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,242
你要去哪儿？
Hey, baby! Where you going?

211
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,622
快点开门
Come on , baby. Open the door.

212
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,875
友善点吧
Be a paI .

213
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,003
你在破坏一个美妙的派对
You're breaking up a beautifuI party.

214
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,675
快点开门
Come on , baby. Open the door.

215
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,094
乐队已开始演奏
Hey, the band's swinging .

216
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,472
来吧，宝贝
Come on , baby.

217
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,270
戈莱利小姐，我要再次抗议
Miss GoIightIy. Once again , I must protest!

218
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,481
若你不关掉唱机
If you don't stop that phonograph right this minute,

219
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,192
我会报警
I'm going to caII the poIice department!

220
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,822
这样好多了
Yeah . That's more better.

221
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,828
宝贝，怎么了？
What's the matter, baby?

222
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,669
你是好孩子，快开门
Come on . You're a great kid . Open the door.

223
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,175
来吧，我在等你
Come on , baby. I'm waiting for you .

224
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,488
-不用怕，只有我
-等等
-It's aII right. It's onIy me. -Now, wait a minute. Miss. . .

225
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,823
戈莱利，荷莉戈莱利
GoIightIy. HoIIy GoIightIy.

226
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,118
我住在楼下
今早我们曾碰面，记得吗？
I Iive downstairs. We met this morning , remember?

227
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,703
对
Yeah .

228
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
没问题，她已走了
It's aII right. She's gone.

229
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,877
难得她这么晚还工作
I must say, she works Iate hours for a decorator.

230
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,672
一名可怕的人在楼下
The thing is, I have the most terrifying man downstairs.

231
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,674
他没喝醉时是好人，但…
I mean , he's sweet when he isn't drunk

232
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,177
喝醉后就变成一头野兽
but Iet him start Iapping up the vino, and oh , goIIy, quel beast.

233
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,889
我受不了，所以从窗口逃出来
It finaIIy got so tiresome down there, I just went out the window.

234
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,896
你可以赶走我
Look, you can throw me out if you want to,

235
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,108
但你看来很友善，而你的朋友又离开了
but you did Iook so cosy in here, and your decorator friend had gone home

236
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,903
在外面很寒冷
and it was beginning to get a bit coId out there on the fire escape.

237
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,906
听说纽约人…
And I aIways heard peopIe in New York

238
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,117
与邻居是陌路人
never get to know their neighbours.

239
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,705
星星一事怎样？
WeII , how was Sing Sing?

240
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,832
很好
Fine.

241
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,626
我赶上火车，一切顺利
I made the train and everything .

242
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,795
天气报告怎样？
And what's the weather report?

243
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,465
“布洛克岛至哈特勒斯有警告”
"SmaII-craft warnings BIock IsIand to Hatteras."

244
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,634
管它是什么意思
Whatever that means.

245
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,140
你真可爱
You know, you're sweet. You reaIIy are.

246
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,020
你跟我的弟弟佛烈很相似
And you Iook a IittIe Iike my brother Fred .

247
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,522
你不介意我叫你佛烈吗？
Do you mind if I caII you Fred?

248
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,232
不介意
Not at aII .

249
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,697
三百元，她真慷慨
$300, she's very generous.

250
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,326
以周薪还是时薪计算？
Is it by the week, the hour or what?

251
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,202
好的，派对完结了，出去
Okay, the party's over. Out.

252
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,080
亲爱的佛烈，很抱歉
Oh , Fred . DarIing Fred , I'm sorry.

253
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,876
我不是蓄意伤害你的，别动怒
I didn't mean to hurt your feeIings. Don't be angry.

254
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,087
我只是想你明白
I was just trying to Iet you know I understand .

255
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,048
我谅解你
I understand compIeteIy.

256
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,092
好的，留下来吧
It's okay, stick around . Make yourseIf a drink.

257
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,719
拿胞子给我，我拿饮品给你
Throw me my robe and I'II make you one.

258
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,137
留在原地吧
You stay right where you are.

259
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,514
你一定很累
You must be absoIuteIy exhausted .

260
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,808
我是指现在已很晚
I mean , it is very Iate

261
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,353
你已入睡
and you were sound asIeep and everything .

262
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,107
你定认为我厚颜无耻
I suppose you think I'm very brazen or tr猫s fou or something .

263
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,151
其他人也是这样
I don't think you're any fouer than anybody eIse.

264
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,112
对，我不介意
Yes, you do. Everybody does. And I don't mind .

265
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,532
在公寓里住在最高层真有用
It's usefuI being top banana in the shock department.

266
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,537
你干什么的？
What do you do, anyway?

267
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,375
-我是作家，可能是吧
-可能？你不知道吗？
-I'm a writer, I guess. -You guess? Don't you know?

268
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,128
好的，正确而且肯定地说
Okay. Positive statement. Ringing affirmative.

269
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,923
我是作家
I'm a writer.

270
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,302
我唯一曾约会作家班尼谢克立
The onIy writer I've ever been out with is Benny ShackIett.

271
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,680
他为电视台编写东西，但差劲极了
He's written an awfuI Iot of teIevision stuff, but quel rat.

272
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,309
你是真正的作家吗？
TeII me, are you a reaI writer?

273
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,355
有人买下你的作品，替你出版吗？
I mean , does anybody buy what you write or pubIish it or anything?

274
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,817
他们买下箱子子里的东西
They bought what's in that box.

275
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,028
你写的吗？
Yours?

276
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,155
这些书都是吗？
AII these books?

277
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,032
是同一本书
WeII , there's just the one book.

278
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,534
有十二本
TweIve copies of it.

279
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,869
保罗华杰的《九条生命》
"Nine Lives by PauI Varjak."

280
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,831
这些是故事
They're stories.

281
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,791
共有九个
N ine of them .

282
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,128
告诉我其中一个
TeII me one.

283
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,381
这些不是适合说出来的故事
They're not the kind of stories you can reaIIy teII .

284
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,258
太卑鄙吗？
Too dirty?

285
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,179
可算是吧，但不是故意的
Yeah , I suppose they're dirty, too, but onIy incidentaIIy.

286
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,143
大部分评语是愤怒、感性、有共鸣
MainIy they're angry, sensitive, intenseIy feIt

287
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,604
最差的形容是“有希望”
and that dirtiest of aII dirty words, promising .

288
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:35,234
引述自1956年10月1日《时代杂志》书中
Or so said The Times Book Review, October 1 st, 1 956.

289
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,154
-1956年？
-对
-1 956? -That's right.

290
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,784
我可能很无礼，但你最近有何作品？
I suppose this is kind of a ratty question , but what have you written IateIy?

291
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,954
最近我在写一本小说
LateIy I've been working on a noveI .

292
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,332
-自从1956年到现在？
-写小说要花很多时间
-LateIy, since 1 956? -WeII , a noveI takes a Iong time.

293
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,044
-我想做到最好
-所以没有写故事？
-I want to get it exactIy right. -So no more stories.

294
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
我的想法是…
WeII , the idea is

295
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,216
我不想在小事上浪费才华
I'm supposed to not fritter my taIent away on IittIe things.

296
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,844
我想留待重要时刻才用
I'm supposed to be saving it for the big one.

297
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,889
你每天也写作吗？
TeII me, do you write every day?

298
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,515
当然
Sure.

299
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,809
-今天呢？
-当然
-Today? -Sure.

300
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,812
-打字机很漂亮
-是
-It's a beautifuI typewriter. -Of course.

301
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,232
我只写感性、有共鸣和有希望的散文
It writes nothing but sensitive, intenseIy feIt, promising prose.

302
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,276
但里面没有打字带
But there's no ribbon in it.

303
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,820
-没有？
-对
-There isn't? -No.

304
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,032
噢
Oh .

305
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,578
今早你提及的事…
You know, something you said this morning has been

306
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,288
使我很困扰
bothering me aII day.

307
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,998
什么？
What's that?

308
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,502
你去女厕，他们真的给你五十元吗？
Do they reaIIy give you $50 whenever you go to the powder room?

309
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,170
当然
Of course.

310
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,839
你一定很出色
You must do very weII .

311
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,009
我努力储钱，但不太成功
I'm trying to save, but I'm not very good at it.

312
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,018
你和我弟弟佛烈真的很相似
You know, you do Iook a Iot Iike my brother Fred .

313
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,648
自从我离家，即十四岁后就不曾见过他
I haven't seen him , of course, since I was 1 4. That's when I Ieft home.

314
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,734
当时他已有一百八十五公分高
And he was aIready 6'2".

315
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,446
可能是花生酱的功效
I guess it must have been the peanut butter that did it.

316
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,742
所有人也认为他对花生酱过分疯狂
Everybody thought he was dotty the way he gorged himseIf on peanut butter.

317
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,620
但他不是疯狂
But he wasn't dotty.

318
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,916
只是可爱、含糊和极迟钝
Just sweet and vague and terribIy sIow.

319
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,547
可怜的佛烈，他现在从军
Poor Fred . He's in the army now.

320
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,051
那是最适合他的地方，直至我储够足够金钱
It's reaIIy the best pIace for him untiI I can get enough money saved .

321
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,012
-接着怎样？
-我和佛烈就…
-And then? -And then Fred and I . . .

322
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,016
我曾到墨西哥
I went to Mexico once.

323
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,061
那儿是养马的好地方
It's a wonderfuI pIace for raising horses.

324
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,815
有一处近海的地方…
I saw one pIace near the sea that. . .

325
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,985
佛烈擅于跟马儿相处
Fred's very good with horses.

326
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,572
但墨西哥的土地也很昂贵
But even Iand in Mexico costs something .

327
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,074
不管我如何努力，我的户口…
And no matter what I do, there never seems to be more than

328
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,577
总不会超过数百元
a coupIe of hundred doIIars in the bank.

329
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,289
不可能是四时三十分
It can't be 4: 30.

330
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,292
不可能的
It just can't.

331
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,633
你不介意我到你的床上去吗？
Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?

332
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,679
没问题
It's aII right. ReaIIy, it is.

333
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,391
我们是朋友，仅此而已
We're friends, that's aII .

334
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,771
我们是朋友吗？
We are friends, aren't we?

335
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,608
当然
Sure.

336
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,617
好的
Okay.

337
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,369
不再说话吧
Let's don't say another word .

338
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,539
我们一起入睡
Let's just go to sIeep.

339
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,147
佛烈，你在哪儿？
Where are you , Fred?

340
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,984
因为很寒冷
Because it's coId .

341
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,950
所以风里有雪
There's snow and wind .

342
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,330
怎么了？
What is it? What's the matter?

343
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,168
为何你在哭？
Why are you crying?

344
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,552
若我们是朋友，就要弄清楚一件事
If we're going to be friends, Iet's just get one thing straight right now.

345
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,681
我讨厌被打探
I hate snoops.

346
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,792
亲爱的佛烈

347
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,671
昨晚请原谅我
你可否在六时到我家来

348
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,548
你的朋友荷莉戈莱利

349
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,443
-是谁？
-亲爱的，是我
-Yeah . -Lucille, darling? 2-E.

350
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,613
我很想找你
I've been trying desperateIy to reach you .

351
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,157
比尔刚回来
BiII just got back.

352
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,159
他早一天回来
A day earIy, the beast.

353
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,327
看来我不能来
So I'm afraid I'II have to beg off.

354
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,913
你会向其他女孩解释吗？
You'II expIain to the rest of the girIs?

355
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,624
你真好
You're a darIing .

356
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,544
或许明天我们可一起午膳
Maybe we can have a Iong Iunch tomorrow.

357
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,380
我在早上致电找你
I'II phone you in the morning .

358
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,841
随你怎么说
Whatever you say.

359
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,802
今晚我不在没问题吗？
And you wiII manage to survive without me tonight?

360
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,512
当然
Sure.

361
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,557
我可以专心写作
I might even take a wiId , boyish fIing at writing .

362
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
-晚安
-晚安
-Good night. -Good night.

363
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,963
你使自己吃不消了
You got yourseIf stuffed , huh , PoIIy, baby?

364
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,466
真活该
Serves you right, big mouth .

365
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,848
-你好
-什么？
-Buongiorno. -H uh?

366
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,810
你没喝酒吗？
Aren't you drinking?

367
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,482
你有口袋或其他东西吗？
You got pockets there or something? What do you go by?

368
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,361
你叫什么名字？怎称呼自己？
What's your name? What's your name? What do you caII yourseIf?

369
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,989
-艾文
-真好
-Irving . -Perfect. Perfect.

370
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,825
宝贝艾文
That's wonderfuI , Irving .

371
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,537
我很快回来
I'II be right back, Irving , baby.

372
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,296
她仍在淋浴，她想你来吗？
Yeah? Whoa ! Kid's stiII in the shower. You expected?

373
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,215
我获邀到来
I was invited . That what you mean?

374
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,260
请别见怪，进来
Now don't get yourseIf aII tense and sore, paI . Come on in .

375
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,763
只是有很多人不请自来
It's a party. There's a Iot of characters come around here, they're not expected .

376
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,223
我请你喝一杯，你喝酒吧？
I'II buy you a drink. You drink?

377
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,558
-喝
-那我请你喝一杯
-Yeah . -Then I'II buy you a drink.

378
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,184
好的
Okay.

379
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,854
你的裙子破了
Hey, honey, your skirt's spIit there.

380
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,273
-你喝什么？
-威士忌
-What do you drink, kid? -Bourbon .

381
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,315
威士忌？
Bourbon?

382
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,609
-要加冰吗？
-不，加水行了
-On the rocks? -Yeah . No. With water.

383
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,444
你想先加冰吗？
AII right, you want rocks first, though , don't you?

384
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,988
-好的
-没问题
-Yeah . -Good , you got them .

385
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,824
-不要太多
-给你的，可使你自由自在
-Not too much . -AII right. That'II set you free.

386
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,869
-跟她相识已久吗？
-不太久，我住在楼上
-You know the kid Iong? -Not very. I Iive upstairs.

387
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,121
说笑吗？看看这儿
You're kidding . Boy, Iook at this pIace, wiII you?

388
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,957
难以置信，像个废墟
What a pIace. It's unbeIievabIe. What a dump.

389
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,417
你认为怎样？
What do you think?

390
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,211
-什么怎样？
-她是不是？
-About what? -Is she or isn't she?

391
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,755
等等
Wait a minute. HoId it.

392
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,260
-哈瑞特
-J.B.你好
-Harriet. -H i , J . B.

393
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,803
J.B.？奥杰，怎么了？
"J . B."? O.J . What is that?

394
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,138
你好
AII right. HeIIo there.

395
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,098

-你好
-You know GiI . -Yeah . How are you? Good to see you .

396
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,641
-喝一杯如何？
-厨房…
-How about a drink? -Fine. In the kitchen .

397
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,186
-有你需要的一切
-谢谢
-You'II find everything you need . -Thanks.

398
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,023
甜心，是你
So. . . Oh , honey, that is you , that is you .

399
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,234
佛烈，很高兴你来了
Fred , darIing , I'm so gIad you couId come.

400
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,987
我买来乔迁礼物
I brought you a house present, something for the bookcase.

401
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,739
你真好
You're sweet.

402
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,657
九条生命

403
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,202
很好看吗？奥杰，给我香烟
Doesn't that Iook nice? Give me a cigarette, O.J .

404
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,328
没问题
Sure, sure.

405
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,872
我的经纪人奥杰广交朋友
O.J . 's a great agent. He knows a terrific Iot of phone numbers.

406
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,790
杰瑞沃德的电话号码是几号？
What's Jerry WaId's phone number, O.J . ?

407
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,833
我已下班
Oh , come on , Iay off.

408
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,669
我想你致电告诉他，佛烈是一名天才
DarIing , I want you to caII him and teII him what a genius Fred is.

409
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:33,795
我来
Yeah , I got it.

410
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,257
别害羞，你不是自夸，我说你是天才
Stop bIushing , Fred . You didn't say you were genius, I did .

411
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,469
别推辞，你怎样使佛烈…
So quit staIIing , O.J . Just teII me what you're going to do

412
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,845
名成利就？
to make Fred rich and famous.

413
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,098
你何不让佛烈解决这事？
Now why don't you Iet Fred baby and me settIe that matter, huh , puppy?

414
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,351
记着，我是经纪人
Okay. But just remember, I'm the agent.

415
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,937
他已经有一名设计师。我是经纪人。
He's aIready got a decorator, I'm the agent.

416
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,606
等等
HoId it. HoId it.

417
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,192
你们好，进来吧
H i , there, boys. Come on in , there.

418
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,278
厨房有一切必需品
Right in the kitchen , you'II find everything you need .

419
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,990
听着，佛烈
So, Iisten , Fred baby.

420
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,952
-不，我叫保罗
-我还以为你叫佛烈
-No, it's PauI baby. -Oh , it is? I thought it was Fred baby.

421
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,495
-不
-你还没回答我的问题
-No. -WeII , answer the question , aII right?

422
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,206
-她是不是？
-是不是什么？
-Is she or isn't she? -Is she or isn't she what?

423
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,999
骗子
A phoney.

424
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,168
我不知道，看来不是
I don't know. I don't think so.

425
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,797
看来不是？你错了，她是
You don't think so, huh? WeII , you're wrong , she is.

426
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,968
但另一方面你说对了，因为她是真正的骗子。
But on the other hand , you're right, because she's a reaI phoney.

427
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,720
因为她真的相信…
You know why? Because she honestIy beIieves aII this phoney junk

428
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:24,763
自己所干的事
that she beIieves in .

429
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,350
我是说真的，我喜欢她，真的
I mean it. Now Iook, I Iike the kid . I mean , I sincereIy Iike the kid . I do.

430
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,851
我很敏感
I mean , I'm sensitive, that's why.

431
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,229
你要敏感才会喜欢她
I mean , you gotta be sensitive to Iike the kid , you know what I mean?

432
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,981
这是一种感觉，很诗意
It's what you caII a touch , a streak of the poet,

433
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,065
你懂吗？
you know what I mean?

434
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,483
你跟她相识很久吗？
You known her Iong?

435
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,901
我发掘她
Are you kidding? I'm the guy that discovered her.

436
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,069
我是奥杰伯曼
I'm O.J . Berman .

437
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,737
数年前…
A coupIe of years ago, back on the coast there.

438
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,115
她只是一个小孩。她别具风格，气质不凡
She was just a kid . Of course, she had a Iot of styIe. A Iot of cIass.

439
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,492
-什么不凡？
-气质不凡
-A Iot of what? -CIass. I said she had Iot of cIass.

440
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,244
但当她开口说话
But of course, when she opened her mouth ,

441
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,038
你就知道她是乡下人
you didn't know what she was taIking , whether she was a hiIIbiIIy or an Okie.

442
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,957
你知道替她改掉口音花了多少时间？
You know how Iong it took me to smooth out that accent?

443
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,375
-不知
-我告诉你多久
-No. -I'II teII you how Iong .

444
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,669
一年，可知我怎样做到？
One year. You know how we did it?

445
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,421
我们要她学法文
We gave her French Iessons. Yeah .

446
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,880
当她学懂法文
Figured once she couId imitate French ,

447
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,882
学习英语就不是难题
she'd have no troubIe imitating EngIish .

448
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,094
最终我为她安排了试镜
And , finaIIy, when I thought she'd be ready, I arranged for a IittIe screen test.

449
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,596
试镜前一夜，我差点气死了
WeII , the night before the screen test. . . WeII , I couId've kiIIed myseIf.

450
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,515
试镜前一夜，电话响起
The night before the screen test, the phone rings.

451
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,684
我接起电话，她说： “我是荷莉”
I pick it up, I said , "O.J . speaking ." She says, "This is HoIIy."

452
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,103
我说： “你看来在远处”
I says, "HoIIy? HoIIy, you sound so far away, honey. What's with you?"

453
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,146
她说她在纽约
She says, "I'm in New York."

454
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,772
我说： “但你明天要去试镜”
I said , "What? You got a screen test tomorrow."

455
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,025
她说不曾到过纽约
She says, "I'm in New York because I've never been to New York before."

456
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,443
我叫她回来
I said , "Get yourseIf on the pIane. Get back here."

457
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,569
但她说不想
She says, "I don't wanna."

458
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,612
我说： “你不想回来是什么意思？”
I say, "What do you mean , you don't wanna? What do you want?"

459
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,656
她说不想，我说： “你想怎样？”
She says, "I don't wanna." I say, "What do you want?"

460
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,784
她说： “我知道后再通知你”
She says, "When I find out what I want, I'm gonna Iet you know." Bang .

461
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,495
-所以佛烈，你别对我说…
-我是保罗
-So, Iook, Fred baby, you know. . . -It's PauI baby.

462
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,040
别说她不是骗子
PauI baby. Sure. I mean , don't teII me that she isn't a phoney.

463
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,124
你懂吗？
You know what I mean?

464
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,127
亲爱的甜心，你去了哪儿？
Irving . Honey, Irving , where have you been?

465
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,312
很好，谢谢
Great, thanks.

466
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,231
麦克，我想找你
Mike, darIing , I tried reaching you aII day Iong .

467
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,650
但你的留言机坏了
Your answering service doesn't answer.

468
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,319
你知道留言机问题很多
You know the troubIe peopIe have with answering services.

469
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,072
我也是这么想，你妈从没…
WeII , I guess so. CarefuI your mother never. . .

470
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,199
她很精神
She's been running around .

471
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,451
你看来很好
You Iook so wonderfuI .

472
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,372
我知道，他也知道她说了他的事
I know. And after aII that she said about him , and he knows that.

473
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,291
荷莉
HoIIy.

474
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,509
-时间
-什么？
-Time, darIing . -What?

475
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,718
现在几点？
The time?

476
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,470
-你有手表吗？
-不，我没有
-Do you have a watch? -No, I don't.

477
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,015
-让我看，现在六时四十五分
-谢谢你
-Let me see it. It's 6:45. -Thank you so much , dear.

478
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,435
可以借我吗？
Can I borrow it?

479
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,237
真的有需要吗？
ReaIIy, was that necessary?

480
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,506
派对很热闹，他们是谁？
This is some party. Who are aII these peopIe, anyhow?

481
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,134
不知道，人们自动涌来
Who knows? The word gets out.

482
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,511
你不介意吗？
You don't mind , do you , darIing?

483
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,556
补给来了
Reinforcements.

484
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,478
-我该放在哪儿？
-那儿
-Where do I put it? -Right in there.

485
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,660
荷莉

486
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,123
荷莉
HoIIy, darIing .

00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,460
-怎么了？
-梅格怀尔伍德
-What's that? -Mag WiIdwood .

488
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,006
她是模特儿，并且是闷蛋
She's a modeI , beIieve it or not, and a thumping bore.

489
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,509
看看她带来的好东西
But just Iook at the goodies she brought with her.

490
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:55,348
他也不错。若你喜欢肤色黝黑、英俊的富商，
He's aII right, I suppose, if you Iike dark, handsome, rich-Iooking men

491
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,434
加上热情和牙齿齐全
with passionate natures and too many teeth .

492
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,020
我不是指这个，是另一个
I don't mean that one. I mean the other one.

493
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,525
-另一个？
-他是拉斯蒂特拉勒
-The other one? -He's Rusty TrawIer.

494
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,236
拉斯蒂特拉勒
Rusty TrawIer.

495
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,907
他是美国第九富商，未到五十岁
He happens to be the ninth-richest man in America under 50.

496
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,787
这是非常有用的资料
Now that indeed is a remarkabIe piece of information to have at your fingertips.

497
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,789
我很留意这些消息
I keep track of these things.

498
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,711
-抱歉，你欠我四十七…
-替我拿着好吗？
-Excuse me. You owe me $47. . . -HoId this a minute, wiII you , darIing?

499
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,798
你在这儿干什么？
Mag , darIing , what are you doing here?

500
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,636
我在上面和雄志工作
Honey, I was upstairs working with Yunioshi .

501
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,055
为《哈泼时尚》拍摄复活节特刊
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

502
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,350
接着他们俩来接我
Then these two nice boys came to pick me up.

503
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,103
其实消息传达错误
It was a mistake, of course. My wires got crossed somewhere.

504
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,606
但他们均非常可爱
They were both very sweet about it.

505
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,984
他是来自巴西的…
May I present Jos茅 da SiIva Pereira?

506
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,237
荷西贝雷拉
He's from BraziI .

507
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,405
戈莱利小姐

508
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,702
你真好，让我参加你的派对
Very kind of you , Miss GoIightIy, to aIIow me to attend your party.

509
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,580
我对北美文化很有兴趣
I'm so interested in North American cuIture.

510
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,625
我曾到自由女神像
I've been aIready, of course, to the Statue of Liberty

511
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,169
和那著名餐馆
and to the restaurant Automatique.

512
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,382
这是我首次到访北美民居
But this is the first time I'm in a typicaI North American home.

513
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,094
他是不是很棒？
WouIdn't he just meIt in your mouth?

514
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,179
这是拉斯蒂特拉勒

515
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,764
她是戈莱利小姐
Miss GoIightIy.

516
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,016
我带他们来你不会生气吧？
You're not vexed at me for bringing them?

517
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,185
-当然不会
-我很高兴
-Of course not, darIing . -I'm gIad .

518
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,355
谁会给我美国威士忌？
Now, who's going to bring me a bourbon?

519
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,399
-奥杰
-什么事？
-O.J . -Yeah?

520
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,069
-你可替怀尔伍德小姐拿饮品吗？

-WouId you get Miss WiIdwood a drink? -Yeah . Which one's Miss WiIdwood?

521
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,240
伯曼先生，我们还没正式介绍
Mr Berman , we haven't been formaIIy introduced ,

522
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,702
我是梅格怀尔伍德，来自山脉连连的…
but I'm Mag WiIdwood from WiIdwood , Arkansas.

523
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,495
阿肯色州
That's hiII country.

524
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,414
视这儿为家吧
You just make yourseIf right at home, senhor.

525
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,873
别烦恼
Oh , do not troubIe yourseIf.

526
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,877
我想学习贵国的风俗习惯
I'm contented to stand observing the customs of your country.

527
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,546
好的
Okay, you do that.

528
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,590
跟我来，特拉勒先生
Now, come aIong , Mr TrawIer.

529
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,426
看看有什么可使你惊喜
Let's see what we can find to amuse you with .

530
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,360
噢，不
Oh , no.

531
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,154
不，不，不
No, no, no.

532
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,127
我不该来接你
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

533
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,546
你是要来接我，但最后我叫吉尔来
You said you wouId pick me up, and at the Iast minute, I had GiI come. . .

534
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,800
我不该来
Look, I wasn't supposed to pick you up, here or anywhere.

535
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,972
-是
-戈莱利小姐
-Yes? -Miss GoIightIy?

536
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,600
我警告你
This time I'm warning you .

537
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,562
这次我一定会找警察

00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,123
晚安
Good evening .

539
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,167
有重要事吗？
Is it something important?

540
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,169
不，只是住在楼上的人
No. Just the guy upstairs.

541
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,671
他投诉太嘈吵
CompIaining about the noise.

542
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,548
他很愤怒吗？
He's angry.

543
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,175
他提及要去报警
WeII , he did mention something about caIIing the poIice.

544
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,720
警员？
Oh , the poIice. The poIice?

545
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,473
我不能碰上他们，我最好找怀尔伍德小姐并且离去
Oh . That I cannot have. I'd better Iook for Miss WiIdwood and go.

546
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,229
我的情郎…
To think I'd find a beau of mine,

547
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,399
追求一名好莱坞劣货
mousing after a piece of cheap HoIIywood trash .

548
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,235
-梅格，你是一名闷蛋
-闭嘴
-Mag , darIing , you're being a bore. -Shut up.

549
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,781
你知道会发生何事吗？
You . You know what's going to happen to you?

550
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:27,162
我会带你到动物园，让牦牛吃掉你
I am going to march you over to the zoo and feed you to the yak.

551
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,165
只要我喝完这杯就行
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

552
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,509
避开
Timber!

553
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,269
抱歉
Sorry.

554
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,480
艾德，晚安

556
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,316
-你记得艾文吗？
-你好
-You remember Irving , don't you? -Yeah . H i , Irving .

557
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,819

558
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,488
-幸会

-WonderfuI seeing you . -Yes.

559
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,657
珠宝贼人
JeweI thieves.

560
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,595
星星

561
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,728
沙里帮我理财
SaIIy heIps me with my accounts.

562
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,063
我对数字毫无认识
I have no head for figures at aII .

563
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,984
我努力尝试储钱
I'm trying desperateIy to save some money. You know, I toId you .

564
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,819
但总不成功
I just can't seem to.

565
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,447
他要我记下一切
He makes me write down everything in there.

566
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,699
我买了什么，花费多少
What I get, what I spend .

567
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,037
我以往有支票户口，他迫我取消了
I used to have a checking account, but he made me get rid of that.

568
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,125
他认为我用现金更实际
He feeIs, for me, anyway, that it's better to operate on a cash basis, tax-wise.

569
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,589
佛烈，某天你将这书变成小说
Some day, Mr Fred , you take this book, turn it into a noveI .

570
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,217
一切都在内，只需加一些细节
Everything is there. Just fiII in a IittIe of the detaiIs.

571
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,803
一定惹笑
CertainIy wouId be good for some Iaughs.

572
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,139
看来不是
No. No, I don't think so.

573
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,933
这本书会使人心伤
This is a book wouId break the heart.

574
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,604
“菲兹西蒙斯先生，女厕，五十元”
"Mr Fitzsimmons, powder room , $50."

575
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,273

“猫粮，二十七角”
"Cat food , 27 cents."

578
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,240
沙里，停止，你使我脸红了
SaIIy, darIing , pIease stop. You're making me bIush .

579
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:55,078
但你对菲兹西蒙斯的说法没错
他是鼠辈
But you're right about Jack Fitzsimmons, he's an absoIute rat.

580
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:59,123
当然，我只认识鼠辈
I guess, of course, I don't reaIIy know anybody but rats.

581
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,334
当然，除了佛烈
Except, of course, Fred here.

582
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,671
你认为佛烈是好人吗？
You do think Fred is nice, don't you , SaIIy?

583
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,757
对你来说，我希望他是好人
For you , I hope he is.

584
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,057
跟我吻别
Give me a kiss goodbye.

585
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,770
沙里叔叔，下周再见
Goodbye, U ncIe SaIIy. TiII next week.

586
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,439
沙里叔叔，再见
Goodbye, U ncIe SaIIy.

587
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,483
别忘记寄那本书来
Goodbye and don't forget to send that book, eh?

588
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,193
不会忘
I won't.

589
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,572
天气报告怎样？
What about the weather report?

590
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,907
对
Oh , yes.

591
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,536
新奥尔良本周将下雪
Snow fIurries expected this weekend in New OrIeans.

592
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,043
新奥尔良本周将下雪？
Snow fIurries expected this weekend in New OrIeans?

593
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,838
真奇怪
Isn't that just the weirdest?

594
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,383
数百万年来，新奥尔良也不曾下雪
I bet they haven't had snow in New OrIeans for a miIIion years.

595
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,011
我不知道他怎么想出来
I don't know how he thinks them up.

596
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,521
我的朋友

597
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,856
有一位很可爱、胆小的女孩

598
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,357

00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,572
宽广
Wider than a mile

601
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,909
我遇上你
l'm crossing you in style

602
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,704
某天
Some day

603
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,127
造梦者
Oh, dream maker

00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,798
你使人心碎
You heartbreaker

605
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,303
不论你去哪儿
Wherever you're going

606
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,474
我也跟着走

去看外面的世界
Off to see the world

609
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,280
外面的天地
There's such a lot of world

610
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,741
多姿多采
To see

611
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,788
我们
We're after

612
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,583
在同一

00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,426
在那儿静候
Waiting 'round the bend

615
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,390
我的朋友

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,097
-怎么了？
-我不知道
-What's wrong? -I don't know.

623

可能没什么的
It's probabIy nothing .

624
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,520
我想看看他是否仍在
I want to see if he's stiII there.

625
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,149
看看谁仍在？你在说什么？

昨天下午我已留意到他
See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon .

628
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,209
我不想过分敏感，但…
I didn't say anything , I didn't want to sound neurotic

629
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,880
-今天他又在此
-你认为他是谁？
-but when he's there again today. . . -Who do you think he is?

630
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,884
可能是任何人，但我认为…
It couId be anybody, of course, but what crossed my mind was

631
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,679
比尔派他来监视我们？
suppose BiII's having us watched , huh?

632
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,726
好的，我会处理这事

不要去，求求你

00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,691
若这是事实，你会坏事
Look, if that's what it is, you'II onIy make everything worse.

635

637
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,198

638
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,117
我只想查明这事
I just want to find out what this is aII about.

639
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,349
好的，你想怎样？

你是荷莉的父亲？

644
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,217
她不是叫荷莉

653
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,284
弟弟、儿女在一起
her brother and her chiIdren .

654
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,994
儿女？
ChiIdren?

655
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,872
他们是她的儿女
Them's her chiIdren .

656
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,916
她有四名子女？
She's got four chiIdren?

657
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,419
我不是指她亲生的
Now, son , I didn't cIaim they was her naturaI-born chiIdren .

658
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,297
他们珍贵的母亲，是难得的女性
Their own precious mother, precious woman

659
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,842
她在1955年7月4日独立纪念日那天去世
passed away J uIy the 4th , Independence Day, 1 955,

660
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,594
灾难的一年
the year of the drought.

661
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,472
我和露拉美结婚时，她快要十四岁
When I married LuIa Mae, she was going on 1 4.

662
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,392
你以为十四岁的人不太清楚…
Now, you might think the average person going on 1 4

663
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,268
自己的想法
wouIdn't know his own mind .

664
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,437
但露拉美…
But you take LuIa Mae.

665
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,065
与别人不同
She was an exceptionaI person .

666
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:26,987
我跟你说
I'II teII you , son ,

667
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,491
她离去使我们心碎
she just pIumb broke our hearts when she run off Iike she done.

668
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,535
她毫无原因出走
Just pIain had no reason .

669
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,913
所有家务均由她的女儿负责
AII the housework was done by her daughters.

670
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,124
露拉美就这样离开了
LuIa Mae couId just take it easy.

671
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,210
她那时很胖
I teII you , that woman got positiveIy fat

672
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,463
弟弟则像个巨人
whiIe her brother, he growed up into a giant.

673
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,384
跟他们到来时有点分别
Which is a sight different from the way they come to us.

674
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,095
他们以往是野孩子
A coupIe of wiId young'uns, they was.

675
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,849
我发现他们在屋外偷奶和火鸡蛋
I caught them outside the house steaIing miIk and turkey eggs.

676
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,934
他们跟无良的人…
LuIa Mae and her brother had been Iiving

677
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,479
住在图纳
with some mean , no-account peopIe about 1 00 miIe east of TuIip.

678
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,315
她离开那儿是有理由的
She had good cause to run off from that house.

679
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,484
离开我家却毫无理由
Never had none to Ieave mine.

680
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,364
她的弟弟有离开吗？
What about her brother? Didn't he Ieave, too?

681
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,075
没有，佛烈跟我们一起，直至去参军
No, sir. We had Fred with us tiII they took him in the army.

682
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,995
佛烈来了一封信，所以我想跟她谈谈
That's what I come to taIk to her about. I had a Ietter from him .

683
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,872
他在二月就离开军队
He's getting out of the army in February.

684
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,666
所以我来找她
That's why I got on a Greyhound bus to come to get her.

685
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,461
她该和丈夫、子女、弟弟一起
LuIa Mae's pIace is with her husband , her chiIdren , and her brother.

686
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,256
什么？
H uh?

687
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,092
这是吃爆米花得来的奖品
你想要吗？
It's the prize in the Cracker Jack. You want it?

688
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,431
我永不明白她为何要离开
Never couId understand why that woman run off.

689
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,018
别告诉我她不快乐
Don't teII me she weren't happy.

690
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,353
她说话滔滔不绝
TaIky as a jaybird she was.

691
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,606
什么也爱谈
With something smart to say on every subject.

692
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,649
说话较广播还多
Better than the radio.

693
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,527
求婚当晚我哭得像宝宝
The night I proposed , I cried Iike a baby.

694
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,780
她说： “你为何哭？我们定会结婚
She said , "What you want to cry for, Doc? Of course we'II be married .

695
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,033
“以往我不曾结婚”
"I've never been married before."

696
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,870
我拥抱着她大笑
WeII , I had to Iaugh and to hug and to squeeze her.

697
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,623
“不曾结婚”
"Never been married before."

698
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,713
我给你忠告，我需要朋友
Listen , son . I advised you I need a friend .

699
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,009
因为我不想吓怕她
'Cause I don't want to surprise or scare her none.

700
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,803
做我的朋友，告诉她我来了
Be my friend . Let her know I'm here.

701
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,940
你愿意帮我吗？
WiII you do that for me, son?

702
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,364
当然，若你想这样
Yeah , sure, Doc. If that's what you want.

703
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,158
来吧
Come on .

704
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,879
好
AII right.

705
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,257
来了
Coming .

706
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,845
我要外出
Oh , darIing , I'm just on my way out.

707
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,181
我该在半小时前到《二十一》
I was supposed to be at 2 1 haIf an hour ago.

708
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,600
或许我们明天再喝酒吧？
Maybe we can have a drink or something tomorrow, huh?

709
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,602
好的，露拉美
Sure, LuIa Mae,

710
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,729
若明天你还在
if you're stiII here tomorrow.

711
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,361
求求你，他在哪儿？
Oh , pIease, where is he?

712
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,989
佛烈？
Fred?

713
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,117
佛烈？

714
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,620
天啊
Gosh .

715
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,455
露拉美
LuIa Mae.

716
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,840
你没吃东西吗？你太瘦了
Gee, honey, don't they feed you up here? You're so skinny.

717
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,682
-你好，医生
-露拉美
-H i , Doc. -Gosh , LuIa Mae.

718
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,393
我来了
Kingdom come.

719
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,622
怎么了？你没事吗？
What is it? What's the matter? Are you aII right?

720
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,999
没事吧
I guess so. No, I'm not.

721
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,835
-佛烈，你可以帮我吗？
-若我可以的话
-Fred , wiII you heIp me? -If I can .

722
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,088
我想你陪我们在车站
I want you to come to the bus station with us, Doc and me.

723
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,340
-什么？
-他还以为我会跟他回去
-What? -He stiII thinks I'm going back with him .

724
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,801
我需要人支持，我不能独自面对
I need support. I don't think I can pIay this scene aIone.

725
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,636
我该怎办？他是你的丈夫
HoIIy, what can I do? He's your husband .

726
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,305
-不，他不是
-他不是？
-No, he's not. -He's not?

727
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,850
多年前已解除婚约，但他不死心
It was annuIIed ages ago, but he just won't accept it.

728
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,978
求求你，我会说你来看我们
PIease, Fred . I'II teII him you're coming to see us off.

729
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,772
别说话
Don't say anything .

730
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,276
一小时后在门前等我们
Just meet us out front in about an hour. PIease?

731
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,577
你在这儿等候，我去拿手袋
You wait right here, honey. I'II get the bag .

732
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,208
我想去买杂志
Why don't I get some magazines?

733
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,502
佛烈，求你别离开我
PIease, Fred . Don't Ieave me.

734
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,087
注意
Attention, please.

735
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,132
到达拉斯…
Leaving from platform five, through coach to Dallas,

736
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,843
费城、哥伦布、印第安诺波利斯、特雷霍特…
Philadelphia, Columbus, lndianapolis, Terre Haute,

737
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,346
圣路易、土耳沙、俄克拉荷马市、丹尼森、达拉斯…
St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Denison, Dallas.

738
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,348
露拉美，我们要起行了
Come on , LuIa Mae. That's us.

739
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,434
医生，我不会跟你走
Doc, I'm not coming with you .

740
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:52,479
我们慢慢走，我尝试作出解释
Come on . Let's waIk together quietIy and I'II try and heIp you understand .

741
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,356
佛烈，帮我向他解释
HeIp me taIk to him , Fred .

742
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,482
没关系
It's aII right, son .

743
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,944
我很感激你想帮忙，但这是我和露拉美之间的事
I appreciate you wanna heIp, but it's between LuIa Mae and me.

744
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,863
当然
Sure, Doc.

745
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,701
露拉美，我爱你
I Iove you , LuIa Mae.

746
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,537
我知道，这就是烦恼所在
I know you do, and that's just the troubIe.

747
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,124
你爱上野性的东西是错误
It's a mistake you aIways made, Doc, trying to Iove a wiId thing .

748
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,918
你经常带野生动物回家
You were aIways Iugging home wiId things.

749
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,463
一次是折翼的鹰
Once it was a hawk with a broken wing

750
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,841
另一次是断脚的成年野猫
and another time it was a fuII-grown wiIdcat with a broken Ieg .

751
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,092
记得吗？
Remember?

752
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,343
露拉美，有时候…
LuIa Mae, there's something . . .

753
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,804
你不应爱上野性的东西
You mustn't give your heart to a wiId thing .

754
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,848
你越爱它，它变得越强
The more you do, the stronger they get.

755
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,268
直至它离开，跑到树林或飞到树上
U ntiI they're strong enough to run into the woods or fIy into a tree.

756
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,979
再去更高的树，直达天际
And then to a higher tree and then to the sky.

757
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,732
露拉美，我定要告诉你一件事
LuIa Mae, there's something I got to teII you .

758
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,651
数周前我收到佛烈的一封信
A coupIe of weeks ago, I got a Ietter from young Fred .

759
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,738
他很好吗？
From Fred? He's aII right, isn't he?

760
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,741
他很好
Yeah , he's fine, I guess.

761
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,451
二月他会离开军队
He's getting out of the army in February.

762
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,496
-他信里是这么说的
-二月？
-That's what he wrote to teII me. -In February?

763
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,831
只相距四个月
WeII , that's onIy four months.

764
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,083
明白吗？你必须跟我回去
So you see, you got to come back with me, LuIa Mae.

765
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,377
你该和我、子女及弟弟一起
Your pIace is with me and your chiIdren and your brother.

766
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,880
医生，你得明白我不可回头
Doc, you've got to understand . I can't come back.

767
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,382
你得明白我所说的话
And you got to understand what I'm trying to teII you .

768
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,260
我不想给你压力，但必须这样
Now, I don't want to seem Iike I'm pressuring you none, but now I got to.

769
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,678
你不回来…
If you don't come back with me,

770
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,764
我就要写信告诉佛烈…
I'm gonna have to write young Fred and teII him that

771
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,642
他要另找家园或继续参军
unIess he wants to Iook out for hisseIf, he better sign up for another hitch .

772
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,269
别这样做，别写信给他
Doc, don't you do that. Don't write that to him .

773
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,897
我会自己写信给他，我要他跟我在一起。
I'II write him myseIf and teII him I want him here with me.

774
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,482
别担心，我会照顾他
I'II take care of him . Don't you worry.

775
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,108
露拉美，你是痴人说梦
You're taIking crazy, LuIa Mae.

776
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,529
住口，我不再是露拉美
Doc, stop caIIing me that. I'm not LuIa Mae any more.

777
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,371
好的，露拉美
AII right, LuIa Mae.

778
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,541
你该知道自己在干什么
I guess you know what you're doing .

779
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,010
你替我看着她好吗？
Keep an eye on her, wiII you , son?

780
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:50,389
至少确保她吃点东西
At Ieast see she eats something once in a whiIe.

781
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,391
好的
Sure, Doc.

782
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,562
她太瘦了
So skinny.

783
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,749
医生，求你谅解我
PIease, Doc. PIease understand .

784
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,545
我爱你，但我不再是露拉美
I Iove you , but I'm just not LuIa Mae any more.

785
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,050
不再是
I'm not.

786
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,340
你可知道什么最可怕？
You know the terribIe thing , Fred , darIing?

787
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,216
我仍然是露拉美
I am stiII LuIa Mae.

788
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,429
那个十四岁，偷火鸡蛋越过荆棘的女孩
Fourteen years oId , steaIing turkey eggs and running through a briar patch .

789
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,227
除了现在我将之称为令人满面通红的事
But now I caII it having the mean reds.

790
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,488
现在去蒂芙尼太早了
WeII , it's stiII too earIy to go to Tiffany's.

791
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,324
最好是去喝酒
I guess the next best thing is a drink.

792
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,202
对，我很需要喝酒
Yes, I very much need a drink.

793
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,622
-佛烈，你愿意请我喝酒吗？
-当然
-WiII you buy me one, Fred , darIing? -Sure.

794
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,211
答应我一件事，我喝醉了才送我回家
OnIy promise me one thing . Don't take me home untiI I'm drunk.

795
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,799
该是非常醉才对
U ntiI I'm very drunk indeed .

796
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,294
你认为她有才华吗？
Do you think she's taIented?

797
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:30,257
-她有深度吗？
-不
-DeepIy and importantIy taIented? -No.

798
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,468
只是很肤浅
AmusingIy and superficiaIIy taIented , yes,

799
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:37,389
但谈不上有深度
but deepIy and importantIy, no.

800
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,455
很优美
Gracious.

801
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,875
你认为她收入丰富吗？
Do you think she's handsomeIy paid?

802
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,089
丰富
Oh , indeed .

803
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,384
让我告诉你
WeII , Iet me teII you something , mister.

804
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,804
若我的收入像她那么丰富，我定会较她富有
If I had her money, I'd be richer than she is.

805
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:21,266
-你怎知道？
-因为我有糖果店
-How do you figure that? -Because I'd keep the candy store.

806
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,020
沙里托马图就是我的糖果店
OId SaIIy Tomato. That's my candy store.

807
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,355
我总有沙里
I'd aIways keep SaIIy.

808
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,192
所以我较她富有
And that's why I'd be richer than she is.

809
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,155
我们要更多空气
We'd better get a IittIe more air.

810
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,417
汤姆、狄克和哈利，更正
. . .Tom , Dick, and Harry. No. Correction .

811
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:51,046
该是汤姆、狄克和席德。哈利是他的朋友
Every Tom , Dick and Sid , Harry was his friend .

812
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:56,426
汤姆、狄克和席德糟透了，他们以为带女孩去吃饭…
Anyway, every Tom , Dick and Sid thinks that if he takes a girI to dinner,

813
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:01,097
她就会像小猫般依偎着他们
she'II just curI up Iike a kitten in a IittIe furry baII at his feet, right?

814
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,142
我曾跟他们吃饭
I have by actuaI count been taken to dinner

815
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:07,354
两个月来跟二十六个不同的鼠辈一起
by 26 different rats in the Iast two months.

816
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,482
若包括超级鼠辈班尼谢克立…
Twenty-seven , if you count Benny ShackIett,

817
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,734
就是二十七人
who is in many ways a super-rat.

818
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:16,363
-我忘了带钥匙
-没问题，我刚按铃了
-I think I forgot my key. -Never mind . I just buzzed Yunioshi .

819
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,616
你想知道有趣的事吗？
Do you wanna know something funny?

820
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,911
大部分的鼠辈都会…
In spite of the fact that most of these rats fork up

821
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,831
给我五十元作为去女厕的费用
$50 for the powder room Iike IittIe doIIs,

822
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:31,044
我的银行户口较半年前…
I find I have again by actuaI count $9 Iess in the oId bank account

823
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,879
少了九元
than I had six months ago.

824
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,633
佛烈
So, my darIing Fred ,

825
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,719
今天我作了重大决定
I have tonight made a very serious decision .

826
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,555
什么决定？
And what is that?

827
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,433
我不再干这事了
No Ionger wiII I pIay the fieId .

828
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,061
-恭喜你
-这一行…
-CongratuIations. -The fieId stinks,

829
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,564
糟透了
both economicaIIy and sociaIIy.

830
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,191
我要放弃
And I'm giving it up.

831
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,654
戈莱利小姐，这次我不只通知警察…
Miss GoIightIy, this time I'm not onIy caIIing the poIice,

832
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,949
更通知消防局、纽约州房屋局
but the fire department and the New York State Housing Commission ,

833
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,451
有需要的话会找卫生局
and , if necessary, the Board of HeaIth !

834
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,371
静下来，你想吵醒所有人吗？
Quiet up there. You want to wake the whoIe house?

835
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:12,294
戈莱利小姐被无礼打扰前想说…
As Miss GoIightIy was saying before she was so rudeIy interrupted ,

836
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:16,590
戈莱利小姐作出宣布
Miss GoIightIy further announces her intention

837
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,843
她会全力以赴

838
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:23,221
务求可以尽快嫁给…
to the immediate capture, for the purpose of matrimony

839
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,433
拉瑟福德先生
of Mr Rutherford .

840
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:31,521
朋友称呼他拉斯蒂，我肯定他有很多朋友
Rusty to his friends, of whom I'm sure he has many.

841
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,482
-特拉勒
-谁？
-TrawIer. -Who?

842
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:39,654
拉斯蒂特拉勒，数周前你曾在派对见过他
Rusty TrawIer. You met him at my party a coupIe of weeks ago.

843
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,865
和梅格怀尔伍德一起来
He came with Mag WiIdwood .

844
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,659
不是英俊的拉丁人
Not the beautifuI Latin type.

845
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,287
另一人，外表像猪的那一位
The other one, the one that Iooks Iike a pig .

846
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,831
记得吗？
Remember?

847
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,668
不到五十岁的美国第九富商？
The ninth-richest man in America under 50?

848
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,134
你像是看不起我
Do I detect a Iook of disapprovaI in your eye?

849
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,640
要嫁给他是困难的
Tough beans, buddy, 'cause that's the way it's gonna be.

850
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,350
你好，猫咪
H i , cat.

851
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,560
荷莉，你醉了
HoIIy, you're drunk.

852
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,104
对
True.

853
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,651
-非常对，但没所谓
-你在干什么？
-AbsoIuteIy true. True, but irreIevant. -What are you doing?

854
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,238
你该和…
So I think we shouId have a drink

855
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,115
新任拉斯蒂太太喝酒
to the new Mrs Rusty TrawIer.

856
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,660
-就是我
-慢慢来
-Me. -Hey, take it easy.

857
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,622
怎么了？你认为我办不到吗？
What's the matter, don't you think I can do it?

858
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:34,793
我是认真想知道，你真的认为我不行吗？
TeII me. SeriousIy, I'm interested . Don't you think I can?

859
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,336
你也听到医生的话
You heard the Doc.

860
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,546
弟弟服完兵役后…
My brother gets out of the army in February

861
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,800
医生不愿收留他，一切全依赖我
and the Doc won't take him back. So it's aII up to me.

862
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,719
你为何不明白
I don't know why you don't understand .

863
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:49,307
我需要钱，我会用尽方法赚钱
I need money, and I'II do whatever I have to do to get it.

864
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,810
所以…
So,

865
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:56,147
下个月我就是拉斯蒂太太
this time next month , I'II be the new Mrs Rusty TrawIer.

866
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,111
我们应该为此而喝酒
And I think we shouId have a IittIe drink to that.

867
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,447
没有酒了，真扫兴
It's aII gone. Isn't that too bad?

868
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,119
楼上有威士忌吗？
Got any whisky upstairs?

869
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,999
-你喝够了
-去拿威士忌吧
-But you've had enough . -Go ahead . Get the whisky.

870
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,668
我愿意付款
I'II pay you for it.

871
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,841
-荷莉，求求你
-你看不起我
-HoIIy, pIease. -No, no, you disapprove of me

872
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,845
我不用看不起我的人请我喝酒
and I do not accept drinks from gentIemen who disapprove of me.

873
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,849
别忘了，我可付钱去买
I'II pay for my own whisky and don't you forget it.

874
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:31,933
荷莉
HoIIy.

875
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,228
看不起我的人不用请我喝酒
I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentIemen .

876
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,816
尤其是他是由女人所供养
EspeciaIIy not disapproving gentIemen who are kept by other Iadies.

877
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,193
拿去吧
So take it.

878
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,197
你应惯于使用女人所赚的钱
You shouId be used to taking money from Iadies by now.

879
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,040
我是你，就会小心金钱
If I were you , I'd be more carefuI with my money.

880
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,251
从拉斯蒂身上赚钱不容易
Rusty TrawIer is too hard a way of earning it.

881
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:06,217
你从这儿走出门口不用四秒
It shouId take you exactIy four seconds to cross from here to that door.

882
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,970
我给你两秒
I'II give you two.

883
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:55,475
城市信托银行-保罗华杰      五十元整

884
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,498
拉斯蒂特拉勒结婚

885
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,583
花花公子女继承人说： “够了”

886
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,506
你好
H i .

887
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,716
我来是想谈谈那夜的事
I've come up to taIk to you about the other night,

888
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,718
我看了报纸…
then I saw the paper, and . . .

889
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,181
我感到有点尴尬
WeII , actuaIIy, I'm kind of embarrassed about it,

890
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,727
既然这事与你有关，我想亲自跟你谈
but since it concerns you , I thought I ought to taIk to you about it in person .

891
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,479
什么？
What?

892
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,189
什么？

893
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,568
耳塞
The earpIugs.

894
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,154
我不能再经历一次
I can't go through the whoIe thing again .

895
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,823
我是来修好的
It's sufficient to say, I've come to make up.

896
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,868
我还会带来各种消息
And as an added inducement, I have aII kinds of news.

897
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,828
可以进来吗？
Can I come in?

898
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,291
可以，等等，我有穿睡衣吗？
I guess so. Just a minute. Do I have a nightgown on?

899
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,836
没有，你可否转身？
No, I don't. WouId you mind turning around for a second?

900
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,422
算了吧，这句话太过时
Oh , never mind . It's such a corny Iine anyway.

901
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,424
我自己转身好了

01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,050
进来
Come in .

01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,470
你看过报纸吗？
Have you seen the paper?

904
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,725
你是指拉斯蒂一事？
Rusty, you mean?

905
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,518
我已知道了
Yes. I know aII about it.

906
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,980
我看错了他，对吗？
CertainIy had him pegged wrong , didn't I?

907
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:29,027
我以为他是鼠辈，其实他是超级鼠辈
I thought he was just a rat, but he was a super-rat aII aIong .

908
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,155
穿着老鼠衣服的超级鼠辈
A super-rat in rat's cIothing .

909
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,699
你还没知道最精彩部分
You don't even know the best part.

910
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,660
他不只是鼠辈或超级鼠辈
Not onIy was he a rat, or a super-rat, rather,

911
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,662
他已经破产了
he was aIso broke.

912
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,249
破产，但不是一毛钱也没有
Broke. I mean , but not a farthing .

913
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,337
他的家人有钱，但他本人已破产
H is famiIy has money, of course, but he personaIIy is broke.

914
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:50,757
他欠债七十万元
It turns out he owes $700, 000.

915
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,511
试想想一人欠债七十万元
Can you imagine anyone owing $700, 000?

916
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,388
四十三元，对
$43, yes.

917
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:01,893
无论如何，他因此娶那丑女皇
Anyway, that's why he decided to marry the queen of the pig peopIe.

918
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,772
佛烈，我告诉你一件事
I'II teII you one thing , Fred , darIing ,

919
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,566
为了钱，我会立刻跟你结婚
I'd marry you for your money in a minute.

920
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,778
-你会为钱跟我结婚吗？
-马上会
-WouId you marry me for my money? -In a minute.

921
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,366
幸好我们均不是有钱人
So I guess it's pretty Iucky neither of us is rich , huh?

922
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,117
是
Yeah .

923
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,080
佛烈，很高兴见到你
Fred , darIing , I'm so gIad to see you .

924
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,170
你近来怎样？
What have you been doing?

925
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,548
主要在写作
Writing , mostIy.

926
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,178
我卖出一个故事，今早刚获悉
SoId a story. Just got word this morning .

927
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,932
真美妙
Oh , that's marveIIous. It reaIIy is.

928
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,518
但…
But. . .

929
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,687
你的设计师有何看法？
OnIy how does your decorator friend feeI about it?

930
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,982
你不是要自救吗？
I thought you were supposed to be saving yourseIf and aII of that?

931
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,358
你可知道？
You know something?

932
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,278
我还没告诉她
I haven't got around to teIIing her about it yet.

933
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,655
我们何不出外…
Look, why don't we go out and have a drink

934
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,574
庆祝一番？
or take a waIk or something to ceIebrate?

935
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:58,741
好的
AII right.

936
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,868
冰箱子里好像有香槟
I think there's some champagne in the icebox.

937
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,704
我换裙子时你替我开了它
Why don't you open it whiIe I get dressed?

938
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,289
好
Okay.

939
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,334
以往我不曾在吃早餐前喝香槟
I don't think I've ever drunk champagne before breakfast before.

940
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,713
曾数度吃早餐时喝香槟
With breakfast on severaI occasions.

941
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,631
但不曾在早餐前喝
But never before, before.

942
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,883
我有一个好点子
Now I've got a wonderfuI idea.

943
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,428
我们可做一些以往不曾做的事
We can spend a whoIe day doing things we've never done before.

944
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,973
首先由你开始，接着是我
We'II take turns. First something you've never done, then me.

945
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:25,810
当然，很难想到有什么是我没做过的
Of course, I can't reaIIy think of anything I've never done.

946
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,579
我不曾在早上散步
I've never been for a waIk in the morning before.

947
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,748
来了纽约后不曾试过
At Ieast not since I've been in New York.

948
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,333
六时我曾在第五大街散步
I've waIked up Fifth Avenue at 6: 00,

949
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,251
但那是晚上
but as far as I'm concerned , that's stiII night.

950
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,671
-那算是吗？
-当然，现在我们平手了
-Do you think it counts? -Sure it counts. Now we're even .

951
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,896
-你不喜欢吗？
-喜欢什么？
-Don't you just Iove it? -Love what?

952
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,856
蒂芙尼
Tiffany's.

953
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,826
不是很美妙吗？
Isn't it wonderfuI?

954
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,120
这儿不会有坏事…
You see what I mean how nothing bad couId ever happen to you

955
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,330
发生
in a pIace Iike this?

956
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:31,209
我不是蔑视珠宝，钻石除外
It isn't that I give a hoot about jeweIIery, except diamonds, of course.

957
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,836
很特别
Like that.

958
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:42,136
你认为怎样？
What do you think?

959
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,888
我…
WeII . . .

960
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,852
我认为四十岁前戴钻石很俗气
Of course, personaIIy, I think it wouId be tacky to wear diamonds before I'm 40.

961
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,314
说得对，但目前你该戴些珠宝
WeII , you're right. But in the meantime, you shouId have something .

962
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,816
我会等候
I'II wait.

963
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,110
不，我会买一份礼物给你
No. I'm gonna buy you a present.

964
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,071
你的打字带为我带来好运
You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon , and it brought me Iuck.

965
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,240
但蒂芙尼的东西很贵
AII right, but Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.

966
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,826
我有支票跟十元
I've got my cheque and $ 1 0.

967
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,245
我不会让你花掉支票
Oh , I wouIdn't Iet you cash your cheque.

968
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,748
但我愿意接受低于十元的礼物
But a present for $ 1 0 or under, that I'II accept.

969
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,753
不知蒂芙尼内有什么只值十元
Of course, I don't exactIy know what we're going to find at Tiffany's for $ 1 0.

970
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,806
我可以帮忙吗？
May I heIp you?

971
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,809
或许，我想送这女士一份礼物
Perhaps. ActuaIIy, we were Iooking for a present for the Iady.

972
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,018
好的
CertainIy, sir.

973
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,604
你想送什么类型的礼物？
Is there something speciaI you had in mind?

974
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,524
我们曾考虑钻石
WeII , we had considered diamonds.

975
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,484
我不想冒犯你
Now, I don't want to offend you ,

976
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,404
但这女士认为钻石太低俗
but the Iady feeIs that diamonds are tacky for her.

977
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,408
钻石适合较老的女人
Oh , I think they're divine on oIder women ,

978
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,910
不太适合我
but I don't think they'd be right for me. You do understand?

979
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,036
好
CertainIy.

980
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,583
实不相瞒，还有另一个问题
In aII fairness, I think I ought to expIain . There's aIso a secondary probIem .

981
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,709
经济的问题
One of finance.

982
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,171
我们有消费限额
We can onIy afford to spend a Iimited amount.

983
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,549
-那数目是多少？
-十元
-May I ask how Iimited? -$ 1 0.

984
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,802
十元？
$ 1 0?

985
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,096
这是我们的限额
That was the outside figure, yes.

986
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,931
我明白了
I see.

987
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,808
你们有价值十元的货品吗？
Do you have anything for $ 1 0?

988
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,935
这价钱的货…
WeII , frankIy, madam , within that price range,

989
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,855
种类有限
the variety of merchandise is rather Iimited .

990
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,858
但确有这类货物，让我想想…
However, I do think we might have, Iet me see. . .

991
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,652
这东西新颍小巧
StrictIy as a noveIty, you understand .

992
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,530
这是有钱人士认为珍贵文物
For the Iady and gentIeman who has everything ,

993
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,492
纯银电话自动拨号器
a sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIer

994
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,661
连税价值6.75元
at $6.75, incIuding tax.

995
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,247
纯银电话自动拨号器
A sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIer.

996
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,376
对，连税价值6.75元
Yes, sir. At $6.75, incIuding federaI tax.

997
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,588
价钱合理，但…
WeII , the price is right, but I must say,

998
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:44,467
我想要一些更…
该怎么说…
I'd rather hoped for something sIightIy more, how shaII I say it,

999
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,552
浪漫的东西
romantic in feeIing .

1000
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,929
你认为怎样？
What do you think?

1001
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,181
纯银电话自动拨号器不错
As sterIing siIver teIephone diaIIers go,

1002
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,684
但你明白我的意思吗？
I certainIy think it's handsome, but, weII , you do understand?

1003
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,771
我们已尽力，但…
WeII , we tried , but I guess. . .

1004
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,690
你们可有提供刻字服务？
We couId have something engraved , couIdn't we?

1005
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,275
有
Yes, I suppose so.

1006
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,110
有，确实有
Yes, indeed .

1007
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,447
唯一的难题是，你要先在这儿购物
The onIy probIem is, you wouId more or Iess have to buy something first

1008
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,493
我们才可替你在物件上刻字
if onIy in order to have some object upon which to pIace the engraving .

1009
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,204
难就难在这里
You see the difficuIty.

1010
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,039
嗯
WeII . . .

1011
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,083
你可在它上面刻字
We couId have this engraved , couIdn't we?

1012
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,168
将会很好看的
I think it wouId be very smart.

1013
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,923
这该不是蒂芙尼的货物吧？
This, I take it, was not purchased at Tiffany's?

1014
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:24,966
不
No.

1015
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,802
它是和…
ActuaIIy, it was purchased concurrent with . . .

1016
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,388
事实上…
WeII , actuaIIy, it came inside of. . .

1017
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,766
它是吃爆米花的赠品
weII , a box of Cracker Jack.

1018
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,560
我明白了
I see.

1019
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,981
爆米花内仍有礼物吗？
Do they stiII reaIIy have prizes in Cracker Jack boxes?

1020
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,316
-是
-很高兴知道这事
-Oh , yes. -That's nice to know.

1021
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,529
给人实在…
It gives one a feeIing of soIidarity,

1022
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,408
延续传统的感觉
aImost of continuity with the past, that sort of thing .

1023
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,827
蒂芙尼愿意为我们刻字吗？
Do you think Tiffany's wouId reaIIy engrave it for us?

1024
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,829
这不会贬低店子的…
I mean , you don't think they wouId feeI it was beneath them

1025
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,080
声誉吗？
or anything Iike that?

1026
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,291
小姐，这样会打破常规
WeII , it is rather unusuaI , madam .

1027
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,336
但本公司非常谅解你们的处境
But I think you'II find that Tiffany's is very understanding .

1028
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,463
你说出名字缩写…
If you wouId teII me what initiaIs you wouId Iike,

1029
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:07,925
我们可在明早交货
I think we couId have something ready for you in the morning .

1030
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,555
我不是说过这儿好极吗？
Didn't I teII you this was a IoveIy pIace?

1031
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,162
这儿是什么地方？
What is this pIace, anyway?

1032
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,040
你想坐下，这儿是公共图书馆
You said you wanted to sit down . It's the pubIic Iibrary.

1033
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,418
-你不曾来过这儿？
-不，我的第二个新尝试
-You've never been here? -No. That makes two for me.

1034
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,421
-我看不见书
-在那儿
-I don't see any books. -They're in there.

1035
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,094
看见了吗？
See?

1036
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,560
每个抽屉也放满小卡片
Each one of these IittIe drawers is stuffed with IittIe cards.

1037
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,855
每张卡写上书名或作者名字
And each IittIe card is a book or an author.

1038
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,732
真神奇
I think that's fascinating .

1039
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,401
华杰
V-A-R-J-A-K.

1040
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,445
真的吗？
ReaIIy?

1041
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:14,283
看，真厉害
Look. Isn't it marveIIous?

1042
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:17,244
找到你了，在公共图书馆里
There you are, right in the pubIic Iibrary.

1043
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,206

"Varjak, PauI . Nine Lives. "

1044
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,291
还有很多数字
And then a Iot of numbers.

1045
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,961
这儿真的有那本书吗？
Do you think they reaIIy have the book itseIf, Iive?

1046
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,171
当然，跟我来
Sure. FoIIow me.

1047
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,016
57号，是我们
N umber 57. That's us.

1048
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,187
57号，保罗华杰的《九条生命》
Fifty-seven , pIease. Nine Lives by Varjak, PauI .

Did you ever read it? It's absoIuteIy marveIIous.

1050
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,610
-我不曾看过
-你该看看，是他写的
-No, I'm afraid I haven't. -WeII , you shouId . He wrote it.

1051
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,029
他就是保罗华杰
He's Varjak, PauI , in person .

1052
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,532
她不相信我
She doesn't beIieve me.

1053
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:58,411
向她展示驾驶执照或信用卡等
Show her your driver's Iicence or Diner's CIub card or something .

1054
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,956
他是作者，我向天发誓
Honest, he reaIIy is the author. Cross my heart and kiss my eIbow.

1055
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,125
你可以小声一点吗？
WouId you kindIy Iower your voice, miss?

1056
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,918
你何不签名留念？
Why don't you autograph it to them?

1057
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,421
这不是很好吗？更加有意思
Don't you think it'd be nice? Sort of make it more personaI?

1058
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,131
小姐…
ReaIIy, miss. . .

1059
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,175
签名吧，别这么自大
Go ahead . Don't be so stuck up, autograph it to them .

1060
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,428
好的，我该写上什么？
AII right, what shaII I say?

1061
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,722
感性的字句
Something sentimentaI , I think.

1062
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,391
你在干什么？
What are you doing? Stop that!

1063
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:24,520
-你在破坏公物
-好的，若你这么认为
-You're defacing pubIic property. -WeII , aII right, if that's the way you feeI .

1064
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,814
佛烈，我们走吧
Come on , Fred , darIing . Let's get out of here.

1065
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,942
这儿的人不及蒂芙尼的人一半友善
I don't think this pIace is haIf as nice as Tiffany's.

1066
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,375
小时候你曾在店里…
Hey, did you ever steaI anything from a five-and-ten

1067
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,835
偷东西吗？
when you were a kid , I mean?

1068
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,589
不，我是书虫，你呢？
No. I'm the sensitive, bookish type. Did you?

1069
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:55,551
我曾试过，现在偶尔还有偷东西
I used to. I stiII do every now and then , sort of to keep my hand in .

1070
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,428
来吧，别畏首畏尾
Come on . Don't be chicken .

1071
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,306
现在该由你试试
Anyway, you've never done it, and it's your turn .

1072
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,352
我看不见东西
I can't see.

1073
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,988
猫咪，你好
H i , cat.

1074
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,990
女主人在吗？
Lady of the house at home?

1075
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,285
荷莉？
HoIIy?

1076
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,746
荷莉？

1077
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,982
不请吃就捣蛋
Trick or treat.

1078
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:06,737
你疯了？你知道的，但我也爱你
You're crazy. You know that, don't you? But I Iove you anyway.

1079
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,198
-我…
-怎么了？
-2-E. -Yeah?

1080
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,743
我要跟你谈谈
I've got to taIk to you .

1081
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,371
好的
AII right.

1082
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,919
你想喝酒吗？
You want a drink?

1083
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,885
我突然觉得…
If this is going to be a serious discussion

1084
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,429
若有重要事要谈…
and suddenIy I'm terribIy afraid it is,

1085
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:35,682
你要脱去那滑稽的面具
you're going to have to take off that ridicuIous mask

1086
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,268
否则我也戴上面具
or eIse I'm going to have to wear one, too.

1087
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,979
求求你
2-E, Iook, pIease.

1088
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,571
怎么了？为女孩而烦恼？
What's the matter? GirI troubIe?

1089
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,908
是这事吗？
Is that it, darIing?

1090
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,286
我明白了
Oh , I see.

1091
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,874
不是严重的事
WeII , that's not so serious.

1092
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,044
事实上，我也有预感
As a matter of fact, I've been expecting it.

1093
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,964
我不能说喜欢发生这事，但我已有心理准备
I can't say I Iike it, but I've been expecting it.

1094
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,385
-她是谁？
-此事跟她无关
-Who is she? -Hasn't got anything to do with her.

1095
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,390
这是我和你之间的事
This is between you and me.

1096
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,642
该是严重的事
Then it is serious.

1097
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:20,894
现在…
WeII , now.

1098
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,980
你是很时髦的女孩
2-E, you're a very styIish girI .

1099
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,692
我们可否好好了结这事？
Can't we end this styIishIy?

1100
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,320
-了结？
-是
-End it? -Yes.

1101
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,241
噢
WeII . . .

1102
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,914
安迪哈迪找到了爱
I do beIieve Iove has found Andy Hardy.

1103
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:43,584
让我猜猜
Let's see,

1104
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,377
女侍应？
a waitress?

1105
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,129
售货员？
A saIesgirI?

1106
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,340
不，她该是富家女，对吗？
No. She'd have to be someone rich , wouIdn't she, PauI?

1107
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,927
一个能帮助你的人
Someone who couId heIp you .

1108
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,096
奇怪地…
CuriousIy enough ,

1109
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,186
她不能帮助我，更帮不了自己
she's a girI who can't heIp anyone, not even herseIf.

1110
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:07,357
我可以帮助她，这感觉很不错
Thing is, I can heIp her, and it's a nice feeIing for a change.

1111
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,778
好的
AII right.

1112
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,323
我明白了
I understand .

1113
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,369
保罗
I'II teII you what, PauI .

1114
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,247
我是一个时髦的女孩
I am a very styIish girI .

1115
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,917
-你在干什么？
-写支票
-What are you doing? -Writing a cheque.

1116
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,630
别装作惊奇
Don't Iook so bewiIdered .

1117
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,424
以往你也见过我写支票
SureIy you've noticed me writing cheques before.

1118
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,094
“给保罗华杰一千元”
"Pay to the order of PauI Varjak, $ 1 , 000."

1119
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,431
带她出外度假一周
Take her away somewhere for a week.

1120
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,685
根据劳工法例
You're entitIed to a vacation with pay.

1121
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,730
你可享有有薪假期
SimpIy a matter of fair Iabour practise, darIing .

1122
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,148
当然，如果你够聪明…
Of course, if you were reaIIy smart,

1123
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:51,109
你可以集结其男生成立工会
you'd get some of the other boys together and organise a union .

1124
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,820
这样你就可得到一切福利
That way you'd get aII the fringe benefits,

1125
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,323
例如医疗福利、退休计划…

1126
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,201
失业保险
and unempIoyment insurance when you're,

1127
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,205
该怎么说？找不到新对象时
how shaII I put it, between engagements?

1128
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,795
谢谢你使我不用那么内疚
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1129
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,881
别傻了
Don't be ridicuIous, darIing .

1130
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,342
拿支票后…
Take the cheque.

1131
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,010
找那女孩
And caII your girI .

1132
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,804
不，谢谢
No, thanks.

1133
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,265
我有自己的支票
I've got a cheque of my own .

1134
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,936
找新作家帮忙时…
When you get yourseIf a new writer to heIp,

1135
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,855
你该找一个跟我同样高大的人
try and find one my size.

1136
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,067
那么你不用修改衣服长短
That way you won't have to even shorten the sIeeves.

1137
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:25,912
荷莉

1138
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,206

真有趣
It's very interesting .

1154
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,412
离开这儿吧
Let's get out of here.

1155
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,083
我说离开这儿，我有话跟你说

1156
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:59,172

What's the matter with you , anyway? What's happened?

1157
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:03,260
佛烈，求你别烦着我
Fred , wiII you pIease just Ieave me aIone?

1158
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,762

先弄清楚一件事
Let's get something straight.

1164
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,034
我从来不是佛烈

-Let me go. -Not tiII we get this settIed .

1168
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,544
南美洲有何特别？
Now what's aII this jazz about South America?

1169
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,380
若我嫁给南美人…

1170
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:42,883
就要熟悉那儿

-Who the heII is Jos茅? -Jos茅 da SiIva Pereira.

1173
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,307
他是谁？
Who the heII's Jos茅 da SiIva Pereira?

1174
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,393
你曾见过他，梅格的朋友
DarIing , you met him . I know you did . Mag WiIdwood's friend .

1175
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,396
跟拉斯蒂同来的高大英俊男士
The taII , good-Iooking one who came to the party with Rusty?

1176
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,231
你不会相信
WeII , my dear, you won't beIieve this,

1177
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:01,651
他不但英俊，而且很富有
but it turns out not onIy is he handsome and wiIdIy rich ,

1178
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,695
他绝对是适合人选
he's absoIuteIy cuckoo for me.

1179
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:06,907
-你疯了
-你以为我属于你的？
-You're crazy. -What? Do you think you own me?

1180
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,408
我正是这么想
That's exactIy what I think.

1181
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:10,202
其他人都这么想
I know, I know. That's what everybody aIways thinks,

1182
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,745
但他们错了
but everybody happens to be wrong .

1183
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,830
看，我不是其他人
Look, I am not everybody.

1184
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,709
我是吗？
Or am I?

1185
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,254
你真的这么想吗？
Is that what you reaIIy think?

1186
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:25,967
我跟鼠辈、超级鼠辈无分别？
That I'm no different from aII your other rats and super-rats?

1187
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,512
等等
Wait a minute.

1188
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,806
若是这样…
If that's it,

1189
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,351
若你有这种想法
if that's what you reaIIy think,

1190
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:37,812
我有些东西想给你
there's something I want to give you .

1191
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,026
是什么？
What's that?

1192
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,362
五十元去女厕的费用
$50 for the powder room .

1193
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,480
我不想叫你进来，但我不能独自…
I wouIdn't ask you in , except the pIace is in such a mess

1194
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:23,191
-面对乱局
-你有口讯
-I couIdn't bear to face it aIone. -You have a message.

1195
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,776
不
No.

1196
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:29,739
行了
Ol茅.

1197
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,425
晚安，雄志
Good evening , Mr Yunioshi .

1201
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:15,535
你定要帮助我
PIease, you must heIp me.

1202
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,210
荷莉
HoIIy.

1203
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:26,588
荷莉
HoIIy. HoIIy.

1204
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,219
荷莉
HoIIy.

1205
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,180
-荷莉
-放开我，不！
-HoIIy. HoIIy. -Let me go. No !

1206
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,806
荷莉
HoIIy.

1207
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,850
-荷莉
-佛烈
-HoIIy. -Fred . Fred .

1208
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,853
荷莉

1209
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,041
不
No, no.

1210
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,175
佛烈
Fred .

1211
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,388
佛烈

1212
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,731
-你对她干了什么？
-没什么
-What did you do to her? -Nothing .

1213
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:28,733
看了电报后她就这样
There was a teIegram , and then this.

1214
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:32,112
捣乱一切，像是疯了似的
Crashing everything , conducting Iike a crazy. It's appaIIing .

1215
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,240
我不可闹出丑闻
I can't have a pubIic scandaI . It's too deIicate.

1216
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,617
我要顾及自己和家人的声誉
My name, my position , my famiIy.

1217
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,619
警察会到来吗？
WiII there be the poIice again , do you think?

1218
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:42,998
不会，没有法例禁止人们在家中发脾气。
I don't see why. There's no Iaw against busting up your own apartment.

1219
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,291
-电报在哪儿？
-在那儿
-Where is the teIegram? -There it is.

1220
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,552
“获悉佛烈在堪萨斯州莱利堡
"Received notice. Young Fred kiIIed

1221
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,641
“交通意外中身亡
"in jeep accident, Fort RiIey, Kansas.

1222
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:06,604
“丈夫和子女均深感遗憾
"Your husband and chiIdren join in the sorrow of our mutuaI Ioss.

1223
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,734
“爱你的医生”
"Letter foIIowing . Love, Doc."

1224
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,779
她的弟弟佛烈
Her brother Fred .

1225
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:18,992
她和弟弟很亲密吗？
This brother, was she very cIose to him?

1226
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,577
是
Yeah .

1227
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,623
我该怎办？
What can one do?

1228
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,876
帮助她
Try to heIp her.

1229
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,211
我曾尝试，但帮助不大
I tried . It didn't do much good .

1230
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,466
你在巴西有牧场？
You got a ranch or something down in BraziI , don't you?

1231
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,051
是
Yes.

1232
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,803
很好，她喜欢牧场
That's good . She'II Iike that.

1233
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,808
你最好进去
WeII , you better get in there.

1234
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:44,494
巴西旅游

1235
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,440
-你好
-你好
-H i . -HeIIo.

1236
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,402
收到你的电报，怎找到我？
Got your wire. How did you know where to reach me?

1237
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,696
我用尽各种办法，四处打听
Oh , I tried everything . CaIIed peopIe, asked around

1238
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,573
突然想起查电话簿
and suddenIy thought of Iooking in the phone book.

1239
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,867
无论如何，很高兴你来了
Anyway, I'm gIad you couId come.

1240
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,204
-你看来不错
-是吗？
-You Iook fine. -You think so?

1241
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:30,623
我很胖，很久没整理发型
I'm fat as a pig , and I haven't had my hair done in months.

1242
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,585
但我很快乐
But I'm happy, reaIIy happy. It probabIy shows.

1243
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,337
看得出来，你容光焕发
You Iook tr猫s distingu茅 yourseIf.

1244
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,214
近日我在写作
I got a job. I've been writing a IittIe.

1245
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:40,049
我看了你三篇文章
I know. I've read three of your stories.

1246
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:43,428
两篇刊在《纽约人》，一篇在杂志内
Two in The New Yorker and one in that funny IittIe magazine.

1247
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,807
坐下来好吗？
Won't you sit down?

1248
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,475
谢谢
Thank you .

1249
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:51,769
-我在学编织
-我看到了
-I've taken up knitting . -So I see.

1250
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:57,150
完成后相信会很好看
It'II probabIy Iook very nice once it's finished .

1251
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,985
实际上我有点紧张
ActuaIIy, I'm a IittIe nervous about it.

1252
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,863
荷西带来新牧场的蓝图
Jos茅 brought up the bIueprints for a new ranch house he's buiIding

1253
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:02,989
但我觉得…
and I have this strange feeIing

1254
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:05,783
我将蓝图和编织指示图混淆了
that maybe the bIueprints and my knitting instructions got switched .

1255
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,162
我可能编织出一个牧场
I mean , it isn't impossibIe that I'm knitting a ranch house.

1256
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:21,549
我不知怎告诉你我有多快乐
ReaIIy, darIing , I can't teII you how divineIy happy I am .

1257
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:24,761
那是什么？
What is that, anyhow?

1258
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,513
葡萄牙语，复杂的语言
Portuguese. A very compIicated Ianguage.

1259
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:29,724
四千个不规则动词
Four thousand irreguIar verbs.

1260
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,358
很厉害，是什么意思？
Very impressive. What's it mean?

1261
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:41,152
“我相信你跟屠夫在一起”
"I beIieve you are in Ieague with the butcher."

1262
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,033
荷莉，怎么了？
HoIIy, what's this about?

1263
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,495
你为何想见我？
Why did you want to see me?

1264
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:52,830
荷西在华盛顿
Jos茅's in Washington for the night

1265
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,583
我想，如果我问你，你或许愿意来
so I thought if I asked you over, you might come.

1266
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,045
我已和其他关心我的人道别
And , weII , I've said goodbye to everyone eIse I care about.

1267
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:00,546
你要去别处？
You're going somewhere?

1268
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,965
明天我要去里奥
I'm going to Rio tomorrow.

1269
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,842
我有机票，我已跟沙里告别
I've got the pIane ticket, and I've even said goodbye to oId SaIIy.

1270
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,177
荷西跟你一起去？
Jos茅 is fIying down with you?

1271
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,054
我们乘坐不同班机
We're going on separate pIanes, of course.

1272
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,848
一起前去不太好
He doesn't think it wouId Iook right for us to be traveIIing together.

1273
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,433
他的家族很保守
H is famiIy's very important down there,

1274
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,519
所以他介怀
so he has to worry about things Iike that.

1275
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,230
我想由我来下厨…
Anyway, I thought I'd show off and cook dinner for us.

1276
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:18,982
会很有趣
It'II be fun eating in .

1277
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,235
我有告诉你我很快乐吗？
Did I teII you how divineIy and utterIy happy I am?

1278
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:23,820
有
Yes.

1279
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,989
接着你们会结婚？
You are getting married , then?

1280
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:29,701
他还没向我求婚，不曾说那几个字
WeII , he hasn't reaIIy asked me, not in so many words.

1281
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:31,828
你是指那四个字吗？
Four, you mean?

1282
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:35,290
这有多难启齿
WeII , that's how many words it takes.

1283
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,583
“请嫁给我”
"WiII you marry me?"

1284
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,753
我知道我们会结婚
Oh , we'II get married , aII right. I know we wiII .

1285
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:43,798
有他的家人在旁，在教堂举行
And in church and with his famiIy there and everything .

1286
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,051
所以他等候至我们到里奥才说
And that's why he's waiting tiII we get to Rio, probabIy.

1287
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:52,598
它像是想告诉我们一些东西
Do you think it's trying to teII us something?

1288
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:56,602
希望你喜欢巧克力汁鸡饭
I hope you Iike chicken and saffron rice served with chocoIate sauce.

1289
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:58,479
这是东印度传统
It's an East Indian cIassic, my dear.

1290
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:01,065
三个月前我不懂打蛋
Three months ago, I couIdn't scrambIe eggs.

1291
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:06,529
你没事吧？
Are you aII right?

1292
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:10,450
我想你对我另眼相看
GoIIy, darIing . I did so want to impress you .

1293
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,826
反正…
Look,

1294
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:14,829
我不太喜欢有汁的鸡
I'm not much for chicken with sauce, anyway.

1295
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,458
何不外出？我请你吃饭饯行
Why don't we go out somewhere? Let me buy you a fareweII dinner.

1296
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:22,211
这会很有趣，只要那地方符合我这样的装扮。
That wouId be fun , as Iong as it's somepIace I can go Iike this.

1297
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:31,804
数年后…
Years from now,

1298
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:34,474
过了数年后我会回来
years and years, I'II be back.

1299
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,518
我带着九个巴西小子
Me and my nine BraziIian brats.

1300
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,397
他们会如荷西般黝黑
They'II be dark Iike Jos茅, of course,

1301
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:44,275
但他们会有漂亮的碧眼
but they'II have bright, green , beautifuI eyes.

1302
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,406
我会带他们回来
因为他们定要看看这儿
I'II bring them back, aII right, 'cause they must see this.

1303
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,284
我爱纽约
Oh , I Iove New York.

1304
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:56,579
那么你为何离开？你怎么想的？
Then why are you Ieaving? What's in it for you , anyway?

1305
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:01,000
我知道你在想什么，我不怪你
Look, I know what you're thinking , and I don't bIame you .

1306
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,795
我说话一向华而不实
I've aIways thrown out such a jazzy Iine.

1307
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:08,758
除了医生和你，荷西是我首次真正的恋爱
ReaIIy, except for Doc and yourseIf, Jos茅's my first non-rat romance.

1308
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,553
他不可算是我完美的如意郎君
Not that he's my idea of the absoIute finito.

1309
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:16,015
他太一本正经和谨慎了
He's too prim and cautious to be my absoIute ideaI .

1310
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,686
若我可选择任何人，我不会选荷西
Now if I couId choose from anybody aIive, I wouIdn't pick Jos茅.

1311
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,939
尼赫鲁，或许史怀哲
Nehru , maybe, or AIbert Schweitzer.

1312
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:25,775
或许伯恩斯坦
Or Leonard Bernstein .

1313
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,403
但我为荷西疯狂
But I am mad about Jos茅.

1314
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,407
若他提出，我愿为他戒烟
I honestIy think I'd give up smoking if he asked me.

1315
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:38,162
时候不早了，我们去吃东西吧
Come on , darIing , Iet's eat. It's getting Iate.

1316
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:43,084
明天就要离开，我甚至没执拾行装
I'm Ieaving tomorrow, and I haven't even begun to pack.

1317
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:07,483
我不想荷西认为我是丢失钥匙的女孩
Didn't want Jos茅 to think I was the kind of girI who Ioses her key,

1318
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,819
所以我配备二十六条钥匙
so I had 26 of them made.

1319
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,029
等等，我有更好的提议
No, wait. I got a better idea.

1320
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:13,990
作为道别仪式
Kind of a fareweII gesture.

1321
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:17,410
一定是有人弄坏了门锁
Somebody must have tripped the Iock.

醒来，英国人来了

1324
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,834
-或许是巴西人
-没错
-Or, in this case, the BraziIians. -ExactIy.

-ExactIy. -I've stiII got to cIean up aII that rice.

1326
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:30,756

Hey, you know. . .

1327
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,341
嘿
Hey!

她在那儿，那女子
There she are who did it! The wanted woman ! There !

1329
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:40,850
扫毒组的克朗柏格

1330
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:43,644

-What do you mean? -What's going on?

1331
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,521
-何不去问你的老板？
-什么老板？
-Why don't you ask your boss? -What boss?

1332
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:48,149
沙里托马图，你何不问他？走吧
SaIIy Tomato. Why don't you ask him? Come on .

1333

由你开始吧
Now, darIing , why don't you start?

1347
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:47,166
你曾替托马图用密码带口讯？

当然不是

1352
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:56,884
但你曾探访托马图？

1353
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,928
每周都去，那又如何？

他是一个敏感…
He's a deepIy sensitive person .

1358

1429
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,320
我就是巴西总统夫人
I'II be married to the future president of BraziI .

1430
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:29,365
我可以获得外交豁免权
And that'II give me dipIomatic immunity or something .

1431
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,701
看来不是
I wouIdn't bet on it.

1432
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,246
什么？
What is it, darIing?

1433
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:39,834
你有口讯
Message for you .

1434
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,920
好的，我明白了
Oh , yes, I see.

1435
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:45,047
他亲自送来…
Did he bring it in person , or was it,

1436
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:47,508
还是只放在门下？
just there, shoved under the door?

1437
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:49,385
由表亲送来
A cousin .

1438
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:54,098
把手袋给我
Hand me my purse, wiII you , darIing?

1439
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,643
女孩子没涂上口红不可看口讯
A girI can't read that sort of thing without her Iipstick.

1440
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:02,439
你替我读出来
You read it to me, wiII you , darIing?

1441
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:04,775
我承受不了
I don't think I can quite bear. . .

1442
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,403
你真的想这样吗？
Sure you want me to?

1443
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:12,658
是
Okay.

1444
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,744
“我亲爱的小女孩
"My dearest IittIe girI ,

1445
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:19,164
“我爱你，我知道你与别人不同
"I have Ioved you knowing you were not as others.

1446
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,833
“但我不喜欢…
"But conceive of my despair

1447
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:24,044
“受公众注目
"upon discovering in such a brutaI and pubIic styIe

1448
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:27,715
“我和你来自不同阶级
"how very different you are from the manner of woman

1449
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:30,634
“你和我心目中的妻子很不同
"a man of my position couId hope to make his wife.

1450
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:36,140
“很抱歉你现在名誉受损
"I grieve for the disgrace of your present circumstances.

1451
01:46:36,265 --> 01:46:38,183
“我不想加深你的…
"And I do not find it in my heart

1452
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,185
“痛楚
"to add my condemn

1453
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,813
“因为你已被旁人指责

1454
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:47,776
“希望你在心里不会指责我
"So I hope you wiII find it in your heart not to condemn me.

1455
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,946
“我要保护家人及我的声誉
"I have my famiIy to protect and my name

1456
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:55,284
“我是一名懦夫
"and I am a coward where these institutions enter.

1457
01:46:56,577 --> 01:47:00,873
“原谅我，漂亮的孩子，愿主保佑你
"Forget me, beautifuI chiId . And may God be with you .

1458
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:02,875
“荷西”
"Jos茅."

1459
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,462
怎样？
WeII?

1460
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:10,215
至少他很坦白
WeII , at Ieast he's honest.

1461
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:13,093
-有点感动
-感动？
-It's kind of touching . -Touching?

1462
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:14,970
那守旧的人
That square-baII jazz.

1463
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,182
他说他是懦夫
He says he's a coward .

1464
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:22,186
那么他不是鼠辈或超越鼠辈
AII right. So he's not a reguIar rat or even a super-rat.

1465
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,813
他只是受惊的小老鼠
He's just a scared IittIe mouse, that's aII .

1466
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:27,566
但…
But, oh , goIIy.

1467
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:29,818
天啊
Gee, damn .

1468
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,118
不用再去南美洲
WeII , so much for South America.

1469
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:43,999
你也不会成为皇后了
I didn't reaIIy think you were cut out to be queen of the Pampas, anyway.

1470
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,835
-去克雷顿饭店
-艾迪怀尔德机场
-CIayton HoteI . -IdIewiId .

1471
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,046
什么？
What?

1472
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:51,799
班机十二时开出，我会上机
The pIane Ieaves at 1 2: 00. And on it I pIan to be.

1473
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,842
荷莉，你不能去
HoIIy, you can't.

1474
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:59,932
我不是想去追回荷西
I'm not hotfooting it after Jos茅, if that's what you think. Oh , no.

1475
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:03,560
他成为总统与我无关
As far as I'm concerned , he's the future president of nowhere.

1476
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,979
但我为何要浪费这机票？
OnIy why shouId I waste a perfectIy good pIane ticket?

1477
01:48:06,063 --> 01:48:08,232
我不曾到过巴西
Besides, I've never been to BraziI .

1478
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,404
求求你，别这样看着我
PIease, darIing , don't sit there Iooking at me Iike that.

1479
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:16,156
我一定要去
I'm going and that's aII there is to it.

1480
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:18,659
他们只是…
Now aII they want from me

1481
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:21,453
想我指证沙里
are my services as the state's witness against SaIIy.

1482
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:24,331
没有人想起诉我
Nobody has any intention of prosecuting me.

1483
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:27,292
但他们没有机会这么做
To begin with , they don't have a ghost of a chance.

1484
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:30,963
我对这城市不再留恋
Even so, this town's finished for me.

1485
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:33,006
至少在短时间内
At Ieast for a whiIe.

1486
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:37,886
聚光灯会伤害女孩的皮肤
There are certain shades of IimeIight that can wreck a girI's compIexion .

1487
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,764
我到每间发廊也会受大众注视
They'II have the rope up at every saIoon in town .

1488
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,642
我告诉你该怎么做
I'II teII you what you do for me, darIing .

1489
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:44,893
你回去之后…
When you get back to town ,

1490
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:48,105
致电《纽约时报》
I want you to caII up the New York Times or whoever you caII .

1491
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:51,567
我要你把巴西五十富豪的名单寄给我
I want you to maiI me a Iist of the 50 richest men in BraziI .

1492
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,402
是五十富豪
The 50 richest.

1493
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:59,283
-我不会让你这么做
-你不会让我这么做？
-HoIIy, I'm not going to Iet you do this. -You're not going to Iet me?

1494
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:01,493
荷莉，我爱你
HoIIy, I'm in Iove with you .

1495
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,871
-那又如何？
-那又如何？
-So what? -So what?

1496
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:06,498
这是很重要的
So pIenty.

1497
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:09,168
-我爱你，你属于我
-不
-I Iove you . You beIong to me. -No.

1498
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,045
-人们不属于对方
-他们当然是
-PeopIe don't beIong to peopIe. -Of course they do.

1499
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:14,006
没有人可将我放在笼内
I'm not gonna Iet anyone put me in a cage.

1500
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:16,341
我不想将你放在笼内，我想爱你
I don't want to put you in a cage. I want to Iove you .

1501
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:18,886
-两者是相同的
-不，不是的
-It's the same thing . -No, it's not.

1502
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:20,721
-荷莉
-我不是荷莉
-HoIIy. . . -I'm not HoIIy.

1503
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,098
也不是露拉美，我不知道自己是谁
I'm not LuIa Mae, either. I don't know who I am .

1504
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,391
我跟这只猫一样
I'm Iike cat, here.

1505
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,810
我和猫咪都是无名氏，不属于任何人
We're a coupIe of no-name sIobs. We beIong to nobody.

1506
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:30,272
也没人属于我们
我们甚至不属于对方
And nobody beIongs to us. We don't even beIong to each other.

1507
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:32,816
停车
Stop the cab.

1508
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:40,032
你认为怎样？
What do you think?

1509
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:43,285
这儿该适合你
This ought to be the right kind of pIace for a tough guy Iike you .

1510
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:45,704
垃圾堆，充满老鼠
Garbage cans, rats gaIore.

1511
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,081
滚开
Scram !

1512
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,708
我说下车
I said take off! Beat it!

1513
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,794
起程吧
Let's go.

1514
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,098
司机
Driver

1515
01:50:07,643 --> 01:50:09,394
请停在那儿
puII over here.

1516
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:20,864
你知道你有何问题吗？无名氏小姐
You know what's wrong with you , Miss Whoever-you-are?

1517
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:23,909
你很懦弱，缺乏勇气
You're chicken . You've got no guts.

1518
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,079
你害怕承认人生就是这样
You're afraid to stick out your chin and say, "Okay, Iife's a fact."

1519
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,622
人们相爱
PeopIe do faII in Iove.

1520
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:30,666
结成佳偶
PeopIe do beIong to each other

1521
01:50:30,749 --> 01:50:33,961
因为这是人们获得真正幸福的唯一机会
because that's the onIy chance anybody's got for reaI happiness.

1522
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,339
你说自己野性难驯
You caII yourseIf a free spirit, a wiId thing .

1523
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,717
害怕别人将你困在笼子里
And you're terrified somebody's going to stick you in a cage.

1524
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:44,638
其实你已在笼子里是你一手做成的
WeII , baby, you're aIready in that cage. You buiIt it yourseIf.

1525
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,807
这和图纳、德州…
And it's not bounded in the west by TuIip, Texas

1526
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,308
或索马里无关
or in the east by SomaIiIand .

1527
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,852
而是看你自己怎么想
It's wherever you go.

1528
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:53,897
无论去哪儿，你也会遇到自己
Because no matter where you run , you just end up running into yourseIf.

1529
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:04,700
给你的，这数个月我一直带在身边
Here. I've been carrying this thing around for months.

1530
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,202
我不再需要它
I don't want it any more.

1531
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:01,506
猫咪，过来
Here, cat!

1532
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:03,592
猫咪
Cat!

1533
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,770
猫咪在哪儿？
Where's the cat?

1534
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:17,356
我不知道
I don't know.

1535
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:30,077
猫咪
Cat!

1536
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:35,040
猫咪

1537
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,627
猫咪

1538
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:40,504
猫咪

1539
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:42,297
猫咪

1540
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:46,093
猫咪

1541
01:52:50,472 --> 01:52:52,015
猫咪
Cat.

1542
01:52:57,479 --> 01:52:59,064
猫咪

1543
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,008
猫咪

1544
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:28,051
猫咪

1545
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,084
剧终

1546
01:55:04,940 --> 01:58:00,000
Mandarin
