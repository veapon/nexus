00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:26,831
想跳支舞嗎？
Do you want to dance?

268
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,209
現在？ 是的
- Now? - Yeah.

269
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,545
好的
Okay.

270
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:41,263
我必須警告你，由我來帶舞 當然，你是美國人
- I have to warn you, I tend to lead. - Of course. You are American.

271
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:56,448
你以前跳過？ 什麼？
- You've done this before. - What?

272
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:01,369
你交過幾個女朋友？

Two.

274
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,048
真的？ 我會騙你嗎？
- Really? - Would I lie to you?

275
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:15,093
不知道. 你會嗎？
I don't know. Would you?

276
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:38,995
你的眼睛真漂亮，你應該連晚上都別閉上
Your eyes are amazing. You should never shut them, not even at night.

277
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:42,666
你應學會張著眼睛睡覺
You should learn to sleep with your eyes open.

278
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:49,048
我可以辦的到 你能嗎？ 〔歌聲〕你能能能.....
- I'll work on that. - Will you?

279
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,680
等一下
Hang on.

280
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,271
我想這是錯誤的
I think this is a mistake.

281
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:08,653
根本沒有錯誤，全看你願不願意而已
There are no mistakes. There's what you do, and what you don't do.

282
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,867
我不能這樣
I can't do this.

283
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:27,216
我忘了外套
Forgot my coat.

284
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,703
不行 怎麼？
- I can't. - What?

285
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:46,079
怎麼回事？
What's wrong?

286
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:49,042
我不知道怎麼辦 這是不對的
I don't know how to do this. It's wrong.

287
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:51,419
打我 什麼？
- Hit me. - What?

288
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:52,836
打我
Hit me.

289
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,555
打我
Hit me.

290
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:37,705
嗨，愛德華 嗨，鮑伯
- Hey, Ed. - Hey, Bob.

291
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,000
好一陣子沒看到你了 沒錯
- Haven't seen you in a while. - No.

292
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:44,086
這禮拜我一直工作到很晚 真的？ 孩子怎麼樣？
- I've been working late this week. - Really? How's the boy?

293
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,048
他的生日到了 幾歲了？
- It's his birthday. - How old?

294
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:47,299
9歲
Nine.

295
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:50,303
那要不要全副武裝來個大搶劫？
So any major armed robberies?

296
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,972
不. 不，這禮拜不行
No. No, not this week.

297
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:55,892
說到這點，多注意一下康妮
Speaking of which, watch out for Connie.

298
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,396
她會叫你在你的抵押單據上簽名 什麼？
- She'll have you sign over your mortgage. - What?

299
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,274
她有設法說服你捐款嗎？ 沒有
- Did she try to hit on you for money? - No.

300
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:08,280
我以為她跟你提過 關於學校拍賣會的事，或者別的
I thought she talked to you about this school auction, or whatever.

301
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,740
沒跟我提過
Not me.

302
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:13,077
我一直出差在外 也許她跟瑪吉說過
I've been out of town. Maybe she talked to Maggie.

303
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,707
是的，我想是我搞錯了
Yeah, I guess I got it wrong.

304
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,085
總之，我們欠你一頓飯
Anyway, we owe you a dinner.

305
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:22,296
沒錯
Yeah.

306
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,059
他不在
He's out.

307
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,647
要不要帶東西給你？
Can I get you anything?

308
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,859
不. 不，我很好，謝謝
No. No, I'm fine, thanks.

309
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,492
今天辛苦了？ 不，不太會
- Tough day? - No, not really.

310
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,580
你呢？ 你今天過的如何？

很好
It was good.

312
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,504
你知道，就平常那些瑣事
You know, the usual stuff.

313
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,596
你確定不要點什麼嗎？
Sure you don't want anything?

314
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:08,431
不用
No.

315
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,227
康妮？ 什麼事？
- Con? - Yeah?

316
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,646
你愛我嗎？
Do you love me?

317
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:18,734
我當然愛你
Of course I love you.

318
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,280
真是個傻問題
What a silly question.

319
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:24,741
我猜...
I guess. . .

320
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,661
...我是覺得我有點傻
. . .I'm just feeling silly.

不是跟你
Not with you.

328
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:00,499

- I'll have a coffee. - Well, I guess I'll have coffee too.

404
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:37,395
再失陪一下，我上個洗手間
Excuse me again. Ladies' room.

405
00:51:40,983 --> 00:51:42,567
天啊，她看起來氣色真好
God, she looks good.

406
00:51:42,777 --> 00:51:46,989
你想她有去做整容嗎？ 她何必整容？ 她還耀眼的很
- You think she's had work? - Why would she? She's still gorgeous.

407
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,159
趁現在早點做，免得到時成了黃臉婆
They do it early now before it goes to shit.

408
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:08,765
我朋友在外面
I have friends out there.

409
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,607
你帶我來這最棒的地方
You take me to the best places.

410
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:21,152
我來
Let me.

411
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:29,453
她不像你說的那樣. 她真的很漂亮 當然漂亮了
- She's not like that. She's really nice. - Of course she is.

412
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:32,959
所以才更糟糕 她既漂亮又溫柔
That makes it worse. She's nice and she's sweet.

413
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,795
她的臀部跟在大學時一樣玲瓏有致
And her ass is in exactly the same place it was in college.

414
00:52:43,387 --> 00:52:45,137
你有在打網球嗎？
Are you taking tennis?

415
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:49,266
哦，我可不會稱那回事為"打網球"
Oh, I wouldn't call what I do "taking tennis. "

416
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:56,149
你回來了. 我正開始要擔心你呢 不，我很好
- There you are. I was starting to worry. - No, I'm fine.

417
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,154
我們還以為你被帥哥給綁架了呢
We thought that heartthrob abducted you.

418
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:01,323
什麼帥哥啊？
What heartthrob?

419
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:05,702
你沒看到櫃檯那個男的嗎？ 好帥哦
You didn't see him at the counter? He was gorgeous.

420
00:53:06,538 --> 00:53:09,498
我沒聽懂 你的扣子沒扣好
- I miss everything. - Your button's undone.

421
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,044
哦，謝謝
Oh. Thank you.

422
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,800
就是他
That's him.

423
00:53:27,395 --> 00:53:28,938
我看他對我有意思
I can see the appeal.

424
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:31,941
如果他看我兩次 我馬上轉頭過去
If he looked at me twice, I'd be on my back.

425
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,526
你不會的 我會的. 為何說不會？
- You would not. - I would so. Why not?

426
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,529
兩項理由: 亞當和你的孩子
A couple of reasons: Adam and your kids.

427
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:40,825
你知道，特蕾西，不必給他們知道
You know, Trace, they wouldn't have to know.

428
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:46,038
這很可能是我自己跨越禁忌尺度
It could be something I did for myself, to broaden my horizons.

429
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:48,208
就像上陶藝班一樣
Like taking a pottery class.

430
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,838
戀愛又不像上陶藝班 有可能
- An affair isn't like taking pottery. - Could be.

431
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:55,925
戀情會像那樣開始發展出來 然後就發生了關係...
It would start out like that. Then something would happen. . .

432
00:53:56,176 --> 00:54:01,557
被人發現有了外遇 最後結局都很慘
. . .someone finds out or someone falls in love and it ends disastrously.

433
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,562
總是以悲劇收場
They always end disastrously.

434
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:18,868
不
No.

435
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:20,745
什麼時候？
When?

436
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:23,665
很久以前了
It was a long time ago.

437
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:28,086
如果可能的話，我希望能重來一遍
And it's the one thing in my life I would undo if I could.

438
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,765
你越過街道就只是為了干我？
Did you just fuck me across the street?

439
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,268
是的
I did.

440
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,607
我們可以立刻結束這段關係 誰也不會受到傷害
We could end this now and no one would get hurt.

441
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:50,987
是的. 我想如果現在結束的話 我會受到傷害
Yeah. I think if we ended this now, I'd get hurt.

442
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:56,951
所以不管怎樣，有人會受到傷害？ 也許不會
- So no matter what, someone gets hurt? - Maybe not.

443
00:54:57,162 --> 00:54:59,873
也許我們會彼此厭倦對方
Maybe we'll get tired of each other.

444
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:02,876
天啊，真希望我能厭倦你
God, I hope I get tired of you.

445
00:55:07,048 --> 00:55:09,174
你深植我心坎底
You're in my mind.

446
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:14,555
每早醒來第一個想到的就是你
You're the only thing in my mind when I wake up every morning.

447
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:19,061
還沒張眼之前，你就浮現在我腦海了
You're in my brain before I even open my eyes.

448
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:22,147
你想的是什麼？ 不一定
- What do you think of? - That depends.

449
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:27,487
如果哪一天不知能否見到你時 我會很緊張...
If it's a day when I don't know if I'm gonna get to see you, I'm anxious. . .

450
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:31,199
...想盡借口來這堿搷A
. . .thinking of excuses to come to the city to see you.

451
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:37,498
你知道我們要見面的日子嗎？
And the days you know we'll meet?

452
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,501
每逢那些日子...
On those days. . .

453
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:42,002
...我...
. . .I'm. . .

454
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,257
平靜多了，也痛恨我自己
. . .calm and hating myself.

455
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,231
這堨u有這個
This is what we have over here.

456
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,234
我下午就幫你準備好了
I'll have it ready for you this afternoon.

457
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,908
愛德華，怎麼了？ 聽起來很重要的樣子
Ed, what's up? Sounded important.

458
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:14,872
我聽說你跟鄧巴、布爾克 及其它公司洽談
I've heard you're talking with Dunbar and Brinks and other companies.

459
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,875
你從哪媗巨茠滿H
Where did you hear that?

460
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,378
嗯，聽著
Well, look.

461
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:23,674
我想他們可能是要挖角我過去 若你的意思是那樣
I suppose they could be wooing me, if that's what you mean.

462
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:28,388
很明顯地一堆人要挖你跳槽 還是誰在挖誰呢？
Apparently a lot of people are wooing you. Or who's wooing who?

463
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,558
你在說什麼呀？ 我跟一些人談過了
What are you talking about? So I talked to some people.

464
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,563
那又怎樣？ 這是關於忠誠，比爾
- So what? - This is about loyalty, Bill.

465
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:41,235
我讓你走 要是有需要的話我可以寫推薦函
I'm letting you go. You'll have my recommendation if you need it.

466
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:45,908
我有一家人要養活，愛德華
I have a family, Ed.

467
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,827
你這堣]有一家人
You had a family here.

468
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:53,081
不，等一等 你跟我談論家人？
No, wait a minute. You're telling me about family?

469
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:57,128
最重要的事你都被蒙在鼓
You don't know the first goddamn thing about it.

470
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:04,303
注意你自己該死的家人，愛德華
Look at your own fucking family, Ed.

471
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:07,223
他媽的注意一下!
Take a goddamn look at that.

472
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,871
愛德華 法蘭克
- Ed. - Frank.

473
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,253
謝謝你這麼快趕來
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

474
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:36,256
這是私事，與公事無關
This is personal, it's not business.

475
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:40,385
考慮一下 你可能不願意牽扯到這件事
Think about it. You might not want to get involved.

476
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:42,805
但我需要找個信得過的人
But I need someone I can trust.

477
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:45,475
我要你跟蹤一個人
I want you to follow somebody.

478
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:51,023
我要你跟蹤我老婆
I want you to follow my wife.

479
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:04,694
著火了，媽 什麼？
- It's burning, Mom. - What?

480
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,353
著火了. 雞肉
It's burning. The chicken.

481
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:08,326
可惡

482
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,342
Shit.

483
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:24,406
水滾了，媽. 水滾開了!
It's boiling, Mom. It's boiling!

484
00:58:24,523 --> 00:58:26,281
謝謝
Thank you.

485
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:33,900
小心! 小心!...
Watch it. Watch it.

486
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,026
抱歉，雞肉有點燒焦
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry.

487
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,605
沒關係
It's fine.

488
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,081
我明天要去芝加哥
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow.

489
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:01,427
去多久？ 不會很久. 可能只住一個晚上
- For how long? - Not long. Probably just a night.

490
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:03,574
幾點的班機？
What time's your flight?

491
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:05,955
八點
Eight o'clock.

492
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:09,338
早上？
A.M.?

493
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,663
戴安·德萊厄爾的兒子跟艾美·琳恩的女兒 要結婚
Dianne Dreyer's son is marrying Amy Lynn's daughter.

494
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:18,009
我絕不要結婚 為什麼不要？
- I'm never getting married. - Why not?

495
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:22,661
我討厭女孩子
I hate girls.

496
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:25,405
你以後就會改變心意的
You might change your mind. That happens sometimes.

497
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:27,885
我才不會
I won't.

498
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:36,433
什麼？ 我今天將比爾·史東解雇了
- What? - I fired Bill Stone today.

499
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,213
你是在煩那件事嗎？ 我沒在煩
- That's what's bothering you? - Nothing's bothering me.

500
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,294
你為什麼要解雇他？
Why did you fire him?

501
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,273
他不夠負責 什麼是負責？
- He's not accountable. - What's accountable?

502
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:52,970
是不是像人吃人？ 不是
- Isn't it like people who eat people? - No.

503
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,858
那是食人族，甜心
That's a cannibal, honey.

504
00:59:57,549 --> 01:00:00,568
總之，我再也信不過他了
Anyway, I can't trust him anymore.

505
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:07,377
所以如果你碰到桃莉，你就會明白
So if you run into Dolly, you'll know.

506
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,681
怎麼？ 沒想到你這樣!
- What? - I can't believe you!

507
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,372
我做了什麼？
What did I do?

508
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,801
糟糕!
Shit!

509
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,485
糟糕!
Shit!

510
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:34,257
快點!
Come on!

511
01:02:55,112 --> 01:02:58,107
真對不起. 真的很對不起
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

512
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,103
甜心，你沒事吧？
Honey, you okay?

513
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:05,469
你一定非常擔心 住手，媽. 別人會看到
- You must have been so worried. - Stop, Mom. People can see.

514
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,671
嗨，我是保羅·馬提爾 嗶聲後請留下您的訊息
Hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave a message after the beep.

515
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:34,254
媽？
Mom?

516
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:38,673
你應該上床睡覺了
You're supposed to be in bed.

517
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:42,509
你在哭，媽 哦，甜心
- You're crying, Mom. - Oh, honey.

518
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:47,931
媽咪只是有點難過而已 來吧，我帶你回房睡覺
Mommy's just a little sad, that's all. Come on, I'll take you bed.

519
01:03:48,185 --> 01:03:50,016
我帶你去睡覺
Let's get you into bed.

520
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:53,808
別難過了，媽 爸明天就回家了
Don't be sad, Mom. Dad will be home tomorrow.

521
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:05,569
他叫保羅·馬提爾
His name is Paul Martel.

522
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:13,614
住在梅瑟街433號，3號公寓
He lives at 433 Mercer Street, Apartment 3.

523
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:17,410
她白天時候去找他
She sees him during the day.

524
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,035
通常都在午餐時間前後
Usually goes around lunchtime.

525
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:24,206
約逗留個兩、三小時
Stays about two hours, maybe three.

526
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:39,217
他們去電影院？
They go to the movies?

527
01:04:39,428 --> 01:04:43,053
那天有去 除此之外，還去了他家
They did that day. Otherwise, they're in his place.

528
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:57,900
快點接!
Pick up.

529
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,042
嘿，小姐!
Hey, lady!

530
01:06:23,002 --> 01:06:24,250
你鑰匙忘了給
Forgot your keys.

531
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,533
等等!
Wait!

532
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:11,492
她是誰？ 她是誰？
Who is she? Who is she?

533
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:14,662
冷靜點! 你在幹什麼？
Calm down! What are you doing?

534

673
01:34:45,234 --> 01:34:46,859
不知道
No.

674
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:51,360
我想在家吧

蘇活區，是不是？

在他桌上找到你的名字和電話號碼

他的家人報案說他失蹤了

你上回見到他是什麼時候？
When did you see him last?

684
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,803
不記得了，很難說

他是個書商

Has something happened? You think he's all right?

689
01:35:44,984 --> 01:35:47,650
一時還很難說
It's hard to say at this point.

690
01:35:47,862 --> 01:35:49,820
我們正在調查
We're working on it.

如果有他消息的話，麻煩通知我們 沒問題
- If you hear from him, let us know. - Certainly.

694
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,348
爸! 警察今天來我們家

警察？ 他們來做什麼？
Cops? What did they want?

696
01:36:42,232 --> 01:36:43,230
有人失蹤了
Someone's missing.

697
01:36:43,735 --> 01:36:46,609
他們必須詢問每個人，你知道的

698
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,029
誰失蹤了？
Who was it?

699
01:36:53,325 --> 01:36:55,450
甜心，坐好
Honey, sit up straight.

700
01:36:58,246 --> 01:37:01,456
誰失蹤了？ 我想你不認識他
- Who was it? - I don't think you know him.

701
01:37:01,664 --> 01:37:03,706
是個賣書的

702
01:37:03,915 --> 01:37:05,831
我忘了在哪見過他
I forget where I met him.

703
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:09,168
他是個壞蛋嗎，媽？
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

704
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:14,964
警察為什麼要給你問話？
Why did they want to talk to you?

705
01:37:15,172 --> 01:37:18,256
我猜他有我的名字和電話號碼
I guess he had my name and number.

706
01:37:19,635 --> 01:37:22,720
他為何會有你的電話號碼？
Why would he have your number?

707
01:37:23,389 --> 01:37:25,636
我想是跟他買過書的關係
I think I bought a book from him.

708
01:37:38,022 --> 01:37:41,146
小心點. 慢慢來 嘿，查理!
