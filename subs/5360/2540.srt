34
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,482
你戴又不表示你是唐老鸭

00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,545
好的
Okay.

270
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:41,263
我必须警告你，由我来带舞 当然，你是美国人
- I have to warn you, I tend to lead. - Of course. You are American.

271
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:56,448
你以前跳过？ 什么？
- You've done this before. - What?

272
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:01,369
你交过几个女朋友？
How many girlfriends have you had?

273
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,418
两个
Two.

274
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,048
真的？ 我会骗你吗？
- Really? - Would I lie to you?

275
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:15,093
不知道. 你会吗？
I don't know. Would you?

276
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:38,995
你的眼睛真漂亮，你应该连晚上都别闭上
Your eyes are amazing. You should never shut them, not even at night.

277
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:42,666
你应学会张着眼睛睡觉
You should learn to sleep with your eyes open.

278
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:49,048
我可以办的到 你能吗？ 〔歌声〕你能能能.....
- I'll work on that. - Will you?

279
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,680
等一下
Hang on.

280
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,271
我想这是错误的
I think this is a mistake.

281
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:08,653
根本没有错误，全看你愿不愿意而已
There are no mistakes. There's what you do, and what you don't do.

282
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,867
我不能这样
I can't do this.

283
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:27,216
我忘了外套
Forgot my coat.

284
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,703
不行 怎么？
- I can't. - What?

285
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:46,079
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

286
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:49,042
我不知道怎么办 这是不对的
I don't know how to do this. It's wrong.

287
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:51,419
打我 什么？
- Hit me. - What?

288
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:52,836
打我
Hit me.

289
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,555
打我
Hit me.

290
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:37,705
嗨，爱德华 嗨，鲍伯
- Hey, Ed. - Hey, Bob.

291
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,000
好一阵子没看到你了 没错
- Haven't seen you in a while. - No.

292
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:44,086
这礼拜我一直工作到很晚 真的？ 孩子怎么样？
- I've been working late this week. - Really? How's the boy?

293
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,048
他的生日到了 几岁了？
- It's his birthday. - How old?

294
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:47,299
9岁
Nine.

295
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:50,303
那要不要全副武装来个大抢劫？
So any major armed robberies?

296
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,972
不. 不，这礼拜不行
No. No, not this week.

297
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:55,892
说到这点，多注意一下康妮
Speaking of which, watch out for Connie.

298
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,396
她会叫你在你的抵押单据上签名 什么？
- She'll have you sign over your mortgage. - What?

299
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,274
她有设法说服你捐款吗？ 没有
- Did she try to hit on you for money? - No.

300
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:08,280
我以为她跟你提过 关于学校拍卖会的事，或者别的
I thought she talked to you about this school auction, or whatever.

301
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,740
没跟我提过
Not me.

302
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:13,077
我一直出差在外 也许她跟玛吉说过
I've been out of town. Maybe she talked to Maggie.

303
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,707
是的，我想是我搞错了
Yeah, I guess I got it wrong.

304
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,085
总之，我们欠你一顿饭
Anyway, we owe you a dinner.

305
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:22,296
没错
Yeah.

306
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,059
他不在
He's out.

307
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,647
要不要带东西给你？
Can I get you anything?

308
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,859
不. 不，我很好，谢谢
No. No, I'm fine, thanks.

309
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,492
今天辛苦了？ 不，不太会
- Tough day? - No, not really.

310
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,580
你呢？ 你今天过的如何？
What about you? How was your day?

311
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,540
很好
It was good.

312
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,504
你知道，就平常那些琐事
You know, the usual stuff.

313
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,596
你确定不要点什么吗？
Sure you don't want anything?

314
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:08,431
不用
No.

315
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,227
康妮？ 什么事？
- Con? - Yeah?

316
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,646
你爱我吗？
Do you love me?

317
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:18,734
我当然爱你
Of course I love you.

318
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,280
真是个傻问题
What a silly question.

319
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:24,741
我猜...
I guess. . .

320
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,661
...我是觉得我有点傻
. . .I'm just feeling silly.

321
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,668
我马上上去
I'll be up in a minute.

322
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,880
好的
Okay.

323
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:39,216
哦，抱歉
Oh, sorry.

324
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:45,733
你来这里做什么？
What are we doing here?

325
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:49,110
吃午餐啊!
Having lunch.

326
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:54,743
我不应该这样 你不应该吃午餐吗？
- I shouldn't be doing this. - You shouldn't have lunch?

327
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,079
不是跟你
Not with you.

328
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:00,499
我想我们应该离开
I think we should leave.

329
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:07,423
听着
Listen.

330
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:10,718
看到那边正要买单的人没？
See those guys over there paying the check?

331
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:16,141
看到了 好的. 如果是右边的人付钱...
- Yes. - Okay. If the guy on the right pays. . .

332
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:20,270
...我们马上离开 如果是左边的人付钱的话...
. . .we leave right now. If the guy on the left pays. . .

333
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:22,357

334
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:26,612

335
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,947

338
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,470
不 这就是生活
- No. - C'est la vie.

00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:47,779
你有空吗？
You free?

367
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,321

你想她有去做整容吗？ 她何必整容？ 她还耀眼的很
- You think she's had work? - Why would she? She's still gorgeous.

407
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,159
趁现在早点做，免得到时成了黄脸婆
They do it early now before it goes to shit.

408
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:08,765
我朋友在外面
I have friends out there.

409
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,607
你带我来这最棒的地方
You take me to the best places.

410
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:21,152
我来
Let me.

411
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:29,453
她不像你说的那样. 她真的很漂亮 当然漂亮了
- She's not like that. She's really nice. - Of course she is.

412
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:32,959
所以才更糟糕 她既漂亮又温柔
That makes it worse. She's nice and she's sweet.

413
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,795
她的臀部跟在大学时一样玲珑有致
And her ass is in exactly the same place it was in college.

414
00:52:43,387 --> 00:52:45,137
你有在打网球吗？
Are you taking tennis?

415
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:49,266
哦，我可不会称那回事为"打网球"
Oh, I wouldn't call what I do "taking tennis. "

416
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:56,149
你回来了. 我正开始要担心你呢 不，我很好
- There you are. I was starting to worry. - No, I'm fine.

417
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,154
我们还以为你被帅哥给绑架了呢
We thought that heartthrob abducted you.

418
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:01,323
什么帅哥啊？
What heartthrob?

419
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:05,702
你没看到柜台那个男的吗？ 好帅哦
You didn't see him at the counter? He was gorgeous.

420
00:53:06,538 --> 00:53:09,498
我没听懂 你的扣子没扣好
- I miss everything. - Your button's undone.

421
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,044
哦，谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

422
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,800
就是他
That's him.

423
00:53:27,395 --> 00:53:28,938
我看他对我有意思
I can see the appeal.

424
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:31,941
如果他看我两次 我马上转头过去
If he looked at me twice, I'd be on my back.

425
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,526
你不会的 我会的. 为何说不会？
- You would not. - I would so. Why not?

426
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,529
两项理由: 亚当和你的孩子
A couple of reasons: Adam and your kids.

427
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:40,825
你知道，特蕾西，不必给他们知道
You know, Trace, they wouldn't have to know.

428
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:46,038
这很可能是我自己跨越禁忌尺度
It could be something I did for myself, to broaden my horizons.

429
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:48,208
就像上陶艺班一样
Like taking a pottery class.

430
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,838
恋爱又不像上陶艺班 有可能
- An affair isn't like taking pottery. - Could be.

431
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:55,925
恋情会像那样开始发展出来 然后就发生了关系...
It would start out like that. Then something would happen. . .

432
00:53:56,176 --> 00:54:01,557
被人发现有了外遇 最后结局都很惨
. . .someone finds out or someone falls in love and it ends disastrously.

433
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,562
总是以悲剧收场
They always end disastrously.

434
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:18,868
不
No.

435
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:20,745
什么时候？
When?

436
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:23,665
很久以前了
It was a long time ago.

437
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:28,086
如果可能的话，我希望能重来一遍
And it's the one thing in my life I would undo if I could.

438
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,765
你越过街道就只是为了干我？
Did you just fuck me across the street?

439
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,268
是的
I did.

440
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,607
我们可以立刻结束这段关系 谁也不会受到伤害
We could end this now and no one would get hurt.

441
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:50,987
是的. 我想如果现在结束的话 我会受到伤害
Yeah. I think if we ended this now, I'd get hurt.

442
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:56,951
所以不管怎样，有人会受到伤害？ 也许不会
- So no matter what, someone gets hurt? - Maybe not.

443
00:54:57,162 --> 00:54:59,873
也许我们会彼此厌倦对方
Maybe we'll get tired of each other.

444
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:02,876
天啊，真希望我能厌倦你
God, I hope I get tired of you.

445
00:55:07,048 --> 00:55:09,174
你深植我心坎底
You're in my mind.

446
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:14,555
每早醒来第一个想到的就是你
You're the only thing in my mind when I wake up every morning.

447
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:19,061
还没张眼之前，你就浮现在我脑海了
You're in my brain before I even open my eyes.

448
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:22,147
你想的是什么？ 不一定
- What do you think of? - That depends.

449
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:27,487
如果哪一天不知能否见到你时 我会很紧张...
If it's a day when I don't know if I'm gonna get to see you, I'm anxious. . .

450
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:31,199
...想尽借口来这里看你
. . .thinking of excuses to come to the city to see you.

451
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:37,498
你知道我们要见面的日子吗？
And the days you know we'll meet?

452
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,501
每逢那些日子...
On those days. . .

453
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:42,002
...我...
. . .I'm. . .

454
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,257
平静多了，也痛恨我自己
. . .calm and hating myself.

455
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,231
这里只有这个
This is what we have over here.

456
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,234
我下午就帮你准备好了
I'll have it ready for you this afternoon.

457
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,908
爱德华，怎么了？ 听起来很重要的样子
Ed, what's up? Sounded important.

458
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:14,872
我听说你跟邓巴、布尔克 及其它公司洽谈
I've heard you're talking with Dunbar and Brinks and other companies.

459
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,875
你从哪里听来的？
Where did you hear that?

460
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,378
嗯，听着
Well, look.

461
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:23,674
我想他们可能是要挖角我过去 若你的意思是那样
I suppose they could be wooing me, if that's what you mean.

462
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:28,388
很明显地一堆人要挖你跳槽 还是谁在挖谁呢？
Apparently a lot of people are wooing you. Or who's wooing who?

463
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,558
你在说什么呀？ 我跟一些人谈过了
What are you talking about? So I talked to some people.

464
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,563
那又怎样？ 这是关于忠诚，比尔
- So what? - This is about loyalty, Bill.

465
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:41,235
我让你走 要是有需要的话我可以写推荐函
I'm letting you go. You'll have my recommendation if you need it.

466
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:45,908
我有一家人要养活，爱德华
I have a family, Ed.

467
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,827
你这里也有一家人
You had a family here.

468
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:53,081
不，等一等 你跟我谈论家人？
No, wait a minute. You're telling me about family?

469
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:57,128
最重要的事你都被蒙在鼓里
You don't know the first goddamn thing about it.

470
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:04,303
注意你自己该死的家人，爱德华
Look at your own fucking family, Ed.

471
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:07,223
他妈的注意一下!
Take a goddamn look at that.

472
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,871
爱德华 法兰克
- Ed. - Frank.

473
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,253
谢谢你这么快赶来
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

474
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:36,256
这是私事，与公事无关
This is personal, it's not business.

475
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:40,385
考虑一下 你可能不愿意牵扯到这件事
Think about it. You might not want to get involved.

476
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:42,805
但我需要找个信得过的人
But I need someone I can trust.

477
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:45,475
我要你跟踪一个人
I want you to follow somebody.

478
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:51,023
我要你跟踪我老婆
I want you to follow my wife.

479
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:04,694
着火了，妈 什么？
- It's burning, Mom. - What?

480
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,353
着火了. 鸡肉
It's burning. The chicken.

481
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:08,326
可恶

482
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,342
Shit.

483
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:24,406
水滚了，妈. 水滚开了!
It's boiling, Mom. It's boiling!

484
00:58:24,523 --> 00:58:26,281
谢谢
Thank you.

485
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:33,900
小心! 小心!...
Watch it. Watch it.

486
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,026
抱歉，鸡肉有点烧焦
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry.

487
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,605
没关系
It's fine.

488
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,081
我明天要去芝加哥
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow.

489
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:01,427
去多久？ 不会很久. 可能只住一个晚上
- For how long? - Not long. Probably just a night.

490
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:03,574
几点的班机？
What time's your flight?

491
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:05,955
八点
Eight o'clock.

492
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:09,338
早上？
A.M.?

493
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,663
戴安・德莱厄尔的儿子跟艾美・琳恩的女儿 要结婚
Dianne Dreyer's son is marrying Amy Lynn's daughter.

494
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:18,009
我绝不要结婚 为什么不要？
- I'm never getting married. - Why not?

495
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:22,661
我讨厌女孩子
I hate girls.

496
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:25,405
你以后就会改变心意的
You might change your mind. That happens sometimes.

497
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:27,885
我才不会
I won't.

498
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:36,433
什么？ 我今天将比尔・史东解雇了
- What? - I fired Bill Stone today.

499
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,213
你是在烦那件事吗？ 我没在烦
- That's what's bothering you? - Nothing's bothering me.

500
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,294
你为什么要解雇他？
Why did you fire him?

501
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,273
他不够负责 什么是负责？
- He's not accountable. - What's accountable?

502
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:52,970
是不是像人吃人？ 不是
- Isn't it like people who eat people? - No.

503
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,858
那是食人族，甜心
That's a cannibal, honey.

504
00:59:57,549 --> 01:00:00,568
总之，我再也信不过他了
Anyway, I can't trust him anymore.

505
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:07,377
所以如果你碰到桃莉，你就会明白
So if you run into Dolly, you'll know.

506
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,681
怎么？ 没想到你这样!
- What? - I can't believe you!

507
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,372
我做了什么？
What did I do?

508
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,801
糟糕!
Shit!

509
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,485
糟糕!
Shit!

510
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:34,257
快点!
Come on!

511
01:02:55,112 --> 01:02:58,107
真对不起. 真的很对不起
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

512
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,103
甜心，你没事吧？
Honey, you okay?

513
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:05,469
你一定非常担心 住手，妈. 别人会看到
- You must have been so worried. - Stop, Mom. People can see.

514
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,671
嗨，我是保罗・马提尔 哔声后请留下您的讯息
Hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave a message after the beep.

515
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:34,254
妈？
Mom?

516
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:38,673
你应该上床睡觉了
You're supposed to be in bed.

517
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:42,509
你在哭，妈 哦，甜心
- You're crying, Mom. - Oh, honey.

518
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:47,931
妈咪只是有点难过而已 来吧，我带你回房睡觉
Mommy's just a little sad, that's all. Come on, I'll take you bed.

519
01:03:48,185 --> 01:03:50,016
我带你去睡觉
Let's get you into bed.

520
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:53,808
别难过了，妈 爸明天就回家了
Don't be sad, Mom. Dad will be home tomorrow.

521
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:05,569
他叫保罗・马提尔
His name is Paul Martel.

522
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:13,614
住在梅瑟街433号，3号公寓
He lives at 433 Mercer Street, Apartment 3.

523
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:17,410
她白天时候去找他
She sees him during the day.

524
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,035
通常都在午餐时间前后
Usually goes around lunchtime.

525
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:24,206
约逗留个两、三小时
Stays about two hours, maybe three.

526
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:39,217
他们去电影院？
They go to the movies?

527
01:04:39,428 --> 01:04:43,053
那天有去 除此之外，还去了他家
They did that day. Otherwise, they're in his place.

528
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:57,900
快点接!
Pick up.

529
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,042
嘿，小姐!
Hey, lady!

530
01:06:23,002 --> 01:06:24,250
你钥匙忘了给
Forgot your keys.

531
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,533
等等!
Wait!

532
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:11,492
她是谁？ 她是谁？
Who is she? Who is she?

533
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:14,662
冷静点! 你在干什么？
Calm down! What are you doing?

534
01:07:18,582 --> 01:07:21,289
还有几个？ 5个、10个？
How many are there? Five, ten?

535
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:26,751
我算什么，星期一那一个？ 我弄错日子了吗？
What am I, the Monday one? Did I get my day wrong?

536
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:30,505
她只是个朋友，好吗？ 只是朋友
She's just a friend, okay? Just a friend.

537
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:36,008
你这该死的骗子 我？ 我是骗子？

也许她只是想买点东西送我

这不是她买给你的 是我送她的

在他桌上找到你的名字和电话号码

678
01:35:01,538 --> 01:35:03,828
他做了什么坏事吗？ 不清楚
- Has he done something wrong? - We don't know.

679
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:06,787
他的家人报案说他失踪了
He's been reported missing by his family.

680
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,456
他老婆不知道他现在人在哪里

681
01:35:12,336 --> 01:35:14,709
我不知道他结过婚了

682
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:16,630
分居了

683
01:35:21,595 --> 01:35:23,676
你上回见到他是什么时候？
When did you see him last?

684
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,803
不记得了，很难说
I don't know, it's hard to say.

685
01:35:30,267 --> 01:35:31,766
他是个书商
He's a book dealer.

686
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:35,060
不太认识 我之前要跟他买书

买了吗？ 不，还没
- And did you? - No, not yet.

688
01:35:41,899 --> 01:35:44,773
发生什么事了吗？ 你认为他没事吧？
Has something happened? You think he's all right?

689
01:35:44,984 --> 01:35:47,650
一时还很难说
It's hard to say at this point.

690
01:35:47,862 --> 01:35:49,820
我们正在调查
We're working on it.

691
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:55,155
总之，谢谢. 谢谢你抽空回答 谢谢

I like these snow-glass things. My boy has some of these.

693
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:03,411
如果有他消息的话，麻烦通知我们 没问题
- If you hear from him, let us know. - Certainly.

694
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,348
爸! 警察今天来我们家
Dad! Cops came to our house today.

695
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,436
警察？ 他们来做什么？
Cops? What did they want?

696
01:36:42,232 --> 01:36:43,230
有人失踪了
Someone's missing.

697
01:36:43,735 --> 01:36:46,609
他们必须询问每个人，你知道的
And they have to check everyone, you know.

698
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,029
谁失踪了？
Who was it?

699
01:36:53,325 --> 01:36:55,450
甜心，坐好
Honey, sit up straight.

700
01:36:58,246 --> 01:37:01,456
谁失踪了？ 我想你不认识他
- Who was it? - I don't think you know him.

701
01:37:01,664 --> 01:37:03,706
是个卖书的
He sells books.

702
01:37:03,915 --> 01:37:05,831
我忘了在哪见过他
I forget where I met him.

703
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:09,168
他是个坏蛋吗，妈？
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

704
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:14,964
警察为什么要给你问话？
Why did they want to talk to you?

705
01:37:15,172 --> 01:37:18,256
我猜他有我的名字和电话号码
I guess he had my name and number.

706
01:37:19,635 --> 01:37:22,720
他为何会有你的电话号码？
Why would he have your number?

707
01:37:23,389 --> 01:37:25,636
我想是跟他买过书的关系
I think I bought a book from him.

708
01:37:38,022 --> 01:37:41,146
小心点. 慢慢来 嘿，查理!
- Be careful. Take it easy. - Hey, Charlie!

Oh, my darling. Oh, I wished you lived closer.

710
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:53,154
主啊，感谢您赐给我们食物 以及您的恩宠
Lord, bless this food to our use, and us to thy service.

711
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:58,243
提醒我们去帮助别人，阿门
And help us be ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.

712

721
01:39:28,935 --> 01:39:31,809
查理，我们上去走廊那边一下 我可以过去吗？
- Charlie, we're going up on the porch. - Can I come?

722
01:39:32,061 --> 01:39:36,353

No, sweetheart. Stay out here. Play with Poppy, we'll be right back.

嗯，他不会再失踪了 尸体上周末被人发现了
Well, he's not missing anymore. His body was discovered last weekend.

727
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,033
天啊，太可怕了
God, that's terrible.

728
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,202
哦，我的天啊

I'm giving it to Goodwill. Let someone else be gorgeous for a change.

775
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:27,433
估且不谈我们明亮的个性 我们该带什么过去？
What should we bring, aside from our sparkling personalities?

776

我们准备得如何了？ 很好

What do you think this place is worth, Ed?

785
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:13,551
不清楚. 如果卖了房子，要搬去哪？
I don't know. If you sell your house, where do you go?

786
01:45:13,763 --> 01:45:17,054
以那些价钱，大溪地 曼谷

Remember, Jeff, I asked you to take me to Fiji.

790
01:45:35,778 --> 01:45:40,486
然后再带我去夏威夷 每天悠闲地钓钓鱼....
And then you took me to Hawaii. We went fishing every single. . . .

791
01:46:03,549 --> 01:46:05,839
怎么了，爱德华？
What happened, Edward?

792
01:46:08,011 --> 01:46:10,009
你干了什么事？
What did you do?

793
01:46:11,387 --> 01:46:12,927
是你伤害他的吗？
Did you hurt him?

794
01:46:17,515 --> 01:46:18,931
爱德华？
Edward?

795
01:46:20,352 --> 01:46:22,267
是你伤害他的吗？
Did you hurt him?

796
01:46:24,396 --> 01:46:26,102
你做的，是不是？
You did, didn't you?

797
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:31,231
天啊，爱德华
Jesus, Edward.

798

800
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,780
不，你告诉我你做了什么
No, you tell me what you did.

801
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:46,075
你是如何一而再三地和他上床 还敢骗我!
How you fucked him, over and over and over. You lied to me!

802
01:46:46,287 --> 01:46:49,745
三番两次地 爱德华，拜托--
- Over and over and over. - Edward, please...

803
01:46:49,957 --> 01:46:51,871
不，你不用马上回答
No, you don't talk to me now.

804
01:46:52,415 --> 01:46:54,789
我尽心尽力地付出...
I gave everything. . .

805

...为了这个家

806
01:46:58,212 --> 01:46:59,377
费尽心血
Everything.

807
01:47:01,089 --> 01:47:03,336
你又做了什么？
And what did you do?

808
01:47:04,424 --> 01:47:07,799
你像是毫无要紧地将它丢弃一旁
You threw it all away, like it was nothing.

809
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:10,219
为什么？
