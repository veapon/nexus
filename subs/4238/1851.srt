1
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:44,673
In the first years of the 21 st century...

2
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:50,114
...a third World War broke out.

3
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:54,587
Those of us who survived knew

4
00:00:54,656 --> 00:01:01,084
mankind could never survive...

5
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,757
a fourth...

6
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:07,427
that our own volatile natures

7
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:11,768
could simply no longer be risked.

8
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:16,868
So we have created a new arm of the law...

9
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,882
...the Grammaton Cleric,

10
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,819
whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate

11
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:32,190
the true source of man's inhumanity to man.

12
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:38,664
His ability...

13
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,667
to feel.

14
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:42,895
Police!

15
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,919
You know what to do.

16
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,228
Get down!

17
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:04,910
We have an unknown number

18
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,420
barricaded in the southeast end of the compound.

19
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,923
Read that. Tetragrammaton team en route.

20
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:14,018
Cleric, lights out. Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,495
When the door's down, blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,361
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,559
Go.

24
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:12,912
Where is he?

25
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,147
Shut up.

26
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,190
Anybody get him? Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,691
Shut up!

28
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,250
Listen.

29
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:20,873
This is it.

30
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,109
Where?

31
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,676
There.

32
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,256
It's real.

33
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,957
Burn it.

34
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,475
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,637
for the evidentiary team to collect and log?

36
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,479
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:10,589
And I thought I'd take it down myself...

38
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,148
get it done properly.

39
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:20,857
How long, Preston, till all this is gone?

40
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,267
Till we've burned every last bit of it?

41
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,665
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,737
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,616
Libria...

44
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,953
I congratulate you.

45
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,959
At last...

46
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:50,794
peace reigns in the heart of man.

47
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,629
At last, war is but a word

48
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,966
whose meaning fades from our understanding.

49
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,302
At last...

50
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,538
we... are... whole.

51
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:15,887
Librians... there is a disease in the heart of man.

52
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,457
Its symptom is hate.

53
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,927
Its symptom... is anger.

54
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:29,095
Its symptom is rage.

55
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,107
Its symptom... is war.

56
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:41,172
The disease... is human emotion.

57
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:45,345
But, Libria... I congratulate you.

58
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,820
For there is a cure for this disease.

59
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,325
At the cost of the dizzying highs of human emotion,

60
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:55,522
we have suppressed its abysmal lows.

61
00:09:55,596 --> 00:10:01,125
And you as a society have embraced this cure.

62
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,469
Prozium.

63
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,308
Now we are at peace with ourselves,

64
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:11,812
and humankind is one.

65
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,813
War is gone.

66
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,509
Hate, a memory.

67
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,485
We are our own conscience now.

68
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:25,015
And it is this conscience that guides us to rate EC-10

69
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,288
for emotional content

70
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,525
all those things that might tempt us to feel again...

71
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,226
and destroy them.

72
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,293
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,239
Against all odds and your own natures...

74
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:45,678
you have survived.

75
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,891
Every time we come from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,462
it reminds why we do what we do.

77
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,666
It does?

78
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,573
I beg your pardon.

79
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:23,877
It does.

80
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,164
The following items have been rated EC-10...

81
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,633
condemned...

82
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,569
seven works of two-dimensional illustrated material,

83
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,233
seven discs of musical content,

84
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:50,334
20 interactive strategy computer programs.

85
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:53,346
Seven works of two-dimensional...

86
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,783
Thank you for coming, Cleric.

87
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:02,789
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:04,119
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,784
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,124
of the Third Conciliarly of the Tetragrammaton...

91
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,629
Father's voice.

92
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,358
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:16,165
I am told that you are very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:20,139
knowing almost instantly if someone is feeling.

95
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,971
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:24,773
Why, do you imagine, that is, Cleric?

97
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,337
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:31,550
Somehow...

99
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,110
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:37,716
to sense how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:41,660
to... put myself in their position.

102
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:46,958
If you had ceased your interval,

103
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,492
if you were a sense offender...

104
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,664
I suppose you could say that, sir.

105
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,072
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,837
Yes, sir... a boy and a girl.

107
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,879
The boy's in the monastery himself,

108
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,379
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,506
Good.

110
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:02,810
And the mother?

111
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,681
My spouse was arrested and incinerated

112
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,515
for sense offense four years ago, sir.

113
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,554
By yourself?

114
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:08,850
No, sir... by another.

115
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,082
How did you feel about that?

116
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,190
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,426
I don't... fully understand, sir.

118
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,429
How did you feel?

119
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,030
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,871
Really?

121
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,343
How is it that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,281
I...

123
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,689
I've asked myself that same question, sir.

124
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,282
I don't know.

125
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,194
A nearly unforgivable lapse, Cleric.

126
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:56,565
I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future.

127
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,035
Yes, sir.

128
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,042
Every time we come from the Nethers to the city,

129
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,810
it reminds why we do what we do.

130
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:10,942
It does?

131
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,612
Every time we come from the Nethers to the city,

132
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,954
it reminds why we do what we do.

133
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,049
It does?

134
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,096
It does.

135
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:30,333
Prosecutorial evidence for A.N.R. 136890.

136
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,996
I need it.

137
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,007
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,305
May not have showed up in the records yet.

139
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,007
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,513
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:43,015
and nothing is pending under that entry.

142
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:45,177
It was an item of evidence brought in personally

143
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,514
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:47,849
Check again.

145
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:52,222
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:55,319
You're mistaken. It was a book of some kind.

147
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,420
Cleric...

148
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,197
...there's nothing.

149
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,426
Thank you.

150
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,735
He's been passing through the gate into the Nether

151
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,209
every night for the last two weeks.

152
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,836
We assumed it was enforcement-related.

153
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,651
You always knew.

154
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:11,198
"But I, being poor...

155
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,604
have only my dreams."

156
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:18,008
"I have spread my dreams under your feet.

157
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,344
"Tread softly...

158
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,748
because you tread on my dreams."

159
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,853
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,018
I'll do what I can to see they go easy on you.

161
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:39,964
We both know... they never go easy.

162
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,228
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,270
No, you're not.

164
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,465
You don't even know the meaning.

165
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,168
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,143
for a feeling you've never felt.

167
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,913
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,076
It's gone.

169
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:01,383
Everything that makes us what we are... traded away.

170
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,616
There's no war.

171
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,356
No murder.

172
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,658
What is it you think we do?

173
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,561
No.

174
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:12,929
You've been with me.

175
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,367
You've seen how it can be... the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,530
A heavy cost.

177
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,104
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,025
Don't.

179
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,674
You and your partner were close?

180
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,848
I hope you're as pleased to be assigned me

181
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,755
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,653
I was told this would be a career-making advancement.

183
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:58,728
I'm like you, Cleric... intuitive.

184
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,100
Sometimes I know when a person's feeling

185
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,007
before they know it themselves.

186
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,513
Cleric...

187
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,319
I can only hope one day to be as...

188
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:24,387
uncompromising as you.

189
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,796
Good night.

190
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,595
The later 20th century

191
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,799
saw the fortuitous and simultaneous rise

192
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:38,971
of two synergistic political and psychological sciences.

193
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:43,142
The first, the revolutionary precept of the hate crime.

194
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,845
John?

195
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,909
Yes?

196
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,116
I saw Robbie Taylor crying today.

197
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,888
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:57,294
Do you think I should report him?

199
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,901
Unquestionably.

200
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,809
...a single inescapable fact...

201
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,907
that mankind united with infinitely greater purpose

202
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:19,611
in pursuit of war...

203
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:23,453
than he ever did in pursuit of peace.

204
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,793
"But I, being poor...

205
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,632
have only my dreams."

206
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:41,038
I have spread my dreams under your feet."

207
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,873
"Tread softly...

208
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:47,778
because you tread on my dreams."

209
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,820
Don't move! Don't move!

210
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,485
Comply! Comply!

211
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,495
- Stop! Stop where you are!       - Get down! Get down!

212
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,194
Don't shoot. This is a lawful entry.

213
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,760
We have a warrant for your wife's arrest.

214
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,669
She's charged with sense offense.

215
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,915
Hey!

216
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,821
Get her! Get her off him now!

217
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,323
Remember me.

218
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,865
Libria...

219
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,705
Awake.

220
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:28,976
Awaken to triumph again in the face of yet another day,

221
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,610
another step in our unified march

222
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,281
into the unwavering purpose...

223
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,989
...move ahead together

224
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:46,658
into the certainty of our collective destiny.

225
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,052
What are you doing?

226
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,656
I said, what are you doing?

227
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:18,186
I accidently dropped my...

228
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,823
morning interval.

229
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,892
I took it out before I brushed my teeth.

230
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,471
I never take it out before I brush my teeth.

231
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,442
Then you'll go by Equilibrium, log the loss,

232
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,842
and get a replacement.

233
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,846
Yes.

234
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,678
Of course.

235
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:59,635
Your new partner called.

236
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,072
He says he'll pick you up at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

237
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:03,473
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,876
I took the liberty of telling him

239
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,040
you would be at Equilibrium, replacing your dose.

240
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,641
No, of course not.

241
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,652
That was the right thing to do.

242
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,023
Stop that.

243
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,897
Due to terrorist activity,

244
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,403
this site is temporarily closed.

245
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:36,909
Proceed to the Equilibrium Center in Sector 8A.

246
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,375
Due to terrorist activity,

247
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,745
this site is temporarily closed.

248
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,250
This site is temporarily closed.

249
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,779
Proceed to the Equilibrium Center in Sector 8A.

250
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,558
More than punctual, Cleric.

251
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,790
Hop in.

252
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,539
How were the lines?

253
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:15,047
I'm surprised you were able to get your interval

254
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:16,776
and get out so quickly.

255
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,076
No, they're... they're fine today.

256
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:27,288
Maybe I'll drop by later, get my interval adjusted.

257
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,057
You expecting Resistance?

258
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:34,328
That's something you'll find about me, Cleric.

259
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:38,428
I'm a wary person, cautious by nature.

260
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:42,105
Always expecting the worst.

261
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,841
You can't do this. You cannot do this.

262
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,972
Tetragrammaton. There's nothing we can't do.

263
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,184
How long have you been off the dose?

264
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,344
Look at you.

265
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,146
Look at you!

266
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,323
Look at you.

267
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,093
The mirror's frame is illegal. Destroy it.

268
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:20,811
We have suppression. We're making entry.

269
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,314
Standard deployment.

270
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:25,180
Collecting catalog. Illegal articles.

271
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,028
You're gonna burn it, aren't you?

272
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:15,757
Eventually.

273
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,498
However, you couldn't have accumulated all this

274
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:19,834
by yourself.

275
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,898
It'll all be sorted and examined.

276
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,104
We'll discover who your confederates are.

277
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:28,772
Gun!

278
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,194
We need her.

279
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:15,383
What's your name?

280
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,659
O'Brien, Mary.

281
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:21,963
Well, Mary...

282
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,434
you can either wait

283
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:27,599
and tell the technicians at the Palace of Justice...

284
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:30,438
or you can tell me now.

285
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,501
Who are your friends?

286
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,741
I'm wondering if you have any idea at all

287
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,845
what that word means... "friend."

288
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,386
There's nothing you don't feel?

289
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,586
How about guilt?

290
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,627
Let me ask you something.

291
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,140
Why are you alive?

292
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:11,873
I'm alive...

293
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,554
I live...

294
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,518
...to safeguard the continuity of this great society.

295
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,189
To serve Libria.

296
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,698
It's circular.

297
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,360
You exist to continue your existence.

298
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,926
What's the point?

299
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,869
What's the point of your existence?

300
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,465
To feel.

301
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:39,706
'Cause you've never done it, you can never know it.

302
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,543
But it's as vital as breath.

303
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,244
And without it... without love,

304
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:48,810
without anger, without sorrow...

305
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,258
breath is just a clock ticking.

306
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:00,295
Then I have no choice but to remand you

307
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,597
to the Palace of Justice for processing.

308
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,000
Processing.

309
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,336
You mean execution, don't you?

310
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:15,408
Processing.

311
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,290
The Gun Katas.

312
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:28,293
Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights,

313
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,261
the Cleric has determined

314
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,527
that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle

315
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,262
is a statistically predictable element.

316
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,772
The Gun Kata treats the gun as a total weapon,

317
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,103
each fluid position representing

318
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,201
a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage

319
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,143
on the maximum number of opponents

320
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,942
while keeping the defender clear

321
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,279
of the statistically traditional trajectories

322
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,012
of return fire.

323
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,121
By the rote mastery of this art,

324
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,420
your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120%/¡£.

325
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:03,053
The difference of a 63%/¡£ increase to lethal proficiency

326
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,495
makes the master of the Gun Katas

327
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:09,467
an adversary not to be taken lightly.

328
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,649
[Echoing] Without love...

329
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:06,283
breath is just a clock... ticking.

330
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,553
Prozium... the great nepenthe.

331
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:53,826
Opiate of our masses.

332
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,494
Glue of our great society.

333
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,662
Salve and salvation,

334
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:02,674
it has delivered us from pathos, from sorrow,

335
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:06,803
the deepest chasms of melancholy and hate.

336
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,405
With it, we anesthetize grief,

337
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:13,578
annihilate jealousy, obliterate rage.

338
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:18,090
That those sister impulses towards joy, love, and elation

339
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,718
are anesthetized in stride,

340
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,091
we accept as fair sacrifice.

341
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:29,124
For we embrace Prozium in its unifying fullness

342
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:33,434
and all that it has done to make us great.

343
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,858
Good morning, Cleric.

344
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:29,861
Good morning.

345
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:33,990
...intrinsically, humans, as creatures of the Earth

346
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:40,302
were drawn inherently always back to one thing... war.

347
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:43,672
And thus we seek to correct not the symptom

348
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:46,303
but the disease itself.

349
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,837
We have sought to shrug off individuality,

350
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:52,544
replacing it with conformity.

351
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,520
Replacing it...

352
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,318
with sameness...

353
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,882
with unity,

354
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,522
allowing each man, woman, and child

355
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,429
in this great society

356
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,061
to lead identical lives.

357
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:16,097
The concept of identical environment construction

358
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:19,440
allows each of us to head confidently into each moment

359
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,241
with all the secure knowledge

360
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:24,147
it has been lived before.

361
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,626
What are you doing?

362
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,405
I'm rearranging my desk.

363
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,134
You didn't like the way it was before?

364
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,335
I had no feelings about it.

365
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,607
I'm merely attempting to optimize.

366
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,518
Sense offenders holed up in the Nether.

367
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,635
We estimate... we estimate 50 men, sir.

368
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:22,300
Intelligence tells us they're all fully armed.

369
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:26,004
This is the group that bombed the Prozium factories.

370
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,603
You clean, we'll sweep.

371
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,204
Yes, sir.

372
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:34,083
Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:35,085
Go!

374
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:36,746
Aah!

375
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:39,223
Take it! Take the landings!

376
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,415
- Aah!       - Aah!

377
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:55,032
- Cover me. I'm going in.       - Aaaaaaaah!

378
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:00,401
Nice grab, Cleric.

379
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:33,998
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

380
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:33,845
Cleric...

381
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:36,377
Why didn't you leave that

382
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:39,219
for the evidentiary team to collect and log?

383
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:46,797
They miss things sometimes.

384
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:49,994
I'll take it in myself...

385
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:52,867
make sure it gets done properly.

386
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:57,966
You know, Preston...

387
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,873
If we keep burning all this contraband,

388
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,177
eventually there won't be anything left to burn.

389
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,050
What'll there be for men like us?

390
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,815
Sir!

391
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,447
We got something out back.

392
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,366
We're gonna need two more men on this.

393
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,140
These animals were defended by women and children.

394
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,507
We put them down easily.

395
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:36,207
This isn't the first time we've seen this.

396
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,546
Why do they keep these animals?

397
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,744
What, do they... do they eat them?

398
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,882
What do you want me to do, sir?

399
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,254
Exterminate them, of course.

400
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:47,758
All right. Let's do it.

401
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:49,590
No.

402
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:50,856
What's wrong, Cleric?

403
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,628
Nothing.

404
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,138
Hey...

405
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:12,445
Grab it.

406
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:13,610
Grab it!

407
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,555
Sir... toss it back in.

408
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:25,460
I'll finish it off.

409
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,393
Give it to me, sir.

410
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,404
Give it to him, Cleric. He'll finish it.

411
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:48,648
Wait!

412
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:54,217
It seems to me that...

413
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:57,956
at least some of these animals ought to be tested for disease.

414
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,055
If there's an epidemic in the Nether,

415
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,623
it's best we know about it.

416
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:09,370
I don't quite follow your logic, Cleric.

417
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:10,670
They were Resistance.

418
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:12,973
They could have led us to the Underground.

419
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,706
But instead of apprehension and interrogation,

420
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,747
they were slaughtered.

421
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:18,978
Yes, but, Cleric, given the circumstances,

422
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:20,643
the Father has decreed

423
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,120
that there will be no more "process" for sense offenders.

424
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,590
They are either to be shot on sight

425
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,149
or incinerated without a trial.

426
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:29,353
But it's counter to law.

427
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:31,259
You're a member of the Council. If...

428
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,195
It is not the will of the Council,

429
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:36,029
it is the will of Father... and he is law.

430
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,161
Sir...

431
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,174
without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem...

432
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:46,234
what we have worked so hard to eradicate?

433
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:48,439
You must understand, Preston,

434
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:52,109
that while you... and even I... may not always agree with it,

435
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:54,880
it is not the message that is important,

436
00:45:54,954 --> 00:45:58,185
it is our obedience to it.

437
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:00,384
Father's will.

438
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:03,053
Call it faith.

439
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,153
You have it, I assume?

440
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,099
Yes.

441
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:14,163
I have it.

442
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,798
Good.

443
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:40,495
Confiscated evidence X23-T45...

444
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,932
Mary O'Brien.

445
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:47,190
Cleric John Preston passing into the Nether...

446
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,427
enforcement-related.

447
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:53,666
Thank you, sir.

448
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:28,232
I don't know what else to do with you.

449
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,338
Go on.

450
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,400
Go on.

451
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:37,845
Go!

452
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:14,478
Fine.

453
00:49:14,553 --> 00:49:16,578
But you're going back in the trunk.

454
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:31,960
Okay.

455
00:49:35,274 --> 00:49:36,536
Here.

456
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,785
Step away from the vehicle!

457
00:49:49,855 --> 00:49:52,085
Step away from the vehicle!

458
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,454
This is your last warning!

459
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:56,358
Step away from the vehicle!

460
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:58,623
Identification.

461
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:00,130
I'm a Cleric.

462
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,394
I'm here on official business.

463
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:03,230
Identification!

464
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:05,628
It's in my coat.

465
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:07,934
Where's the coat? Where is it?!

466
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,267
I don't have it.

467
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:14,073
Unidentified individuals are subject to summary destruction.

468
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:15,807
You're making a very big mistake.

469
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:16,939
I'm a Grammaton Cleric, first class.

470
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:18,038
We're gonna search your vehicle.

471
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:20,381
No, you're not. There's nothing in it.

472
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:21,942
Search it!

473
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,694
- Clear, sir.       - Keys to the trunk.

474
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,024
I'm trying to tell you.

475
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,156
I have a predawn combustion to witness.

476
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:35,666
I'm not...

477
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:37,702
Captain, this is a waste of my time.

478
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:39,100
My name is John Preston.

479
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:41,503
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric of the Tetragramm...

480
00:50:41,573 --> 00:50:43,165
Wait.

481
00:50:46,745 --> 00:50:47,803
Stand off.

482
00:50:50,649 --> 00:50:53,049
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you, sir.

483
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,584
That's okay. Just doing your job.

484
00:50:57,656 --> 00:50:58,645
Thank you.

485
00:50:59,925 --> 00:51:01,586
We'll escort you back to the gate.

486
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,592
Thanks.

487
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,029
Animals.

488
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,961
Nether's full of them.

489
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:15,906
Sounds like it came from your trunk.

490
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:17,908
Impossible.

491
00:51:17,976 --> 00:51:19,910
Just give me my keys.

492
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:21,104
I'll be on my way.

493
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,047
Captain...

494
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,248
I'm asking you one last time...

495
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,120
don't do this.

496
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,922
Down on your knees!

497
00:51:35,994 --> 00:51:37,586
- Down on your knees!       - Down on your knees!

498
00:51:37,663 --> 00:51:38,857
Drop down!

499
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:41,195
On the ground! Comply!

500
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,858
Do it!

501
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:44,694
No.

502
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,101
Fuck!

503
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:51,874
What?

504
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:54,242
Aw, shit! Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him!

505
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:04,749
Aah!

506
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:25,620
Always practicing, Cleric.

507
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:28,359
I guess that's why you're the best.

508
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,062
Maybe I'm just better.

509
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:35,937
Something on your mind?

510
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,941
Why do you ask?

511
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:41,273
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

512
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,439
It's my job to know what you're thinking.

513
00:54:54,826 --> 00:54:57,488
So, then... what am I thinking?

514
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,527
About the murders in the Nether last night...

515
00:55:11,877 --> 00:55:13,640
And if they know who did it.

516
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:20,475
Am I close?

517
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:25,846
So, tell me... do they know?

518
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:36,331
There are theories.

519
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:38,699
I have one or two of my own, but at the moment...

520
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,965
[Straining] They're premature!

521
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:47,109
I'm glad it happened.

522
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:52,541
Why?

523
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:54,676
Because now Father and the Council

524
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:58,280
have decreed an acceleration in the crackdown on offenders.

525
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,551
Whoever did it...

526
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,992
all they accomplished was a quicker end to the Resistance.

527
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:15,201
It's gonna be a massacre, Cleric.

528
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:35,154
I came to tell you... there's a raid in the Nether...

529
00:56:35,227 --> 00:56:38,253
Sector 7.

530
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:41,891
So get ready.

531
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:24,606
That door behind you...

532
00:57:26,678 --> 00:57:28,043
Go.

533
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:31,046
Go, damn you!

534
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,114
Get out of here, God damn it! If you don't, you're dead!

535
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:39,019
Don't do it. He'll shoot us in the back.

536
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,058
If I was gonna shoot you, I'd shoot you in the face.

537
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:42,491
Now go.

538
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,498
Damn you! Follow me.

539
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:53,265
Now! Let's go!

540
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:03,871
There will be no detention.

541
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:07,749
Repeat... no detention for any purpose.

542
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:11,619
All prisoners and apprehendees are to be put down.

543
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,323
Look out!

544
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:25,762
Aah!

545
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:29,305
Aaaah!

546
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:36,110
Cleric, what's happening? We heard gunshots.

547
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:38,671
Go!

548
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,980
What are you doing? Cleric!

549
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:42,314
They're Resistance fighters.

550
00:58:43,355 --> 00:58:44,344
Cleric!

551
00:58:47,225 --> 00:58:48,351
He's a sense offender!

552
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,835
Cover all quadrants!

553
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:35,236
Secure the perimeter!

554
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:47,774
What is this?

555
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,717
What are you doing?!

556
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:53,349
Nicely done, Cleric.

557
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:55,484
You drive them into the trap...

558
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:58,689
I close it.

559
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:09,863
The very definition of... teamwork.

560
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,465
Don't you think?

561
01:00:13,945 --> 01:00:17,073
Why don't you take the honors of the execution, Cleric?

562
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,982
These people should be taken for clinical interrogation.

563
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:25,215
Cleric...

564
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,588
Father's rulings are quite clear.

565
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:30,423
Offenders are to be shot on sight.

566
01:00:30,495 --> 01:00:32,053
They have valuable information.

567
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,154
Cleric...

568
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:34,721
They can be put to much better use.

569
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,766
Cleric.

570
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:40,902
If your weapon's low, please, use mine.

571
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:30,815
No.

572
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,616
I think, in the end...

573
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,753
it'll be better if you have it.

574
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:01,974
Captain.

575
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:04,044
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

576
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:09,555
Ready...

577
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:19,370
Aim...

578
01:02:26,144 --> 01:02:27,941
Fire!

579
01:02:34,652 --> 01:02:36,449
Sir?

580
01:02:36,521 --> 01:02:38,352
Yes, Cleric?

581
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:41,221
You asked me to become Father's instrument

582
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:43,988
against the Resistance.

583
01:02:44,062 --> 01:02:45,996
I'm ready.

584
01:02:46,064 --> 01:02:47,998
Today.

585
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:49,863
I wish to show my faith.

586
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,835
I wish, with your permission,

587
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:56,806
to locate the Underground once and for all.

588
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,365
To destroy it.

589
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:02,704
To destroy it.

590
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,873
Good. Do it.

591
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:17,284
I'm so...

592
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:19,125
so very sorry.

593
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:34,074
These are the possessions he had on him at the time of death.

594
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:35,544
The illegal ones will be burned with him.

595
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:36,910
Good.

596
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:19,820
Errol Partridge.

597
01:04:23,795 --> 01:04:26,093
The name supposed to mean something to me?

598
01:04:26,164 --> 01:04:28,928
He was a Grammaton Cleric, first class. You knew him.

599
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,265
News bulletin... I'm a sense offender.

600
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:34,498
I don't hang around much with the Cleric.

601
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,270
I want to know about him.

602
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:47,813
Well...

603
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,979
I suggest you go ask him.

604
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,059
But I understand that he's dead...

605
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:58,755
killed by your friends at the Tetragrammaton.

606
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:01,526
Not by my friends.

607
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,260
By me.

608
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,634
Aaah!

609
01:05:47,845 --> 01:05:49,335
You were lovers.

610
01:06:07,465 --> 01:06:10,025
The Underground is our foe,

611
01:06:10,101 --> 01:06:12,661
and greater than even the threat

612
01:06:12,737 --> 01:06:16,605
of those who have forsaken their Prozium for emotion

613
01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:21,771
is the threat of those selfsame individuals united.

614
01:06:21,846 --> 01:06:24,610
They are the secret organization...

615
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:33,123
And thus, it is in the writing of the Father

616
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:34,954
that we find our greatest...

617
01:06:36,828 --> 01:06:38,693
Good afternoon, sir.

618
01:06:38,763 --> 01:06:41,664
What will it be for you?

619
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:43,461
The latest copy of the inserts?

620
01:06:43,534 --> 01:06:45,695
Revised edition of the manifesto?

621
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,794
Errol Partridge.

622
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:49,431
What do you know about him?

623
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:50,838
I beg your pardon?

624
01:06:50,908 --> 01:06:52,773
Everyone out. Now.

625
01:07:06,624 --> 01:07:08,558
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

626
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:11,254
Errol Partridge... what do you know about him?

627
01:07:11,329 --> 01:07:14,196
I'm sure this must be some mis...

628
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:16,529
- You're an offender.       - I'm not.

629
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:19,468
No? Then why are you so scared of me?

630
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:22,597
Now, you will tell me everything you know about Errol Partridge,

631
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:24,607
or I will have a wagon come to take you

632
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:27,508
to the Hall of Destruction for summary combustion.

633
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:29,705
[Breathing heavily] L-I really don't know...

634
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,872
Speak!

635
01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:34,543
He... he'd come in here with a fellow named Jurgen.

636
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:35,881
Why?

637
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:39,047
That's... that's all I know. I swear.

638
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,112
Jurgen!

639
01:08:00,845 --> 01:08:02,642
Interesting.

640
01:08:04,482 --> 01:08:05,847
- Ugh-ow!       - Ugh!

641
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:43,745
We've been watching you, Preston.

642
01:08:49,961 --> 01:08:51,258
You're Jurgen.

643
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,593
You're feeling.

644
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:12,074
Do you know why you came?

645
01:09:34,772 --> 01:09:37,366
Welcome to the Underground.

646
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:49,376
Polygraph.

647
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:53,389
It detects fluctuations of human emotion.

648
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:55,618
We have to be sure.

649
01:10:00,765 --> 01:10:02,255
Mary.

650
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:10,934
You're carrying in your left pocket

651
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:13,943
a red ribbon sprayed with her scent.

652
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,078
You breathe it in sometimes

653
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:21,050
when you think there's no one to see.

654
01:10:21,118 --> 01:10:25,054
But what you feel...

655
01:10:25,122 --> 01:10:27,647
what you feel could only be satisfied

656
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:30,353
by falling yourself into her.

657
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,265
She's scheduled for combustion...

658
01:10:39,337 --> 01:10:41,498
tomorrow.

659
01:10:47,378 --> 01:10:49,505
I know.

660
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:53,213
You know, I was like you.

661
01:10:53,284 --> 01:10:57,243
But the first thing you learn about emotion

662
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,687
is that it has its price...

663
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,658
a complete paradox.

664
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:05,594
But without restraint...

665
01:11:05,663 --> 01:11:07,893
without control...

666
01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:09,899
emotion is chaos.

667
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:12,026
But how is that diff...

668
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:15,595
The difference being is that when we want to feel,

669
01:11:15,673 --> 01:11:17,800
we can.

670
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:21,470
It's just that...

671
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:25,413
some of us...

672
01:11:25,483 --> 01:11:27,747
some of us have to forgo that luxury

673
01:11:27,818 --> 01:11:30,946
so that the rest can have it.

674
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,080
Some very few of us

675
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:37,093
have to force ourselves not to feel.

676
01:11:38,863 --> 01:11:40,023
Like me.

677
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,867
Like you.

678
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:50,873
What can I do?

679
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,570
You can kill Father.

680
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,880
Cleric John Preston...

681
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:35,680
You are to come with us immediately.

682
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:46,957
Cleric Preston.

683
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:48,191
Sir.

684
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:54,231
I've heard the most disturbing rumor.

685
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:55,602
Rumor, sir?

686
01:12:55,673 --> 01:12:56,640
Yes.

687
01:12:56,707 --> 01:12:59,005
A rumor maintaining that one of us,

688
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:00,475
one of the Cleric,

689
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:04,640
has secretly taken it upon himself to cease his dose,

690
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,548
that one of our elite number

691
01:13:07,618 --> 01:13:10,815
is actually feeling.

692
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,822
Feeling, sir?

693
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:16,554
Are you playing with me, Cleric?!

694
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:23,161
No, sir.

695
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:31,931
This person, I'm told,

696
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:35,706
is actually attempting to contact the Resistance.

697
01:13:37,748 --> 01:13:41,240
Now tell me, if you'll be so kind,

698
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:43,183
how exactly...

699
01:13:43,254 --> 01:13:46,417
have you been making use of your time of late?

700
01:13:52,296 --> 01:13:55,527
Attempting to contact the Resistance, sir.

701
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,104
Attempting?

702
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:07,968
How is it that you intend to expose this traitor

703
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:11,071
if all you do is attempt?

704
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,148
You're...

705
01:14:18,222 --> 01:14:20,053
absolutely...

706
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:22,319
100%/¡£ right, sir.

707
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,857
Of course I am.

708
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:31,701
The Cleric is the final line of defense.

709
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:34,067
If the Resistance compromises it,

710
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,572
we are doomed.

711
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,406
Father is doomed.

712
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:43,105
I will redouble my efforts, sir,

713
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,977
to locate the Resistance,

714
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:46,539
to find this traitor,

715
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:49,917
and bring them all to the Council's fair justice.

716
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:55,317
Do it.

717
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:40,898
What are you doing?

718
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:45,933
What are you doing?

719
01:15:48,846 --> 01:15:50,336
I, uh...

720
01:15:55,252 --> 01:15:58,221
I was checking to make sure you've been...

721
01:15:58,288 --> 01:15:59,949
taking your interval.

722
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,753
And are you satisfied?

723
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,456
Yes, I am.

724
01:16:10,768 --> 01:16:12,201
Good night, Dad.

725
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:15,999
I don't understand.

726
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:18,701
My execution's set.

727
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:21,210
Why are you here?

728
01:16:40,364 --> 01:16:41,854
Aren't you gonna dose?

729
01:16:55,746 --> 01:16:57,714
My God.

730
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,708
What...

731
01:17:03,754 --> 01:17:05,915
What'll you do?

732
01:17:07,524 --> 01:17:09,151
I don't know.

733
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:45,089
50 sweepers, maybe more.

734
01:17:45,162 --> 01:17:47,596
What about an audience? Can you arrange to meet with him?

735
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,655
Father's never given a single audience since the upheaval.

736
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,291
The danger of assassination is too great.

737
01:17:51,368 --> 01:17:53,598
They trained you your whole life to fight these kind of odds.

738
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,331
Even if I could...

739
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:57,168
even if I could make it through,

740
01:17:57,241 --> 01:18:00,369
what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything,

741
01:18:00,444 --> 01:18:02,002
that anything would be different?

742
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:04,877
We have a network that's larger than you could ever imagine.

743
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:06,848
Instant word comes that Father is dead,

744
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:08,350
that the Council is leaderless.

745
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:10,579
Bombs that have already been planted will be set off

746
01:18:10,654 --> 01:18:12,918
at Prozium clinics and factories around Libria.

747
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:15,322
If we can succeed in disrupting the supply

748
01:18:15,392 --> 01:18:18,054
for even one day... one day...

749
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:20,688
our cause will be won by human nature itself.

750
01:18:20,764 --> 01:18:23,790
What about war, the everyday cruelties that are all gone now?

751
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:25,892
Replaced by the touch of Grammaton.

752
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,765
Will you do it?

753
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,741
Yes.

754
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:44,647
Can you?

755
01:18:48,358 --> 01:18:50,053
I don't know.

756
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:01,932
Don't...

757
01:19:03,774 --> 01:19:05,264
Seeing her one last time

758
01:19:05,309 --> 01:19:08,403
will only make it harder to do what you have to do.

759
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,474
...designed especially to deal with it.

760
01:19:45,549 --> 01:19:47,141
The Cleric was implemented

761
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:49,549
and sent out to search and destroy

762
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,110
such objects that remained

763
01:19:51,188 --> 01:19:54,123
and, if necessary, those who attempted to...

764
01:19:54,191 --> 01:19:55,590
File footage.

765
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:59,288
The Council...

766
01:19:59,363 --> 01:20:01,888
Viviana Preston.

767
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:04,024
Sentence and incineration.

768
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:07,761
Auditory.

769
01:20:07,838 --> 01:20:09,203
Viviana Preston,

770
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:11,673
for ceasing your interval, for the crime of feeling,

771
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:12,868
you stand condemned

772
01:20:12,943 --> 01:20:15,173
to suffer annihilation in the city furnaces.

773
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:18,681
You will be taken there immediately, and you will burn.

774
01:20:35,098 --> 01:20:37,623
The Cleric was implemented

775
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:39,498
and sent out to search and destroy

776
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,093
such objects that remained

777
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:45,267
and, if necessary, those who attempted to...

778
01:20:45,342 --> 01:20:47,310
The Council...

779
01:21:28,018 --> 01:21:29,952
The incineration... has it gone through?!

780
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,783
It's going through now.

781
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:33,379
Hey!

782
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,212
Machine turbines priming.

783
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:05,879
Machine turbines priming.

784
01:22:05,956 --> 01:22:08,015
Tetragrammaton... I need to speak to this woman!

785
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,718
You're too late, sir. The time lock is engaged.

786
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:11,021
If we force the door now,

787
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,584
the turbines will explode at street level.

788
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:16,120
...personnel, clear the area immediately.

789
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:20,602
All unauthorized personnel, clear the area immediately.

790
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,764
Turbines primed.

791
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,536
Fire in 10 seconds...

792
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,373
9 seconds...

793
01:22:28,445 --> 01:22:29,810
8 seconds...

794
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,177
7 seconds...

795
01:22:31,248 --> 01:22:33,512
6 seconds...

796
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,608
5 seconds...

797
01:22:35,685 --> 01:22:36,811
4 seconds...

798
01:22:36,887 --> 01:22:38,514
3 seconds...

799
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:41,113
2 seconds...

800
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:44,388
Turbines... fire.

801
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:38,411
Cleric John Preston...

802
01:23:44,054 --> 01:23:46,045
You are under arrest.

803
01:23:47,724 --> 01:23:49,555
This man...

804
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:51,890
this senior Cleric...

805
01:23:51,962 --> 01:23:53,862
has ceased the dose.

806
01:23:54,931 --> 01:23:57,491
He is feeling!

807
01:23:57,567 --> 01:24:01,469
He is the worm that has been eating at the core

808
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:04,371
of our great society!

809
01:24:04,441 --> 01:24:06,102
And I...

810
01:24:06,176 --> 01:24:09,111
I have brought him for your justice.

811
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:10,874
Ugh!

812
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:17,682
I told you I'd make my career with you, Preston.

813
01:24:18,755 --> 01:24:20,245
Vice-Council...

814
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,520
This man is guilty

815
01:24:22,592 --> 01:24:24,389
of consorting with sense offenders,

816
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:27,726
of having relations with a female,

817
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:31,062
of sense crime itself.

818
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:33,466
Dispatch a search team to the Cleric's quarters

819
01:24:33,537 --> 01:24:34,561
to search for unused...

820
01:24:34,638 --> 01:24:35,900
Uh, that won't be necessary, sir.

821
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:37,735
If you'll run the trace record on his side arm,

822
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:40,002
you will find that it was he

823
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:42,909
who was with the sweeper team when they were murdered.

824
01:24:48,518 --> 01:24:49,883
Cleric...

825
01:24:49,953 --> 01:24:52,251
I assume you have something to say to me.

826
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:56,851
I know...

827
01:24:56,927 --> 01:24:58,417
it's hard to believe...

828
01:25:00,997 --> 01:25:03,966
...that a Cleric of the Tetragrammaton

829
01:25:04,034 --> 01:25:07,094
could turn his back on everything he's been taught,

830
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,661
would become associated with the Resistance,

831
01:25:09,706 --> 01:25:13,972
even becoming a champion in its Underground.

832
01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:16,035
But it's true.

833
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:24,453
I promised that I would bring you that man.

834
01:25:24,521 --> 01:25:25,579
And I have.

835
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,619
- Cleric Brandt...       - Sir?

836
01:25:30,694 --> 01:25:33,595
The trace shows that it was your gun

837
01:25:33,663 --> 01:25:36,291
in the Nether with the sweepers.

838
01:25:36,366 --> 01:25:37,890
That's impossible.

839
01:25:42,405 --> 01:25:45,397
This is wrong.

840
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:48,239
I think, in the end...

841
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:51,246
it'll be better if you have it.

842
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:53,043
He switched them.

843
01:25:54,017 --> 01:25:55,848
He switched them.

844
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:57,614
See, I have his gun now.

845
01:25:57,687 --> 01:26:00,451
Of course you do. You took it when you arrested me.

846
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:01,455
What?

847
01:26:01,524 --> 01:26:03,754
Take him to the Hall of Destruction

848
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:06,091
for summary judgment and combustion.

849
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,596
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! I can explain this.

850
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:11,793
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

851
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:14,268
He is the one who's feeling!

852
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:15,895
This is a mistake!

853
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:19,805
Of course...

854
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:22,777
since a complaint has been lodged,

855
01:26:22,846 --> 01:26:25,747
law and the letter is that I allow a team

856
01:26:25,815 --> 01:26:28,249
to carry out the search of your premises.

857
01:26:28,318 --> 01:26:30,445
Do you think that's entirely necessary, Cleric,

858
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,513
or am I being too... exacting?

859
01:26:34,591 --> 01:26:36,957
As you say, sir,

860
01:26:37,027 --> 01:26:38,961
it's the law and the letter.

861
01:26:39,029 --> 01:26:42,021
And it doesn't disturb you in the least

862
01:26:42,098 --> 01:26:44,464
that your colleague is going to his end?

863
01:26:44,534 --> 01:26:46,968
The only thing that disturbs me, sir,

864
01:26:47,037 --> 01:26:49,733
is that I am Father's instrument against the Underground,

865
01:26:49,806 --> 01:26:54,971
and yet... I've never had the honor of meeting him.

866
01:26:55,045 --> 01:26:56,945
Hmm.

867
01:26:57,047 --> 01:26:58,708
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

868
01:26:58,782 --> 01:27:01,876
that Father never grants an audience to anyone.

869
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:04,283
Even to the man who brings him the Resistance?

870
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:18,427
Sorry, sir. Just a formality.

871
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,628
The search team will be up momentarily.

872
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:23,298
Excellent. I have nothing to hide.

873
01:27:43,393 --> 01:27:45,588
The search teams are already inside, sir.

874
01:27:45,662 --> 01:27:46,959
Excellent.

875
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:10,115
Looking for something?

876
01:28:14,891 --> 01:28:16,654
If I were you...

877
01:28:16,726 --> 01:28:21,789
I'd be more careful in the future.

878
01:28:26,903 --> 01:28:28,268
How long?

879
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:30,602
Since Mom.

880
01:28:33,576 --> 01:28:34,668
And Lisa?

881
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:36,006
Of course.

882
01:28:40,784 --> 01:28:42,445
How did you know?

883
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:45,044
You forget...

884
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:47,521
it's my job to know what you're thinking.

885
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,194
Then you know what I'm gonna do now.

886
01:28:55,265 --> 01:28:55,398
You have a message for the Vice-Council?

887
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:58,765
You have a message for the Vice-Council?

888
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,700
It's done.

889
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:04,171
I've located the Resistance.

890
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,572
Come now.

891
01:29:06,643 --> 01:29:08,634
You'll have them all.

892
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:34,094
Do not address Father unless first addressed by him.

893
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,432
Avoid eye contact.

894
01:29:35,505 --> 01:29:38,736
If you should break his personal security zone,

895
01:29:38,808 --> 01:29:41,333
you will be immediately put down by snipers.

896
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,072
Is that understood?

897
01:29:43,146 --> 01:29:46,274
You'll be required to surrender your firearm, of course,

898
01:29:46,349 --> 01:29:48,283
and then there's the test.

899
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:49,716
Test?

900
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,154
Yes.

901
01:29:53,223 --> 01:29:56,249
You didn't imagine we would risk exposing Father

902
01:29:56,326 --> 01:29:58,760
to even such a dedicated servant as yourself

903
01:29:58,828 --> 01:30:02,127
without first having tested you, did you?

904
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:07,698
Please.

905
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:23,074
Cleric...

906
01:30:23,152 --> 01:30:25,120
your weapon, please.

907
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:31,684
Here.

908
01:30:36,633 --> 01:30:37,759
Sit.

909
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,368
We'll start with a test question first.

910
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:46,772
[Snaps fingers] More of a riddle, actually.

911
01:30:48,144 --> 01:30:50,271
What would you say is the easiest way

912
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:52,576
to get a weapon away from a Grammaton Cleric?

913
01:30:58,087 --> 01:31:00,681
You ask him for it.

914
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:10,866
I told you I'd make my career with you, Cleric.

915
01:31:14,337 --> 01:31:15,634
...to combine the capacity...

916
01:31:17,507 --> 01:31:18,496
Preston...

917
01:31:18,575 --> 01:31:21,066
Brandt's job was simple...

918
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,601
to make you feel like you'd won,

919
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,843
to make you feel safe.

920
01:31:30,053 --> 01:31:33,580
For years, I tried to infiltrate an agent

921
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:35,180
into the Underground...

922
01:31:36,593 --> 01:31:38,652
...until it hit me...

923
01:31:38,728 --> 01:31:42,459
in order to pass undetected into their midst,

924
01:31:42,532 --> 01:31:45,262
in order to be trusted by them,

925
01:31:45,335 --> 01:31:50,705
my provocateur would have to think like them

926
01:31:50,773 --> 01:31:53,674
and would have to feel like them.

927
01:31:53,743 --> 01:31:56,678
But where to find such a man...

928
01:31:56,746 --> 01:32:02,048
a man with the capacity to feel who didn't yet know it?

929
01:32:04,988 --> 01:32:07,684
But...

930
01:32:07,757 --> 01:32:09,019
we've never met.

931
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:10,923
No?

932
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:18,490
Don't look so surprised, Preston.

933
01:32:18,568 --> 01:32:20,433
Why should Father be more real

934
01:32:20,503 --> 01:32:22,994
than any other political puppet?

935
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:25,974
The real Father died years ago.

936
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:27,976
The Council simply elected me

937
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:30,945
to pursue his paternal tradition.

938
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:33,140
And you, Preston,

939
01:32:33,216 --> 01:32:36,083
the supposed savior of the Resistance,

940
01:32:36,152 --> 01:32:38,017
are now its destroyer,

941
01:32:38,087 --> 01:32:42,854
and, along with them, you've given me yourself...

942
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:44,586
calmly...

943
01:32:44,661 --> 01:32:46,526
cooly...

944
01:32:46,596 --> 01:32:51,329
entirely without incident.

945
01:32:55,438 --> 01:32:57,065
No.

946
01:32:58,641 --> 01:32:59,608
Oh...

947
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,570
Shit.

948
01:33:03,546 --> 01:33:05,241
Not without incident.

949
01:33:12,255 --> 01:33:13,745
I'm coming.

950
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:44,543
You really should learn to knock.

951
01:35:11,107 --> 01:35:14,474
How did it feel, Preston?

952
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:30,320
- Agh!       - Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

953
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:33,627
Wah!

954
01:35:33,696 --> 01:35:35,357
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

955
01:35:35,431 --> 01:35:36,989
Ugh!

956
01:35:38,201 --> 01:35:39,327
Ugh!

957
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:41,427
- Aggh!       - Aggh!

958
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:58,084
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

959
01:36:03,693 --> 01:36:06,856
I plan to be wearing it for a long time.

960
01:36:42,665 --> 01:36:45,361
Becareful, Preston.

961
01:36:45,434 --> 01:36:47,800
You're treading on my dreams.

962
01:37:22,872 --> 01:37:24,169
Ohh!

963
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,003
Wait!

964
01:37:26,075 --> 01:37:27,099
Wait.

965
01:37:27,176 --> 01:37:28,609
Look at me.

966
01:37:28,678 --> 01:37:29,770
Look at me.

967
01:37:31,914 --> 01:37:33,575
I'm life.

968
01:37:33,649 --> 01:37:37,141
I live, l-I breathe...

969
01:37:39,221 --> 01:37:40,711
I feel.

970
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:45,523
Now that you know it...

971
01:37:45,594 --> 01:37:48,392
can you really take it?

972
01:37:48,464 --> 01:37:50,489
Is it really worth the price?

973
01:37:56,605 --> 01:37:58,334
I pay it gladly.

974
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:20,495
The following items have been rated EC-10...

975
01:38:20,563 --> 01:38:21,894
condemned.

976
01:38:28,871 --> 01:38:30,031
In the 19th century...

977
01:38:36,612 --> 01:38:39,342
...world to its knees.

978
01:38:39,415 --> 01:38:43,215
Two millennia ago...

979
01:38:43,285 --> 01:38:44,946
in his conquest of the known world,

980
01:38:45,021 --> 01:38:46,545
Alexander the Great slaughtered

981
01:38:46,622 --> 01:38:49,250
more than one million human beings.

982
01:38:50,893 --> 01:38:54,329
Three centuries later, purely out of jealousy,

983
01:38:54,397 --> 01:38:57,662
Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula," murdered his own sister,

984
01:38:57,733 --> 01:39:00,429
impregnated with his own child.

985
01:39:00,503 --> 01:39:01,629
In the...

986
01:39:12,815 --> 01:39:15,750
...items have been rated EC-10...

987
01:39:17,653 --> 01:39:19,883
...rated condemned, destroyed.

988
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:24,888
...items have been rated...
