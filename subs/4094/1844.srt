00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,170
墨西哥某地

8
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,890
只有无比顽固的美国佬才会来这鸟不拉屎的地方
Only a hardheaded gringo... Would come down here...

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,100
执行什么援救计划  而且居然是单枪匹马
On a rescue mission... ALL ALONE

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,980
这美国佬不肯开口说话
This gringo is not going to talk.

11
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,600
那就杀了他
Then kill him.

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,690
速度点  将军在等着我们呢
C'mon, the General's expecting us.

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,570
你不能用自己的枪
You can't use your gun...

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,870
用他自己的枪射杀他
...Shoot him with his.

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,340
这枪用不了
It's not working.

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,410
这兔崽子的枪连撞针都没有
This asshole's gun has no firing pin.

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,230
别管他了
Leave him.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,190
狗狗们好久没试过自己杀死猎物了
The dogs haven't had to kill for their food in a while.

19
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,900
朋友  下次
Next time, amigo,

20
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,150
先计划好再来
plan ahead.

21
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,990
我真是个伪天主教徒
Oh, I'm such a bad Catholic.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,250
才不  你就是脑子有病罢了
No, you're just sick in the head.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,540
别忘了要拿给将军的钱
Don't forget the General's money.

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,670
那美国佬贿赂错警察了
That gringo bribed the wrong cop...

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,000
还带了一把没撞针的枪
...and brought a gun with no firing pin.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,700
撞针在这里

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500

傻蛋  我心肝宝贝呢
Where's my girl, fool?

33
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,530
她很好  就在那里面  她好得不得了  
She cool, man. She in there. She's still fine as hell.

34
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,370
就这样吗  你在巴达被轰出局了吗
So that's it? Bada-bing, you out of the game?

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,600
生意都吹了吗
Done with the whole trade?

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,330
-对  -问题就在这  博斯克
- Yeah.  - Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

37
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,710
要么继续  要么就在墨西哥
You either keep doing that,

38
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,580
监狱好好呆上十五年  
or you do a 15- year bid in a Mexican prison

39
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,630
和齐拓表兄一起
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

40
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,960
还是老一套  你自己收拾烂摊子吧  哥们
Same old shit. You choose how to flush the toilet, brother.

41
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,760
好了  吃软的还是吃硬的
That's right. Easy way or the hard way.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
可怜虫

43

注意点  怪头  你连我这老朋友都要失去了
But watch yourself, B.A., now, you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,210
傻瓜

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,050
还好吗  心肝  想我吗
What's up, girl? You miss me?

Because l missed you. Yes, l did. It's been too long, baby.

It's very Arizona, very Tex-Mex. It's good. It's good.

56

不如我们把我六点钟方向的那人叫来
Maybe we can get the guy at my six

57

你是在拦路抢劫吗
You jacking me?

78
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,730
这算什么  太阳从西边出来了吗
What is this, opposite day?

我不是抢劫犯  但如果我不及时赶到  我朋友就会死
I'm not a thief. But if l don't reach my friend in time, then he dies.

You ain't gonna shoot me in the head, pops.

83

你自己心里清楚
You know that ain't happening.

84
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,040
你他妈的有病吗  
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

85
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,500
随随便便就开枪打陌生人
You shoot a total stranger?

86
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,500
我都不认识你  操

l know it hurts, but l had to make a point with you.

你是陆军游骑兵吗  小子
You Army Ranger, son?

94
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,860
大叔  小心斟酌你要说的下一句话
Be real careful of what you say next, pops.

因为我比他们更强

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
-螺旋翼没问题  长官  -这家伙到底是谁
- Rotors are good, sir.  - Who is this guy?

266
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,010
快点  我们走
Come on! Let's go!

267

干掉美国佬

268
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,180
默多克  把这玩意弄上天去
Murdock, get this thing in the air.

269
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,720
抓紧咯  
Hold on, boys!

270
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,980
我要试试在卡通里看到的把戏
I'm gonna try something l saw in a cartoon once.

271
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,480
你说卡通是毛意思  快把我们弄走
What you talking about cartoons for? Get us the hell out of here!

272
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,190
六点钟方向有敌方直升机
We got a hot chopper to your six.

273
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,740
金刚罩  你们打不到我  打不到我
I'm blocking bullets. We're bulletproof.

274
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,490
金刚罩  打不到我
We're bulletproof, boys!

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,160
小心
Oh, heads up.

276
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,830
我看见你了  美国佬 
I see you, gringo!

277
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,710
你把我的心肝宝贝压成了薄饼  我要杀了你这混蛋
You pancaked my van! I'm gonna kill you, fool!

278
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,880
你不能停在那里  那是残疾人专用的
You can't park there. That's a handicap zone.

279
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,380
-我就知道你是个疯子  神经病  -我已经后悔了
- l knew you was crazy! l knew...  - This is a mistake.

280
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,230
开火
Fire! Fire! Fire!

281
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,400
把他们打下来
Blow them out of the sky.

282
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,910
我从来没有这样试过
I've never tried this before!

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,780
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

284
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,040
你看到他让直升飞机做空翻了吗
Did you see how he turned the helicopter?

285
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,130
这空对空作战真刺激  是不  老兄
Whoa! There's nothing like some good air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

286
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,670
别看我  看前面
Don't look at me! Look there!

287
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,460
他只剩热感导弹了  
He's only got heat seekers left.

288
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,720
上尉  把我们弄走
Captain, get us out of here.

289
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,010
抓紧了  这可不好受  
Hold on, this could get ugly!

290
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,600
准备好  加油啊  宝贝  继续爬升
Here we go! Come on, baby, climb!

291
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,310
发射导弹 
Fire the missiles.

292
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,780
哇哇  导弹  来吧
Whoa! Missiles! Come on, come on.

293
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,950
这就是对付热感导弹的方法
That's how we deal with heat seekers, chaps.

294
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,990
我们熄火
We go cold.

295
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
搞毛
What the hell?

296
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,000
小白  快把他弄进来
Face, get him in here!

297
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,080
妈了个逼的
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

298
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,960
抓住他了
Got him!

299
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,340
重启
Restart. Restart.

300
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
关好门
Close the door!

301
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,430
我知道你是空降兵  但那也太夸张了吧
l know you're Airborne Rangers, but that was ridiculous!

302
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,930
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

303
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,890
头儿  我们是要杀了图克  不是被杀
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco, not the other way around!

304
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,770
抢先一步并不是计划  小子
One step ahead of the game isn't a plan, kid.

305
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,150
而是要抢先两三步
Two to three steps ahead.

306
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,820
抢在敌人出招前就将其拿下
Beating an enemy's move before it's even made.

307
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,660
这才是计划
That's a plan.

308
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,580
斧头  斧头  瞄准尾随我的目标
Hatchet, Hatchet, lock on my LC.

309
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,290
图克将军  你现在正未经许可
General Tuco, you are currently engaged

310
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,910
对美国军事人员发动攻击
in unauthorized warfare on United States military personnel.

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,460
滚你妈的  是你先挑起来的
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You engaged me.

312
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,000
重复一遍  
Repeat.

313
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,420
你现在正未经许可对美国军事人员发动攻击
You are engaged in unauthorized warfare on United States military personnel.

- ln other words, Adios! Mother- fu...!!  - Oh, no.

318
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,910
干得漂亮  上尉
Well done, Captain.

319
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,790
-酷毙了  -酷个屁
- That was awesome.  - That wasn't awesome.

320
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,450
-你真是个天才  -老子死也不坐飞机了  
- You are a genius!  - I'm never flying again in this thing!

321
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,250
相信你果然没错  头儿
l never should have doubted you, boss!

322
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,920
凡事都在计划之中  小子
There's a plan in everything, kid.

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,550
我就爱计划圆满的那一刻
And I love it when a plan comes together.

没有比这更好的烹饪了
Gunpowder cooking. Nothing like it.

330
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,460
小白  你想要用凝固汽油红烧还是用原子弹油炸
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

331
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,960
原子弹油炸  
Nuke it.

332
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,540
油炸  
Nuke it!

333
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,130
默多克  他妈的给我煮熟一点
Murdock, burn the hell out of it,

334
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,300
给我狠狠地烧
like it was damned.

335
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,470
把整个地方都烧了算了  兄弟
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

- You want secret sauce?  - No, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

338
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,810
秘密就是  你有病  地球人都知道
The secret's out. You crazy. Everybody knows.

339
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,780
没人能学会你的防冻腌泡汁  默多克
No one can do an anti- freeze marinade like you can, Murdock.

340
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,990
但我上次吃了以后就面瘫了
But l got a little Bell's palsy last time l ate that.

341
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,490
只是局部面瘫而已  来吧  有点男人样
It's only partial paralysis. Come on, take it like a man.

342
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,280
是的  长官  正要准备和他们对话
Yes, sir. I'm having that conversation right now.

343
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,240
一定会让他们明白的  一切都在我掌控  长官
We will enforce that. I've got it well in hand, sir.

344
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,750
我想你也不希望我局部面瘫地上战场吧
I don't think you want me to be in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

345
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,330
有客人哟
Visitors.

346
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,680
说真的  我还真吃了一惊
Wow, I'm a little taken aback. I'm not gonna lie.

347
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,640
中尉
Lieutenant.

348
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,640
很抱歉  我是不是也要叫你中尉
Oh, I'm sorry, am l supposed to call you Lieutenant back?

349
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,270
不  你得叫我上尉
No, you're supposed to call me Captain.

350

上尉

351
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,770
没错
That's right.

352
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,570
让我想起吃的了  瞧瞧你

餐厅名

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,450
怪不得你不要孩子  也不要家庭
So, l guess you said no to the kids, no to the family.

355
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,320
就是要平步青云啊  
Just no ladder you can't climb, huh?

356
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,330
不  亲爱的  我只是不要你而已
No, no, honey, l just said no to you.

Would you like some pork?

359
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,210
我要是把你丫手打折了  你还能再傻逼一点么
lf I broke every bone in your hand, could you still do that?

360
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,130
太不可思议了  三年了  
This is crazy. Three years?

361
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,170
我们三年没见面了
We haven't seen each other for three years,

362
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,380
你就是来谈这个的吗
this is what we're gonna talk about?

363
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,390
那你想谈什么

我那张斯蒂利・丹的CD带来了么
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?

366
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,020
我都懒的搭理你
I'm not even going to respond to that.

367
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,190
我们一口气听了九遍
We listened to it, like, nine times in a row.

368
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,490
品着那难喝的解百衲葡萄酒  记得吗
We were drinking that crappy cabernet. You remember that?

369
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,490
我们还干了点儿别的  咱干什么了
We were doing something else. What were we doing?

370
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,570
你还记得吗  干什么了  在卧室里 
Do you remember what it was we were doing? It was in a bedroom.

371
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,990
你都忘了吗
You don't remember?

372
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,580
我只记得我离开了你
The only thing I remember is leaving.

373
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,540
这是我对你最美好的回忆
Which is my fondest memory of you.

374
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,670
你们是最棒的  可别给我惹事
You guys are the best. Stay out of trouble, you hear me?

375
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,260
保重  谢谢
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

376
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,760
头盔戴牢了
Keep that on.

377
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,900
上校  我叫林奇  中央情报局的
Colonel, my name is Lynch, I'm with Central lntelligence.

378
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,110
在之前第一次"沙漠风暴"行动时遇见一个中情局的人也叫林奇
l knew a company man named Lynch back in the first Desert Storm.

379
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,620
对  我们那有一堆人叫都叫这名儿
Yeah, l come from a long line of Lynches.

380
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,660
有想过人们为何不信任中情局吗
You ever stop to consider that maybe the reason nobody trusts the CIA

381
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,870
因为没人知道你们的真名
is because nobody knows your real names?

382
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,170
有什么可效劳的吗  林奇先生
What can l do for you, Mr. Lynch?

383
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,670
我要你帮我阻止萨达姆的前任手下
I need you to help me to stop Saddam's former flunkies

384
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,420
在未来的30小时内窃取数十亿美元
from stealing over a billion dollars in the next 30 hours.

在伊朗境内  
belonged to the Shah of lran.

387
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,310
曾在两伊战争期间失踪
During the lran- lraq War, it went missing.

388
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,060
流言盛传是萨达姆偷去了
Rumor was, Saddam had stolen it.

389
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,060
"沙漠风暴"时我们已经偷了回来
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

390
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,440
但是没拿回模板
Well, you didn't get the engraving plates.

391
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,110
那不要紧
It didn't matter.

392
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,480
他们要想印钞票就得重建铸币厂
They would have had to rebuild a mint just to print those bills.

393
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,070
没错  长官
Well, sir,

394
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,070
他们正在这么干
it's happening as we speak.

395
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,120
这群阿拉伯来的暴徒占用了废弃的伊拉克国家铸币厂
Fedayeen thugs have seized what's left of the lraqi National Mint

396
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,500
印制了几十亿非法美国货币
to run off billions of dollars in unbacked American currency.

397
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,130
他们要如何把模板和十亿美钞
How are they planning on moving the plates and a billion dollars

398
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,460
-运出巴格达  -装甲车
- out of Baghdad?  - Armored convoy,

399
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,090
由退伍的伊拉克特种兵驾驶
manned with former lraqi spec ops.

400
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,430
速度奇快  遇佛杀佛
You know, high speed, shoot-to-kill types.

401
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
你打算怎样阻止他们
So how do you plan on stopping them?

402
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,560
听着  最近有流言说萨达姆的党羽
Listen, there's some rumors about some top-secret plates

403
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,190
要把一些高度机密的模板偷运出城
being smuggled out of the city by Saddam loyalists.

404
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,280
你听说了吗
Do you know anything about this?

405
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,320
你听好了  要是你想借此事大显身手
Seriously, if you're going to make a play for these plates,

406
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,110
我可得请你滚蛋了
I'm waving you off right now.

407
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,660
因为那是我的职责  我能搞定
'Cause it's my responsibility and it's my ass.

408
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,490
我是认真的  
I'm serious.

409
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,370
小白  
Face?

410
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,120
不然我把你告上军事法庭
l will court-martial you.

411
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,380
-好吧  -嘿
- Whoo! Okay.  - Hey.

412
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,920
别拿我的话当耳边风
Get the memo.

413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,340
记得告诉你家亲爱的史密斯上校他妈的给我离巴格达越远越好
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

414
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,930
你
You know,

415
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,470
你再也没回来  我以为你会回来 
you never came back. l thought you were gonna come back.

416
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,850
我现在不是回来了么
Well, this is me, coming back.

417
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,020
你觉得那几个小丑真敢插手
You think those clowns can really pull this off?

418
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,150
听着  这话我从来说不出口
Listen, listen, l would never tell him this,

419
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,320
但他们确实是四个分队里最牛逼的小组
but they are the best CIAndestine unit in the four branches,

420
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,490
而且最擅长那些不可思议的任务
and they specialize in the ridiculous...

421
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,910
我去找其他人
...shadow peck and the rest of them.

422
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,040
-给我盯紧了他们  -遵命  长官
- Do not let them out of your sight.  - Yes, ma'am.

423
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,000
"暗黑破坏神"是恶魔的意思吗  -当然啦
- Doesn't diablo mean "devil"?  - Yeah, man.

424
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,510
去你娘的  汉尼拔  你想要我怎么样
God damn it, Hannibal, what do you want me to do?

425
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,010
罗素・莫里森将军

426
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,010
基地指挥官

427
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,760
如果这是我的行动    
If this were my operation and you wanted it,

428
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,970
-那你随便插手  可这不是  -你竟让"黑森林"执行这任务 
- you would have the mission.  - You let Black Forest deploy on this,

429
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,180
这是国际性事件  我向你保证
and it's an international incident, l promise you.

430
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,020
他们根本不算是士兵 
They're not soldiers.

431
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,770
就是群混在军队里的纨绔子弟
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

432
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,520
-谁指挥地面部队  -布拉德・帕克
- Who's running the ground team?  - Brock Pike.

433
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,070
帕克  
Pike.

434
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,820
他就是个搞笑的暴徒  得了吧
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character. Come on.

435
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,870
汉尼拔  我们有命令在身
Hannibal, we have been ordered, ordered, mind you,

436
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,700
明确要你别靠近巴格达  
to stay out of Baghdad.

437
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,490
-就这么定了  不得违抗  -将军
- Cut, dried, the end.  - General,

438
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,790
我们得给他点回旋余地  您觉得呢
we should find him a little wiggle room, don't you think?

439
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,040
我还认识一个叫林奇的中情局走狗
You know, l knew another Lynch, a CIA stooge.

440
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,050
68年时驻扎在老挝
Stationed in Laos, '68.

441
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,470
-和我没关系  -真的吗
- No relation.  - Are you sure?

442
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,930
我一看你就想起他
'Cause you remind me of him.

443
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,180
我几小时后得赶到喀布尔
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

444
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,310
希望我48小时后回来时已经万事大吉
I'll be back here in 48. I'm assuming we're green and go.

445
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,230
要是干砸了别忘通知我
Notify me otherwise.

446
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,940
他在总部还穿着防弹衣
He's wearing body armor in the HQ.

447
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,230
能看出中情局的都什么货色了吧
And that should tell you everything you need to know about the CIA.

448
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,920
老罗   现在没其他人了  咱们谈谈
Russ, let's do some good on the way out the door here.

449
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,960
那些模板的危害性太大
Those plates are gonna do all kinds of damage.

450
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,510
让我去搞定
Let me go get them.

451
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,630
算了吧  汉尼拔  这次你要置身事外
Forget about it, Hannibal. Steer clear of this one.

452
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,090
不要插手
Well clear of it.

453
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,970
这次行动是直刺萨德尔城的心脏 
This is a gauntlet run right through the heart of Sadr City.

454
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,020
萨达姆・侯赛因是个公认的疯子
Saddam Hussein was a certifiable madman,

455
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,190
但还没疯狂到
but even he wasn't crazy enough

456
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,440
三十年后再去那地方
to go into that place more than once in 30 years.

457
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,530
我们一周前撤离   那里已经无法无天了
We pulled out of there a week ago and already it's the Wild West.

458
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,650
你听上去还是很担心的
You actually sound worried.

459
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,490
你还是生气了
And you actually seem offended.

460
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,660
不是说你不如当年了  
Well, this isn't about you losing a step now.

461
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,080
我想你要明白这一点
l want you to know that.

462
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,080
我可比当年强大得多
I'm 10 times the man l was when you met me.

463
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,040
也迅捷得多
And twice as fast.

464
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,960
老罗
Russ,

465
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,630
我和弟兄们保证能全身而退
the boys and l can get this done, minus the bloodshed.

466
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,180
那些模板的危害性太大
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

467
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,640
别逼我求你
Don't make me beg.

468
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
我不想看到你求人
I'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

469
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,060
你和我是这么多年的老朋友
You've been my friend for a long time.

470
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,650
更重要的是  
More importantly,

471
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,610
你和那些小伙子们可能是
you and those boys have possibly been

472
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,110
我调遣过的最有价值的战斗力
the most valuable military asset l have ever had at my disposal.

473
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,910
你请求我别逼你求我
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

474
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
但其实是我得求你
Right now, I'm begging you.

475
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,080
汉尼拔  求你了  这次你就放手吧
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

476
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,130
老罗   事关重大  不能让那帮笨蛋上呀
Russ, this is too big an enterprise. We can't let these bozos do this.

477
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,840
事关重大呀
It's way too big.

478
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,430
你是否愿意带着我的祝福出战
And you'd do it with or without my blessing?

479
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,510
我不会不带的
No, that I wouldn't.

480
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,510
我需要你的祝福
l need your blessing.

481
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,390
我不敢肯定这算不算是种祝福
I'm not so sure that it is a blessing.

482
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,690
祝你马到功成  伙计  
Good hunting, my friend.

483
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
谢谢
Thank you.

484
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,570
和老家伙谈的如何
How'd it go with the old man?

485
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,200
都是些陈词滥调   你手上是什么
Same old, same old. What you got there?

486
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,990
我的新欢
Pictures of my new baby.

487
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,750
不错呀  眼光不赖
Oh, look at her. Who's a proud papa?

488
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,790
这些是默多克近距离拍下的
These pictures are the closest Murdock gets to that van.

489
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,500
等我回到洛杉矶  它就会在那儿等我了
It's ready for me when I go back to LA.

490
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,920
听着  怪头  我们得多待一阵子了
Listen, B.A., we're extending our stay a little bit.

491
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,430
得回巴格达去
We're going back into Baghdad.

492
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,510
上头不是命令咱别去巴格达吗
l thought we was ordered to stay out of Baghdad.

493
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,260
-没错  可我   -史密斯
- That's true, but I'm...  - Smith.

494
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,140
-帕克  -我听说你和你手下
- Pike.  - l understand you and your grunts

495
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,440
要抢我饭碗  我可不太高兴
are now stealing my gigs. l don't like that.

496
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,690
我以为你们"黑森林"大军忙着
I figured you Black Forest guys would be busy

497
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,940
在哪搞独裁或推翻民主呢
installing a dictatorship or overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

498
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,740
现在是周末  那些事得上班时间处理  大叔
It's still the weekend, yet. That's nine-to-five stuff, pops.

499
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
看看你们这群小丑
Look at you clowns.

500
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,700
你们算哪门子士兵
You're not soldiers.

501
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,580
简直就是穿着马球衫的刺客
You're assassins in polo shirts.

502
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,960
你们折腾一年的活儿  我们一周就能拿下
We'll make in a week what you guys make in a year.

503
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,750
钞票买不来勇气  小子
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

504
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,460
也买不来智慧
or brains.

505
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,680
可惜你两样都缺
And you're short on both.

506
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,100
这是莫里森的基地  赶紧滚出我的地盘
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

507
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,560
怪头  你都穿上黄色领骑衫了呀  
They make you wear the yellow shirt there, B.A.?

508
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,770
你名字是啥意思   废物的意思吗
What's that stand for, "Barely Able"?

509
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,740
让开  废物
Get out of my way, punk.

510
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,820
别怕他们
Hey, don't sweat them.

511
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,950
他们可帮我们大忙了
They might have just done us a favor. A big one.

512
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,700
看   只剩一辆中型坦克了
Let me see, we got one medium tank left.

513
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,960
我跟你说  她不会平白无故地回来
I'm telling you, there's a reason she came back.

514
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,370
小白  我都说了  忘了她
Face, l told you, forget about her.

515
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,880
这女人的野心简直 
The levels of ambition on this woman...

516
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,880
打死我也不坐飞机了  汉尼拔
I ain't stepping foot in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

517
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,090
不论是滑翔机  纸飞机  还是轻型机
No gliders, paper planes, ultra-lights.

518
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,090
-你就是揪着这事儿不放吧  -没错
- You ever gonna let me live that down?  - No.

519
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,220
墨西哥那都多久前的事了  我还救了你的命
Mexico was a long time ago, and l saved your life.

520
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,390
那你怎么不谢我在医院里没揍烂你菊花
How about thanking me for not whooping your ass at the hospital?

521
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,970
没遇见你之前我是空降兵
l was an Airborne Ranger until l met you.

522
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,600
可你吓得跟什么似的  
And you chickened out just like...

523
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,100
-263次跳伞  -你就不能谢谢我吗
- 263 jumps.  - Just a thank-you would have been nice.

524
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,270
可坐过一次你开的直升机后全毁了
And one helicopter ride with you screws it up.

525
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
空降兵却恐飞  就是个棒槌
Airborne Ranger with a fear of flying. Like a punk!

526
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,360
怪头  我保证  咱抢过卡车
B.A., for the last time, nobody leaves the truck

527
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,530
后就都在里面呆着  好吧
once we take it over. Okay?

528
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,950
我老表带我来到这个派对  在那里有个超棒的伴奏乐队
My cousin takes me to this party where this amazing cover band

529
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,910
演奏了鞭挞金属版的莱昂纳尔・里奇的怀旧金曲
does this trash metal version of Hello by Lionel Richie.

530
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,040
-哦  -唱起来就像这样
-Yeah. -Yeah. It goes...

531
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,590
嗨  你是在找我吗
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

532
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,250
伙计们   他们在里面多久了
Guys, how long have they been in there?

533
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,340
-三小时了  -三小时
- About three hours. - Three hours.

534
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,420
三小时
Three hours?

535
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,260
在里头三小时了  没出来吗
They've been in there for three hours? They haven't come out at all?

536
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,720
都没人出来尿尿或其他什么的吗
No one came out to take a leak, nothing?

537
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,310
一个也没
- No.  - Nope.

538
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,100
我站这儿才一会儿就已经感觉不对了
I've been here for three seconds and that sounds odd to me.

539
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,020
我就像猎鹰般的盯着他们
I've been watching that tent like a hawk.

540
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,190
是吗  我怎么看到你们只是坐这儿吃意大利肉汁烩饭
Really? lt looks like you're eating some risotto and sitting on your ass.

541
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,610
我不知道了  我想来点汤
I don't know. I wanted the soup.

542
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,950
-我吃的不是意大利肉汁烩饭  -真不是
- I wasn't eating risotto. I had... -It's not risotto.

543
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,540
伙计们
Yeah, boys.

544
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,630
他想挑事呀
Yeah, he wants to fight, doesn't he?

545
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,800
靠这也太爽了  还给我们找了跳脱衣舞的妞呀 
Damn, this is awesome. They got us a stripper, too.

546
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,720
你眼神就像我们当兵的一样性感  比如说我
You got that hot enlisted look. Me likey.

547
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,560
在我关你们禁闭之前  我想知道  他们哪去了
Before l throw you in the stockade, where are they?

548
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,190
没跟我们说哦  上尉
They didn't tell us... Captain.

549
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,150
只给了我们一箱啤酒和每人五十块
They just gave us a case of beer and 50 bucks apiece.

550
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,860
给我的是一百
I got a hundred.

551
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,650
给你的是一百块呀
Oh, did you get a hundred?

552
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,660
这假发是不是归咱们了
You think we get to keep the hair?

553
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,580
策划  行动  部署
Staging, movement, action plan.

554
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,580
你们有得读了
There's a nice read for you.

555
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,800
太给力了  汉尼拔  要的就是这个
Hell, yeah, Hannibal. This is it right here.

556
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,880
让人难以置信
This is bat-shit insane.

557
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,260
-完美  -头儿  太疯狂了
- It's perfect.  - This is beyond nuts, boss.

558
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,560
习惯就好
It gets better.

559
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,690
怪头  你去找一块和你块头差不多大的金属做滑板
B.A., you'll need a piece of contoured metal to make a skid plate.

560
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,820
快走  傻瓜
Let's go, fool.

561
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,440
默多克  去弄块车用电池
Murdock, we'll need a car battery, too.

562
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,160
看看"黑森林"那群傻帽那边有不
See if the boys at Black Forest can help us out.

563
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,870
我们还需要记者证
Press credentials, we need them.

564
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,450
到媒体中心的帐篷里去找找
Hit the media tent and see what's lying around.

565
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,750
抱歉  伙计  我看你
Sorry, my friend, l see you've put

566
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,580
刚把南非电视台的话筒放下边了
the South African microphone at the bottom.

567
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,790
你不能总让CNN高高在上
You can't always put the CNN on top.

568
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,090
当兵的  这儿有两个话筒  我不清楚是
Private, there are two mics. I don't know if there is something...

569
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,680
早先我曾是个帅小伙
I was a moving man in my younger days

570
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,050
默多克  我们得弄台新闻摄影机
Murdock, we need a news camera.

571
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,640
就看你的了
See what you can do.

572
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,640
抱歉  抱歉
All right, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

573
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,310
你好  我
Hello. I'm...

574
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,310
我爱上你了
I'm in love with you.

575
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,940
听着  我们正在做预备性会谈  
Listen, we're doing a preliminary poll of...

576
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,320
是关于那个什么  对了  撤军
What are we talking about? Of the pull-out.

577
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,320
还需要气囊  越多越好
We're gonna need airbags, lots of them.

578
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,740
-你是哪个部门的  -法国世界报
- What bureau are you with, darling?  - Le Monde.

579
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,240
你是法国人
Are you French?

580
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,480
你好  我是帕克尔将军  我需要
Hello, this is General Parker. I need...

581
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
找你的
Okay. It's for you.

582
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,800
要进行空袭  你自己去和上头说
Hey, fool, you need to call an air strike on yourself.

583
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,430
-我们这没问题了  老兄  再会  -不  我们得回去 
- We're good, mate. I'll meet you.  - No, I think we need to get going now.

584
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,680
你给我听清楚了
You need to understand what I'm telling you right now.

585
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,260
怪头  弄块磁铁
B.A., we're gonna need a magnet.

586
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,350
要磁力够强的
A powerful one.

587
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,690
看过蓝人乐队的演出吗
You ever seen Blue Man Group?

588
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,190
其他的交给我
I'll pick up the rest.

589
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,040
我想冒次险
I'm just gonna go for it.

590
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,050
你愿意付出一切  换取这个机会吗
What would you give for one chance

591
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,720
那就是回来大声告诉我们的敌人
to come back here and tell our enemies

592
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,390
他们也许能夺走我们的生命 
that they may take our lives,

593
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,560
却永远夺不走我们的自由 
but they'll never take our freedom!

594
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,560
恶搞《勇敢的心》

595
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,560
准备好进城了吗  
Ready to go downtown?

596
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,900
祝君好运
Good luck.

597
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
-谢谢  -让他们见鬼去吧
- Thank you.  - Give 'em hell.

598
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,750
莫里森将军  汉尼拔・史密斯在他妈哪儿呀
General Morrison, where the hell is Hannibal Smith?

599
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,840
上尉   和首长说话要礼貌
Captain, you would do well to revise your tone and readdress me.

600
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,590
将军  我奉命可以随时取代你
General, I have authority under DClS that supersedes your command,

601
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,720
为免难堪  我最后再问你一次  
so last time, before this becomes embarrassing for the both of us,

602
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,390
汉尼拔在哪儿
where is Hannibal Smith?

603
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,270
你先出去下  将军
Would you excuse us, General?

604
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,360
上尉  我从军快四十年了
Captain, in nearly 40 years of being in this army,

605
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,780
已经不是刚当兵时的火爆脾气了
I have learned to control my temper

606
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,200
特别是对待下属时我更会和和气气
and my voice when in the presence of a subordinate officer

607
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,290
现在到底是谁他妈的说话这么不客气
who, for at least the time being, seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

608
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,290
我理解是
Now, it is my understanding

609
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,300
你有事要问我  对吧
that you have a question for me. ls that correct?

610
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,880
是的
You are correct, sir.

611
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,130
你要记住  你还是一名美国军官
Then when you are prepared to remember that you are still an officer

612
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,890
尽管你现在没穿着军装
in the United States Army, in spite of your civilian attire,

613
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,890
当兵的就要有当兵的样
and are ready to present that question in a military fashion,

614
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,100
这样我们才能谈的下去
then perhaps we could get somewhere with this discussion.

615
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,230
如果你派遣天龙特攻队去了巴格达
lf you have sent an Alpha Team into Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

616
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,610
就已经违抗了国防部的命令 
that is a direct violation of a DoD order.

617
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,360
既然你都这么说了
Well, and as much as you have this kind of knowledge,

618
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,950
还问我作甚
I can't help wondering why it is that you need to ask anything of me.

619
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,870
我就当你是承认了
I will take that as your confirmation, sir.

620
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,050
他们三小时后出发
They go mobile in three hours.

621
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,930
在铸币厂里将模板和十多亿美元
The plates and over a billion dollars

622
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,680
装在一辆拖车后面
will be loaded into the back of a semi at the mint.

623
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,310
然后行驶7.4公里到达这座桥
They're overland for exactly 4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

624
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,730
这是我们的机会  但转瞬即逝
That's our window, and it closes fast.

625
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,530
一有任何风吹草动  他们都会开大火力
These guys will go weapons hot at the first whisper of trouble.

626
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,710
小白  你得进入酒店地下
Face, your point of entry is under the hotel.

627
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,050
酒店上面肯定挤满了外国记者和私人保镖
It'll be packed with foreign press and private security.

628
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,780
怪头  你带着计时器等在这条巷子里
B.A., you're in this alleyway on a stopwatch.

629
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,360
车起码要是双气缸引擎
Make sure the bike has V-tins or better.

630
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,740
我弄了辆比那强百倍的
I got something a whole lot better than that.

631
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,240
我干什么呀  头儿
What about me, boss man?

632
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,750
我有架小型直升机
I had a little helicopter here someplace.

633
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,790
能不能空翻  或是空中熄火
You got some barrel rolls? Some mid-air stalls?

634
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,170
我等不及下一次濒死体验了
I'm looking for my next near-death experience.

635
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,180
你这次是支援行动  上尉  
Only air support this time, Captain,

636
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,680
下次会让你大干一场  我保证
but I'll get you in on the next one. I promise.

637
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,270
怪头  你六点半准时出发
B.A., I need you to pop that clutch at 0630.

638
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,600
我吗
Is that me?

639
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,320
我都忘了  我在伊拉克的下水道里  太谢谢了  头儿
Oh, no, l forgot. I'm in an lraqi sewer. Thanks, boss!

640
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,280
时间就是一切  小白
Timing is everything, Face.

641
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,450
关键要一击即中
This is all about the bull's-eyes.

642
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,170
谁说不是
Why not?

643
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,550
在拖车下面  你得把跟在后面的卡车干掉
From under the semi, you'll take out the truck directly behind you.

644
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,770
然后会有人冲着你过来  小白
Now, these guys are gonna be onto you, Face.

645
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,610
怪头  这时就该你上场了
B.A., that's your cue for throttle.

646
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,740
穿越前先看清两旁的路
Be sure to look both ways before crossing.

647
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,820
还有别忘了给车加满油
And have a nice full tank of gas.

648
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,830
车上会有重兵把守  怪头
You'll have multiple hostiles on board, B.A.

649
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,420
把他们统统解决掉
Escort them from the premises.

650
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,740
要是有人从后面偷袭  别担心  有我呢
If any stragglers sneak up behind, don't worry, l got your back.

651
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,670
抓住你了  小子
Gotcha, kid.

652
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,920
好样的
Attaboy.

653
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,430
听起来不错  但我们要怎么离开巴格达呢
That's all fine in theory, but I still don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

654
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,510
我心中有数
I do.

655
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,550
怪头  右转  
B.A.! Hang a right!

656
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,890
好的  抓紧
All right! Hang on!

657
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
-小心  -低头
- Watch out! Watch out!   - Heads down!

658
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,820
干得漂亮  怪头
Oh! Nice one, B.A. !

659
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,150
小白  装上气囊
Face, get the airbags!

660
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,620
得保证一会儿不会脱落
Gotta make sure this thing stays locked for later!

661
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
完美
Beautiful!

662
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,080
一  二  三
One, two, three.

663
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,420
头儿  气囊是为了防撞击的吧
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy on impact, right?

664
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,090
怪头  到集装箱里去
B.A., get in the container.

665
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,640
注意后方
Contact, rear!

666
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,220
靠
Shit!

667
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,030
我就觉得这部分最不靠谱
See, this is the part of the plan l don't trust!

668
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,530
别担心  小白  绳子很牢
Don't worry, Face! The rope will hold!

669
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,620
我担心会被钉在集装箱上
If l was worried, l'd be nailing myself to the container right now!

670
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,460
抓住了  弟兄们
Hang on, boys!

671
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,400
老子来也  统统给我轰成渣吧
Bam! Come on! l smoked you!

672
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,060
你们看到下面的情况了没
You boys see that down there?

673
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,360
那傻蛋来干什么  
Murdock? What is that fool doing here?

674
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,360
让我出去  我不是开玩笑
Don't lock me in here. l ain't playing with y'all!

675
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,650
头儿  你有没有在游戏厅玩过
Hey, boss, you ever play that game at the fun fair

676
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,950
用爪子抓玩具的游戏
where you try to pick up a stuffed animal with the claw?

677
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,490
这感觉太像啦
This is a lot like that.

678
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,540
就是这样
That's it!

679
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,370
你们锁上了是么 
Did you lock this?

680
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,830
你们锁上了是么  你们竟然我把锁住了
You locked it, didn't you?

681
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,670
汉尼拔  快开门呀  伙计
Hannibal, open this door right now, man!

682
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,960
你是在把这车厢往哪儿挂吗
What the... Are you hooking this thing?

683
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,090
-是往直升机上挂吗  -挂好了
- You hooking this up to a helicopter?   - I got you.

684
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,260
到底他妈怎么回事  别这么疯狂
What the hell's going on?   You ain't that crazy!

685
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,470
别他妈告我现在我在天上  看我怎么弄死你们 
Tell me we ain't flying! I'm gonna kill you, fool!

686
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,470
-头儿  那是博斯克吗  -快放我出去 
- Boss, is that Bosco?  - Get me out of here!

687
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,470
-糟了  -快放我出去  
- That's not good.  - Let me out of here!

688
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,470
这下糟了  他不高兴了
That's not good. He is not happy.

689
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,850
林奇特工  我临时从
Agent Lynch, I'm patching surveillance

690
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,310
将军账营中打给你
from the General's tent to you now.

691
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,520
长官  现在有架可倾斜旋翼的V22型飞机
Sir, l have an inbound V-22 tilt-rotor

692
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,110
从西北方向接近
on approach from the northwest.

693
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,700
是友非敌  奉将军之命在此降落
Identified friendly. Landing under the General's orders.

694
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,740
是天龙特攻队撤退至此  不是敌人   
Alpha Delta Alpha, stand down. Checked, friendly.

695
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,290
喀布尔  阿富汗

696
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,790
是我们的人  在临时着陆区的D区
Those are our boys. D-block perimeter around LZ

697
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,000
携带重要物品降落
for essential cargo touchdown.

698
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,730
老罗  大获全胜
Russ, we are in the net.

699
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,940
收到  我五分钟后到 
Copy that. l will be there in five.

700
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,360
用一大瓶尊尼获加蓝方为你们接风
I've got a big bottle of Blue Label waiting.

701
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,240
一瓶哪够  最起码一箱才行  吝啬鬼
A bottle? Make it a case, Scrooge.

702
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,780
一会儿见
See you in a few.

703
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,950
谁去放他出来
Who's gonna let him out?

704
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,500
-你去  -你去
- You!  - You!

705
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,130
你们都小心着点  等我出去搞死你们
What you don't realize is, now l gotta kill all of y'all!

706
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,840
丫的搞死你们  先灭汉尼拔  然后是默多克
I'll kill all of y'all! Hannibal first, then Murdock!

707
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,800
-头儿  -最后是小白
- Boss man.  - I'm gonna save Face for last!

708
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,590
-让我试试  -去吧
- Let me try something.  - Go for it.

709
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,090
真是诡异  我觉得他比那任务还可怕
ls it weird that I'm more scared now than what we just did?

710
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,390
博斯克  我是默多克
Bosco, it's Murdock.

711
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,180
默多克  快开门 
Murdock, open this door!

712
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,730
乖  我给你做你爱吃的椰奶咖喱橄榄沙司哟
I'll make you some of that coconut-curry tapenade that you love.

713
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,480
这招估计管用
That might work.

714
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,480
有吐司吗  
With toast points?

715
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,610
当然有吐司  不然
Hell, yeah, with toast points. What, you're gonna have that

716
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,360
要抹在土豆饼上吃吗 
with plain old chips?

717
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,450
-你玩儿我  -猛虎出栅喽
- Damn! You tricked me.  - There he is.

718
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,160
-出来喽  -我讨厌这样
- There he is!  - I hate that!

719
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,280
-得了  -离我远点  伙计
- Come on!  - Get away from me, man!

720
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,120
要不是寡不敌众我真想揍扁你们
The only reason l don't kick y'all asses is 'cause you all outrank me.

721
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,040
你搞明白点  我讨厌在天上飞
You should know better! You know l hate flying!

722
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,290
我满身是汗  臭气熏天  
I'm wet! I stink!

723
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,830
我还一毛钱都花不了
And l can't spend none of that money!

724
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,790
-用钱买不来幸福  -去你丫的
- Money can't buy happiness.  - Damn, man!

725
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,170
默多克  今晚你来做饭  穿上你的小花围裙
Hey, Murdock, you cooking tonight. You better get your apron on.

726
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,470
我就爱计划圆满的那一刻
I love it when a plan comes together.

727
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,770
-汉尼拔  谁在里面  -是将军吗
- Hannibal, who was that?  - General?

728
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,190
-里面是将军吗  -老罗
- ls that the General?  - Russ.

729
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,730
-到这儿来  -将军 
- Get there. Get in there.  -  General!

730
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,820
-老罗  -将军  
- Russ!  - General!

731
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,530
将军 
General!

732
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,150
天哪
Jesus Christ.

733
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,410
帕克
Pike.

734
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,040
注意后方
Contact rear!

735
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,330
过去
Get in there!

736
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,250
快过去
Get there, get there!

737
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,150
经过商议  我们决定将你
After conferring, we've decided to demote you

738
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,730
降级到中尉
to the rank of First Lieutenant.

739
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,610
索萨中尉  虽不是你的过失  
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing personal,

740
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,400
但你却没能弄回模板
but you lost those plates.

741
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,530
那便是你的责任
Those were your responsibility.

742
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,330
你就庆幸吧
Consider yourself lucky.

743
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,830
其他人要为此去蹲监狱
Others are going to prison over this.

744
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,370
您好  麦克雷迪检察官
Good day, Director McCready.

745
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,330
中尉  你可以走了
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

746
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,880
史密斯上校  本庭无法证实
Colonel Smith, this court has been unable to recover

747
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,250
你执行的那项任务是遵从
any direct order from General Morrison for you to conduct the mission

748
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,340
莫里森将军的命令
for which you're being tried.

749
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,800
法官大人  这是秘密行动
Your Honor, this was a covert operation

750
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,220
并无官方命令
and no official orders were given.

751
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,930
但唯一能证明此项行动合法性的人
So the one individual who can verify

752
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,770
已经去世了  对吧  上校
the legitimacy of this operation is deceased. Is that correct, Colonel?

753
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,900
不对  法官大人  不是去世
No, Your Honor, not deceased.

754
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,690
罗素・莫里森将军

755
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,690
美国陆军

756
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,190
莫里森将军是被谋杀的
General Morrison was murdered.

757
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,780
上校  像你们这种不守军规的人
Colonel, I've been around a long time.

758
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,780
我见的多了
I've seen units like yours. They're outlaws.

759
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,530
就是你们这种人
Units like that pose a direct threat

760
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,080
对我军的军威军纪造成了巨大威胁
to the fabric and fundamentals of our military.

761
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,330
法官大人  为何"黑森林"没有被问责
Your Honors, why hasn't Black Forest been brought to trial?

762
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,300
黑森林及其成员不在我们的管辖范围内
Black Forest and its personnel are not subject to military jurisdiction.

763
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,840
你的计划呢  头儿  
Where's the plan, boss? Where is it?

764
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,760
逃跑计划呢  我没看到呢
Where's the escape hatch? Because l don't see it.

765
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,350
-这项任务还没结束  中尉  -什么任务
- This mission isn't over, Lieutenant.  - What mission?

766
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,230
找到帕克和模板  就能洗清罪名
I clear our names. We find Pike and the plates.

767
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,190
不惜一切代价
No matter what.

768
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,360
法官大人  这些人只是依令办事
Your Honors, these men were acting under my command.

769
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,240
所有处罚都应由我一人承担
Any judgment should be levied against me, and me alone.

770
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,490
并非如此  长官 
Absolutely not, sir.

771
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,740
我们都是自愿参与此行动
We were all participating in this operation willingly.

772
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,990
我不赞成个人顶责 
I don't wanna be tried separately.

773
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,660
我也拒绝个人顶责  长官
I refuse to be tried separately, sir.

774
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,910
根据军事审判统一法典
In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

775
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,790
本庭判决A小队  即天龙特攻队
this court is rendering guilty verdicts

776
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,290
所有成员罪名成立
for each member of this Alpha Unit, or A-Team,

777
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,400
并委托监狱对你们分开进行最严密监禁
and mandating incarceration in separate maximum-security facilities

778
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,170
在未来十年内 
for a period of up to 10 years.

779
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,800
撤销你们的军衔
You're all hereby stripped of formal rank

780
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,180
并开除军籍  永不录用
and dishonorably discharged.

781
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,390
简直是放屁
This is bullshit, man.

782
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,190
现在休庭
This session is adjourned.

783
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,740
可耻
Disgraceful.

784
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,030
-别碰我  -上尉  退下
- Do not touch me, okay?  - Captain, stand down.

785
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,660
安静
Order! Order!

786
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,950
绝对的诬陷 
Absolute disgrace!

787
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,200
你高兴了吧  查瑞莎
You happy? Are you happy, Charissa?

788
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,870
上校  管好你的人
Colonel, control your men!

789
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,870
-把你的手拿开  -这是诬陷
- Get your hands off me!  - This is a disgrace!

790
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,870
六个月后

791
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
军 事 监 狱

792
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,000
科罗拉多

793
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,000
卡森要塞

794
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,400
好久不见  林奇先生
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch. Long time.

795
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,900
在这么多摄像头下  
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

796
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,490
你还能这样放松
A lot of cameras in here.

797
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,280
确实挺多
Yeah, there are.

798
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,030
但现在它们都有些技术故障
Yeah, well, they seem to be having some technical issues at the moment.

799
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,660
看来录像里是找不到我了  
May not show up till playback.

800
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,910
汉尼拔  能这么称呼你吗
Hannibal. Can l call you Hannibal?

801
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,330
不能再叫你上校了
I can't call you Colonel anymore.

802
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,920
我等了
Six months.

803
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,380
你六个月  等着你把这儿炸飞
Been waiting for you to bust out of here

804
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,470
再召回那帮小兄弟
and round up the rest of the Backstreet Boys

805
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,010
带我去找模板
and lead me to those plates.

806
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,010
但六个月却毫无音讯
Six months and not a peep.

807
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,980
所有人都以为你们是和帕克一伙儿的
Everybody thought you and your team were working with Pike.

808
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,690
除了你  
Mmm. Everybody except you.

809
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,990
帕克谋杀了莫里森  设计陷害我们  偷走了模板
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me and my boys up and stole those plates.

810
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,330
我知道他在哪儿
And I know where he is.

811
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,160
没人知道他在哪儿
Nobody knows where he is.

812
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,880
这有一张他被拍到的照片
It's a single image of him.

813
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,550
一个月前在欧洲的某处
Taken about a month ago, somewhere in Europe.

814
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,130
大概是监控摄像头的抓拍
We think it's a grab from a CCTV camera.

815
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,100
是德国的法兰克福
Frankfurt, Germany.

816
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,430
你怎么知道 
How did you get that in here?

817
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,310
我需要的只是时间  林奇
Time, Lynch.

818
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,610
1分钟我就能做到这样  
Give me a minute and I'm good.

819
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,570
给1小时我会更出色
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

820
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,820
要是给我半年时间  我就无敌了
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

821
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,490
帕克我认识  
I know Pike.

822
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,780
那个阿拉伯人是谁
Who's the Arab?

823
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,910
不知道
We don't know.

824
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,080
我们觉得他是"深黑"  整个事件的幕后黑手
We think he's the deep, dark, hidden hand in this whole thing.

825
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,000
或是经纪人  或是买主
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

826
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,340
林奇  我们有共同的敌人  而你却只有一个选择
Lynch, we have common enemies and you have limited choices.

827
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,050
我的队伍是你夺回模板的最好选择
My team is still your best shot at getting those plates back.

828
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,380
这我得想一想  
I wouldn't be so sure.

829
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,880
那你干吗大老远跑到这儿来
Then why did you make the long drive out here?

830
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,760
你和中情局的伙计们正等着你的决定
You and your boys at Langley want your own private printing press.

831
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,350
行不行就取决于你的爱国心了
That's about as deep as your patriotism goes.

832
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,890
那你需要我如何协助
So, what would you need from me?

833
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,940
我答应过队员们会为他们洗清罪名
I swore to my team that I would clear our names.

834
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,860
你们都该明白名誉的重要性
You of all people must understand the value of a name.

835
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,530
听着  
Now, listen.

836
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,740
我要求复职与洗清罪名
I want full reinstatement and clean records

837
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,490
我和我的队员们
for myself and my team.

838
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,830
我无法把你弄出去  
I can't get you out of here.

839
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,790
至少合法的途径上不行
Not legally, at least.

840
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,500
这是中情局的拿手菜
This is something the boys at Langley do very, very well.

841
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,000
浸5毫升河豚毒素的古巴雪茄

842
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,260
剂量一定要准确
Make sure the dosage is right.

843
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,510
准确的意思就是毫厘不差
And when I say right, I mean perfect.

844
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,350
我的幸福鸟呀她还没来到
Don't seem like happiness will come along

845
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,690
古巴货 可惜了
Cuban. What a shame.

846
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,610
大家都往我床上丢石块
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed

847
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,320
生活停滞不前
Just can't seem to get ahead in life

848
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,000
火葬室

849
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:52,910
为啥我就搞不定
Ooh, nothing I do ever turn out right

850
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
"战神"  约翰・史密斯  被捕后死于心脏病

851
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,170
为啥没人来帮帮我
Won't somebody help me, please?

852
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,260
我已寂寞很久了
'Cause I've been lonely for so long

853
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,050
我的幸福鸟呀她还没来到
Don't seem like happiness will come along

854
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,890
我已寂寞
I've been lonely...

855
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,370
休想在我的 
You are not permitted

856
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,790
道场撒野
in my dojo!

857
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,380
看来  撒旦显灵了
So, Satan walks into this bar...

858
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,510
等等  这都什么  泳池  
Wait a minute. What's this, a lap pool?

859
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,970
蒸汽房
A dry steam room?

860
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,590
是啊  还要用很久呢
Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.

861
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,510
你到底怎么弄来的
How in the hell do you pull this off?

862
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,060
这不在于和谁关系好  鲍勃  而在于你们关系有多好
It's not who you know, Bob, it's how you know them.

863
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,060
联邦营地监狱

864
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,060
彭萨科拉

865
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,060
弗罗里达

866
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,730
你儿子从阿富汗回来了吗
Oh! Did your boy get back from Afghanistan?

867
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,770
对  多亏回来了  我和孩他妈都高兴的不得了
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home. His mother and l are real grateful.

868
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,650
上尉 
Captain.

869
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,570
你忘东西在我床上了
You left something on the bed.

870
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,950
-你应该藏起来  -藏起来多浪费
- Could have hid those.  - Why would I want to do that?

871
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,950
太销魂了  八点见  
Drive me crazy. I'll see you at 8:00.

872
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,210
-你还要建什么  -泳池和蒸汽房已经有了
-And now you want to build...  -A lap pool and a dry steam.

873
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,640
对了  还要一个日光浴场所
Overlooking a sundeck.

874
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,430
谢谢你的靴子 
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

875
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,680
客气啥  我的荣幸  宝贝儿
Ah! Come on. It's my pleasure, baby!

876
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,940
漂亮
Beautiful.

877
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,200
听着  我知道这对身体有好处
Listen, now l know this is good for the body,

878
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,990
但怎样保护脸不被晒伤
but how do you protect the face?

879
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,620
小子  你的脸再黑也很帅
You don't mess with it, kid.

880
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
呵呵
Gotcha.

881
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,750
-谢谢请我做日光浴  -不客气
- Thanks for the tan. - You got it.

882
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,420
史密斯越狱了  中尉
Smith has escaped, Lieutenant.

883
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,800
我去抓他回来
Let me go after him.

884
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,640
史密斯他们和布拉德・帕克的黑森林勾结
Smith and his team were working with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

885
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,970
找到他们就能找回模板  长官
I can get those plates back for you, sir.

886
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,060
相信我
You know I can.

887
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,270
哼哼哈嘿
Holla what? Holla who?

888
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,860
哼哼哈
Holla me.

889
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,910
放我出去
Hey! Let me out! Hey, hey! Hey!

890
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,950
我当时就看到他站在那儿  我都傻了  我还以为是鬼
I see him standing there, and I was like, "What?"

891
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:43,330
他全身乌黑  等我醒来   脸上还很麻木
And then it turned black and I woke up, and my face was numb,

892
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,880
我就
and l just...

893
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,340
你就把他的脚印都用拖把擦了
And you mopped up the footprints that led out,

894
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,670
连你的实验大褂丢了也没发觉
ignored the fact that your lab coat,

895
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,720
还有通行证  车钥匙和你的车
pass card, car keys and car were missing.

896
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,430
胖得好像吞了史密斯在肚中
Looks like he ate Smith.

897
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,510
吉伯特  你或者蓄意
Gilbert, you've either deliberately

898
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,270
与一名联邦罪犯策划越狱 
aided and abetted a federal fugitive's escape,

899
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,270
或者就是你笨得可以
or you're the single dumbest human being I've ever come into contact with.

900
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,440
-你闻到了吗   -啥也别说
- You smell that?   - Don't talk about it.

901
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,860
你想知道为啥我要倾着身子吗
Would you like to know which way I'm leaning?

902
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,910
前锋的职业病
Forward.

903
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,410
每小时给这家伙做一次尿检
I would test this man's urine, on the hour.

904
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,680
距离我的假释听证会就差一周啊  
I was a week away from my parole hearing.

905
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,100
你晒得还真黑啊
You are really tan.

906
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,480
跟你说过了这任务还没完
Told you the mission wasn't over.

907
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,780
我要重组天龙特攻队
I'm putting the team back together.

908
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,860
天龙特攻队不能没有你  小白
I need you, Face. I can't do this without you.

909
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,990
狱长  为啥有人可以不经你同意去探望史密斯
Warden, how did Smith arrange a personal visit without your consent

910
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,660
你也没签字通过呀  这咋就发生了
or your signature? How does that happen?

911
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,410
这该死的家伙怎么办到的
How the hell did this guy do that?

912
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,920
封锁起来  谁都不许进去
Seal that up, nobody goes in there.

913
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,920
没有探监那天的登记记录
Log-in pages from the day in question have been removed.

914
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,550
-意料之中  -被撕掉了
- Why does that not surprise me?  - Torn out.

915
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,600
雪茄藏在那本书的书脊里
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

916
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,100
-真精密  这书不错  -不错
- Subtle. It's a good book.  - Right.

917
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,890
这是全方位监视犯人的摄像录像
This is surveillance from all around the prison, right?

918
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,730
而屏幕上出现的扭曲是信号干扰 
What you're watching is a signal jammer.

919
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,940
每当他路过这些探头时
Every time he walks through one of these things,

920
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,820
一拍到他的摄像头都会受到信号干扰
we get massive interference. He waltzes in here and waltzes out.

921
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,740
没人知道他是谁
Nobody knows who he is.

922
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,200
天呀
God.

923
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,490
哦  这就是那根帮助史密斯上校越狱的雪茄
Yes. The cigar that Colonel Smith broke out of prison with.

924
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,500

- Yeah. Wanna hear the crazy part?  - Yes.

925
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,920
实验检测到这里面含有足以致命剂量的河豚毒素 
Lab reports show lethal amounts of, wait for it, tetrodotoxin.

926
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,130
河豚毒素   那是什么
Tetrodotoxin? What is that?

927
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,220
-可以濒死的药物  -能让人成为睡美人的玩意

931
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,770
你觉得是中情局的人来找的史密斯吗
Come on, do you really think that the CIA came to the prison to visit Smith?

932
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,730
虽然有些离谱  但我觉得是中情局帮他越狱的
This sounds kind of crazy, but l think the CIA broke him out.

933
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,020
谁帮的忙
Who put us on?

934
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,570
就是在巴格达的那个人  中情局的林奇
The same guy that put us on in Baghdad. Lynch, CIA.

935
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,450

What are we talking about? Clean records? Reinstatements?

936
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,200
都是
All of the above.

937

要他们付出代价
Payback.

939
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,080
他们在交换什么  在做什么
What are they exchanging?  What is that?

940
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,590
他就是这样进来的吗
Is that how he got this in here?

941
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,180
找找两张图中的不图之处
One of these things is not like the other.

942
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,430
这种游戏我可不在行
I suck at these games.

943
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,640
模板从哪座楼里带出来的  模板上倒映的是什么

史密斯在向我们暗示什么  这不会是巧合
Smith is talking to us. This is not accidental.

947
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,980
这家伙总是胸有成竹  
With this guy, there's a plan and two to back it up.

948
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,150
你不是指什么因果报应吧
l take it you didn't get religion inside.

949
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,070
不  是复仇

1182
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,320
什么两万英尺
What are you talking about, 20,000 feet?

1183
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,290
-咱们启动旧火力系统吧  -见鬼
- Let's fire up the old weapons system.  - What the hell, man?

1184
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,330
博斯克  这儿闷死了  我要开个窗
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy. I'm gonna pop a window!

1185
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,670
奶奶滴  看谁有能耐  比比吧
What you got, bitches? What you got?

1186
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,140
小白  也让我来耍耍  快点嘛
Let me have a turn, Face! Come on!

1187
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,100
-我们怎么会呆在一个坠落的坦克里  -因为飞机爆炸了
- Why are we in a falling tank?  - Because the plane exploded!

1188
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,930
什么  啥时候  
What... What? When?

1189

- The Reapers shot it down!  - What Reapers?

1191
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,610
就是那些现在还穷追不舍的家伙
The same ones that are still trying to kill us!

1192
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,110
-汉尼拔  都怪你  -严格来讲  我们没在飞了嘛  
- l blame you, Hannibal!  - Technically, we're not flying.

1193
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,570
废话  我们是在坠落  混蛋
I know! Because we're falling, fool!

1194
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,540
额滴神啊
Oh, Jesus!

1195
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,750
2号无人机坠落  我们损失了一架无人机
UAV-2 has splashed down. We just lost one of the drones.

1196
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,260
汉尼拔  这下我们惨了
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

1197
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,970
伙计们绷紧了
Brace yourselves!

1198
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,300
爽翻天了
Awesome!

1199
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,720
小白  你操纵主炮  
Face, get on to the main gun!

1200
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,060
离这八百米的地方有个湖
There's a lake a half-mile away from this position.

1201
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,060
-我操他妈的朝谁开火啊  -相信我
- What the hell am l trying to hit?  - Trust me!

1202
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,980
-把机枪转到82度  -开火
- Rotate the turret 82 degrees.  - Fire in the hole!

1204
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,320
开火
Fire!

1205
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,080
他们是想再射落一架无人机吗
Are they trying to shoot down that other drone?

1206
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,830
不  他们是在驾驶坦克
No. They're trying to fly that tank.

1207
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,370
-坦克飞起来咯  -坦克飞不起来  傻逼
- He's flying the tank!  - You can't fly a tank, fool!

再转到34度
Rotate 34 degrees now!

1211
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,590
-汉尼拔  -等下

1213
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,520
-控制中心  我们失去了无人机  -确定击中了吗 
- Control, we have lost...  - Is that a confirmed hit?

1214
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,690
右转正前方  待命
Bring turret full-front and wait!

1215
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:12,980
默多克  关闭舱门 
Murdock! Close the hatch!

1216
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,650
收到  这样能行不 
Hatch, okay! Did that work? Did that work?

1217
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,240
-头儿  -加把劲呀

-加把劲  -关好舱口没
- Come on.  - Hatch control?

1219
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,780
我还不想这么早死 
I'm too young to die!

1220
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,160
头儿  现在都不用瞄准了
Boss! I'm aiming at nothing!

1221
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,160
加把劲

我的驾驶技术如何

1226
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,140
-上帝保佑呀  上帝显灵吧  -加把劲
- Get right with God, y'all! This is it!   - Come on!

1227
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,610
这对鱼类不公平
It's not fair to the fish!

1228
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,110
你作弊
You're cheating!

1229
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,620
真唠叨
You with your nagging...

1230
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,120
把鱼都吓跑了
...you're chasing them away!

1231
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,120
中情局国外办事处

1232

德国  法兰克福

1233
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,020
好了  辛勤的小蜜蜂
All right. Busy bees, busy bees.

1234
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:31,690
把外套脱了吧  太他妈热了
Guys, you can take your coats off. Hot as hell in here.

1235
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,360
热得跟蒸桑拿一样
I'm sweating like a whore in church.

1236
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,570
-长官  -什么事
- Sir.  - Yeah?

1237
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:37,860
史密斯一伙人在德国曼海姆劫了一架C1 30运输机
Smith and his team were engaged in a C-1 30 over Mannheim, Germany,

1238
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,740
还击落了两架无人机
by two Reaper drones.

1239
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,030
不知道是不是数据加密出了故障
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch,

1240
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,160
但报告里说是被一辆坦克击落
but it says that they were shot down in a tank.

1241
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:50,210
北美空防司令部想掩盖为失踪  但麻烦的是我们
NORAD's calling it an X-out, but there is a conflicting report.

1242
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,500
我就知道
I'm sure there is.

1243
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:55,090
一名德国老妇说她看到一辆坦克
I've got a German Hausfrau who says she saw a tank

1244
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:59,010
从沃格斯坦湖里驶出来  坦克里有个人长得很像默多克
drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee with a guy resembling Murdock...

1245
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,340
打扰一下  柏林怎么走
Excuse me, which way to Berlin?

1246
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:04,390
-问她柏林去怎么走  -这不可能
- ...asking for directions to Berlin.  - That's impossible.

1247
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:08,720
史密斯一周内都死了两次了
Well, this will be the second time Smith has died this week.

1248
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,430
对他们来说还有什么不可能的呢
ls that possible?

1249
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,500
美国驻欧洲指挥部

1250
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,500
德国  斯图加特

1251
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,730
-有什么消息  -看看这个
- What have you got for me?  - Look at this.

1252
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,990
我们对史密斯的访客图像进行了还原
We just got the unscrambled composite of Smith's visitor in prison,

1253
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,450
但没有查到该人身份
but with no lD on the subject yet.

1254
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,830
你好  帅哥
Hello, handsome.

1255
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,660
等下  我以前见过他
Wait, I've seen this person before.

1256
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,770
我认识这人
l know this guy.

1257
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,090
巴格达
Baghdad.

1258
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,380
给我洗张清晰的出来  我们开始行动
Get me a clean patch to Langley. We're going fishing.

1259
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,010
我都没听说过
I barely even heard about it.

1260
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,680
我零碎地听说了些  但这些怎么跟我们扯上了关系
I mean, I heard bits and pieces of it, but how much of that was us?

1261
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,100
-我已经  -我在说话呢
- So, l have a...  - l was talking.

1262
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,600
-不会和我们牵扯上的  -别说了好吗  
- It's never us.  - Can you stop?

1263
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,980
国防部的索萨中尉打来电话
l have a DoD hardline from Lieutenant Sosa.

1264
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,730
她找林奇特工
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

1265
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,110
林奇特工没空  一直没空
He's not available, ever.

1266
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,190
巴格达的林奇特工
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

1267
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,700
在莫里森将军的帐篷那次
General Morrison's tent?

1268
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,450
出去
Out.

1269
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,490
为什么雇她
Why do we have her?

1270
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,290
因为她超有个性
She's got a fantastic personality. That's why.

1271
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,210
请问哪位
With whom am l speaking?

1272
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:19,130
我是索萨上  中尉  你是林奇特工吗
This is Capt... uh Lieutenant Sosa. ls this Agent Lynch?

1273
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,460
不好意思  我不知道你的名字  
I'm sorry, I don't have a first name.

1274
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,050
我也不知道  有何贵干  中尉
Neither do I. So, what can l do you for, Lieutenant?

1275
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,180
我看见一张你在卡森要塞
I'm looking at an image of you

1276
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,260
训练营的照片
from the disciplinary barracks at Fort Carson.

1277
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,270
真性感
She's hot.

1278
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,230
你在监狱里探访过前上校汉尼拔・史密斯吗
Did you visit former Colonel Hannibal Smith in prison?

1279
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,730
我不知道你在说什么  前上尉
I don't know what you're talking about, former Captain.

1280
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,570
林奇特工  如果是你协助史密斯逃走
Agent Lynch, if you facilitated Smith's escape

1281
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,780
并且正在暗中协助和支持他的话
and are currently aiding and abetting him...

1282
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,870
那可真是 
Ooh. Buddy.

1283
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,830
要是换作是你  这么做的话
lf you can make something like that stick,

1284
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,410
可就一步登天了啊
your next promotion should be in the five-star range.

1285
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,540
如果你还要协助他们抢回模板
And if you're helping to retrieve those engraving plates,

1286
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,380
那我就不得不出手阻止你了
I'm going to have to go out of my way to disappoint you.

1287
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:17,020
查出她的电话  电脑和其它辅助设备
I want her phones, her computers, any support packages she operates.

1288
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,310
我要掌握一切  我要拦截她的所有情报
I wanna know everything. I want active intercept taps on everything she's got.

1289
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,230
从现在开始监视她的一举一动
l want every move monitored from this moment forward.

1290
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,190
她可是国防部的人
You realize she's DoD.

1291
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,950
她是天王老子我也不怕  照做
I don't care if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1292
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,030
长官  看看这个
Boss, check this out.

1293
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,250
这张照片上  帕克是在法兰克福的孔希斯银行
We've tracked this photograph of Pike to the K?nigsbank in Frankfurt.

1294
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,040
监控录像记录了上个月
Our surveillance has him and an unknown Arab

1295
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,500
他一直和一个阿拉伯人一起
making regular trips from the train station to the bank

1296
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,540
从火车站到银行去
all over the last month.

1297
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,710
-帕克大意了  -要是我们查到了
- Pike's getting sloppy.  - Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1298
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,380
史密斯那伙人会不会也盯上了他们
what are the odds that Smith and his team are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1299
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:50,800
不  不  这是国防部的高度机密信息
No, no, no, this is a direct pull-down from the Pentagon's database.

1300
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:53,560
史密斯他们绝不可能得到这情报
There's absolutely no way Smith and his team could have this stuff.

1301
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,390
不要低估他们  他们的情报远比我们得要多
I think we should assume they have more information than us at all times.

1302
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,190
帕克自上个月以来  就一直把模板
Pike has been moving the stolen engraving plates

1303
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,150
往法兰克福的孔希斯银行大楼运送
to the Konigsbank Tower in Frankfurt over the past month.

1304
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,820
明天是最后一批箱子
Tomorrow, the last of the cases containing these plates

1305
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,240
之后将转交给阿拉伯人
will be transferred to the Arab.

1306
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,570
这是过去六个月来
This will mark the only time in the last six months

1307
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,450
这些模板第一次集中出现
that all of the plates have been in one location.

1308
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,790
要夺回它们  这是最好也是唯一的一次机会
It's our best and only shot at getting them back.

1309
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,540
他们离开孔希斯银行大楼  乘坐七点一刻到苏黎世的火车
They leave the Konigsbank Tower for the 7:15 train to Zurich.

1310
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:24,670
先生们  我们可不能让他们如愿了
Gentlemen, we're gonna make sure they miss that train.

1311
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,920
-小白  -在
- Face?  - Yeah.

1312
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,130
去找你的旧爱吧
Time to bring in your former flame.

1313
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,590
要是她真如我所料那般犀利
If she's as good as l think,

1314
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,300
现在就该去法兰克福了  为了拦截那些模板
then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt to intercept those plates.

1315
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,310
-你为何要关照她  -她是个理想主义者 
- Why would you tip her off?  - She's a crusader,

1316
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,350
也许我们之后会用得到她
and we're gonna need her teed up at some point.

1317
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,900
提高警惕  伙计们
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

1318
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,690
查瑞莎・索萨
Charissa Sosa...

1319
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,650
查瑞莎・索萨
Charissa Sosa...

1320
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,150
问题在于  
Now the wrinkle.

1321
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,700
要是索萨盯上了我们  也就可以推测  林奇也盯上了她
If Sosa's onto us, we can assume that Lynch is onto her.

1322
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,540
要是林奇觉得她是个麻烦人物
And if he thinks she stands beteen him and those plates,

1323
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,540
他就会毫不犹豫地干掉她 
he won't hesitate to kill her.

1324
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,670
小白  去火车站
Face, get to the train station.

1325
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,170
我是索萨
This is Sosa.

1326
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,880
要是林奇威胁到她  你要负责搞定
If there's a threat from Lynch, deal with it.

1327
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,680
喂
Hello?

1328
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,060
可以开枪  重复一遍  可以开枪
Shoot is green. Say again, shoot is green.

1329
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,470
喂
Hello?

1330
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,730
不对劲
Something's wrong.

1331
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,820
我们成了靶子  快撤  这情况不妙
We're marked, guys. Pull back. I don't like this at all.

1332
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,620
记住  别被人看到
See. Don't be seen.

1333
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,330
-你好  美人儿  -你真够胆
- Hello, beautiful.  - You have got some balls.

1334
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,960
-居然丢给我个手机  -没办法
- You put a drop phone on me?  - l had to, babe.

1335
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,830
只有这样我才能跟你说话  林奇掌握着你所有的通讯线路
It's the only way I could talk to you. Lynch has all your comm lines.

1336
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,340
-你都快撤掉你的人  -我会找到你的  小白
- I want you to pull your team now.  - I'm gonna find you, Face.

1337
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,220
不要跟她或其他任何人直接接触
But do not engage her or anyone else directly.

1338
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,670
我先找到你再说吧
Not if l find you first.

1339
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,350
别  好了  好了
Come on, all right... Okay. Okay.

1340
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,600
往 这 儿 看

1341
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,690
天啊
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1342
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:10,980
-你到底想怎么样  -救你命
- What the hell are you doing?  - Trying to save you!

1343
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,490
查瑞莎
Charissa.

1344
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:21,040
你知道我们是无辜的  你心里清楚  
Come on, you know we're innocent. You know this.

1345
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,160
你在撒谎  就像你在巴格达那样
You're lying. Like you lied in Baghdad.

1346
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,170
我不知道  我对模板的事一无所知
I did not know. l knew nothing about the plates.

1347
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,420
当时的确不知道
At that... At that time.

1348
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,960
你谎话连篇
You are completely full of shit!

1349
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,470
你就别一套一套的了
Will you stop selling yourself on that

1350
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,180
当时明明是你骗了我
and avoiding the fact that you lied to me!

1351
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,340
-明明是你骗我  -什么时候  
- You're the one that misled me.  - When?

1352
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,510
-得了  你想翻旧账吗  -不错
- Come on. You wanna go there?  - Yeah, let's go there.

1353
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,390
你知道我是玩玩的  你也就想和我玩玩
You heard l was a player and you wanted to play.

1354
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:42,640
但我开始变得认真了  你就慌了
And then l got serious and you freaked!

1355
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,890
-我慌了吗  我才没有慌  -你慌了
- Oh, l freaked? l did not freak!  - Yes, you did.

1356
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:48,520
你惊慌失措  然后落跑
You panicked and you ran.

1357
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:56,360
想想吧  查瑞莎
Charissa, come on.

1358
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:59,660
我可是联邦逃犯  你也知道我被通缉
I'm a federal fugitive. You know exactly how wanted I am.

1359
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:03,830
你觉得我干嘛来法兰克福  来找老情人吗  才不是
You think I came to Frankfurt to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1360
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,370
我之所以来这儿  因为不是我们干的  我们是被人陷害
I'm here because we didn't do this. I'm here because we were set up.

1361
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:11,090
我相信最终会真相大白  所以我来这里冒险
I'm here because, in the end, the truth is worth the risk.

1362
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:17,300
就算你不信任我  我也相信你
And I believe in you, even if you don't believe in me.

1363
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,470
天  我都忘了你原来这么美
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

1364
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,860
收好这部手机
Hold on to that phone.

1365
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,370
我的老天
OH MY GOD!

1366
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,580
他有枪
HE'S GOT A GUN!

1367
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,080
就在那儿  他有枪
RlGHT THERE! HE'S GOT A GUN!

1368
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,880
枪
A GUN!

1369
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,340
真废柴
Sucker.

1370
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,130
-见鬼  -派克在哪儿
- Oh, shit.  - Where's Peck?

1371
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,220
别光是问  快去找他
Excellent question. Find him!

1372
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,550
请保持镇静  从最近的出口离开
Please stay calm and go to the nearest exit.

1373
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:11,090
孔希斯银行大楼

1374
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,090
德国  法兰克福

1375
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,090
三号通道见
Meet you up on corridor three.

1376
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,420
三号报告  现在一切正常
Three to base. We're all clear at this time.

1377
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:44,300
包裹安全后给我确认一下
Give me confirmation as soon as the package is secure.

1378
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,100
我们要看到视频监视画面
We need a video feed.

1379
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,290
好了  开始吧
Okay, let's dance.

1380
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,880
各就各位  准备行动
Coming down. Positions, prepare to move.

1381
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,460
像平时一样  跟紧我  先生
As always, stay close to me, sir.

1382
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,150
正在关闭第十层
Closing off the 10th floor.

1383
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,770
十层的人   我们需要支援
Tenth floor, we need backup.

1384
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,650
回来
Get back! Get back!

1385
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,240
我什么都看不见
l can't see anything.

1386
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,650
头儿  情况如何
How we doing there, big man?

1387
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,410
默多克  接好阿拉伯人 
Murdock, here comes the Arab.

1388
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,160
这是一个向左边中场的
And here's a long drive

1389
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,160
长传远射
hit deep into left center field.

1390
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:52,210
默多克杀了回来  他是背水一战  竟然接住了
Murdock's back, he's at the wall, and he makes the catch!

1391
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,500
我喘不过气来了
I can't breathe.

1392
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,670
这是个圈套
It's a trap!

1393
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,800
皮特  我们需要支援
Pete, we need backup!

1394
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,020
怪头  箱子丢了  
B.A., I lost the case.

1395
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,480
我受到攻击  准备撤离
I'm taking fire. I'm out of here.

1396
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:31,160
怪头  快去拿回模板
B.A., get to those plates.

1397
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,550
一群联邦政府人员已经对
Deutsche Federal is responding to explosions and shots fired

1398
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,760
-孔希斯大楼的爆炸和枪击做出了反应  -赶快离开这里
- at the Konigsbank building.  - Get us out of this mess and get us

1399
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,930
-赶去大楼那边  -遵命  
- to that building as soon as possible.  - Yes, ma'am.

1400
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,210
是你逼我的  拜库斯
You made me work for this one, Baracus.

1401
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:02,040
没想到我会这么狼狈
I didn't think l was this out of shape.

1402
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,300
真不走运  
I am, unfortunately.

1403
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,380
其他人呢
Where's the rest of the team, huh?

1404
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,640
史密斯  派克  还有那个傻逼飞行员  他叫什么来着
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot, the asshole. What's his name?

1405
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,310
我要把你打得屁股尿流  拜库斯  看看你有什么能耐
I'm gonna take this one out of your ass, Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1406
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,690
来啊  发什么愣  没力气了吗  
Come on. What are you doing? What, are you tired?

1407
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,940
我不想伤害你  老兄
I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1408
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,030
不  你伤不了我  等着挨揍吧
No, you're not gonna hurt me, I'm gonna hurt you.

1409
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,700
-我不想杀了你  伙计  -你不想吗  
- l don't wanna kill you, man.  - You don't wanna kill me?

1410
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,710
你根本杀不了我  我要杀了你  拜库斯
You're not gonna kill me. I'm gonna kill you, Baracus.

1411
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:40,920
我没在开玩笑  帕克
I'm not playing with you, Pike.

1412
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,040
来吧  我有两把枪  记得吧  我是左撇子  
Here we go, because I got two guns. I'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1413
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:46,500
刚刚打斗的时候  枪已经上膛了吧
So, as soon as that hammer goes back, it's on.

1414
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,300
我发誓  我做得出来
I swear to God, I'll do it.

1415
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,380
你不是懦夫吧
You're not a coward, are you?

1416
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,090
是不
Are you?

1417
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:58,270
真难看
Whoopsy.

1418
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,430
去你妈的
Damn!

1419
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,100
-要搭车吗  大块头  -你救了我一命  老兄
- Need a ride, big fella?  - You're a life-saver, man.

1420
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:02,270
我下不了手
I couldn't shoot him.

1421
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,200
让开  趴下
Get out of the way! Get down! Get down!

1422
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,150
这么多条子
Yeah, this is about the right amount of cops.

1423
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:51,360
你真可爱  你应该庆幸周围都是人  
That's cute. You're lucky there are people around.

1424
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,240
不  亲爱的  你才应该庆幸
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1425
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,910
你不热下再吃吗
You eat that cold?

1426
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:04,670
我不讲究
Any way I can get it.

1427
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,420
屋顶有处地方漏了
There's a leak in the roof.

1428
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,500
好多处都漏了
There's a lot of them.

1429
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,090
-他们回来了  -是的
- Is that them?  - I got it.

1430
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,850
好吧  我没偷看过阿拉伯人
All right. Not a peep out of the Arab.

1431
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,760
索萨当时在火车站
Sosa was at the train station.

1432
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,100
-你见她了吗  -是的
- You saw her?  - Yeah.

1433
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:24,140
你和她谈过了吗
Did you talk to her?

1434
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:26,940
我别无选择  好吗  相信我
I had no choice, okay? Just trust me on that.

1435
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,860
信你个头  一涉及到女人你就头脑发热
I trust you to make historically bad decisions

1436
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,360
尽出昏招  
as far as women are concerned.

1437
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,780
你到底是怎么想的
What part of you is thinking at the moment?

1438
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,110
林奇的人要杀她  我必须阻止
Lynch's men moved in on her and l had to react.

1439
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,570
这不是你派我去的初衷吗
That's why you wanted me there in the first place...

1440
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,740
是去阻止而不是去泡她
To stop them! Not to engage her!

1441
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:41,240
只有先泡上了她  我才能去阻止他们
I couldn't do one without the other.

1442
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,870
得了  我很怀疑 
Please. Somehow I doubt that.

1443
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,790
你干嘛这么生气  我们找回了模板  
Hey. What are you so pissed about? We got the plates.

1444
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,210
她也得到了情报
You wanted her teed up. She's teed up.

1445
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,630
她知道我们没偷
She knows we didn't steal them.

1446
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,970
她肯定急于查出真正的幕后黑手
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1447
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,890
什么
What?

1448
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:07,230
你一定知道
You had to know.

1449
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:15,240
你一定知道  如果你留我一条命  这一刻迟早会到来
You had to know if you left me alive, that this was coming.

1450
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,120
你怎么会不知道呢
How could you not?

1451
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:35,420
你教会了我一切
You taught me almost everything I know.

1452
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:40,600
汉尼拔  你认识这个人吗
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1453
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,440
我们都认识
We all do.

1454
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,860
莫里森
Morrison?

1455
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,820
不是吧
Hell, no.

1456
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,490
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1457
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,540
不知道这算不算祝福  行动顺利  朋友
Not so sure that it is a blessing, but good hunting, my friend.

1458
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:12,380
谢谢
Thank you.

1459
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,050
你个贱人
You son of a bitch.

1460
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:23,430
莫里森  真天杀的
Morrison? Holy shit.

1461
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,940
你不是将军
You're not a general.

1462
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,400
你把他怎么了
How could you do this to him?

1463
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,730
你对得起我们吗
How could you do this to us?

1464
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,820
你不配当将军
You know nothing about leading men.

1465
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:44,700
我就知道  林奇如果协助我逃跑  那你肯定也有参与其中
I knew if Lynch helped me escape, you had to be part of it.

1466
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,170
你和帕克利用模板和林奇达成协议
You and Pike were making a play on those plates with Lynch,

1467
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,500
但你背叛了他  
and you turned on him.

1468
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,920
就像你背叛我们一样
The way you turned on us.

1469
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,340
林奇本来就没把我们算在内
Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1470
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,760
他只是在利用我们
He was gonna use us.

1471
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,260
为保险起见他才把你拉进来
He brought you on as insurance.

1472
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:08,020
你就没想过  这是背叛了你的挚友吗
He never thought you'd betray your oldest living friend.

1473
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,770
我只是先下手为强  汉尼拔  我是个战士
I just hit first, Hannibal. I'm a fighting man.

1474
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,480
你是个骗子  叛徒
You're a liar and a traitor!

1475
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,860
别废话了  杀了我
Then don't draw this out. Kill me.

1476
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,480
好主意呀
That's a fantastic idea!

1477
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,000
头儿  让我来
Bos, let me do this.

1478
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,740
小白   我可不杀人
Face, I ain't killing nobody.

1479
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:27,950
你不杀  我杀
You're not, Bosco. I am.

1480
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,210
不管他说啥  别杀他  好吗
No matter what he says, do not kill him, okay?

1481
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,040
不想看就别过头去
You guys don't wanna watch? Just turn your heads.

1482
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,880
-我不赞成杀他  -我也很想杀了他
- I'm not gonna be party to it neither.  - I wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

1483
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,250
但他是我们的救命稻草
but he's our ticket out.

1484
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,460
他终于不说疯话了  听他一回
He knows what he's talking about for once. Listen to him.

1485
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:41,420
-小白  他是我们唯一的证人  -默多克
- Face, he is our only evidence.  - Murdock, Murdock...

1486
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,840
-明白不  -我们现在都是他害的
- Do you understand?   - He put us here.

1487
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,850
等他给我们做完证再崩了他
You can blow his head off after he testifies, okay?

1488
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:46,890
他把一切都毁了
He's ruined it!

1489
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,510
-好好想想你在做什么  小白  -好了
- Think what you're doing, Face.  -  All right.

1490
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,310
-如果你不能  -够了 兄弟们
- If you can't handle it...  - Boys, enough.

1491
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,690
够了  小白
Enough! That's enough, Face.

1492
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,070
够了  退下
Enough! Step down!

1493
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:58,820
大家都出去
Everybody outside

1494
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,530
我来
I got him.

1495
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,320
-还是让我干掉他吧  -小白  出去
- I don't want you to have to do it.  - Face, outside.

1496
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,490
退下  
Stand down, soldier.

1497
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,160
小白  马上
Face. Now!

1498
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,620
-真他妈愚蠢  -你没事吧  伙计
- Fucking stupid.  - You okay, man?

1499
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,580
你知道莫里森伪装成阿拉伯人
You knew Morrison was masquerading as the Arab.

1500
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,840
-为什么不告诉我  -我也不能百分之百肯定
- Why not share that?  - I wasn't 100% sure.

1501
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,420
只有99%的把握吗
How about 99%?

1502
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,260
你不觉得这很重要吗
Would you think it was worth mentioning then?

1503
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,300
林奇  你到底在想什么
Lynch, what did you think?

1504
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,590
你觉得我会当场杀了他吗
You think I'd just kill him on the spot?

1505
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,100
我知道你不会  我相信你
I was certain of it. I still am.

1506
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,100
你拿到模板了吗
Do you have the plates?

1507
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,850
当然  不然我会打给你吗
I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

1508
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,310
史密斯  归还模板  杀了莫里斯  你们就能洗清罪名
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison, and reclaim your lives.

1509
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,570
我要白宫  国务院
I want signed and authorized amnesty agreements

1510
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,070
和三军参谋长联席会议
for myself and for each of my men.

1511
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,110
所签署并授权的赦免令
From the White House, the State Department

1512
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,240
给我和我的兄弟们
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1513
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:49,830
你听到了吗
You hear me?

1514
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:53,750
再给我点时间
I'm gonna need a little more time.

1515
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,330
要多久
How much?

1516
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,330
目标时间倒计时

1517
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,880
五分钟
Give me five minutes.

1518
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,880
我等着
I'm waiting.

1519
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,690
还不明白吗  汉尼拔
Don't you get it, Hannibal?

1520
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,400
我们为他们打仗  流血  牺牲
We fight for them, we bleed for them, we die for them...

1521
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,190
他们才不管我们死活
They don't give a rat's ass.

1522
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,320
死亡和毁灭
Death and destruction,

1523
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,700
对他们来说无足轻重
they're selling it like it was on the goddamn commodities exchange.

1524
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,660
你别指责他们   和他们无关
Don't push this off on them. This is not about them.

1525
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,500
你所谓的反战已经造成了数十亿美元的损失
Your war protest was stealing billions of dollars!

1526
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:37,960
你到底是谁
Who are you?

1527
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:40,590
我是将军  你是名上校
I am a general. You are a colonel.

1528
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:44,340
我指挥  你行动
I say, "Jump," and you say, "How high?" End of story.

1529
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,420
你该上路了
It is now.

1530
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,600
我亲眼看到你在阿灵顿的墓碑
l saw your tomb at Arlington.

1531
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,600
为国捐躯的军人均葬于此

1532
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:55,770
你是为国捐躯的英雄
You died a national hero.

1533
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,990
死了太便宜你
Death's too easy.

1534
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:13,200
我们再也不想听什么谎言了
And the last thing we need now is another lie.

1535
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,330
别这样  汉尼拔  你欠我那么多
Don't do this. Hannibal, please. You owe me that much.

1536
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,000
是你欠我
You owe me!

1537
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,580
你要去告诉世人  我们是无罪的  
You're gonna tell them we're innocent.

1538
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,130
你欠我的
You owe me.

1539
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,050
汉尼拔  你们所为之而战的东西
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1540
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,220
根本毫无意义
What are you fighting for now, you and those boys?

1541
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:34,100
你们的军衔和名誉  
Your ranks? Your reputations?

1542
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:35,260
都是狗屁
They're shit!

1543
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,640
你们就是罪人  
You're convicts!

1544
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:41,100
不管有没有模板   你们都是联邦逃犯
Plates, no plates, you are federal fugitives,

1545
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:44,980
等他们利用完了你  汉尼拔  照样把你丢弃
and when they're done with you, Hannibal, they just fucking burn you.

1546
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:50,030
祖鲁一号  我是阔剑  准备行动
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword, you're clear to engage.

1547
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:52,450
阔剑  这名字你起的吗
"Broadsword." Did you come up with that?

1548
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:54,910
好酷的名字   阔剑
That's awesome. "Broadsword."

1549
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,660
阔剑
"Broadsword."

1550
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,750
头儿  你会那样做吗
Boss, could you do that?

1551
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,000
对我们  
To us?

1552
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,170
就像莫里森那样对我们
What Morrison did?

1553
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,010
不  永远不会
No. Not in a million years.

1554
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,550
是啊  但你却失算了
Yeah, but you didn't see it coming, though.

1555
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,470
你什么时候就认出他来了
How long did you know it was him?

1556
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,850
你们疯了吗
Are you guys crazy?

1557
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,600
你本来就是疯子  但  小白  你在谴责汉尼拔吗
I know you are, but, Face, are you accusing him?

1558
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:26,020
我宁愿被特警队乱枪打死也不会背叛你们
I'd rather face a firing squad than betray you boys.

1559
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:27,900
自己人不要吵起来
Don't let this tear us apart.

1560
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:29,570
至少现在不能吵
Not now.

1561
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,780
我们现在要比任何时候都团结才行
Not when we need each other like no other time before.

1562
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,700
快跑
Move!

1563
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,550
酷毙了
Wow. That's awesome.

1564
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:57,350
就像使命召唤里的场景  你觉得呢
That looks exactly like Call of Duty, doesn't it?

1565
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,600
好了  要求是  禁止发布新闻
All right. Here's the deal. No press release.

1566
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,980
不要当地法律机关和新闻媒体参与
Keep local law enforcement and media off-site.

1567
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,560
设立4.8公里的隔离和禁飞区 
Get a three-mile cordon, ditto the no-fly zone.

1568
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:09,110
派一支清理小队过去把该死的模板找回来
Get an agency scrub team out there and get me the goddamn plates back.

1569
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:15,160
德国警方已经把你手下所有人都监禁在了孔希斯银行大楼
The German police have your entire team in custody in the Konigsbank Tower.

1570
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:20,870
那不是我的人  是史密斯他们的  我单干
I don't do teams, babe. That's Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act.

1571
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,550
美 国 大 使 馆

1572
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,050
我喜欢轻装出行
I like to travel light.

1573
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:36,590
像忠诚这种东西  我可不带
Stuff like loyalty doesn't fit in the overhead bins.

1574
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,890
我以为你和史密斯是同伙
I thought you and Smith were working together.

1575
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:43,100
你错了
You thought wrong.

1576
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:46,560
我们是有武器  但你也管不着
Yes, we have weapons. No, you may not wand us.

1577
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,730
你想要做交易吗  那就提条件吧
If you want to deal, we can deal.

1578
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:55,780
让我费尽心思使你一败涂地  
How about l dedicate my immediate future

1579
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,410
如何
to destroying yours?

1580
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:02,660
你怎么不聪明一些
How about you get smart and start dealing

1581
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,210
在别人出手之前  先下手为强呢
before somebody else does?

1582
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,630
前任上尉
Former Captain.

1583
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,710
除非你有像这样的文件
Unless you've got a piece of paper that looks exactly like this one,

1584
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,880
不然这个不合作的麻烦家伙归我管
then this troubled young loner belongs to me.

1585
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,260
我们走
Let's go.

1586
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,810
他们到底怎么搞来的引渡令
How the hell did they get an extradition order?

1587
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:23,680
抱歉  帕克  至少我们按规矩办事
Sorry, Pike. At least with me, there are rules.

1588
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:27,000
中情局也有规矩  比你们更高级而已
CIA's got rules. Our rules are just cooler than yours.

1589
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:29,150
-走  -林奇
- Go.  - You know, Lynch,

1590
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:32,820
要是我把你关在这间屋子里  那可是做了一件大好事
if l could seal this room with you inside, l'd be doing the world a big favor.

1591
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,070
那可不好
That's not nice.

1592
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,200
是林奇干的  肯定是他
Lynch? Had to be.

1593
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,740
离火近一些  弟兄们
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1594
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:44,540
要是那架武装机还在附近  那也测不出我们的体热
lf that gunship is still around, it won't read our body heat.

1595
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:48,830
林奇个傻逼  这么心急要干掉我们  根本没想要确定模板的位置
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill us, didn't even bother locating the plates.

1596
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,920
我们现在还能不用武力吗  怪头
Where do we stand on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1597
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,010
你生气了吗  你是该生气
You pissed? You should be.

1598
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:57,510
现在模板有屁用  只有莫里森能帮我们洗脱罪名
Who gives a shit about the plates? Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1599
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:00,180
没有了莫里森  一切都无济于事
And without Morrison, we got nothing.

1600
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,020
-我们怎么办  头儿   -我不知道  默多克
- What do we do, boss?  - I don't know, Murdock.

1601
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,350
-我不知道  -我知道
- I don't know.  - I do.

1602
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:11,900
林奇个混球  我想我知道怎么对付他了
This guy Lynch, I think I got him figured out.

1603
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,530
-你有计划了吗  小子  -我们怎么离开这儿
- You got a plan, kid?  - How do we get out of here?

1604
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:17,320
给我二十分钟先
Give me 20 minutes.

1605
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:25,660
所以莫里森和史密斯那伙人都死了
So, Morrison's dead. Smith and his team are dead.

1606
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:28,790
15分钟后我们就能找到印刷模板
Another 15 minutes or so, we locate those engraving plates.

1607
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:30,420
你在幸灾乐祸吗
What is this? Are you gloating?

1608
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,880
不  我是在打击你  谁让你们背叛了我
No, this is me beating you after you burned me.

1609
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,300
-我们做了交易  记得吗  -我们没做交易
- We had a deal, remember?  - Not you and me.

1610
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,130
-你  我  还有莫里森  -我不是直接和你交易
- You, me and Morrison.  - Not you and me, directly.

1611
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,800
所以你俩自己密谋  把我排除在外
And you two collude and cut me out.

1612
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:44,680
你在干嘛  真要在车里杀人吗
Hey. What are you doing? In the car?

1613
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,270
要在车里杀人吗
Are we doing... Are we gonna do this in the car?

1614
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,430
-你来杀吗  -不是  他来
- You doing this?  - He's gonna do it.

1615
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,020
好吧  在这儿死真是不错
Way to go. That's brilliant, right there.

1616
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,770
你要干嘛  他在干嘛  老天
What are you doing? What is he doing?

1617
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,570
-天啊  -怎么样了  凯尔  
- Jesus.  - How's it going, Kyle?

1618
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,730
-你还好吧  -还好
- You all right?  - I'm good.

1619
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,610
老兄  你好个鬼  你在干什么
Brother, you are far from good. What are you doing?

1620
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,660
欧版消音器
It's a European silencer.

1621
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,080
逆时针装消音器  你就那样拿枪吗
It's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise. You're holding a gun like that?

1622
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,990
你以前也像这样拿枪吗  你居然能活到现在
You've held a gun like that before and you're still here?

1623
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,580
真是奇迹
That's amazing.

1624
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,330
-别指着我  -天啊  当作我最后的请求
- Don't point that thing...  - Jesus. Final request,

1625
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,000
不要让这家伙开枪打我
don't let this guy shoot me, please.

1626
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,510
如果让索萨知道我们还活着 
So, if Sosa knows we're alive...

1627
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,050
她就会相信莫里森也还活着
She'll believe Morrison is alive, too.

1628
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:26,100
但愿林奇还在监听索萨的通讯线路
Let's just hope that Lynch still has Sosa's comm lines.

1629
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,060
我是索萨
This is Sosa.

1630
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:33,770
莫里森将军在我手里
General Morrison is in my possession.

1631
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,440
什么  抱歉  我听不清  你是哪位
What? I'm sorry. l can't hear you. Who is this?

1632
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,740
-还没干掉他呀  -不是吧
- Okay, this was not well thought out.  - No shit.

1633
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,700
看着  我来教你怎么杀我 
I mean, look at this. Am I to teach you how to kill me?

1634
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,490
帮个忙  好吗  拿起枪管
Hey, do me a favor, all right? Put the barrel...

1635
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,030
拿起枪管对准我的头
Put the gun flush to my head.

1636
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,870
-确定吗  -对了  就是这儿
- Are you sure?  - There you go, right there.

1637
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,370
-子弹会横穿过去吗  -在你先打伤其他人之前
- Is that going to go through?  - Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1638
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,750
好了  我们没事了
There you go. We're okay. We're okay.

1639
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,670
绝不要反铐住一个坐着的人
Never cuff a man in a seated position with his hands behind his back.

1640
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,590
这样就看不到他的手了
Makes it impossible to see the hands.

1641
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,170
太酷了
That was cool.

1642
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,220
-你喜欢吗  -喜欢
- You like that?  - I like that.

1643
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,880
非常喜欢  
I like that a lot.

1644
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,680
你还好吗  蠢货
Are you all right, you idiot?

1645
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,640
-是的  这一下真带劲  -给他拷上手铐
- Yeah. It was a good hit.  - Please handcuff him.

1646
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,640
我们还要手铐干嘛  不用了
We don't need to use them again. We don't need the cuffs.

1647
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:11,890
你知道自己在和谁说话吗
Who are you talking to?

1648
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,810
-布拉德  要手机还是要枪  选一个  -天啊
- Brad, phone or gun.  - Jesus.

1649
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:15,000
手机还是枪  选一个
Phone or gun. Pick.

1650
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,360
-把枪放下  -我没有背叛你  是莫里森的主意
- Put the gun down.  - Hey, l didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1651
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,740
我真想打死你
l really wanna shoot you.

1652
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,820
你得听这个电话  长官
You gotta hear this, sir.

1653
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,530
你是史密斯吗 
Is this Smith?

1654
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,410
前上校打给前上尉  真有趣
From a former colonel to a former captain,

1655
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:30,540
我知道大约三十秒你就可以锁定信号
I know I've got about 30 seconds before you lock this signal.

1656
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:33,750
所以听着  我们可以证明自己的清白 
So listen, we can prove our innocence.

1657
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,250
好吧  慢点说
Okay. All right. Now, go back.

1658
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,920
你刚说你抓了莫里森将军吗
Did you say you have Morrison? You have General Morrison?

1659
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,130
-是的  -他还活着吗
- Correct.  - You have him alive?

1660
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:44,970
好得很  所以林奇想杀我们灭口
And well, despite Lynch trying to wipe us out wholesale.

1661
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,350
电话里说不清  但莫里森的证词可以证明我们清白
Too much to explain now but Morrison's testimony frees us

1662
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,270
揭发林奇的罪行
and fries Lynch.

1663
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,400
没有模板可不行
Well, not without the plates.

1664
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,310
也在我这儿
Also in mypossession.

1665
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,440
记住  林奇以为我们已经死了  不要让他知道
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead, and I want to keep it that way.

1666
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,990
-好的  成交  -给我支笔
- All right. We'll deal.  - Give me a pen.

1667
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,530
-何时何地  -给我支笔  有谁有笔吗
- Where and when?  - Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1668
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,410
-洛杉矶码头  四十八小时后的凌晨  -你还用笔呀
- LA docks, 48 hours, dawn.  - You still use a pen?

1669
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,950
我把莫里森和模板带来
I deliver Morrison and the plates.

1670
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,000
作为回报  我要求在民事法庭上重审
In return, I want a retrial in front of a civilian court.

1671
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,670
好  成交 
All right. We'll deal.

1672
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,500
洛杉矶码头  四十八小时后见
LA docks, 48 hours from now.

1673
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:25,300
你们若敢耍花招  交易就取消
Any bullshit from your end, and that's it, deal's off.

1674
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:30,470
-找到他了吗  -没有
- Did we get him?  - No.

1675
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,430
帕克  
Pike.

1676
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,350
你相信有第二次机会吗
You believe in second chances?

1677
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:40,400
现在相信了
I do now.

1678
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,480
说太多了吗
Too much?

1679
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,860
还好  差点就被定位了
I thought you were spot-on.

1680
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,410
该我了
My turn.

1681
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:54,000
小白来电

1682
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,920
收好这部手机
Hold on to that phone.

1683
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,800
我是索萨
This is Sosa.

1684
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,260
你好  美人儿
Hello, beautiful.

1685
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:14,270
谢谢
Thank you.

1686
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,440
他们这下原形毕露了  看怪头那样  
They got the raw end of the deal, didn't they? Look at B.A.

1687
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:27,650
跟个大香蕉似的
He looks like a huge banana.

1688
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:30,070
早上好  朋友
Good morning, my friend.

1689
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,160
早上好
Good morning.

1690
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,210
你是宾基・拉宾诺维兹神父吗
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1691
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:42,840
见鬼  我给错护照了吗
What passport did I give you?

1692
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,380
你从坦桑尼亚来的吗  我妈妈也是坦桑尼亚人
You're from Tanzania. My mother is from Tanzania.

1693
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:46,960
-见鬼  -这什么情况
- Oh, shit.  - What the hell happened?

1694
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,350
-让非洲人信犹太教  -这里是六号岗台
- ...converting Africans to Judaism. - This is station six...

1695
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,480
我就是做这些事
Stuff like that.

1696
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,020
准备行动  我右边有三个
Let's get ready to move. There's three to my right.

1697
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:04,820
后面有两个  东北出口有一个
There's two behind me and one at the northeast exit.

1698
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,740
等等
Wait a sec.

1699
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,490
祝好
Shalom.

1700
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,830
-他在干嘛  -默多克  正在编他的生平事迹
- What's he doing? - It's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1701
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:27,420
上帝在我心
There is a God.

1702
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,420
-你会说斯瓦希里语吗  -你不会吗
- You speak Swahili?  - You don't?

1703
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:32,180
接下去有的忙了吗  小子
You got enough to work with, kid?

1704
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:33,260
好吧
We will.

1705
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:36,970
咱现在选择穿过大西洋
You and l have some major favors moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1706
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:40,100
到一艘做黑市交易的深海货船上去
It's a deep-sea freighter, shipping strictly black-market merch.

1707
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,770
我们怎么离开呢
How do we get out to her?

1708
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,350
我说的就是一艘普通的旧船
A boat. A plain old boat.

1709
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,190
默多克  坐船渡海  太帅了
This is what I'm talking about, Murdock. Traveling the open seas in style.

1710
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:49,740
我就喜欢这种交通工具  没的比  船这么安全  
This is the way l like to travel. classy-like. The way people used to, safe.

1711
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:50,900
还坐什么飞机
We don't need a plane.

1712
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:54,200
博斯克  但愿有一天我们能帮你克服飞行恐惧症
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1713
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,370
什么
What?

1714
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:58,120
这原来不是船呀
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1715
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,710
只是今天还不行
Just not today.

1716
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,540
默多克  给我记住
Murdock, don't you remember what l said?

1717
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:06,290
-你得自己背他过去了  -你得自己背他过去了
- I said you have to catch him...  - You have to catch him...

1718
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,460
-你把他弄昏了之后  -你把他弄昏了之后
- ...after you inject him.  - ...after you inject him.

1719
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,800
我错了
My bad.

1720
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,370
见鬼  我的头痛死了
Damn it! My head, man.

1721
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:48,460
-你最爱的椰奶咖喱橄榄沙司哟   -快给我  傻蛋
- Coconut- curry tapenade, your favorite.  - Give me that, fool.

1722
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,920
吐司呢
You get them toast points?

1723
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,510
给  吐司这就来了
Voila! Toast points.

1724
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:59,220
你非得又把我弄晕吗
Y'all knocked me out again, huh?

1725
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:03,180
听好  把你弄昏的是
Okay, now, the whole injection, knocking out,

1726
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,690
汉尼拔和小白
Hannibal and Face.

1727
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,810
而我是给你做咖喱橄榄沙司滴
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1728
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:11,900
但我明明是脸朝地摔倒的  
Why do l feel like l fell on my face?

1729
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,110
还骗我
Huh? Tell me that.

1730
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,660
林奇是个矛盾体  
Lynch is a paradox.

1731
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,620
默多克  你发现了吗
Murdock, you done with that?

1732
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:26,210
他本该匿名工作  却偏喜欢受人关注
This is a guy who needs anonymity, but he loves theatricality.

1733
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,210
他是个行政官员  不是个执行者 
He's an administrator, he's not an operator.

1734
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,970
在哪儿
Where is it?

1735
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,010
漂亮
Very nice.

1736
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,760
所以他总是尽力远离现场
So he stays as far away from the point of impact as possible,

1737
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,180
绝不会直接参与进去
and never gets his hands dirty if he can help it.

1738
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:45,810
但我们要改变现状
But we're gonna change all that.

1739
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,560
你骗不了一个职业骗子
You can't hustle a hustler, fool.

1740
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,070
这玩意不能靠近火星和火苗  甚至闪光灯都不行
No sparks, no flames, not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1741
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,650
慢点
Easy, easy.

1742
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:59,910
这家伙绝不会出现在事发现场
This guy is never at the flashpoint of anything.

1743
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,200
而是在幕后高枕无忧地暗中操纵
He's safe and sound somewhere, pulling the strings.

1744
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,370
妈妈
Mama. Mama.

1745
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,750
头儿  为什么搞得这么麻烦
Hey, boss. Why so many of these damn things anyway?

1746
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,880
因为乱花渐欲迷人眼  伙计
Because overkill is underrated, my friend.

1747
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:19,260
所以我们要揭开那家伙的保护茧
So we're gonna bring this guy down to ground level.

1748
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:20,720
妈妈
Mama. Mama.

1749
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,100
林奇  这边
This way, Lynch. Lynch.

1750
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,730
他最害怕的一点
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1751
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:33,020
就是自己在众目睽睽下被揭露真面目
Then you put him on display for the whole world to see.

1752
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,530
还有问题吗
Any questions?

1753
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,240
怎么了  头儿 
What's up, boss man?

1754
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:41,700
怪头
Hey, B.A.

1755
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:44,080
这次任务艰巨吧
It's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1756
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:48,370
这我也说不好
Well, I can't promise you it won't.

1757
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:51,580
给你读个东西  就一句
Let me read you something real quick.

1758
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:55,710
以暴力取胜  意味着失败  
"Victory attained by violence is tantamount to defeat,

1759
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,670
因为这只是短暂的胜利
"for it is momentary."

1760
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:01,470
甘地
Gandhi.

1761
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:06,310
若是心中存在暴力  就把它发泄出来
"It is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts,

1762
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:09,730
这要胜过用非暴力来掩饰心中的脆弱
"than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence."

1763
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:13,810
这是谁说的
Who said that?

1764
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:15,440
还是甘地
Same guy.

1765
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:19,990
甘地从不惧怕为自己的信仰而战
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight for the things he believed in.

1766
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,240
你又信仰什么  怪头
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1767
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:46,350
人生如戏
For life is but an opera

1768
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:51,310
跑调了  是不
It's off, isn't it?

1769
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,440
应该唱得更高点是吧
I think it's higher.

1770
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:58,070
还不错了  
No, it's good. It's not that, Murdock.

1771
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:59,610
小白  怎么了
Face, what's wrong? Come on, man.

1772
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,990
我也不知道  只是在想
l don't know, man. I'm just thinking past this.

1773
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:07,240
这一路上  我们每次都能全身而退
You know, we've always come back alive,

1774
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:11,040
都亏了老家伙的巧妙计划
the four of us, 'cause of the old man.

1775
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,460
-我知道  -但我不是他
- l know.  - I'm not him.

1776
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,120
小白  我知道
Face, l know this.

1777
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,340
默多克  我不是汉尼拔
Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1778
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,960
这次行动谁的牺牲会最大  
Who has the most to lose on this, Face?

1779
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,510
是我  
Me.

1780
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,470
但我相信你
And I trust you.

1781
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,770
我明白
Yeah, l know,

1782
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:32,140
但是  你就是个疯子
but you're crazy.

1783
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:38,480
还没那么疯
Not that crazy.

1784
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
洛杉矶港

1785
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
西汉堡号

1786
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:58,170
所有目标差不多到了  
Our eagles may have landed.

1787
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,380
大家准备好了吗
Everybody ready to roll?

1788
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:00,750
收到  第一小队准备行动
Copy Team one on the move.

1789
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,550
收到  第二小队按计划行事
Acknowledged. Team to en route.

1790
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:12,310
好啦  大家准备好了吗  
All right, guys, everybody ready?

1791
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,850
好戏就要开幕了
Curtain's about to come up.

1792
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,310
演出开始
Show time.

1793
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,780
史密斯就在那里  盯紧他
That's Smith right there. Watch him.

1794
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,660
所有小队都到位了吗
Ground team is in position?

1795
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,160
准备就绪
Standing by.

1796
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:33,790
已经就位
In position.

1797
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:38,040
一队狙击手就位
Shoot Team One. Affirmative.

1798
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:39,880
一号观测员  10到8点钟方向
Spotter One. 10-8.

1799
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,250
注意听好了
Let's chattermark on comms for now.

1800
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,050
莫里森是首要目标  模板就在集装箱里
Morrison's the primary tango. Plates are the package.

1801
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,680
好了  他在跟索萨通话  把电话转过来
Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa. I want this call.

1802
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:53,680
你骗我们  我们说好的
You lied to me, Sosa. We had a deal.

1803
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:55,850
快把那该死的电话转给我  谢谢
I want that goddamn call in my... Thank you.

1804
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,100
是说好了  但我改了主意
We had a deal, but I'm changing the deal.

1805
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:00,190
耍我吗  索萨
Are you kidding me, Sosa? Are you kidding me?

1806
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:03,280
情况起了复杂的变化  现在不由你了
This is a complicated exchange and you have no play here.

1807
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,490
听着  不然就一辈子
Listen, or remain at-large fugitives

1808
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:07,650
-继续做你的通缉犯  -哦 不
- for the foreseeable future.  - Uh oh. No! No, no.

1809
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:10,070
行行好  我已经把莫里森和模板带来了
For God sakes, I've got Morrison here and the plates.

1810
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,580
我已经暴露了  索萨  暴露了
I'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!

1811
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,330
我们不在码头上交易
We're not doing this on the docks.

1812
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,040
给我听好了  我们绝不会自首
Now listen to me, we're not turning ourselves in.

1813
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,670
给我听好了  我们绝不会自首
Now you listen to me, we're not turning ourselves in.

1814
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,080
你必须按我的条件来  不然就没的谈
I need you to do it on my terms or nothing at all.

1815
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:23,000
去你妈的  见鬼去吧  索萨
To hell with that, and to hell with you, Sosa!

1816
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,210
她背叛了他
Ah. She burned him.

1817
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:27,840
小白  怪头  我们撤  索萨耍了我们
Face, B.A., we're bugging out. Sosa's jammed us.

1818
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:30,890
默多克  放下十号位的箱子
Murdock, get the chopper down here in 10.

1819
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:34,350
他在转移他  
Okay, he's moving him.

1820
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:35,680
盯紧他  他要转移了
You got him? He's moving him.

1821
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:37,480
老天爷  你别紧张
For the love of God, relax.

1822
01:51:37,770 --> 01:51:39,770
我没紧张  在转移了
I am relaxed. He's moving him.

1823
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:41,730
不要这样  汉尼拔  求你了
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.

1824
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:44,860
-那儿  莫里森就在那儿  杀了他  -等下  他拿了模板吗
- That's Morrison, right there. Take him.  - Wait, does he have the plates?

1825
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,360
模板在史密斯手里  快行动
Smith has the plates. Go now.

1826
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,150
-干掉他  他就在那儿  开枪  -我来搞定莫里森  准备射击  
- Take him, he's right there. Kill him.  - I've got Morrison, taking a shot.

1827
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:54,240
刚刚真险  小子
A little too close for comfort, kid.

1828
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,620
刚才怎么了
What just happened?

1829
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,160
天杀的他究竟想干嘛
What the hell is he doing?

1830
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,290
他们人呢  谁来告诉我
Where are they? Somebody talk to me.

1831
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:01,330
见鬼  那东西把他们压死了吗
Come on, did that thing crush them or what?

1832
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:06,050
好吧  玩三个塑料杯可比这个简单多了
This was a hell of a lot easier when it was just three plastic cups.

1833
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,180
大家冷静下来  提高警惕  不要鲁莽
Everybody just be cool. Pay attention. No hasty moves.

1834
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:18,310
要打败林奇那样的人  有三个关键要素
So, you beat a guy like Lynch by drawing him in with three things.

1835
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:20,310
奇了怪了  他们到底要干嘛
What the hell are they doing?

1836
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,520
声东击西
Distraction.

1837
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:26,000
到底怎么回事
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1838
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:30,070
调虎离山
Diversion.

1839
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,120
这是要调虎离山  别乱  目标在集装箱里
This is a diversion! Stay eagle on those containers.

1840
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,000
他们要借此逃跑  快开火
They're breaking for the exits! Open fire!

1841
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,830
不要暴露  回撤
Do not engage! Back off!

1842
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,580
地面队伍  开枪
Ground teams, engage!

1843
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:48,760
他妈的
Holy shit!

1844
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,850
地面队伍  开枪
Ground team, re-engage.

1845
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,600
你被史密斯耍了  他是想要
You are being played by Smith.

1846
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:00,560
吸引你的注意力  林奇  放聪明点
He's trying to draw your eye line, Lynch. Come on, be smart.

1847
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,850
抓住他  抓住他  快去
Take them! Take them! Take them! Take them!

1848
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:08,280
注意塔身还有塔腰  是派克和拜库斯
Contact! Tower house and bow! It's Peck and Baracus!

1849
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:16,160
还要能全身而退
And division.

1850
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:20,250
这是个陷阱  快撤退  
It's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1851
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:22,080
-他妈的快离开那儿  -不
- Get the hell out of there!  - No, no, no.

1852
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:30,710
这是怎么了  到底怎么回事
What is happening? What is going on?

1853
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,550
这计划不错  小子
Nice one, kid.

1854
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,260
是派克和拜库斯 
It's Peck and Baracus!

1855
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,930
-快开枪  -闭嘴  我知道该怎么做
- Shoot them!  - Shut up! l know what I'm doing.

1856
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:38,720
够了  小朋友们  该我上了
Okay, paintballers, time to go pro.

1857
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,600
怪头  执行下一步计划
B.A., get to your secondary position.

1858
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,230
好了  扭转局面的人来了  
Okay. Game-changer.

1859
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,230
你们该适可而止了
Here's what l think of your best-laid plans.

1860
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,400
妈的
Shit!

1861
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:58,700
我的天呐
Jesus Christ!

1862
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,450
伟大战略家史密斯的计谋就到此终止了
So much for the grand scheme, Smith.

1863
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,660
他妈的到底怎么了
What the hell was that?

1864
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,540
怎么回事  小白  
Face, what the hell was that?

1865
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:07,670
他给船身开了个窟窿  
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW! He punched a hole in the hull!

1866
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,170
那计划怎么办
What about the plan?

1867
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,710
帕克把计划给搞乱了  这是意外状况
Pike just blew up the plan! We are ad-libbing!

1868
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,170
博斯克  快走
Bosco, get out of there!

1869
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,590
我去找汉尼拔
I'm going for Hannibal.

1870
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,590
-掩护我  我去找模板  -遵命
- Cover me. I'm going for those plates.  - Yes, sir.

1871
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,890
船要沉了  快走
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

1872
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:26,440
抓紧
Bos, hang on!

1873
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,170
天呀
Oh! Jeez!

1874
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:16,460
靠
Shit.

1875
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:19,920
博斯克  帕克占据有利位置  我快没子弹了
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground. I'm running low on ammo, man.

1876
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,560
妈的
Shit!

1877
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:35,900
怎么了  帅哥  
How are you doing, handsome?

1878
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:38,650
你的枪还他妈能使吗
Shit, can you cycle that weapon. Nice work.

1879
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,610
战友和子弹  
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1880
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,070
最需要他们的时候都去哪儿了呢
Where are they when you need them?

1881
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:48,120
我和你没私仇  但看着这儿   
Don't take this too personally, but look here,

1882
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,000
笑一笑  等着枪响
smile, wait for the flash.

1883
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,670
拜库斯
Baracus.

1884
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:08,680
博斯克
Bosco!

1885
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,490
林奇
Lynch.

1886
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:31,540
林奇
Lynch.

1887
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:35,880
来吧  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1888
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:40,880
林奇
Lynch.

1889
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:45,970
出来吧  史密斯  别装神弄鬼了
Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

1890
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:48,720
来呀  林奇
Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

1891
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:54,480
林奇
Lynch...

1892
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,520
你找得到我吗
Where am l?

1893
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:01,230
来呀  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1894
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:05,280
林奇
Lynch.

1895
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:07,950
来找我吧  林奇
Where am l, Lynch?

1896
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:11,120
来呀  林奇
Come on, Lynch.

1897
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,370
林奇  林奇
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1898
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,250
林奇
Lynch!

1899
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:36,100
终于找到你了  汉尼拔  你可真难找
There you are, Hannibal. Been looking all over for you.

1900
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:39,270
别以为我是白面小生  
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1901
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,440
我的泰拳还有两下子  柔术还更好一点呢  但是
My muay Thai is pretty good. My jujitsu is a little better, but...

1902
01:58:43,610 --> 01:58:47,410
我手上这些功夫  比起那些集装箱啊车啊爆炸啊
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing going with the containers

1903
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:50,950
装神弄鬼啊什么的  还真是小巫见大巫  
and the cars, and the fireworks. "Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1904
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:57,120
真他妈烦人  但老天给了帕克一个火箭筒
God, that's annoying. But you give Pike a rocket.

1905
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,540
你没想到吧
There's your monkey wrench.

1906
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
汉尼拔  别这样
Hannibal, don't do this.

1907
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:06,380
你知道吗  史密斯  本来一切都照你的计划进行
You know, Smith, you could have the best recipe in the world...

1908
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:08,340
-你欠我这么多  -可惜你千算万算
- You owe me that much.  - ...but you drop a few bullets

1909
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:10,050
-漏算一着  -汉尼拔  别这样
- into the batter...  - Hannibal, don't do this.

1910
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,310
-林奇  不要  -汉尼拔  别
- Lynch, no!  - Hannibal, please.

1911
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:13,720
天
Oh, God.

1912
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,600
天不遂人愿
...and that cake don't bake.

1913
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:21,400
人证物证  都齐了  这下你有麻烦了
Uh-oh. Your witness, your gun, your problem.

1914
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:27,360
你也算报效祖国了  抱歉
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1915
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,040
好久不见  钱先生  我可等死你了
Hello, Ben, where have you been all my life?

1916
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:41,330
汉尼拔  看看  两成年男子对决
Look at us, Hannibal. Couple of grown men.

1917
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:43,880
你流血了  你居然流血了 
I'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

1918
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:46,710
别起来
Don't get up.

1919
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:54,760
操你妈
God damn it!

1920
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:58,140
你的泰拳和柔术都那么差劲  林奇
Your muay Thai is as bad as your jujitsu, Lynch.

1921
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,060
你必须靠枪才行
Better stick with a gun.

1922
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:05,400
要是有把装弹的枪你就死定了
You put a loaded weapon in my hand, I'll put a bullet in your head.

1923
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:23,790
我说过我会杀了你
I told you l would shoot you.

1924
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:26,960
防弹衣救了你一命
Kevlar saved your life.

1925
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:30,130
问题是  要是瞄准你的头  这玩意还顶个球用
Thing is, it doesn't do much good if I pop you in the head.

1926
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:32,340
我要能与防弹衣合为一体的话可就不一定了
It does if you melt it down.

1927
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:35,510
汉尼拔  别这样
Hannibal, don't do this.

1928
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:37,770
-汉尼拔  别  -要打败林奇那样的人
- Hannibal, please.  - So, you beat a guy like that

1929
02:00:37,850 --> 02:00:39,810
有三个关键要素
by drawing him in with three things.

1930
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,900
-声东击西  -怎么回事
- Distraction.  - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1931
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,480
调虎离山
Diversion.

1932
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:46,110
全身而退
And division.

1933
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:53,820
在众目睽睽下揭露他的真面目
Then you put him on display for the whole world to see.

1934
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,620
搞毛
What the...

1935
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,640
真不错
That's good.

1936
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:18,260
真令人惊讶
Surprise.

1937
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,850
布里斯特工
Agent Burress.

1938
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,690
你叫我什么
What did you call me?

1939
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,560
文斯・布里斯特工  不是你的名字吗
Agent Vance Burress? lsn't that your name?

1940
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:29,190
至少我的逮捕令上是这么写的
At least that's the name I've got on this warrant here,

1941
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,450
除非你有和这张一模一样的 
and unless you have a piece of paper that looks exactly like...

1942
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,570
真好笑  这是我曾说过的话
That's funny. That's what l said.

1943
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,200
以我之道还施我身
She's quoting me.

1944
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:39,160
慢慢来
Easy, easy.

1945
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:43,250
你被捕了  罪名是蓄意制造虚假谋杀
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

1946
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,290
以及盗窃政府最高机密的
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

1947
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:48,880
美钞模板
and the theft of top secret government engraving plates.

1948
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:50,380
慢慢起来
Easy.

1949
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,130
看来这计划还算顺利
l guess the plan went okay,

1950
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:58,810
只是我没考虑到帕克会把船给炸了
considering Pike did blow up the boat, which l didn't account for at all.

1951
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,890
子弹没打穿呢
Bullets didn't go through.

1952
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:05,690
伙计  觉得怎样
How are you feeling, man?

1953
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,400
不好  很不好
Not... Not good.

1954
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:09,520
-怎么了  -不舒服
- What's wrong? - Not good.

1955
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,780
我感觉精神正常了
I feel sane.

1956
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:14,320
早知道我早该往你脑袋上来一枪
I should have shot you in the head a long time ago.

1957
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,160
我怎么觉得你害怕了
Is it crazy that I'm feeling your anxiety right now?

1958
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,240
我看起来像害怕的样吗
Do I look anxious to you?

1959
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,240
你觉得我被打败了吗
You think I'm beaten?

1960
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:23,580
我只是在流血  没有流虚汗
I'm bleeding, l'm not sweating.

1961
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:26,710
把他带走  
Let's take him out of here, guys. Go ahead, princess.

1962
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:34,470
脑震荡和撞伤有什么区别吗
What's the difference between a concussion and a contusion?

1963
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:38,010
-没事的  伙计  -默多克  干得不错
-It don't matter, bro. You tore up.  - Murdock, that was beautiful.

1964
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,680
你没事  头盔很有用嘛
You were right. The helmet worked.

1965
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,760
番茄酱立功了
Ketchup worked great.

1966
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:44,680
你表现真棒  现在感觉怎么样
You did a great job. You okay?

1967
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:45,940
-还好  -清醒点了吗
- Yeah.  -  Got your bell rung?

1968
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:49,690
下次还是让汉尼拔制定计划吧
Just let Hannibal make the plans next time.

1969
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:52,320
-好吧  -好吧
- Oh. Okay.  - Okay.

1970
02:02:52,650 --> 02:02:54,280
你的良心感觉怎么样  大块头
How's the conscience, big guy?

1971
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:57,280
平静如水
At peace.

1972
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:09,080
别熄火
Keep it turning.

1973
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,340
我们要带走他们
We already got them on the exits.

1974
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:14,010
现在方圆3公里都被封锁了  -索萨是哪位
- We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.  - Which one of you is Sosa?

1975
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:15,670
-我是  -我要找索萨
- I am. I am. - I need to talk to Sosa.

1976
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,510
从现在开始  你的囚犯将遣回
As of right now your prisoner is to be remanded

1977
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,430
-联邦关押  -我有他的逮捕令  
- into federal custody.  - l have a warrant for this man.

1978
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:22,100
-现在  -我来告诉你吧  我是医生
-  As of right now...  - I'll tell you what... I'm a doc.

1979
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,680
让我来治疗你  我来帮你
Let me doctor you up. Let me help you out.

1980
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:26,020
你要缝针吧  
Do you need stitches? Please tell me you need stitches.

1981
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,520
我会帮你缝得很好哟
l can stitch you up really good.

1982
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:30,480
先生们
Gentlemen.

1983
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:33,980
中情局
The Central lntelligence Agency

1984
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,400
秉持高度的伦理道德

1985
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:38,740
和坚定不移的职业标准
as well as an unshakeable professional standard.

1986
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:42,990
因此  我们为发生的一切
As such, we would like to extend our most sincere apologies

1987
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,490
向你们表达最诚挚的歉意
for what's happened here.

1988
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:48,790
-祝你们好运  -你们要带他去哪里
- Good day and God bless.  - Where are you taking him?

1989
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,590
你说谁
Who?

1990
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,340
我不知道你的名字
I never got your name.

1991
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:03,600
我叫林奇
My name is Lynch.

1992
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:07,060
果然
Of course it is.

1993
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:11,020
他刚刚是说林奇吗
Did he just say Lynch?

1994
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,490
别碰我
Hey. Do not touch me.

1995
02:04:25,330 --> 02:04:26,620
别紧张  伙计们
Take it easy, guys.

1996
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:29,370
所有人都给我退下
Everybody, stand down! Stand down!

1997
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:32,380
-去把拿上模板  -所有人给我退下
-Get those plates. - Everybody, stand down!

1998
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:35,210
-这是命令  给我退下  -你想干什么
- That's an order. Hey, you, stand down. -  What is wrong with you?

1999
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:36,500
中尉
Lieutenant.

2000
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:37,760
长官  你是几时到的  我不知道
Sir, when did you arrive? l had no idea...

2001
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,720
-给我点时间  -遵命
- Just give me a minute.  - Yes, sir.

2002
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,300
把你的手拿开  肌肉男
FACE: Get your hands off me, tough guy.

2003
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:50,310
虽然搞得一团糟  但我们好歹拿回了模板
Well, that's one hell of a mess. But we did get the plates.

2004
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:54,980
但不幸的是  我得以逃脱合法监禁的罪名控告你们
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to charge you all with escaping lawful custody.

2005
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,770
什么  汉尼拔  那家伙在说什么
What? Hannibal, what is this guy talking about?

2006
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:00,570
怪头  虽然是误判  但我们越狱还是违法的
B.A., we were wrongly convicted, but it's still illegal to break out ofjail.

2007
02:05:00,650 --> 02:05:01,990
长官  史密斯他们为这次行动
Director McCready, Smith and his team

2008
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,530
立下汗马功劳
were instrumental in recovering those plates.

2009
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:07,700
但他们仍是十级通缉犯  必须逮捕他们
They're still level-10 federal fugitives and l need that off my desk.

2010
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:09,790
这真他妈扯淡  长官
This is chickenshit, sir.

2011
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,290
也许对他们是很扯淡  
Yeah, well, you know what? Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

2012
02:05:12,370 --> 02:05:15,750
但是对你  上尉  我们决定将你重新升为上尉
but for you, Captain, we're re-promoting you to your former rank.

2013
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,170
他们马上会被转移
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

2014
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,800
交给长滩市的联邦法警
to the U.S. Marshals Service here in Long Beach.

2015
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,720
-以最高的安全级别运走他们  -我理解  但
-And there should be a C-5 transport... -l understand, but...

2016
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,090
半小时后起飞
...on the tarmac in half an hour.

2017
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,590
-这势在必行  -这很不公平长官
- This needs to be done. - This is really unfair, sir.

2018
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:27,350
-真他妈扯蛋  -我可是胡迪尼大师
- This is bullshit.  - I'm like Harry Houdini.

2019
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:27,350
逃脱术大师

2020
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:29,060
这手铐我很容易就能咬开
I chew through your cuffs.

2021
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:31,890
-起身  前进  进去  -往前走
- Get up. Step up. Get in there!  - Step up!

2022
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:34,230
-行动起来  -等下  停一下
- Let's go. Get moving. - Stop. Wait, stop.

2023
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,020
-走  -等等
- Move it. -Wait.

2024
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:38,270
-这太没道理了  -不用担心
- This is so wrong.  - It got a little aggressive.

2025
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:39,860
-不用担心  -现在这样真的大错特错了
- Don't worry about it.  - This is really, really wrong,

2026
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:42,450
我会不惜一切代价来弥补  
and I'm going to do everything l can to fix it.

2027
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:45,110
-我相信你  -我真的很抱歉  小白
- I know you will.  - I'm so sorry, Face.

2028
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,690
这计划真不错  小白
Nice plan, Face.

2029
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,030
好个毛  才抓住林奇  结果我们又进了监狱
Yeah. We just traded Lynches, and we're going back to prison.

2030
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,080
我们交还了模板  这下能抬头做人了
We returned the plates. We can hold our heads high.

2031
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:30,370
我们做了应该做的
We did the right thing.

2032
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:33,620
但他们却这样对待我们  真他妈的
Yeah, and look what they did to us. This is some bullshit.

2033
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,870
他们又抛弃了我们  汉尼拔  
They burned us again, Hannibal.

2034
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,790
我们相信国家机关  但他们却恩将仇报
We trusted the system and it turned on us.

2035
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:42,000
记住  小子们  无论表面上看起来多么混乱
Remember, boys, no matter how random things might appear,

2036
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:44,630
本质上总是有计划存在  小子
there is still a plan. Kid.

2037
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:49,350
我不是故意抢你台词  头儿  不过
Well, l don't mean to steal your line, boss, but...

2038
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:59,610
我就爱计划圆满的那一刻
I love it when a plan comes together.

2039
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:06,740
依旧被政府通缉
Still wanted by the government,

2040
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,950
但这些战士们  一次次地神奇逃脱
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

2041
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:14,250
如果你遇到困难
lf you have a problem,

2042
02:07:15,250 --> 02:07:17,250
如果你走投无路
if no one else can help,

2043
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:20,210
你要是能找到他们  
and if you can find them,

2044
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:22,210
或许就能雇佣
maybe you can hire

2045
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,260
天龙特攻队
the A-Team.
