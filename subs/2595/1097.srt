1
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,490
大地惊雷

2
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:01,950
虽无人追赶  恶人亦仓皇逃跑
旧约: 箴言  第二十八章  第一节

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
背景音乐  依靠在上帝的臂膀下
"Leaning on the everlasting arms"

4
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,920
人们不会相信  
People did not give it credence

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,650
一个小女孩能离开家乡
that a young girl could leave home.

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,560
在冰天雪地的寒冬为父亲报仇
And go off in the winter time to avenge her father's blood.

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,050
但事实就是如此
But it did happen.

8
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,040
那个懦夫汤姆・切尼射杀我父亲的时候
I was just fourteen years of age

9
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
我只有十四岁
when a coward by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down.

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,190
他不但杀了我父亲  抢走他的马
And robbed him of his life, and his horse.

11
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,320
还拿走了他裤袋里的两块加州金块
And two California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser pant.

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,930
切尼是个雇工
Chaney was a hired man.

13
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,880
爸爸让他到史密斯堡
And Papa had taken him up to Fort Smith

14
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,780
帮忙带回他买下的小野马驹
to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd bought.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,720
在城里  切尼被美酒吸引
In town, Chaney had followed to drink.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,650
开始赌博  输光了身上所有的钱
And cards, and lost all his money.

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,740
他认为他被骗了
He got it into his head he was being cheated.

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,620
回到住处取他的那把亨利步枪
And went back to the boarding house for his Henry Rifle.

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,300
当父亲试图阻止他时
When Papa tried to intervene.

20
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,250
切尼开枪杀了他
Chaney shot him.

21
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,300
切尼逃跑了
Chaney fled.

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,320
他本可以牵着马慢慢走的
He could have walked his horse.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,520
因为那座镇上的人没有一个去追赶他
For not a soul in that city could be bothered to give chase.

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,450
切尼自以为能逃过制裁
No doubt Chaney fancied himself, scott free.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,630
但是他错了
But he was wrong.

26
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,200
这个世界任何东西都是有代价的
You must pay for everything in this world,

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,340
欠下的终究都会被偿还
one way or another.

28
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,430
除了上帝的恩泽
There is nothing free,

29
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,650
没有什么是免费的
except the grace of God.

30
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,280
是他吗
Is that the man?

31
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,770
是我父亲
That is my father.

32
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,270
如果你想亲吻他
If you would like to kiss him,

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,950
请便吧
It would be all right.

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,420
他回家了
He's gone to home.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,480
感谢上帝
Praise the Lord.

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,770
为什么这么贵
Why is it so much?

37
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,570
棺木的选材
The quality of the casket.

38
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,200
还有防腐的材料
And of the embalming.

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,460
死者保持这样的外表是需要时间和工艺的
The life like appearance requires time and art.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,020
化学药剂十分昂贵  帐单里有详细价格
And the chemicals come dear, the particulars are in your bill.

41
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,370
如果你想亲吻他  请便
If you'd like to kiss him, It would be all right.

42
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,290
谢谢您  他的灵魂已经消散了
Thank you, the spirit has flow.

43
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,100
你电报上说只要五十美元
Your wire said fifty dollars.

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,840
你没说清楚他是要被运输的
You did not specify that he was to be shipped.

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,690
我们只有六十美元
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.

46
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,220
我们都没有钱住店了
That leaves nothing for our board.

47
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,800
亚内尔  你去看着遗体
Yarnell you can see to the body

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,180
运到火车站  然后护送回家
transport to the train station, and company it home.

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,570
我今晚会在这儿过夜
I'll have to sleep here tonight.

50
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,280
我还需要整理遗物和处理其他事宜
I still have to collect father's things and see some other business.

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,290
你母亲从没说过你要来办什么其他事宜
Your mama didn't say nothing about you settling no business here.

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,890
这是妈妈不知道的事
It's business mama dosen't know about.

53
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,540
好了  亚内尔  你可以走了
It's all right Yarnell, I dismiss you.

54
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,450
我可不这么认为
I am not sure.

55
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,440
转告我妈不要签署任何文件 
Tell mama not to sign anything

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,740
一切等我回家后将父亲体面安葬好再说
until I return home and see that Papa is buried in his mason's apron.

57
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,410
你的出价可以接受  但我要在这过夜
Your terms are agreeable, if I might pass the night here.

58
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,860
在这儿  和这些死人一起吗
Here, among these people?

59
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,830
"这些死人"吗  
These people?

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,130
待会儿还有三个心灵要在这里安息
I'm expecting three more souls.

61
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,850
苏里文  史密斯还有狗舌头
Sullivan, Smith, and His-tongue-in-the-rain.

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,370
女士们先生们  听好了
Ladies and gentlemen, beware

63
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,960
好好培养孩子  让他们走上正路
and train up your children the way that they should go!

64
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,520
你们看看现在的我
You see what has become of me.

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,100
因为喝酒
Because of drink.

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,640
我杀了一个人
I killed a man.

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,030
就因为争抢一把小折刀
In a triffiling quarrel over a pocket knife.

68
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,770
如果我年轻的时候能受到良好的教育
If I had received good instruction as a child...

69
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,080
请问哪位是警长
Could you point out the sheriff?

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,350
那个大胡子
Him with the moustaches.

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,770
今天我本可以和我妻子儿女在一起
I would be with my wife and children today.

72
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,020
我不知道他们以后会怎么样
I do not know what is to become of them.

73
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,310
但是我希望妻子不会放手不管孩子们
But I hope and pray that she will not slight them

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,570
让他们成为社会的败类
and compel them to go into low company.

75
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,340
好吧
Well.

76
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,950
我杀了一个不该杀的人  
I killed the wrong man,

77
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,260
这就是我在这的原因
is the which why I'm here.

78
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,990
如果我没杀错的话
Had I killed the man I meant to.

79
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,000
我肯定不会被判死刑的
I don't believed I'd a been convicted.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,220
我看到人群中  有些人还不如我呢
I see men out there in that crowd, that's worse than me.

81
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,590
好了
Okay.

82
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,320
我被绞死之前  我想说的是
Before I hang, I would like to say.

83
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,290
没有  我们没抓到他
Naw, we ain't arrested him.

84
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,820
他们没追上他  跑得太快了
Ain't caught up to him, but he lit out for the Territory.

85
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,130
我觉得他投靠幸运奈德・彼伯了  
I would think that he throwed in with Lucky Ned Pepper,

86
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,400
他们昨天在波托河旁抢劫了一辆邮车
whose gang robbed a mail hack yesterday at the Poteau River.

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
那为什么您没有去搜捕他呢
Well, why are you not looking for him?

88
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,430
印第安区不在我的管辖范围内
I ain't no authority in the Indian Nation.

89
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,560
汤姆・切尼现在归美国法警管了
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S. Marshal now.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,950
那他们什么时候去抓他呢
When will they arrest him?

91
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,030
近期是不太可能了  法警的人手不够
Not soon, I'm afraid, the Marshals are not well staffed.

92
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,580
我实话跟你说吧  
And I'll tell you, frankly,

93
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,030
切尼是通缉犯名单上的最后一个
Chaney is at the end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,170
我能雇个法警去追捕汤姆・切尼吗
Could I hire a Marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?

95
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,380
你是不是经常雇佣一些赏金猎人啊
You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters, do you?

96
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,430
怎么可能呢
That is a silly question.

97
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,110
我是来处理父亲后事的
I am here to settle my father's affairs.

98
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,820
-就你一个人吗  -只有我能做
- All alone. - I am the person for it.

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,290
我妈的数学很差
Mama was never any good at sums.

100
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,820
而且她大字不识两个
And she could hardly spell 'cat'.

101
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,980
我要看到杀害我父亲的人被处以绞刑
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.

102
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,330
好吧
Well, nothing prevents you

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,380
你的确可以雇佣法警
from offering a reward or from so informing the Marshals.

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,500
但报酬要丰厚  这样才有人会去
It had to be real money though, to be persuasive.

105
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,880
切尼现在已经过河到了查克托区
Chaney's across the river, in Choctaw Nation.

106
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,880
查克托区: 印第安人半自治区

107
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,250
我会处理钱的问题  谁是最好的法警
I will see to the money. Who's the best Marshal?

108
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,320
我得想想
I'd have to weigh that.

109
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,230
威廉姆・沃特斯追捕能力过人
William Waters, is the best tracker.

110
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,220
他有一半卡曼其血统  
He is half Comanche,

111
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,220
卡曼其族(北美印第安之一族)

112
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,510
看他追捕赏心悦目
and it is something to see him cut for the sign.

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,520
最暴脾气的要属大公鸡考伯恩
The meanest, is Rooster Cogburn.

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,660
他铁面无私  真正的硬汉
He is a pitiless man. Double tough.

115
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,800
他无所畏惧
Fear don't enter into his thinking.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,670
但是他嗜酒如命
Hmm, he loves to pull a cork.

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,970
最好的人选应该是奎因
The best is probably, L.T. Quinn.

118
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,080
他总能活捉罪犯
He brings his prisoners in alive.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,220
也许会因此偶尔失手 
Now he may let one slip by now and again,

120
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,730
但是  他相信
but he believes that

121
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,570
就算是罪大恶极的人  也应秉公处理
even the worst of men, is entitled to a fair shake.

122
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,090
我在哪儿能找到这个大公鸡
Where can I find this, Rooster?

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
厕所有人了
The jakes is occupied.

124
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,030
我知道考伯恩先生
I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn.

125
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,630
我有事找您
As I said, I have business with you.

126
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,200
我的事情更紧急
I have prior business.

127
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,760
您已经在这里待了很久了  考伯恩先生
You've been at it for quite some time, Mr. Cogburn.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,940
我的事情想做多久就多久
There is no clock for my business!

129
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,630
去死吧  你怎么找到我的
The hell with you! How did you spot me here?

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,560
警长叫我去酒吧找找
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.

131
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
酒吧的人说你在这儿  我们得谈谈
In the saloon they referred me here. We must talk.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,020
酒吧根本就不接待女人
Women ain't allowed in the saloon.

133
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,370
我不算顾客  我才十四岁
I was not there as a customer. I am fourteen years old.

134
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,490
厕所有人了
The jakes is occupied.

135
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,860
有段时间不会出来
Will be for some time.

136
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,520
罗斯  运往耶尔县  在车站存放

137
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,260
晚上好
Good evening.

138
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,830
如果你想睡在棺材里  请便吧
If you would like to sleep in a coffin, It would be all right.

139
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,880
棉花你多少钱收
How much are you paying for cotton?

140
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,960
九分五收中低档次的  十分收优质的
Nine and a half, for low and middlin' and ten for ordinary.

141
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,900
我门很早就把货出手了
We got most of ours out early.

142
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,460
我卖给了小岩城的维兹绅兄弟  
I sold to the Wizten brothers in Little Rock

143
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,070
价格是十一分
for eleven cents.

144
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,830
那你应该把剩下的也卖给他们啊
Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the Witzen brothers.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,310
我们的确吧剩下的卖了
We take the balance to Witzen.

146
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,140
十分五的价格
We got ten and a half.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,810
你为什么要来告诉我这些呢
Why'd you come here to tell me this?

148
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,160
我们本来打算明年来这里做生意的
I thought we might shop around up here next year.

149
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
这么看来  我们在小岩城那边就好了
But I guess we are doing alright in Little Rock.

150
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,610
我是麦蒂・罗斯
I'm Mattie Ross.

151
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,860
弗兰克・罗斯是我父亲
Daughter of Frank Ross.

152
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,100
真是可怜啊
Aw, tragic thing.

153
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,670
我想说  你的父亲令我印象深刻
May I say, your father impressed me.

154
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,230
他的人品很好
With his manly qualities.

155
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,220
他做商人分文必争  却还是个绅士
He was a close trader, but he acted a gentleman.

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,180
我的提议是将我父亲买下的小马驹
My propose was to sell those ponies back to you,

157
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,900
再卖还给你
that my father brought.

158
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,800
我想这恐怕是不行
Well that I fear, is out of the question.

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,650
我保证会给你送到的
I will see that they are shipped to you,

160
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,770
而且会尽快
at my earliest convenience.

161
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,780
我们现在不想要也不需要小马驹了
We don't want the ponies now, we don't need them.

162
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,010
我想这与我无关吧
Well that hardly concerns me.

163
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,130
你父亲买下它们  并且付钱了
Your father brought the ponies, and paid for them.

164
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,820
我们两清了  我有收据的
And there is an end to it. I have the bill of sale.

165
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,160
那我要三百块的补助
And I want 300 dollars

166
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,400
因为我父亲的马是在你的马棚失窃的
for Papa's saddle horse that was stolen from your stable.

167
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,770
你应该找偷马的人去讨账
You'll have to take that up with the man who stole the horse.

168
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,030
汤姆・切尼偷走了
Tom Chaney stole the horse

169
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,730
你应该负责保管好的马
while it was in your care.

170
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,150
你要对此负责
You were responsible.

171
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,090
我很钦佩你的不懈努力
Yeah, I admire your sand.

172
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,590
但是你应该知道  我对此是不负责任的
But I believe you'll find I'm not liable for such claims.

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,910
你是保管人
You were the custodian.

174
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,320
如果你是开银行的而银行被抢劫了
If you were a bank and were robbed.

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
你不能就告诉储户们顺其自然吧
You could not simply tell your depositors to go hang.

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,430
别跟我打比方
I do not entertain hypotheticals.

177
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,460
世道本来就已经很烦人了
The world as it is is vexing enough.

178
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,530
其次  你对马的估价过高了
Secondly your evaluation of the horse is high.

179
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,740
你至少高估了两百块  你多大了
By about two hundred dollars. How old are you?

180
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,840
我跟你说  我的估价绝对是低价
If anything, my prices is low.

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,030
茱迪是一匹优质的赛马种马
My Judy was a fine racing mare.

182
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,220
我看到她 
I've seen her

183
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,960
能驮着一个很重的骑手跳过八栅栅栏 
jump a eight-rail fence with a heavy rider.

184
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,870
-我十四岁 -是吗  真有意思
- I am fourteen. - Oh, well, it's all very interesting.

185
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,050
小马驹是你们的了  你得收下
The ponies are yours, take them.

186
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,930
你父亲的马是被杀人犯偷走的
Your father horse was stolen by a murderous criminal.

187
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,000
鉴于我们之间的默示协议
I have provided reasonable protection

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
我已经为它做了足够的保护措施
for the creature as per our implicit agreement.

189
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,790
我的马厩管理员牙齿都被打掉了  
My watchmen had his teeth knocked out,

190
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,050
他现在只能喝汤了
and can take only soup.

191
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,520
那我们法庭上见吧
That would take it to law.

192
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,010
你没有理由起诉我
You have no case.

193
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,930
阿肯色州洁特律师也许不会同意
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle, Arkansas may think otherwise.

194
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,760
陪审团估计也不会同意你的观点
As might a jury.

195
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,730
一个寡妇和三个孩子的诉状胜算不会小
Petitioned by a widow and three small children.

196
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,800
我会往你父亲的账户里
I will pay two hundred dollars

197
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,230
打两百美元
to your fathers estate.

198
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,720
前提条件是  我要收到你律师的文件
When I have in my hand a letter from your lawyer,

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,850
免除我到今天为止的一切责任
absolving me of all liability from the beginning of the world to date.

200
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,930
茱迪的价格是两百块
I'll take two hundred dollars for Judy,

201
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,230
小马驹是一百块
plus one hundred for the ponies.

202
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,850
另有二十五块
And twenty five dollars

203
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,720
是那匹汤姆・切尼留下的灰马
for the grey horse that Tom Chaney left.

204
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,450
市场上很容易就能四十块出手的
He was easily worth forty.

205
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,800
那一共是三百二十五块
That is three hundred and twenty-five dollars total.

206
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,040
小马驹不算在内  我是不会买的
The ponies have no part in it. I will not buy them.

207
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,120
那茱迪的价格就是三百二十五块
Then the price for Judy is three hundred and twenty-five dollars.

208
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,140
就算是飞马我也不会出这么多钱的
I would not pay three hundred and twenty-five dollars for winged Pegasus.

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,540
还有  那匹灰马根本就不是你的
As for the grey horse, it does not belong to you.

210
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,500
那匹马是我父亲借给汤姆・切尼的
The grey horse was lent to Tom Chaney by my father.

211
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,290
切尼只是借用而已
Chaney only had the use of him.

212
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,490
我会付给你二百二十五块
I would pay two hundred and twenty five dollars.

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,380
但我要留着那匹灰马
And keep the grey horse.

214
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,870
另外还有小马驹我也收下
And I want the ponies.

215
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,000
我不接受
I cannot accept that.

216
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,690
我离开这里之后就不会有和解了 
There will be no settlement after I leave this office

217
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,580
-我们法庭上见  -好吧  我让步
- and it will go to law. - All right, this is my last offer.

218
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,380
两百五十块
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

219
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,890
前提是我拿到先前说的免责文件
For that I get the release, previously discussed.

220
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,010
还有你父亲的马鞍
And I keep your father's saddle.

221
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,170
灰马不由得你来卖
The grey horse is not yours to sell.

222
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,250
那马鞍是无价的  我要留着它
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.

223
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
洁特律师会证明那匹灰马的归属权
Lawyer Dagget will prove ownership of the grey horse.

224
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,360
他会发函向你追缴非法强占财产的
He will come after you with a writ of replevin.

225
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,540
什么  好吧  听好了
What? All right, now look, listen very carefully.

226
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,250
我不会再让步了
As I will not bargain further.

227
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,960
我要回小马驹
I'll will take the ponies back,

228
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
那匹灰马本来就是我的
and the grey horse, which is mine.

229
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,000
妥协价是...
And settle...

230
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,970
三百美元  就这么说定了
For three hundred dollars. Now you must take that or leave it.

231
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,190
我豁出去了
And I do not much care which it is.

232
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,300
杰特律师是不会让我
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to

233
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,920
接受任何低于三百二十五块的补偿的
consider anything under three hundred and twenty-five dollars.

234
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,550
但是我想三百二十块就够了
But I will settle for three hundred and twenty.

235
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,540
如果那二十块是提前支付的话
If I am given twenty in advance.

236
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,560
好了  现在我们再说说那个马鞍
Now here's what I have to say about that saddle.

237
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,310
弗兰克・罗斯的女儿吗
Frank Ross's daughter.

238
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
哦  可怜的孩子
Oh, poor child.

239
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,360
你是准备在这儿呆一阵子
Are you are gonna staying with us,

240
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,770
还是你马上就回家看你妈妈呢
or you hurrying back home to your Mama?

241
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,590
我想留在这儿  如果方便的话
I'll stay here, if you can have me.

242
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,430
我昨晚在收敛师那儿过的夜
I just spend last night at the undertakers.

243
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,160
陪着三具尸体
In the company of three corpses.

244
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,220
我觉得我像是以西结
I felt like Ezekiel.

245
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,640
以西结: 希伯来先知
旧约圣经以西结书之作者

246
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,640
在死亡谷中
In valley of the dry bones.

247
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,250
上帝保佑你
Then, God bless you.

248
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,610
你和祖母特纳睡在一个房间
Now that you'll be rooming with, Grandma Turner.

249
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,210
我们得挤一挤了
We had to double up,

250
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,170
因为许多人都前来看绞刑
what with all the people in town come to see the hanging.

251
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,160
这些是你父亲屋中的遗物
This was in your poor father's room.

252
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,270
这就是所有的东西了
That is everything.

253
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,650
这栋房子里没有小偷的
There are no light fingers in this house.

254
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,750
如果你需要什么来装那把枪
If you need something for to tote the gun around?

255
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,840
我可以给你一个面粉袋  只要五分钱
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.

256
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,750
他在那儿发现了什么
...about what he found up here,

257
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,840
我们离波特警官很近
and we're close enough to deputy Marshal Potter

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,840
所以我们就靠近那里去调查了
that we thought we'd better ride over ourselves and investigate.

259
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,990
那么你看到什么了
And what did you see when you arrived?

260
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,240
一个女人  在院子那里
A woman, was out in the yard.

261
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,780
她死了  脸上都是苍蝇
Dead with blow flies on her face.

262
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,020
一个老人在院子里面 
The old man was inside

263
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,530
他的胸脯被霰弹枪打开花了  
with his breast opened by a scatter-gun

264
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,790
他的脚被烧焦了
and his feet burned.

265
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,700
他那时候还活着  但也只剩一口气了
He was still alive, but just was.

266
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,960
他说是沃顿兄弟俩干的
Said it was them two Wharton boys had done it.

267
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,920
-他们聚在一起  喝醉了  -反对
- Rode up, drunk. - Objection.

268
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
道听途说
Hearsay.

269
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,640
那可是临终遗言  法官大人
Dying declaration, your honor.

270
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,820
反对无效  请继续  考伯恩先生
Objection's overruled. Proceed Mr. Cogburn.

271
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,820
然后兄弟二人  奥多斯和赛思将他推倒在地
Them two Wharton boys, Odus and C.C. throwed down on him,

272
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,450
问他钱在哪儿  但是他没说
and asked him where his money was, but he wouldn't tell them.

273
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,130
他们在他脚上抹上松子油  点火拷问他
They lit pine nut held them to his feet.

274
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,910
他说钱在一个水果罐头中
He told them the money was in the fruit jar.

275
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,250
在烟熏屋旁的一块灰色岩石下面
Under a grey rock at the corner of the smoke house.

276
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,260
然后呢
And then?

277
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,390
他死了  死时相当痛苦
Well he died on us, Passed away in considerable pain.

278
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,450
然后你做了什么
What'd you do then?

279
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,530
我和波特警官找到烟熏屋
I made Marshal Potter and went out to the smoke house

280
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,430
发现那块岩石被搬走了
and that rock had been moved,

281
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,770
然后那罐钱也不见了
the jar with the money in it was gone.

282
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,610
-反对  纯属猜测  -反对有效
-Objection, speculative. -Sustained.

283
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,220
你们在烟熏屋旁边找到了那个灰岩石
You found a flat grey rock, in the corner of the smoke house.

284
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,530
下面有个洞
With a hollowed out space beneth it.

285
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,190
如果被告要陈述证据
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence,

286
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,840
我希望他能宣誓
I suggest he be sworn.

287
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,120
考伯恩先生  你在烟熏屋附近
Mr. Cogburn. What did you find,

288
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,100
找到了什么东西
if anything, in the corner of that smokehouse?

289
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,780
有一块平整的灰色岩石
We found a flat gray rock with

290
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,380
下面有个洞  里面什么都没有
a hollowed-out space under it. Nothing there.

291
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,470
-然后呢  -没有罐子  什么也没有
- Well then what did you...? - No jar or nothing.

292
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,410
那之后你做什么了吗
Well, what did you do then?

293
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,120
然后  我去到沃顿兄弟那里
Well, rode up to the Wharton boys there,

294
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,640
离北福克河与加拿大河的汇流处不远
near where the North Fork strikes the Canadian.

295
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,890
-..加拿大河支流  -你发现了什么
- ...branch of the Canadian. - What did you find?

296
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,900
我用望远镜看到兄弟俩和他们的父亲艾伦
I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy Aaron.

297
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,680
他们和一些畜养猪在溪流岸边
down on the creek bank with some hogs.

298
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,740
他们杀了一头小猪
They'd killed a shoat.

299
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,810
然后便生火烧水
And a fire built up under a wash pot for scalding water.

300
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,760
之后你做了什么
What did you do?

301
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,080
我对着艾伦喊  我们是美国法警
Announced we was U.S. Marshals, I hollered out to Aaron.

302
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,500
我要和他儿子们谈谈
I needed to talk to his two boys.

303
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,030
他抡起斧子
He raised an axe,

304
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,850
开始咒骂我们  并且侮辱法庭公正
and commence to cussing us and blackguarding this court.

305
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,040
那之后呢
What did he do then?

306
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,220
我后退几步  躲开斧子
I backed away from the axe.

307
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,960
试着和他讲点道理
Tried to talked some sense into him.

308
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,550
就在这个时候
While this was going on,

309
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,910
赛思躲在升起的蒸汽后面
C.C. edges over to the wash pot there, behind the steam.

310
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,920
拿起一把双管猎枪
And picks up a shot gun.

311
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,160
波特看到了  但是一切都太迟了
Potter seen him, but it was too late.

312
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,100
赛思对着波特开火了
C.C. Wharton pulled out on Potter with one barrel.

313
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,430
然后想要打我  我就开枪了
Turned to do the same for me and I shot him.

314
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,980
他父亲也抡起了斧子
And the old man raised the axe.

315
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,170
我开枪打了他
And I shot him.

316
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,430
奥多斯想要逃跑  我也对他开了一枪
Odus lit out, and I shot him.

317
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,170
赛思和他老爸倒地后就断气了
C.C. Wharton and Aaron Wharton were dead when they hit the ground,

318
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,890
而奥多斯只是被击伤了
Odus was just winged.

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,770
那你发现装着一百二十美元的罐子了吗
Did you find the jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it?

320
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,860
-反对  暗示性问题  -反对有效
- Leading. - Sustained.

321
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,840
之后发生了什么
What happened then?

322
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,600
的确找到了里面有一百二十块钱的罐子
Found a jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.

323
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,710
奥多斯后来怎样了
What became of Odus Wharton?

324
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,200
他在那儿坐着呢
There he sits.

325
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,200
您可以提问了  高迪先生
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

326
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,910
谢谢  巴罗先生
Thank you Mr. Barlow.

327
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,270
考伯恩先生
Mr. Cogburn.

328
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,710
在你担任美国法警职务的四年中
In your four years as a U.S. Marshal.

329
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,590
你对多少人开了枪
How many men have you shot?

330
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,650
我从不无缘无故开枪打人
Never shot nobody that didn't ask for it.

331
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,570
你并没有回答我的问题
Well that was not the question.

332
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,510
多少个
How many?

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,100
开枪打的还是射杀的
Shot or killed?

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,040
咱们就限定在你射杀的吧
Let us restrict it to killed

335
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,360
这样数目不至于大得说不清
So that we may have a manageable figure.

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,840
大概十二个
About twelve.

337
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,410
或者十五个  制止斗殴  自卫反击之类的
Fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending myself, et cetera.

338
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,170
他说大概十二个
Around twelve he says.

339
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,880
或者十五个
Or fifteen.

340
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,600
那么多  你甚至都没法给出准确的数字
So many, you cannot keep a precise count.

341
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,370
我检查了案件卷宗  可以提供准确的数目
I have examined the records, and can supply the accurate figure.

342
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,360
我估计算上沃顿家的那两人  得有二十三个
I believe them two Wharton boys makes it twenty three.

343
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,470
就单单这一家
And how many members of this one family,

344
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,930
沃顿家  你杀了多少个人
the Wharton family, have you killed?

345
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
直系的  还是...
Immediate, or...

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,690
你是否还开枪打死了家中的兄弟达布・沃顿
Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother?

347
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,590
以及异母兄弟克里特・沃顿
And Clete Wharton, half-brother?

348
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,550
噢  克里特卖烈酒给切诺基人
Oh, Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee.

349
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,710
他拿着个大螺栓向我冲来
He come at me with a king bolt.

350
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,160
大螺栓
A king bolt?

351
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,020
你带着枪  他朝你冲过去
You are armed, and he advanced upon you.

352
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,860
手里就拿着个大螺栓
With nothing more than a King bolt?

353
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,420
还是从马车牵引架上卸下来的
From a wagon tongue?

354
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,930
我见过有人被比螺栓还小的东西
I've seen men badly tore up with

355
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,410
撕成重伤  我是在正当防卫
nothing bigger than a king bolt. I defended myself.

356
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,160
回到我们的案子
Returning to the other encounter.

357
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,670
你碰上了艾伦还有他剩下的两个儿子
With Aaron Wharton, and his two remaining sons.

358
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,150
你从藏身之处猛然跃起
You sprang from cover.

359
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,670
手里拿着左轮枪
With revolver in hand.

360
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,570
-就是那样  -上好子弹准备射击
-That'd be it. -Loaded and cocked.

361
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,290
要是没上好子弹  我还怎么开枪
Well if it ain't loaded and cocked, it don't shoot.

362
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,840
和他的儿子一样  
And like his son,

363
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,730
艾伦冲向了一个带着武器的人
Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man.

364
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,860
可他也有武器  他举着把斧头
Well he was armed, he had an axed raised.

365
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,840
我记得你曾作证说你后退躲开了艾伦
I believe you testified you backed away from Aaron Wharton.

366
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,060
-没错  -朝哪个方向后退
-That's right. -Which direction were you going?

367
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,240
我后退的时候都是向后的
I always go backwards, when I'm backing up.

368
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,240
很有趣
Very amusing.

369
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,960
他朝你冲去的方式和克里特差不多
Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner of Clete Wharton

370
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
拿着个可怜的螺栓
menacing you with that little

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,040
或者一卷报纸之类的玩意儿来威胁你
king bolt or rolledup newspaper or whatever it was.

372
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,790
对  他开始咒骂
Yes sir. He commenced to cussing

373
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,520
-嘴里放着狠话  -然后你向后退
-and laying about with threats. -And you were backing away.

374
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
枪战发生之前你后退了多少步
How many steps before the shooting started?

375
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,170
七八步吧
Uh, seven, eight steps.

376
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,180
很好  而沃顿先生穷追不舍
Good, and Wharton keeping pace.

377
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,570
离他的营火越来越远
Advancing away from his campfire.

378
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,720
七  八  步
Seven, eight, steps.

379
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,370
那有多远
What would that be?

380
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,040
十五  或者二十英尺
Fifteen, twenty feet?

381
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,100
差不多吧
I suppose.

382
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,300
你能否向陪审团解释一下  考伯恩先生
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn.

383
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,040
为什么沃顿先生被发现的时候
Why Mr. Wharton was found

384
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,440
倒在他的手盆边上  一只手还在火里
immediately by his wash pot, one arm in the fire.

385
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,590
-袖子和手都烧着了  -呃
- His sleeve and hand smoldering. - Well...

386
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,160
你是否在射杀他之后还搬动了尸体
Did you move the body after you shot him?

387
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,470
我为什么要那么干
Why would I do that?

388
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,580
你否认把尸体拖到营火旁边并把手扔进去
You did not drag the body over to the fire? Fling his arm in?

389
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,570
-我否认  先生  -两个证人
-No, sir. -Two witnesses.

390
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,680
两个目击了事发现场的证人
Who arrived on the scene

391
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,570
能够为尸体的位置作证
will testify to the location of the body.

392
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,240
你不记得搬动过尸体
You do not remember moving the body.

393
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,260
那么  这就是一起当可怜的沃顿先生正在
So it was, a cold blooded bushwhack,

394
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,840
照料营火的时候发生的冷血袭击
while poor Mr. Wharton was tending his campfire.

395
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
抗议
Objection.

396
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,250
要是尸体真在那儿  可能是我搬的
I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him.

397
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,940
我记不清了
I do not remember.

398
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,900
为什么你要去搬动尸体  考伯恩先生
Why, would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?

399
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,920
那些猪崽在附近跑来跑去  可能是它们挪的
Them hogs rooting around they might have moved him.

400
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,790
我记不清了
I do not remember.

401
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,570
傻逼娘娘腔
Pencil-neck son of a bitch.

402
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,230
-考伯恩先生  -干嘛
-Mr. Cogburn. -What do you want?

403
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,360
我想跟您谈一会儿
I'd like to talk to you a minute.

404
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,700
干嘛
What is it?

405
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,060
他们告诉我您是真正有勇气和毅力的人
They tell me you're a man with, true grit.

406
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,120
你想干嘛  小女孩
What do you want, girl?

407
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,720
有话直说  该吃晚饭了
Speak up, it is suppertime.

408
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,990
我来卷吧
Let me do that.

409
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,320
你的烟丝太干了
Your makings are too dry.

410
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,410
我在找在蒙纳克客栈门口
I am looking for the man who shot and killed my father,

411
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,360
枪杀了我父亲弗兰克・罗斯的男人
Frank Ross, in front of the Monarch boarding house.

412
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,610
他的名字叫汤姆・切尼
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

413
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,210
他们说他逃到了印第安人的地盘
They say he's over in Indian Territory,

414
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,700
我需要有人帮我追捕他
and I need somebody to go after him.

415
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,610
你叫什么  小女孩
What's your name, girl.

416
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,150
我叫麦蒂・罗斯
My name is Mattie Ross.

417
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,250
我们家住在耶尔县
We're located in Yell County.

418
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,600
我妈妈在家里照顾
My mother is at home looking after

419
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,470
我的妹妹维多利亚和弟弟小弗兰克
my sister Victoria and my brother little Frank.

420
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,620
你最好回家去
You best go home to them.

421
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,620
他们需要人照顾
They'll need help with the charges.

422
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,070
切尼身上背着逃犯逮捕令
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.

423
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,450
只要你能逮捕他  政府会奖励你两美元
The government will pay you two dollars

424
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,500
每追踪一英里额外奖励十美分
for bringing him in plus ten cents a mile for each of you.

425
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,390
在这基础上  我会付给你五十美元的酬劳
On top of that, I will pay you a fifty dollar reward.

426
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,670
你到底是谁
What are you?

427
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,680
你那兜里装着什么
What you got there in your poke?

428
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,530
天啊  一把柯尔特龙骑兵左轮
By God! A Colt Dragoon!

429
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,590
你个小不点
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin,

430
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,590
拿着这么一把枪要干嘛
what're you doing with a pistol like that?

431
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,550
我打算用它杀掉汤姆・切尼
Well I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.

432
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,870
杀掉汤姆・切尼  
Kill Tom Chaney?

433
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,920
要是法律没能惩罚他的话
Well if the law fails to do so.

434
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,860
那这枪能帮上你的忙
Well that piece will do the job for you.

435
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,220
不过你最好找好支点
If you can find a high stump

436
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,320
身后顶着墙[形容这枪后坐力大]
to rest it on and a wall to put behind you.

437
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,600
这里没有人认识我父亲
Nobody here knew my father and I'm,

438
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,870
而且除非我亲自动手
afraid nothing's is going to be done about Chaney

439
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,370
恐怕切尼会逍遥法外
except I do it.

440
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,490
我弟弟还是个孩子
My brother is a child,

441
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,000
我母亲优柔寡断  又悲痛致残
and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief.

442
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,780
我不相信你有五十美元
I don't believe you have fifty dollars.

443
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,350
我跟斯通希尔上校签了合约
I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill

444
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,460
他明天或者后天就会支付给我
which he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day

445
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,980
一旦律师签好了手续
once a lawyer countersigns.

446
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,110
我不相信关于金钱的任何事情
I don't believe in fairy tales or sermons or stories about money,

447
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,280
小妹妹  不过谢谢你帮我卷的烟
baby sister. But thank you for the cigarette.

448
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,140
你妈妈还在等你回家吧  宝贝
Isn't your Mama expecting you home, dear?

449
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,220
我的事还没处理完
My business is not yet finished.

450
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,610
弗洛依夫人  有新空出来房间吗
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?

451
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,650
特纳奶奶那间  那床太挤了
Grandma Turner... the bed is quite narrow.

452
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,570
后面二楼倒是空出来了
The second-floor back did open up

453
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,860
但是  门廊上的那位先生
But uh, that gentleman on the porch,

454
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,270
刚住进去
has just taken it.

455
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,050
不过别担心  宝贝
Oh but don't worry yourself, dear.

456
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,660
你没有打扰到特纳奶奶
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

457
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,850
我叫勒波义夫
My name is LeBoeuf.

458
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,250
我刚从耶尔县过来
I just come from Yell County.

459
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,260
我们耶尔县可没有你这么滑稽的牛仔
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.

460
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,740
你这些俏皮话对我是没用的
A saucy line will not get you far with me.

461
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,980
我昨天早上见了你母亲
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

462
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,880
她让你马上回家
She said for you to come right on home.

463
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,790
你到那儿去干嘛
What was your business there?

464
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,410
我想你认识这个男人
This is a man I think you know.

465
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,760
你管他叫汤姆・切尼
You called him Tom Chaney.

466
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,570
至少我想是这样  在我追踪他的
I believe. All the months I've been

467
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,300
这几个月间  他是瑟伦・切尔姆斯福特
tracking him he has used the name, Theron Chelmsford.

468
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,690
也是约翰・托德・安德森
John Todd Andersen,

469
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,020
还用过别的假名
and others.

470
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,570
他在路易斯安那州的门罗  
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana,

471
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,360
和阿肯色州的派恩布拉夫等地游荡
and Pine Bluff, Arkansas

472
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,340
然后他出现在你父亲那儿
Before turning up at your fathers place.

473
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,970
那为什么你没在阿肯色州的派恩布拉夫
Then why did you not catch him at,

474
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,990
或者路易斯安那州的门罗抓住他
Pine Bluff, Arkansas or Monroe, Louisiana?

475
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,920
他特别狡诈
He is a crafty one.

476
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,170
我还以为他是那种粗人呢
I thought him slow-witted myself.

477
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,820
他只是看上去那样而已
That was his act.

478
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,340
不错的伪装
It was a good one.

479
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,950
你是执法者吗
Are you some kind of law?

480
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,070
没错
That's right

481
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,270
我是德州骑警
I'm a Texas Ranger.

482
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,290
在那个州  你大概还算是个人物
That may make you a big noise in that state

483
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,050
在阿肯色州你该知道德州式的
in Arkansas you should mind that your Texas trappings and title

484
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,210
马具和头衔可没什么吸引力
do not make you an object of fun.

485
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,700
你为什么一直徒劳地在追捕切尼
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

486
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,930
他在德州韦科枪杀了州参议员比波斯
He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs in Waco, Texas.

487
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,870
比波斯家发出了悬赏
Bibbs family have put out a reward.

488
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,090
切尼为什么会枪杀州参议员
How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?

489
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,400
我听说与一条狗的纠纷有关
My understanding is there was an argument about a dog.

490
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,490
你知道切尼现在何处吗
You know anything about the whereabouts of Chaney?

491
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,920
他在印第安人的地盘
He is in the Territory, and I

492
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,050
而且我对你拿到赏金不抱多大希望
hold out little hope for you earning your bounty.

493
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,260
-怎么说  -我的人会先你一步拿到赏金
-Why is that? -My man will beat you to it.

494
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,060
我雇了一位最厉害的执行法警
I have hired a deputy marshal, the toughest one they have

495
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,560
而且他对据说和切尼联系密切的
and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

496
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,030
奈德・彼伯帮很熟悉
that they say Chaney has tied up with.

497
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,130
那我就加入你和你的法警吧
Well, I will throw in with you and your Marshal.

498
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,560
不  考伯恩警官和我两个人就够了
No, Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.

499
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,150
我们合作会更有优势
It'll be to our mutual advantage.

500
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,090
我想你那位警官会对那地方很熟悉
Your Marshal, I presume, knows the Territory.

501
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,600
而我熟悉切尼  活捉他至少得两个人
I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man job taking him alive.

502
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,020
抓到切尼之后他得被押回史密斯堡受绞刑
When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to hang.

503
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,100
我不能让他因为
I am not having him go

504
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,200
枪杀了什么州议员而被押回德州受绞刑
to Texas to hang for shooting some senator.

505
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,770
他在哪儿受绞刑并不重要  对不对
It is not important where he hangs, it is?

506
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,770
对我来说重要
It is to me.

507
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,090
对你来说呢
Is it to you?

508
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,510
对我来说这意味着一大笔钱
It means a great deal of money to me.

509
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,100
我跟了他好几个月
It's been many months' Work.

510
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,900
我很遗憾你的工资并不是按月支付
I'm sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages

511
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,360
还被这白痴耍得浪费了一整个冬天
and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit.

512
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,640
你说的话可真是冷酷无情
You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements.

513
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,170
我坐在那儿看着你的时候
While I sat there watching

514
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,250
我还在考虑要不要夺取你的初吻
you I gave some thought to stealing a kiss

515
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,670
尽管你还小  又病泱泱的
though you are very young and sick and

516
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,140
而且  对我也没什么吸引力
unattractive to boot, but

517
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,270
可现在  我倒是想要
now I have a mind to give

518
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,070
用皮带好好抽你个五六下
you five or six good licks with my belt.

519
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,290
两样都不合我口味
One would be as unpleasant as the other.

520
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,140
我倒是给你个建议吧  把梳子沾湿  
If you wet your comb,

521
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,160
说不定能把那头乱毛梳平
it might tame that cowlick.

522
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,820
麦蒂  我希望你能把这些事务
Mattie, I wish you would leave these matters

523
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,620
完全移交给我处理  或者至少得
entirely to me or at the very least

524
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,750
在签那些条约之前
give me the courtesy of

525
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,000
赏脸咨询在下的意见
consulting me before entering such agreements.

526
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,200
我不是在责怪你  可我不得不说你这种
I am not scolding you, but I am saying your head strong ways,

527
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,540
固执的作风总有一天将使你走进死胡同
will lead you into a tight corner one day.

528
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,820
我相信随信附上的文件
I trust the enclosed document

529
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,880
能让你处理完事务  回到耶尔县来
will let you conclude your business and return to Yell County.

530
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,080
您的  J・诺贝尔・达吉特
Yours, J. Noble Dagget.

531
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,510
你今天看起来就跟我昨天一样糟
I was as bad yesterday as you look today.

532
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,160
我被逼地跟特纳奶奶同床共枕
I was forced to share a bed with Grandma Turner.

533
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,720
我和特纳奶奶不熟
I'm not acquainted with Grandma Turner.

534
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,680
既然她住在这个城市
If she is a resident of this city

535
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,590
要是她染上了什么疾病  我可不奇怪
it does not surprise me that she carries disease.

536
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,680
这个疟疾肆虐的地方毁掉了我的身体
This malarial place has ruined my health.

537
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,530
也毁掉了我的生意
As it has my finances.

538
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,780
我欠你钱
I owe you money.

539
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,160
你可别认为我占了你便宜
You have not traded poorly.

540
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,810
噢  可不嘛
Oh, certainly not.

541
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,560
我为了一匹不属于我的马
I'm paying you for a horse

542
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
付给你一笔钱
I do not possess.

543
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,280
然后我还从你手上买回了一群没用的小马驹
And have bought back a string of useless ponies

544
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,310
我还卖不出去
Which I cannot sell again.

545
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,540
你忘了那匹灰马
You're forgetting the Grey horse.

546
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,200
-劣马  -你看问题的角度有失偏颇
-Crowbait. -You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.

547
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,710
我看问题的角度来自上帝永恒的真理
I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth.

548
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,820
你的病让你过于悲观了
Your illness is putting you down in the dumps.

549
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,920
你很快就会找到买家买那些小马了
You will soon find another buyer for the ponies.

550
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,100
我倒是有个暂定的订单  十美元一匹
Well I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head.

551
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,430
来自小石城的菲茨肥皂厂
From the Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock.

552
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,070
就这么毁掉那些生气勃勃的小马太可惜了
It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.

553
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,940
可惜就可惜吧  这生意本来就谈不成
So it would. I'm confident the deal will fall through.

554
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
我要匹小马
Look here, I need a pony

555
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,560
我会给你十美元来买一匹
and I will pay ten dollars for one of them.

556
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,020
不  那是批发价  不  不
No. That was lot price. No no.

557
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,070
等等
Wait a minute.

558
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,620
我们又做上生意了吗
Are we trading again?

559
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,410
这匹马真美
This one is beautiful.

560
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,580
他意识不到他身上有个骑手
He don't know he got a rider.

561
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,830
您太轻了
You're to light.

562
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,440
他以为身上有只虱子
He think he got a horsefly on him.

563
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,010
他精力非常旺盛
He's very spirited.

564
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,810
我就叫他"小黑"吧
I'll call him 'Little Blackie'.

565
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,400
好名字
Das a good name.

566
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,270
他爱吃什么
What does he like for a treat?

567
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,450
小姐  他是匹马
Well ma'am, he's a horse.

568
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,150
所以他爱吃苹果
So he likes apples.

569
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,600
替我谢谢斯通希尔先生
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

570
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,290
不  小姐  我没资格提您的名字
No ma'am, I ain't supposed to utter your name.

571
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,520
看  睡着了
See. Sleep.

572
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,760
没关系  我会叫醒他的
That is fine, I will wake him.

573
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,520
考伯恩警官
Marshal Cogburn.

574
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,380
是我  麦蒂・罗斯  你的雇主
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

575
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,520
你还有多久能出发
How long til you are ready to go?

576
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,580
去哪儿  
Go where?

577
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,810
去印第安区抓汤姆・切尼
Into the Indian Territory. In pursuit of Tom Chaney.

578
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,220
噢  你就是那个坐拥金山的可怜小女孩
Oh, You're the bereaved girl with stories of El Dorado.

579
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,140
哈  你有多少钱
Huh, how much money you got there?

580
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,660
我说抓到切尼就给你五十美元
I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney.

581
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,330
你不相信我
You did not believe me?

582
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,870
我不知道
Well, I did not know.

583
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,250
你让人捉摸不透
You are a hard one to figure.

584
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,040
你准备好出发要多长时间
How long for you to make ready to depart?

585
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,690
悠着点儿  小妹妹
Well uh, hold on sis.

586
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,310
我记得你的任务  我可不记得答应过
I remember your offer but do not remember agreeing to it.

587
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,770
要是我得去和奈德・彼伯帮干架
If I'm to go up against, Ned Pepper.

588
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,150
我得要一百美元
Then I'll need a hundred dollars.

589
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,240
就是这个价  一百美元
That much I can tell you. A hundred dollars.

590
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,360
逮回你的人  一百美元
To retrieve your man, a hundred dollars.

591
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,230
得先付五十美元
I will take that fifty dollars in advance.

592
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,300
当作路费花销
There will be expenses.

593
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,090
你这是在试图愚弄我
You are trying to take advantage of me.

594
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,120
我给你的是儿童折扣价
I am giving you the children's rate.

595
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,220
我可不是骗子  我只是个住在
I am not a sharper, I am an old man

596
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,690
中国人开的杂货铺后头睡在绳床上的老头
sleeping in a rope bed in a room behind a Chinese grocery.

597
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,390
我一无所有  
I have nothing

598
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,990
你就想在威士忌里醉死吧
You want to be kept in whiskey.

599
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,220
我可用不着买那个
I don't have to buy that,

600
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,540
我没收就行
I confiscate it.

601
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,490
我可是法庭警官
I am an officer of the court.

602
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,750
谢谢
Ah, thank you.

603
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,230
一百美元  就这个价
Hundred dollars, that's the rate.

604
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,020
那我就不讨价还价了
I shall not niggle.

605
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,890
我们今天下午能出发吗
Can we depart this afternoon?

606
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,830
我们
We?

607
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,170
你不能去  这不包括在任务里
You're not going, that is no part of it.

608
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,330
你要是以为我会傻到给你五十美元然后
You have misjudge me if you think I am silly

609
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,120
眼巴巴看着你扬长而去  你就大错特错了
enough to give you fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off.

610
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,230
我是个合法的美国法警
I am a bonded U.S. Marshal.

611
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,420
那种话对我可没用
That weighs but little with me.

612
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,630
我得看着你把这事做完
I will see the thing done.

613
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,070
该死  我可不能一边扮硬汉
Damn ducks. I can't go after Ned Pepper

614
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,250
追捕奈德・彼伯  一边又照顾个小孩
and a band of hard men and look after a baby at the same time.

615
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,410
我可不是小孩
I am not a baby.

616
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,010
我可不会在那种房间里有张暖床
I will not be stopping at boarding

617
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,740
桌子上摆着热饭热菜的客栈里歇脚
houses where there is warm beds and hot grub on the table.

618
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,090
我会风驰电掣  风餐露宿
I'll be traveling fast and eating light.

619
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,590
最多在地上打个小盹儿
What little sleeping is done will take place on the ground.

620
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,360
我以前也露过一次营
Well I have slept out a night before.

621
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,640
爸爸去年夏天带我和小弗兰克
Papa took me and Little Frank

622
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,540
去佩蒂吉恩州立公园猎过一次浣熊
coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.

623
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,130
我们在森林里待了整整一晚上
We were in the woods all night.

624
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,610
我们升起了一大簇篝火  还讲鬼故事
We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories.

625
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,080
我们玩的很开心
We had a good time.

626
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,810
猎浣熊
Coon hunting!?

627
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,300
咱这可不是什么猎浣熊
This ain't no coon hunt!

628
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,190
这主意和猎浣熊差不多
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

629
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,640
这跟猎浣熊可差了十万八千里
It don't come within forty miles of being a coon hunt!

630
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
你不过是好大喜功而已
You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is.

631
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,830
给你钱
Here is the money.

632
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,380
我的目标是抓住汤姆・切尼
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,

633
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,880
要是你没胆  我就找个有胆子的人
and if you are not game, I will find somebody who is game.

634
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,340
到目前为止我发现你只会说空话
All I have heard out of you so far is talk.

635
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,040
我知道你能喝威士忌  还能打呼噜吐痰
I know you can drink whiskey and snore

636
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,430
躺在污秽的床上  抱怨自己悲惨的际遇
and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station.

637
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,020
然后就是自吹自擂
The rest has been braggadocio.

638
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,760
他们说你有勇气  所以我才来找你
They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you.

639
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,320
我花钱可不是雇你来说空话的
I am not paying for talk. I can get all

640
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,530
我在那客栈里就听够了
the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.

641
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,940
把你的钱留下
Leave your money.

642
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,580
明早七点来这儿找我
Meet me here tomorrow morning

643
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,300
然后我们出发去"猎浣熊"
at seven o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt.

644
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,360
最挚爱的母亲
Dearest mother,

645
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,170
我即将开始一段伟大的冒险
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.

646
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,960
我听说汤姆・切尼逃入了荒野之中
I have learned that Tom Chaney has fled into the wild.

647
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,800
而我将协助当局将他捉拿归案
And I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.

648
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,430
你知道爸爸总让我坚信正义
You know that Papa would want me to be firm in the right.

649
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,820
就像他一直做的那样
As he always was.

650
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,150
所以别为我担心
So do not fear on my account.

651
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,000
纵使走过死亡笼罩的幽谷
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.

652
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,600
我也不怕遭害[圣经诗篇廿三篇四节]
I shall fear no evil.

653
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,720
万物的造物主俯视着我  而且
The author of all things watches over me, and

654
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,220
我有匹好马
I have a fine horse.

655
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,270
亲亲小弗兰基  捏捏维奥莱特的脸
Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek.

656
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,030
我父亲的死  终将迎来复仇
My Papa's death will soon be avenged.

657
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,960
我要出发去查克托区了
I'm off for the Choctaw Nation,

658
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,680
考伯恩警官呢
Where's Marshal Cogburn?

659
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,800
走了
Went away.

660
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,570
留了这个给你
Left this.

661
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,980
这有张回家的车票
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home.

662
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,930
用它回家去
Use it.

663
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,280
当你看到这封信时
By the time you read this,

664
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,780
我已经穿过河到印第安区了
I will be across the river in the Indian Nation.

665
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
你不可能追上来的
Pursuit will be futile.

666
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,270
我会带切尼回来的
I will return with your man, Chaney.

667
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,130
让我自己来完成
Leave me to my work.

668
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,770
鲁本・考伯恩
Reuben Cogburn.

669
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,390
那是考伯恩法警吗
Is that Marshal Cogburn?

670
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,770
对
That is the man.

671
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,780
他旁边是谁
Who's he with?

672
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,660
不知道
I do not know.

673
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,880
带我过去
Well, take me across.

674
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,540
那你就是那个逃犯
So, you're the runaway.

675
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,920
他告诉我  你一旦出现
Marshal told me you'd show up.

676
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,710
就带去见警长
I'd present you to the Sheriff.

677
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,360
那是瞎编的  放开我的马
That is a story. Let go my horse.

678
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,860
我过河有急事
I have business across the river.

679
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,400
如果你还是不带我过去
If you don't turn around and take me across,

680
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,270
那我们就法庭上见
You may find yourself in court where you don’t want to be.

681
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,280
我有个好律师
I have a good lawyer.

682
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,810
小黑  冲过去
Go, Little Blackie.

683
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,820
加油
Come on.

684
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,090
真是匹好马
That is quite a horse.

685
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,850
我用十美元买下它
I'll give you ten dollars for him.

686
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,310
用你从我这偷来的钱吗
From the money you stole from me?

687
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,760
那不是偷  我不已经去抓你要的人了吗
That was not stolen, I'm out for your man.

688
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,280
我们协商好一起走的
I was to accompany you.

689
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,200
如果我不去  协议便不生效
If I do not, there is no agreement

690
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,060
那你就是偷我的钱
and my money was stolen.

691
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,340
快把这孩子送回摆渡那去吧
Marshal, put this child back on the ferry.

692
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,720
山高路远  这简直就是浪费时间
It's a long road, and time is a-wasting.

693
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,850
若我现在回去
If I go back, it's to the U.S. Marshal's office

694
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,730
我会去警署报告  你偷了我的钱
to report the theft of my money.

695
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,580
考伯恩法警  "追上来也没意义"
And futile, Marshal Cogburn, "Pursuit would be futile"?

696
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,010
的没意义你都拼错了
It's not spelt F-U-D-E-L.

697
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,510
我真要打你屁股了
It's time for your spanking.

698
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,030
你再老三老四
Now you do as the grown-ups say!

699
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,180
我就拿鞭子抽烂你的腿
Or I will get myself a birch switch and stripe your leg!

700
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,590
法警  你就眼睁睁地看着他这么打我吗
Are you going to let him do this, Marshal.

701
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,830
不会  勒波义夫  放下鞭
No, I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LeBoeuf.

702
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,840
不行  我开始了就不能停下
I aim to finish what I started.

703
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,060
那估计会是你人生中犯下的最大的错误
That'll be the biggest mistake you ever made,

704
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,840
你这个德州傻牛仔
you Texas brush-popper.

705
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,670
竟然被一小姑娘摆布
Hoorawed by a little girl.

706
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,990
我真不习惯生这么大的火堆
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

707
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,380
在德州  我们用小树枝生小火
In Texas, we will make do with a fire of little more than twigs

708
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,350
或是用水牛的粪便
or buffalo chips.

709
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,520
用豆子来维持过夜火
Heat the nights rations of beans.

710
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,900
骑警队规定
And, it is Ranger

711
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,060
不能在生火的地方搭帐篷
policy never to make your camp in the same place as your cookfire.

712
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,010
在野外暴露自己的行踪  是不明智的
Very imprudent to make your presence known in unsettled country.

713
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,780
你怎么知道巴格比那有情报
How do you know Bagby will have intelligence?

714
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
他开了家店
He has a store.

715
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,250
这样就有消息来源了吗
That makes him an authority on movements in the Territory?

716
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,500
现在我们身在荒野里
We have entered a wild place.

717
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,660
不管是谁
Anyone coming in,

718
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,730
都需要食物的补给
wanting any kind of supply,

719
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,250
所以那是必经之路
cannot pick and choose his portal.

720
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,920
你这样做有必要吗
That is a piece of foolishness.

721
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,270
这季节蛇都冬眠了
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.

722
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,890
我有听说过冬眠起来的蛇
They've been known to wake up.

723
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,080
我也要根绳子
Well, let me have a rope, too.

724
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,010
你就不用了
A snake would not bother you.

725
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,450
又小又瘦的  蛇才不会喜欢
You are to little and boney.

726
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,230
去打点明早用的水  放在火堆旁
You should fetch the water for the morning and put it by the fire.

727
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,590
-小溪要结冰了  -我才不去
- The creek'll ice over tonight. - I'm not going down there again.

728
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,090
你想要的话  就自己去打
You want anymore water, you can go fetch it yourself.

729
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,150
你该庆幸  这地方这么容易打到水
You're lucky to be traveling in a place with a spring so handy.

730
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,320
在我那儿  连续几天都看不到一滴水
In my country you can ride for days and see no ground water.

731
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,390
我只能从马蹄印里弄出点脏水喝
I have lapped filthily water from a hoofprint.

732
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,060
这已经算幸运了
and was glad to have it.

733
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,480
若我遇到一个德州牛仔
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies

734
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,220
说他从未喝过马蹄印里的水
who says he had never drank water out of a horse track

735
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,400
那我会跟他握手
I think I'll shake his hand

736
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,090
请他抽丹尼尔・韦伯斯特雪茄
and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

737
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,130
你不相信
You do not believe it?

738
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,580
前二十五遍还相信
Oh, I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard it.

739
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,670
说不定  还真有可能是真的
Maybe, maybe this is true.

740
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,640
说不定舔脏水是骑警队的规定
Maybe lapping water off the ground is Ranger policy.

741
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,050
你太无知了  考伯恩
You're getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn.

742
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,650
我不介意你拿我开玩笑
I don't mind a little personal chaffing.

743
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,380
但我不想听到
But I won't hear anything

744
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,490
任何拿骑警队做嘲讽对象的屁话
against the Ranger troop from a man like you.

745
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,950
你们骑绵羊都出名了
How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down there?

746
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,880
就算你的马全部倒下了
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping

747
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,600
我的白马依然能驰骋
when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed.

748
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,380
再敢开玩笑的话
Now make another joke about it.

749
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,030
你是想用你那三寸不烂之舌
You are only trying to put on a show for this girl Mattie

750
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,360
在小姑娘面前做表演吧
with what you must think is a keen tongue.

751
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,730
你说话怎么跟女人似的
This is like women talking.

752
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,890
是啊  没错
Yes, that is the way!

753
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,440
你弄得我在小姑娘眼里  显得特蠢
Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.

754
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,380
我想她已经知道你是什么货色了
I think she has got you pretty well figured.

755
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,570
想听"午夜访客"吗
Would you two like to hear the story of "the Midnight Caller"?

756
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,170
其中一个扮访客
One of you is gonna have to be the caller.

757
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,660
我教你说什么
Now I'll tell you what to say.

758
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,110
我扮演其他角色
Now I'll do all the other parts myself.

759
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,400
-早  警官  -早
- Good morning, Marshal. - Morning.

760
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,240
勒波义夫先生呢
Where's Mr.  LeBoeuf?

761
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,140
去溪边解手去了
Down by the creek performing his necessaries.

762
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,130
考伯恩警长  我们正好需要私自协商下
Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance for a private parley.

763
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,870
你和勒波义夫先生之间  应该有
I gather that you and Mr. LeBoeuf have come to some,

764
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,080
某种协议吧
some sort of agreement.

765
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,300
作为你的雇主
And as your employer I believe

766
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,980
我有权知道  详细内容
I have the right to know the particulars.

767
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
详细内容
The particulars...

768
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,070
我们会把切尼交给德州执法官
...is that we bring Chaney down to the magistrate in San Saba Texas

769
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,140
那有丰厚的悬赏等我们去拿
where they have a considerable reward on offer, which we split.

770
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,250
我不想让他被带到德州
I did not want him brought to Texas,

771
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,110
不想让他在德州服法
to have a Texas punishment administered for a Texas crime.

772
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,030
这不是我们的协议
That was not our agreement.

773
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,090
你不是希望他被抓  然后服法吗
What you want is to have him caught and punished.

774
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,910
我要他为我爸服法
I want him to know he's being punished for killing my father.

775
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,120
那么  你可以亲口告诉他
Well, you can let him know that. You can tell him to his face.

776
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,920
还可以吐他口水
You can spit on him.

777
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,760
或者叫他吃沙  我会帮你把人按着
and make him eat sand out of the road. I can hold him down.

778
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,620
如果你想的话
If you want,

779
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,300
我会把他打得皮开肉绽
I'll flay the flesh off the soles of his feet,

780
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,880
然后帮你找印第安辣椒抹上去
and find you Indian pepper you can rub into the wound.

781
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,830
这样不值一百美金吗
Isn't that a hundred dollar value?

782
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,170
不值
No, it is not.

783
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,580
既然我付了钱  你就应该服从我
When I have brought and paid for something, I will have my way.

784
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,100
若不服从  为什么我要付你钱
Why do you think I'm paying you, if not to have my way.

785
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,580
你现在要明白
It is time for you to learn.

786
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,810
不是所有细节都能按照你的意愿走
You cannot have your way in every little particular.

787
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,680
若你不满意
If you find I fail to satisfy your terms,

788
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,840
等追捕结束后  我退你钱
I'll return your money at the end of this expedition.

789
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,780
等我和小黑回去后
Little Blackie and I are ridding back to

790
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,080
要把这些告诉警署  这是欺诈
the U.S. Marshal's office. This is fraud.

791
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,090
该死的
God damn it!

792
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,430
怎么了
What's going on?

793
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,490
我们在谈生意
This is a business conversation.

794
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,570
谈生意
Is that what you call it?

795
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,340
看起来  你还是被小姑娘摆布
Sounds to me you're still being hoorawed by a little girl.

796
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,360
-你说  摆布  -没错
- You say, hoorawed? - That was the word.

797
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,760
没有摆布  我和警官的协议
There is no hoorawing in it. In my agreement with the Marshal,

798
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,470
比你的早  这有法律效应的
antedates your. It has the force of law.

799
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,660
法律效应
The force of law?

800
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,560
他可是个恶名昭彰的混球
This man is a notorious thumper.

801
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,120
他跟着昆特里尔到处抢劫
He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill,

802
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,210
还有血腥比尔・安德森 
and Bloody Bill Anderson.

803
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,630
他们是守法公民  德州佬
Them men was patriots, Texas trash.

804
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,500
在堪萨斯州的劳伦斯  欺杀妇孺
They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.

805
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,190
简直一派胡言
That's a God damn lie!

806
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,790
你在哪儿服役
What army was you in, Mister?

807
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,900
什里夫波特市
I was at Shreveport.

808
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,660
先是跟着柯比・史密斯  然后
First with Kirby Smith, then with...

809
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,430
从属哪个部队
What side was you on?

810
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,610
北佛吉尼亚部队  考伯恩
I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn.

811
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,540
我说这个也不会掉脑袋
And I don't have to hang my head when I say it.

812
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,810
若你跟的是昆特里尔首长
If you had served with Captain Quantrill.

813
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,450
首长  昆特里尔首长
Captain! Captain Quantrill.

814
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,180
确实是他
That...indeed.

815
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,310
-不说了  勒波义夫  -哪个首长
- You had best let this go, LeBoeuf. - Captain of what?

816
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,890
很好
Good, then!

817
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,220
德州那边可没这个闲钱给我
There're not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas,

818
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,820
听你扯屁话
to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions.

819
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,290
我们之间的协议作废了
Our agreement is nullified.

820
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,300
正合我意
That suits me.

821
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,420
分道扬镳  自力更生吧
It's man for himself.

822
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,070
恭喜你  考伯恩
Congratulations, Cogburn.

823
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,490
成功从一个抢劫犯晋升为保姆了
You've graduated from marauder to wetnurse.

824
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,540
再见
A-dios.

825
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,980
我们不需要他  是吧  警官
We don't need him, do we Marshal?

826
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,490
会需要他的夏普斯卡宾枪吧
We'll miss his Sharps carbine.

827
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,230
这里可不是什么太平之地
It's apt to get lively out here.

828
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
住手
Hey!

829
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,070
快跑
Go on.

830
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,970
待在这儿  小妹妹
Stay here, sister.

831
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,760
我去见巴格比
And I will see Bagby.

832
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,480
切尼来过吗
Has Chaney been here?

833
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,680
没有
No.

834
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,860
憧伞ずＫ沽教烨袄垂
Coke Hayes was, two days ago.

835
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,880
憧珊凸肥涸四蔚乱换锏
Coke runs with Lucky Ned.

836
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,510
他用这个买了东西
He bought supplies, with this.

837
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,580
是爸爸的金币
Well, this is Papa's gold piece.

838
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,660
汤姆・切尼  等着  我们来了
Tom Chaney here we come.

839
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,230
这金币到处都是
It is not the world's only California gold piece.

840
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,010
可在这少见
They are rare here.

841
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,200
是很少见
They are rare.

842
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,540
就算是切尼的
But if it is, Chaney's,

843
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,970
他加入狗屎运奈德并不是唯一的可能性
Just as easily mean that Lucky Ned

844
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,430
他也有可能是被狗屎运奈德杀人劫财了
and his gang fell upon him, as that he fell in with them.

845
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,660
切尼现在可能已经是尸体了
Chaney could be a corpse.

846
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,840
这会令人很失望的  警官
That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal.

847
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,760
那我们现在该怎么办
what would we do?

848
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,290
继续追捕
Um, pursue them.

849
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,330
不管怎么样  奈德和法警的账还没算清呢
Ned's unfinished business for the marshals anyhow.

850
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,270
抓到他  就等于就抓到切尼了
Or when we have him we will also have Chaney.

851
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,330
起码知道切尼尸体所在
or we can learn the whereabouts of his body.

852
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,790
巴格比不知道他们往哪儿走了
Bagby didn't know which way they went.

853
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,580
但起码  他们从这经过过
But now we know they come through here.

854
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,410
这儿只有一两条路好走
They couldn't be going but one or two ways.

855
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,730
一条是朝着旋梯山朝北走
Heading north, towards the Winding Stair Mountains.

856
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,560
另外一条就是朝西走
Pushing further west.

857
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,540
我猜是北边  那容易抢到东西
I suspect north. There is more to rob.

858
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,430
我买了家餐馆
I bought an eating place.

859
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,680
起名叫"绿蛙"
Called the "Green frog".

860
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,340
从此我自称伯勒先生
Started calling myself, Burroughs.

861
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,690
但我又开始酗酒了
But my drinking picked up.

862
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,440
妻子不喜欢我的那帮狐朋酒友
My wife did not care for the company of my river friends.

863
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,290
她决定重投前夫的怀抱
She decided to go back to her fist husband,

864
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,350
一个五金店的店员
a clerk in a hardware store.

865
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,820
临走前  她和我说  "再见  鲁本"
That was when she said, "Goodbye Reuben."

866
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,420
"你不够得体"
"A love for decency does not abide in you."

867
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,330
一个离婚女人竟和你谈体面
There is a divorced woman talking about decency.

868
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,880
我告诉她   "再见  诺拉"
I told her, "goodbye Nola."

869
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,280
"但愿那卖钉子的混蛋这次能令你快乐"
"I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy this time."

870
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,890
她把我的儿子也带走了
She took my boy with her too.

871
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,370
反正他也不喜欢我
He never cared for me anyway.

872
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,190
估计是对他太凶了
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

873
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,090
虽然我不是故意的
I did not mean anything by it.

874
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,770
谁都不想有比我儿子贺拉斯还笨的小孩吧
You would not want to see a clumsier child than Horace.

875
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,000
他至少打破了四十个杯子
I bet he broke forty cups...

876
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,030
那是切尼吗
Is it Chaney?

877
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,220
单从脚底  可认不出
I would not recognize the soles of his feet.

878
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,880
那你爬上去看看
Well, you'll have to clamber up and look.

879
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,340
我太老太胖了
I'm too old and too fat.

880
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,910
现在绿蛙那多了张桌球台
Now the Green Frog had one billiard table.

881
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,880
男女都能玩  不过一般都是男的在玩
Served ladies and men both, mostly men.

882
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,380
我曾经想自己经营
I tried to run it myself a while,

883
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,350
但是总是照料不好
but I couldn’t keep good help.

884
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,060
我一直没有学会如何买肉
And I never did learn how to buy meat.

885
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,410
是他吗
Is that him?

886
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,420
我觉得不是
I believe not.

887
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,120
把他放下来
Well, cut him down.

888
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,510
为什么
Why?

889
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,190
我可能认识
I might know him.

890
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,650
所以我就跑去了德州那火烤之地
That was when I went out to the staked plain of Texas,

891
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,050
和弗农・沙夫特  还有个叫奥利的
and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe

892
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,710
平头族印第安人一起猎水牛
and a Flathead Indian named Olly.

893
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,690
摩门一家
The Mormons...

894
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,240
把沙夫特赶出了盐湖城
had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake City,

895
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,700
别问我为什么
but don't ask me what it was for.

896
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,170
就当做误会好了
Call it a misunderstanding and let it go at that.

897
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,890
那些无赖
Well,  the big shaggies,

898
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,540
都散了
about all gone now.

899
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,560
真他妈的遗憾
Damned shame.

900
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,490
现在能买到腌牛舌的话  三美金我也愿意
Give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo tongue.

901
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,380
为什么要把他吊这么高
Why did they hang him so high?

902
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,280
不知道
I don't know.

903
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,620
可能认为这样可以让他死得更惨
Possibly in the belief it would make him more dead.

904
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,240
我不认识这人
I do not know this man.

905
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,820
你吊死的吗
You hanged him?

906
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,860
为什么他把这吊死的人带走
Why is he taking the hanged man?

907
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,370
他认识的人吗
Did he know him?

908
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,880
不认识
He did not.

909
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,500
好歹是具尸体
But it is a dead body.

910
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,110
可以卖点钱
Must be worth something in the trade.

911
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,930
再说说我第二任妻子  埃德娜
Now my second wife, Edna.

912
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,430
她一直希望我成为律师
She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer.

913
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,230
买了本很厚的《丹尼尔协商技巧》
Bought this heavy book called Daniel's on Negotiable Instruments.

914
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,930
让我读
Set to make me reading it.

915
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,160
我从来没看懂过
Never could get a grip on it.

916
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,370
我很开心能够撇开它  离开德州
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.

917
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,880
我们离加拿大不远了
There ain’t six trees between here and Canada,

918
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,310
这段距离几乎寸草不生
nothing else grows but has stickers on it.

919
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,370
问他们...
Ask them...

920
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,800
-我就知道  -知道什么
- I knew it. - Knew what?

921
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,490
有人跟踪我们
We're being followed.

922
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,560
我刚嘱咐那印第安人若发现有人跟着我们
I asked that Indian to signal with a shot

923
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,080
就鸣枪做信号
if someone was on our trail.

924
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,670
我们应该担心吗  警官
Should we be concerned, Marshal?

925
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,770
不用  勒波义夫故意打草惊蛇
No, Mr. LeBoeuf is giving us his bird dog.

926
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,330
一旦计谋成功  他就会飞奔而至
He wants to cut it in, once it flushed his prey.

927
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,940
或许我们可以来回行走
Perhaps we could double back over our tracks,

928
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,320
来混淆他们的追踪
and confuse the trail in a clever way.

929
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,140
不用  我们就在这儿等
No, we will wait right here.

930
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,680
跟我们的朋友问声好
Offer our friend a warm hello.

931
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,600
问问他要去哪儿
Ask him where he's going.

932
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,000
你不是勒波义夫
You are not LeBoeuf.

933
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,030
我叫福斯特
My name is Forster.

934
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:16,680
我是这里的牙医
I practice dentistry in the nation.

935
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,550
也是兽医
Also, veterinary arts.

936
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,720
也开刀
And medicine,

937
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,390
不过是在那些不会乱动的人们身上
on those humans that will sit still for it.

938
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,750
看来你今天有收获啊
You have your work cut out for you there.

939
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,760
和一个诚恳的印第安人交易的
Traded for him with an Indian, who said he came by him honestly.

940
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,530
我以两面牙医镜一瓶祛痰剂作为交换
I gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of expectorant.

941
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,360
你们有需要
Do either of you need

942
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,060
医疗救助吗
Medical attention?

943
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,470
没有  要开始变冷了
No. Hey! Fixing to get cold.

944
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,680
你知道哪儿可以避寒吗
Do you know of anywhere to take shelter?

945
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,460
我有熊皮保暖
I have my bearskin.

946
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:05,570
你可能想去小流氓博本那儿
You might want to head over to the Original Greaser Bob's.

947
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,290
他在卡里伦河那凿了个洞
He notched a dugout into a hollow along the Carrillon River.

948
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,020
你穿过河
If you ride the river,

949
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,100
就能看到了
you won't fail to see it.

950
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,950
小流氓博本创意旅馆

951
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,570
小流氓博本
Greaser Bob...

952
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,340
在纠察线北边打猎
...is hunting north of the picket wire.

953
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:28,360
不会在意你借用一下的
And would not begrudge its use.

954
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,630
-多谢  -我已经拔了他的牙齿
- Much obliged. - Now, I have taken his teeth.

955
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,650
我会付价钱
I will entertain an offer,

956
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,350
买下他的其他部分
for the rest of him.

957
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,430
拿着我的大衣
Take my jacket.

958
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,530
轻轻地走到屋顶上
Creep onto the roof.

959
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,350
若他们不友好  听我指令  弄灭烟囱
If they're unfriendly I'll give you a sign to damp the chimney.

960
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,740
谁在外面
Who is out there?

961
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,870
我们想避下寒
We're looking for shelter.

962
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,760
没地方了  快滚
No room for you here! Ride on!

963
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,860
里面都有谁
Who all is in there?

964
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,860
滚
Ride on!

965
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,250
我是联邦官员
I'm a Federal officer.

966
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,330
里面有谁在
Who's in there?

967
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,120
一个圣公会教徒和一个废物
A Methodist and a son of a bitch.

968
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,150
我是大公鸡考伯恩
This is Rooster Cogburn.

969
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:25,240
还有哥伦布・波特和五名法警
Columbus Potter and five other Marshals is out here with me.

970
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,910
我们有一桶煤油
We have got a bucket of coal oil.

971
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,630
再过一分钟  就点燃你们的房子
In one minute we will burn your house from both ends.

972
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,270
你们一共就两个人
There's only two of you.

973
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,590
有种你就试试看
Go ahead and bet your life on it.

974
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,540
你们有几个人
How many of you is in there?

975
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:37,640
就我们俩
Just the two of us.

976
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,230
但是我的搭档中枪了
But my partner's hit.

977
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,300
他走不动了
And he can't walk.

978
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,680
你是埃米特・昆西吗
Is that Emmet Quincy?

979
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,960
你说房顶上的是个男的
You said it was a man on the roof.

980
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,410
我以为是波特呢
I thought it was Potter.

981
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,320
昆西  你还是一如既往的笨啊
You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form.

982
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,950
怎么这么多玉米糊糊啊
This here's an awful lot of sofky.

983
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,860
你们在等同伙吗
You boys looking for company?

984
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,200
没有  那是我们的晚饭和早饭
No, that was supper and breakfast both.

985
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,960
我想早上多吃点
I like a big breakfast.

986
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,180
玉米糊熟了之后会变大的
Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think.

987
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,750
还有威士忌呢
And a good store of whiskey here as well.

988
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,580
你们准备这么多吃的干什么
What are you boys up to, outside of cooking banquets?

989
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,060
我们正在吃饭
We were just having our supper.

990
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,590
这种鬼天气  我们也不知道是谁在外面
We don't know who was outside in weather like this.

991
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,690
还以为是个疯子呢
Might have been some crazy man.

992
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,760
谁都可以自称是法警
Anyone could say he is a marshal.

993
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,870
我的腿好痛
My leg hurts.

994
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,800
当然痛了
I'll bet it does.

995
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:51,010
你上次见到奈德・彼伯是什么时候
When was the last time you see your old pard, Ned Pepper?

996
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:54,250
不知道  他是谁啊
I do not know that. Who is he?

997
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,710
你居然不记得他了
I'm surprised you don't remember him.

998
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,890
他是个皮包骨  又警觉又敏捷
Skinny fellow, nervous and quick,

999
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,350
他的嘴唇都烂了
his lip's all messed up.

1000
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,170
还是想不起来是谁
That don't bring anybody to mind.

1001
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,570
现在有个新来的
There's a new boy

1002
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,800
可能在奈德手下做事
that might be running with Ned.

1003
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,450
他脸上有个又黑又亮的弹痕
He got a powder mark on his face, black polish.

1004
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,470
他称呼自己为切尼
Calls himself Chaney

1005
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,280
有时也叫切尔姆斯福特
or Chelmsford sometimes.

1006
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,730
拿一把亨利步枪
Carries a Henry rifle.

1007
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,950
还是记不起来
That don't bring anybody to mind.

1008
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,270
如果脸上有弹痕我应该能记住的
Black mark, I would remember that.

1009
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,410
你什么都不记得了是吗  昆西
You don't remember nothing I want to know, do you Quincy?

1010
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,450
你知道什么  小月
What do you know, Moon?

1011
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,550
我们不认识你要找的那帮人
We don't know those boys you're looking for.

1012
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,930
我不认识那帮人
I don't know those boys.

1013
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,260
我知道一定告诉你  我坚信法理
I always try to help out the law.

1014
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,660
等我们到史密斯堡的时候
By the time we get to Fort Smith,

1015
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,080
你这条腿就会肿得像我的帽子一样粗了
that leg will be swelled up as tight as Dick's hat band.

1016
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,940
这条腿就废了
It'll be mortified.

1017
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,760
到时候不截肢都不行了
And they'll have to cut it off.

1018
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,010
如果你活下来了
Then if you live, I'll make

1019
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,990
我会让你在底特律的联邦监狱里
it two or three years in the federal house

1020
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,160
-蹲个两三年  -你在威胁我
- up in Detroit, there. - You're trying to get at me.

1021
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,190
他们会教你读书写字的  但是
They'll teach you how to read an write up there. But...

1022
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,390
除此之外  就有你好受的了
The rest won't be so good.

1023
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,200
那帮家伙连瘸子都会不放过的
Them boys, they can be hard on a gimp.

1024
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,270
你在威胁我
You are trying to get at me.

1025
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,290
现在
Now.

1026
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,530
如果你能透露点关于奈德的消息
You give me some good information on Ned.

1027
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,800
我明天就把你送回巴格比的商店
I'll take you down to Bagby's store tomorrow,

1028
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,560
把你腿里的子弹取出来
get that ball taken out of your leg.

1029
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,210
然后我会给你们三天时间离开这里
Then I'll give you three days to clear the Territory.

1030
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,020
我们真的不认识你要找的那帮人
We don't know those boys you're looking for.

1031
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,040
反正不是他的腿
It ain't his leg.

1032
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,580
-我...  -你能闭嘴吗  小月
- I was... -Won't you flap your mouth, Moon?

1033
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,060
我来说就可以了
It's best you let me do the talking.

1034
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,650
-我要说  -我们是谨慎的捕猎者
- I would say I... - We are weary trappers.

1035
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,910
你怎么会跟这个老恶棍在一起
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?

1036
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,600
脸上有弹痕的那个切尼杀了我父亲
The man Chaney with the marked face, killed my father.

1037
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,680
他也像你一样是个醉鬼
He's a whiskey drinker like you

1038
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,900
他因为喝醉杀了我父亲
and it led to killing in the end.

1039
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,710
好好回答法警的问题  他会帮你的
If you answer the Marshal's questions, he will help you.

1040
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,970
我家有个很好的律师  他也会帮你的
I have a good lawyer at home, and I know he will help you too.

1041
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,840
我有点搞不懂
I'm puzzled by these.

1042
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,080
她为什么会在这
Why is she here?

1043
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,080
乔  别听那个小兔崽子的鬼话
Joe, these people. Don't you go jawing with that runt.

1044
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,760
我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

1045
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,870
我希望你进监狱  我的律师才不会帮你
I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not help you.

1046
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,750
我腿疼的要昏过去了
My leg is giving me fits.

1047
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,310
像你这样的年轻人不会想失去一条腿的
A young fellow like you don't want to loose his leg.

1048
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,750
冷静点
Easy now.

1049
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,090
他在引诱你
He's trying to get at you.

1050
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:57,890
我从不食言
With the truth.

1051
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,500
前天我们看到奈德和海斯了
We seen Ned and Hayes two days ago.

1052
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,060
你脑子坏了吗  你再说我就杀了你
Don't you act the fool, if you blow I will kill you.

1053
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,770
我受够了  我需要个医生
I'm played out, I need a doctor.

1054
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,660
我们前天碰到奈德和Hays了
We met Ned and Hayes two days ago.

1055
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,990
该死的
God damn it.

1056
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,530
天啊
Oh lord.

1057
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,660
我要死了
I'm dying.

1058
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,050
快想想办法
Do something.

1059
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,310
救救我
Help me.

1060
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,610
我也无计可施了  孩子
I can do nothing for you, son.

1061
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:42,650
你的伙伴要杀你  我已经替你报仇了
You pard has killed you, and I've done for him.

1062
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,550
别让我死在这里
Don't leave me lying here.

1063
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,060
别让狼把我吃掉的
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

1064
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,060
我会把你安葬的
I'll see you're buried right.

1065
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,160
跟我说说奈德  你在哪儿看到他了
You tell me about Ned, where'd you see him?

1066
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,480
前天
Two days ago.

1067
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,760
在巴格比的商店
Bagby's store.

1068
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,210
他们今晚要来这里换马并拿些玉米糊
They are coming here tonight to get remounts, and sofky.

1069
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,940
他们刚在御夫座铁路交叉处抢了飞之凯蒂
They just robbed the Katy Flyer at Wagoner's Switch.

1070
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,940
飞之凯蒂: 最早拥有名字的火车
途径密苏里州  堪萨斯州  德克萨斯州

1071
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,310
我要死了
I'm gone.

1072
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,800
给我的兄弟乔治・加勒特捎个信
Send the news to my brother, George Garrett.

1073
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,840
他在德州南部做卫理公会巡回牧师
He is a Methodist circuit rider in South Texas.

1074
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,330
我要不要告诉他你是个逃犯
Shall I tell him you was outlawed up.

1075
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:19,460
无所谓了
It don't matter.

1076
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,670
他知道的
He knows I'm on the scout.

1077
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,840
我会在荣耀之路上和他相见的
I will meet him later, walking the streets of Glory.

1078
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,720
别碰见昆西
Well don't be looking for Quincy.

1079
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,540
他们来了之后我们怎么干
What do we do when they get here?

1080
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,080
等他们自己送上门
Well, they will ride up.

1081
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,410
到时候我们来一个瓮中捉鳖
What we want is to get them all in the dugout.

1082
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,880
我会干掉最后一个进去的人
I'll kill the last one that goes in,

1083
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,410
之后他们就成瓮中之鳖了
then we will have them in a barrel.

1084
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,070
你在他们身后放冷枪吗
You will shoot them in the back?

1085
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,010
这样才能给他们个下马威
It will give them to know our intention is serious.

1086
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,990
然后我会喊话
Then I will call down

1087
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,720
看看我们能不能活捉他们
see if they'll be taken alive.

1088
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,320
如果抓不到活的
If they won't.

1089
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,010
他们一出来我就开枪
I'll shoot them as they come out.

1090
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,870
干掉他们中的三个
I'm hopeful that three of their party being dead

1091
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,870
估计他们也就没胆了
will take the starch out of them.

1092
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:15,210
你看上去很沉着
You display great poise.

1093
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,870
这跟打火鸡没什么两样
Aw,it is just a turkey shoot.

1094
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,480
有一次在新墨西哥州
There was one time, in New Mexico,

1095
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,460
我们被七个人追
we was being pursued by seven men.

1096
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,690
我把马调了个头 然后用牙咬住缰绳
I turned Bo around and taken them reins in my teeth,

1097
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,930
朝着他们直冲过去
and rode right at them boys.

1098
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,620
拿我马鞍里的两把海军六号朝他们开火
Firing them two navy sixes I carry in my saddle.

1099
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,920
希望他们真是如我所想的那样
Well.. I guess they was all married men who

1100
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,680
都有老婆了  非常顾家  不能丢失性命
loved their families as they scattered and run for home.

1101
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,700
这真的难以置信
Well that is hard to believe.

1102
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,330
-什么难以置信  -你居然一挑七啊
- What is? - One man riding at seven.

1103
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,770
这是真的
Well, it's true.

1104
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,680
当你足够快足够勇猛的时候
You go for a man hard enough and fast enough,

1105
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,260
你的对手是不会想己方有多少人的
You don't have time to think about

1106
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,670
他只会考虑他自己
how many is with him, he thinks about himself.

1107
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,160
考虑如何阻挡即将到来的狂风暴雨
How he may get clear of the wrath that's about to set down on you.

1108
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,650
他们为什么要追你呢
Why were they pursuing you?

1109
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,720
我抢劫了一个放高利贷的银行
I robbed a high-interest bank.

1110
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,490
我总不能去抢小偷吧
Can't rob a thief, can you?

1111
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,060
我从不抢平民的钱
Never robbed a citizen.

1112
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,500
连一块表都没抢过
Never took a man's watch.

1113
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,500
抢谁都不对
It is all stealing.

1114
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,700
那帮新墨西哥州的人也这么想
That's the position they took in New Mexico.

1115
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,400
就一个人
One man.

1116
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,840
没想到他们会派人过来探风
I didn't figure them to send a scout.

1117
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,660
该死的
Damn.

1118
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,920
他是勒波义夫
It is LeBoeuf.

1119
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,440
警官  我们必须得去提醒他
Oh, we have to warn him, Marshal.

1120
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,470
来不及了
Too late.

1121
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,450
我们该怎么办啊  警官
What do we do, Marshal?

1122
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,220
静观其变  他在干什么
We sit. What does he do?

1123
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,640
那个穿羊皮衣服的小子就是狗屎运奈德
Him in the woolly chaps, is Lucky Ned.

1124
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,540
就是现在
Well, that's that.

1125
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,050
计划失败
Well that didn't pan out.

1126
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,810
你把我的计划全毁了  伙计
You managed to put a kink in my rope, partner.

1127
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,160
我伤的很严重
Ah, I'm severely injured.

1128
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,130
伤的不轻呢
Yes, you got rocks on.

1129
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,790
我中枪了
I was also shot.

1130
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,420
而且是被来复枪打中
By a rifle.

1131
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,480
很有可能
Well that's quite possible.

1132
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,810
我没能够按照原计划行动
The scheme did not developed as I had planned.

1133
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,500
你肩膀中枪了  好在子弹穿过去了
You've been shot in the shoulder, but the bullet passed through.

1134
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,230
你嘴怎么了
What happened to your mouth?

1135
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:52,040
我可能咬着自己了
I believe I bit myself.

1136
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,340
掉了几颗牙  果真啊
Couple of teeth loose, and ah yeah.

1137
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,980
舌头都快被咬断了
Tongue bit almost through.

1138
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,720
你想我把它留在里面还是猛的拔出来
You want to see if it'll knit or should I just yank it free.

1139
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,620
我认识一个赶马的人
I know a teamster.

1140
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,610
他从马背上摔下来的时候把舌头咬断了
Bit his tongue off as he was thrown from a horse.

1141
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,700
过了很长时间才能说话
After a time he learned to make himself more or less understood.

1142
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,790
我还是把它弄出来吧
I'll just yank it free.

1143
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,970
现在怎么样了
What's that now.

1144
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,860
现在怎么样了
What's that now?

1145
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,750
会自己愈合的
Knit. It will knit.

1146
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,860
好极了
Ah, very well.

1147
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,150
舌头上的伤口可包扎不了
It's impossible to bind a tongue wound.

1148
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,860
真不巧  我们刚才还碰到个医生呢
Too bad, we just ran across a doctor.

1149
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,660
-警官  -但是我们不知道他往哪走了
- Marshal? - Of sorts, but we did not know where he was headed.

1150
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,920
我也看到他了  所以我才过来的
I saw him too, that's how I came to be here.

1151
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,570
这些人里没有切尼
Neither of these men are Chaney.

1152
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,750
我知道  这几个人我都认识
I know it, I know them both.

1153
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,380
那个长的很丑的是憧伞ずＫ
That ugly one is Coke Hayes.

1154
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,450
这个更丑的是克莱门特・帕马利
Him uglier stiff is Clement Parmalee.

1155
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:39,990
帕马利和他的兄弟们
Parmalee and his brothers

1156
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:42,890
在旋梯山有一个老窝
have a silver claim in the Winding Stair Mountains.

1157
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:45,420
狗屎运奈德的同伙肯定在那等他们
And I'll bet that's where Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

1158
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,210
我们今晚在这过夜  明早再去找他们
Well, we'll sleep here, follow in the morning.

1159
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,640
但我们答应过他要把他安葬好的
But we promised to bury the poor soul inside.

1160
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,250
地太硬了
Ground is too hard.

1161
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,320
他要是想安葬的比较风光的话
That man wanted a decent burial,

1162
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,630
他应该等到夏天再死
he should have gotten himself killed in summer.

1163
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,890
晚安  小黑
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

1164
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,950
我的直觉告诉我  明天就能找到他了
I have a notion that tomorrow we will reach our object.

1165
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,110
我们紧随其后
We're hot on the trail.

1166
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,200
我们会在旋梯山追上汤姆・切尼的
Seems that we'll overtake Tom Chaney in the Winding Stairs Mountains.

1167
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,740
他到时候肯定不会好受
I would not want to be in his shoes.

1168
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,900
据我了解  切尼和
As I understand it, Chaney or

1169
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,960
切尔姆斯福特的名字是他在德州常用的
Chelmsford, as he called himself in Texas.

1170
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,900
杀了州议员的狗
Shot the senator's dog.

1171
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,300
当州议员要告他的时候
When the Senator remonstrated

1172
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,790
切尔姆斯福特把他也给杀了
Chelmsford shot him as well.

1173
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,190
你现在也许会说
Now you could argue that the shooting

1174
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,160
枪杀那条狗是禁止的
of the dog was clearly an instance of malum prohibitum.

1175
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,400
但枪杀议员
But the shooting of the senator

1176
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,940
无疑是个违法的案例
is indubitably a instance of malum in se.

1177
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,010
违什么
Malum in what?

1178
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,330
违法的
Malum in se.

1179
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:51,620
两者的区别一个是事情本身的错误
The distinction is between an act that is wrong within itself.

1180
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:54,900
另外一个是违反法律规定和道德约束的
And an act that is wrong according to our laws and mores.

1181
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,070
是拉丁语
It is Latin.

1182
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,130
我实在吃惊
I'm struck,

1183
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,000
你不但挨了枪子  还被人蹂躏成这个样
that LeBoeuf had been shot, trampled

1184
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:04,800
舌头差点都断了
and nearly severed his tongue.

1185
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,080
这都堵不住你的嘴
Not only does he not cease to talk,

1186
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,310
你说话说的还挺溜
but he spills the banks of English.

1187
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:18,200
有一次我离切尔姆斯福特只有两百多米
I was within three hundred yards of Chelmsford once.

1188
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,100
可能是最近的一次了
The closest I have been.

1189
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,600
并且在我的夏普斯卡宾枪的射程内
With a Sharps carbine that is within range.

1190
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,310
我在马上  可以立马开枪
But I was mounted, and had the choice of firing off-hand.

1191
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,290
也可以下马站立开枪
or dismounting and shoot from the rest.

1192
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,240
不过这样他就和我拉开距离了
which would allow Chelmsford to augment the distance.

1193
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,410
我还是在马上开枪了
I fired mounted.

1194
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,980
但是打偏了
And fired wide.

1195
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,620
如果你让枪每天都睡大觉
You could not hit a man at three hundred yards

1196
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,430
怎么可能射中一个两百多米远的人
if your gun was resting on your Gibraltar.

1197
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:54,720
夏普斯卡宾枪拥有强大的威力和精准度
A Sharps carbine is an instrument of uncanny power and precision.

1198
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,510
我可没说枪不行
I've no doubt that the gun is sound.

1199
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,040
我衣衫褴褛  口无遮拦
My clothes are all ragged and my language is rough.

1200
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,710
就连我的面包也从来不服软
My bread is corn dodgers, both solid and tough

1201
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:12,530
我的生活快乐又美好
And yet I'm happy, and live at my ease

1202
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:16,850
就像高粱糖浆  培根和奶酪
On sorghum molasses, and bacon, and cheese

1203
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,110
《格里尔县》  班特勒作曲
Greer county, Bantler.

1204
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,070
我不相信他昨晚睡觉了
I do not believe he slept.

1205
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,980
史密斯堡不远了  勒波义夫
Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf.

1206
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,160
但是我想让你的马往切斯特城的方向走
But I would encourage the creature you ride to head Chester.

1207
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,640
一只手的家伙只会拖我们后腿
Out here a one-armed man look like an easy prey.

1208
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,180
一只眼睛枪法不准的家伙
And a one-eyed man who can't shoot.

1209
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,130
你怎么不回去呢  考伯恩
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?

1210
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,410
我可得去
I'll do fine.

1211
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,990
我知道帕马利的老窝在哪  我又没受伤
I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I'm uninjured,

1212
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:55,330
我粮食充足  再说我们分道扬镳了的
well provisioned and we agree to separate.

1213
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:58,030
你取消合约良心会不安的
In conscience you cannot shite our agreement.

1214
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,670
而且是你开枪打伤了我
You're the one that shot me.

1215
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,720
勒波义夫先生说得有道理  警官
Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal.

1216
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,060
在竞赛中
It is unfair leg-up in any

1217
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,220
朝对手开枪可有失公平
competition to shoot your opposite number.

1218
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,760
他妈的  我不能接受
God damn it. I do not

1219
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:08,950
你说是我开枪打了勒波义夫
accept it as a given that I did shoot LeBoeuf.

1220
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:10,970
当时那么多枪都响了
There were plenty of guns going off.

1221
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,360
我听到来福枪响了  而且感觉到了子弹
I heard the rifle, and I felt the ball.

1222
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,220
你打偏了  考伯恩
You missed your shot, Cogburn.

1223
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,620
我会打偏吗
Missed my shot!

1224
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:20,390
你缺只眼睛可比我缺之手差多了
You are more handicapped without the eye, then I without the arm.

1225
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:23,210
我能射中六十米外的蚊子眼睛
I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards.

1226
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,670
那个中国佬又卖了我一堆水货子弹
That chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again.

1227
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,010
我以为你要说  太阳刺进了你的双眼呢
I thought you were going to say, the sun was in your eyes.

1228
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,310
对了  你只有一只眼睛
That is to say, "Your eye".

1229
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,620
一次中两个
Two at one time.

1230
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,470
我扔高一点
I will chuck one high.

1231
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,650
你别开枪
Hold fire.

1232
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,420
-中了  -中了
- There. - There?

1233
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,590
-是我打中的  -是你吗
- My bullet. - Your bullet?

1234
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,560
你要是能打中还会误伤我的肩膀吗
If you hit what you aim at, explain my shoulder.

1235
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,180
先生们  在大草原上比赛射面包
Gentlemen, shooting corn bread out here on

1236
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,600
不能帮我们找到彼伯那帮人
the prairie is getting us no closer to the Pepper gang.

1237
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,040
再来一次  等着瞧
One more. This will prove it.

1238
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,720
请你别开枪
Please hold fire.

1239
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,540
这样就能找到回去的路
Find our way back.

1240
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,880
狗屎运奈德
Lucky Ned?

1241
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,750
狗屎运奈德
Lucky Ned!

1242
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,960
真不赖啊  考伯恩
Very good, Cogburn.

1243
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,260
现在怎么办
Now what?

1244
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:21,210
该死的
Oh, god damn it.

1245
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,750
考伯恩才不想我吃他的粮食
Cogburn does not want me to eat out of his store.

1246
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,450
别犯傻了
That is silly.

1247
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,660
你一整天都没吃了  而且这些是我的
You have not eaten the whole day,and it is my store not his.

1248
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,280
饿死他好了
Let him starve.

1249
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,960
他既没追踪
He did not track.

1250
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,140
也没开过枪
He did not shoot.

1251
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,100
还好意思吃东西
Accepting food stuffs.

1252
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,990
这都是你自找的
That was your initiative.

1253
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:38,750
他一点力都没出
He did not contribute.

1254
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,070
他是个只会挨枪子的人
He's a man, who walks in front of bullets.

1255
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,820
我们躲在掩护后面安全地开枪的时候
Mr. LeBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

1256
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,310
勒波义夫在和狗屎运奈德他们单打独斗
while we fired safely from cover.

1257
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,290
-我们  -你不应该这么说他
- We? - It is unfair to indict a man,

1258
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,000
尤其当他的下巴都肿了
when his jaw is swollen, and tongue

1259
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,690
舌头都快断了  他根本没法辩护
mangled and is therefore unable to rise to his defense.

1260
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,010
我可以为我自己辩护的
I can speak for myself.

1261
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
只不过对于像你这种低级醉鬼
I'm hardly obliged to answer

1262
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,360
我才懒得和你吵架呢
the ravings of a drunkard who is beneath me.

1263
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,440
我会到其他的地方另起炉灶的
I shall make my own camp elsewhere.

1264
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,330
你才什么都没干呢  考伯恩
It is you who have nothing to offer, Cogburn.

1265
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,570
你好意思吗
A sad picture indeed.

1266
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,900
这不再是追踪犯人了
This is no longer a man hunt.

1267
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,280
是自我堕落
It is a debauch.

1268
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,410
德州骑警队员
The Texas Ranger

1269
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,640
将独自去完成任务
presses on, alone.

1270
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,410
把这个小姑娘带走
Take the girl.

1271
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,650
我不干了
I bow out.

1272
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,690
早知现在  何必当初
A fine thing to decide once you

1273
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,870
在这荒芜之地撒下她不管吗
brought her in the middle of the Choctaw Nation.

1274
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,760
我不干了  我金盆洗手了
I bow out, I wash my hands.

1275
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,780
先生们  我们不能在这个时候闹翻啊
Gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion.

1276
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,700
我们马上就要抓到汤姆・切尼了
Not so close to our goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1277
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,810
抓到个屁
In hand?

1278
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,610
如果他现在没被埋在
If he is not in a shallow grave

1279
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:45,250
从这去史密斯堡路上的坟堆里
somewhere between here and Fort Smith.

1280
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,620
那就是他逃跑了
He is gone.

1281
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:48,230
跑到天涯海角去了
Long gone.

1282
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,020
这还要归功于勒波义夫先生 我们打偏了
Thanks to Mr. LeBoeuf, we missed our shot.

1283
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,650
我们已经打草惊蛇了
We have barked and the birds have flown.

1284
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,690
跑了  跑了  跑了
Gone, gone, gone.

1285
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,290
狗屎运奈德的大军逃跑了
Lucky Ned's cohort gone.

1286
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,080
你的五十美金也泡汤了
Your fifty dollars, gone.

1287
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,560
跟我的威士忌一起泡汤了
Gone with whiskey.

1288
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,320
这多显而易见啊
Seized in evidence.

1289
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,580
就算他们留下踪迹也追不上了
The trail is cold if ever there was one.

1290
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,850
我  我真是个糊涂的老头
I'm....I'm a foolish old man

1291
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:16,920
被人拉进这么个徒劳无功的追捕
who'd been drawn into a wild goose chase.

1292
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,350
居然还是被个悍妇和一个傻子拉进来的
by a harpy in trousers, and a nincompoop.

1293
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,730
勒波义夫先生
Ah, Mr. LeBoeuf.

1294
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,930
他爱在这儿待多久就待多久吧
He can wander the Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes.

1295
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,420
当地的土著印第安人或许还把他当兄弟呢
Perhaps the local Indians will take him in.

1296
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,500
他能说会道  没准能当上酋长呢
Honor his gibbering by making him Chief.

1297
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,230
小妹妹  你爱去哪儿就去哪儿吧
You sister, may go where you like.

1298
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,510
我们的合同终止了
Our engagement is terminated.

1299
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,940
我不干了
I bow out.

1300
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:52,970
我和你去
I'm going with you.

1301
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,410
不行  这不可能
No, that is not possible.

1302
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,120
我拖了你的后腿吗
Have I held you back?

1303
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,960
我有把我会用的柯尔特龙骑兵左轮手枪
I have a Colt's Dragoon revolver, which I know how to use.

1304
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,900
我不会给你带来负担
And I will be no more of a burden to you, as I was to the Marshal.

1305
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,170
我担心的不是这个
That's not my worry.

1306
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,470
你很勇敢
You've earned your spurs.

1307
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,590
你已经证明了
That is clear now.

1308
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,370
你已经成为一名追踪高手了
You've been an regular old hand on the trail.

1309
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,290
但是考伯恩说的对
But Cogburn's right.

1310
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:18,150
虽然我刚才没当着他的面承认
Even if I will not give him the satisfaction of consenting it.

1311
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:21,330
确实追不上了
The trail is cold.

1312
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:27,380
而且我也伤得不轻
And I am, considerably diminished.

1313
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,050
你追踪切尼那么久了
How can you give up now,

1314
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,240
怎么能说放弃就放弃呢
after the many months you've dedicated to finding Chaney?

1315
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,070
你展示出了极大的决心
You have shown great determination.

1316
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,100
我之前小看你了
I misjudged you.

1317
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,540
我挑错人了
I picked the wrong man.

1318
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,820
如果我们还有办法的话  我愿意帮你
I would go on with your company, if there were a clear way to go.

1319
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,830
但我们只能在黑暗中摸索
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1320
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,910
切尔姆斯福特已经逃跑了
Chelmsford's gone.

1321
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,390
我们都追到这天荒地末了
We chased him right off the map.

1322
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,000
这事就这样
There is nothing for it.

1323
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,950
我回德州了
I'm bound for Texas.

1324
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,180
你也该回家了
It's time for you to go home, too.

1325
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,430
等警官清醒之后
The Marshal, when he sobers,

1326
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,500
你就该回去了
is your way back.

1327
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,410
我不回去  没找到切尼就不回去  
I will not go back. Not without Chaney,

1328
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,310
生要见人  死要见尸
dead or alive.

1329
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,790
我也看错你了
I misjudged you as well.

1330
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,520
来握个手吧
I extend my hand.

1331
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,770
勒波义夫先生  求你了
Mr. LeBoeuf! Please!

1332
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,050
再会
Adios.

1333
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,860
我认识你
I know you.

1334
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,580
你叫麦蒂
Your name is Mattie.

1335
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,010
你是小麦蒂  那个记账员
You're little Mattie, the bookkeeper.

1336
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:48,230
真巧啊
Isn't that something.

1337
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,850
是的  而且我认识你  汤姆・切尼
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

1338
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,200
你在这干什么
What are you doing out here?

1339
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,860
来打点水
Come to fetch some water.

1340
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,050
那你在这山里干什么
Oh, then what are you doing in these mountains, here?

1341
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,930
虽然还没被正式任命
Well I have not been formally deputized,

1342
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,110
但我是受命于鲁本・考伯恩警官
but I am acting as an agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn

1343
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:03,360
和帕克法官
and Judge Parker's court.

1344
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,680
我要把你带回史密斯堡
I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.

1345
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,110
我不去
Well I will not go.

1346
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,110
你觉得怎么样
How do you like that?

1347
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:23,300
那边有一治安团的警官会抓你去的
There is a posse of officers up there who will force you to go.

1348
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,590
有意思
That is interesting news.

1349
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,760
那边有多少人
And how many is up there?

1350
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,530
五十个左右
Right around fifty.

1351
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,780
他们都武器精良  志在必得
They're all well armed and they mean business.

1352
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:32,820
现在我要你渡过小溪
What I want you to do now is come on across the creek

1353
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,790
从我面前走到那座山上去
and walk in front of me up that hill.

1354
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,880
我还是让那些警官来抓我吧
I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.

1355
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:41,790
如果你不照着做  我就得开枪了
Well if you refuse to go, then I'll have to shoot you.

1356
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,460
噢
Oh.

1357
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,730
那你最好给枪上膛
Well you had better cock your piece.

1358
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,090
一直向后扳
All the way back.

1359
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,670
-直到锁住  -我知道怎么做
- Til it locks. - I know how to do it.

1360
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,610
你不打算跟我走?
You will not go with me?

1361
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:56,100
不  恰恰相反
Naw, it's just the other way around.

1362
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,350
你得跟我走
You're going with me.

1363
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,920
我要...
I will...AAAH!

1364
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,240
我没想到你会开枪
I did not think you would do it.

1365
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,580
-现在呢  -我有根肋骨断了
- What do you think now? - One of my short ribs is broken.

1366
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,990
我爸爸想帮助你  你却杀了他
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.

1367
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,190
我有一个你从他那偷的金币
I have one of the gold pieces you stole from him.

1368
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,310
现在把另一个也给我
Now give me the other.

1369
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,610
-我干什么都不顺  -麦蒂
- Nothing has gone right for me. - MATTIE!

1370
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,080
我在这下面
I'm down here.

1371
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,700
现在居然被个孩子打中了
Now I'm shot by a child.

1372
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,300
我抓住切尼了
Chaney is taken into custody!

1373
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,840
快救我
Help me.

1374
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,870
麦蒂
Mattie!

1375
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,810
警官
Marshal.

1376
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,990
把马牵上  快走
Take them horses you got and move!

1377
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,610
汤姆  到那山上去  别停下
Tom, get on up that hill! Don't you stop..

1378
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,410
下面都是些什么人
Who all is down there?

1379
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,380
考伯恩和其他五十个警官
Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers.

1380
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,220
再敢撒谎  我打穿你的头
Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in!

1381
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,250
只有一个法警
Just the Marshal.

1382
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,410
大公鸡
Rooster.

1383
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,550
考伯恩
Cogburn!

1384
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:20,390
听得见吗
You hear me?

1385
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:25,270
回答我  大公鸡
You answer me, Rooster!

1386
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,010
我要杀了这姑娘
I will kill this girl!

1387
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,720
你知道我干得出来
You know I will do it!

1388
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,890
她对我来说什么也不是  
The girl is nothing to me!

1389
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,790
只是个阿肯色州来的亡命者
She is a runaway from Arkansas!

1390
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,540
非常好
That is all very well.

1391
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,940
你建议我把她杀了吗
Do you advise that I kill her?

1392
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,550
随你的便  奈德
Do what you think is best, Ned.

1393
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:46,270
她只不过是个迷路的小孩
She's nothing to me but a lost child.

1394
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,680
先好好想想
Think it over first.

1395
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,620
我已经好好想过了
I have already thought it over!

1396
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,060
这样你会过来得更快
You get mounted double fast!

1397
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:58,480
如果看到你越过那座秃山  向西北去
If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest,

1398
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,910
我就放了这姑娘
I will spare the girl.

1399
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,150
给你五分钟
You have five minutes!

1400
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,930
马上就会有一队法警过来  奈德
There will be a party of marshals here soon, Ned!

1401
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,520
把这姑娘和切尼交给我
Let me have the girl and Chaney

1402
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,500
我就把他们引开六个小时
and I will mislead them for six hours!

1403
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,240
太不够意思了  大公鸡
Too thin, Rooster!

1404
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,290
太不够意思
Too thin!

1405
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,720
五分钟已经快到了
Your five minutes is running!

1406
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,310
别再说了
No more talk!

1407
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,230
到那山上去
Get on up that hill.

1408
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,230
安静
Quiet there!

1409
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,950
法雷尔  看看汤姆的伤口
Farrel, see to Tom's wound.

1410
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,950
我能来点培根吗
Can I have some of that bacon?

1411
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,040
随便你
You help yourself.

1412
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,910
再来点咖啡
Have some of the coffee.

1413
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:42,130
我不喝咖啡  我才十四岁
I do not drink coffee, I am fourteen.

1414
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:46,010
我们可没有酸奶  也没有面包
Well we do not have buttermilk, and we do not have bread.

1415
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,880
我们补给不足
We are poorly supplied.

1416
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,710
-她在哪儿  -你在这里干嘛
- Where she is. - What are you doing here?

1417
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,460
我要拧断你的小细脖子
I will ring your scrawny neck.

1418
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,540
别提这茬了
You let that go.

1419
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:56,130
怎么回事
What happened, huh?

1420
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,500
我告诉你  你就会明白我占理了
I will tell you and you will see that I'm in the right.

1421
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,660
汤姆・切尼在史密斯堡枪杀了我爸爸
Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort Smith

1422
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,740
还抢了他两个金币
and robbed him of two gold pieces

1423
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,570
偷了他的牝马
and stole his mare.

1424
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:04,890
我听说考伯恩先生很有种
I was informed Rooster Cogburn had grit

1425
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:06,880
就雇他来抓捕凶手
and I hired him out to find the murderer.

1426
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,930
刚才我正好看到切尼在饮马
A few minutes ago I came upon Chaney watering the horses.

1427
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,890
他不服法  我便朝他开枪了
He would not be taken in charge and I shot him.

1428
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,400
如果我把他打死
If I had killed him

1429
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,200
现在就不会被抓住  可我的枪哑火了
I would not be now in this fix. My revolver misfired.

1430
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,320
是这样
They will do it.

1431
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,640
哑火总是会让你陷入窘境
It will embarrass you every time.

1432
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,570
姑娘们都玩娃娃  可你喜欢枪  是吗
Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns, do ya?

1433
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:26,400
我对枪一点兴趣都没有
I do not care a thing in the world about guns.

1434
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,910
如果有的话  我就会有支好使的枪了
If I did I would have one that worked.

1435
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,840
我中了埋伏  奈德
I was shot from ambush, Ned.

1436
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,490
马在打响鼻  不断发出噪音
The horses was blowing and making noise.

1437
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:32,800
是警官打中我的
It was that officer that got me.

1438
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,940
你怎么还能在那大言不惭
How can you sit there and tell such a big story?

1439
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,690
那个坑有一百英尺深  我要把你扔进去
That pit is a hundred feet deep, and I will throw you in it.

1440
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,940
让你尖叫着腐烂
I'll leave you screaming in rot.

1441
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,810
-现在你觉得怎么样  -你不会的
- Now how do you like that? - No you won't.

1442
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,110
这个人不会让你为所欲为的
This man will not let you have your way.

1443
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:44,730
他是你老板  你得照他说的做
He's your boss and you have to do as he tells you.

1444
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,610
我从来都没法为所欲为
Ain't nothing going my way.

1445
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,740
前天晚上埋伏我们的人是大公鸡吗
Was that Rooster waylaid us night before last?

1446
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,440
是考伯恩警官和我
It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.

1447
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,100
你和考伯恩
You and Cogburn.

1448
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,320
真厉害
Quite the posse.

1449
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,070
咱们走吧  奈德
Let us move, Ned.

1450
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,400
时机到了再走  医生
In good time, Doctor.

1451
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,440
昆西和那孩子怎么样了
What happened to Quincy and the kid?

1452
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,990
他们都死了
They are both dead.

1453
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,050
我当时身历其境  太可怕了
I was in the very middle of it. It was a terrible thing to see.

1454
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,980
拜托  我们走吧  奈德
Please, let us move, Ned.

1455
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,520
法警已经走了
The Marshal's gone.

1456
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,820
你需要好的律师吗
Do you need a good lawyer?

1457
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:33,900
我需要好的法官
I need a good judge.

1458
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,470
憧伞ずＫ乖趺囱了
What happened to Coke Hayes,

1459
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,080
这老家伙被从马上射下来了
the old fellow shot off his horse.

1460
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,820
也死了
Dead as well.

1461
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:42,470
这些暴行已经结束了
These depredations have come to an end.

1462
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,980
你朋友大公鸡活捉不了几个人
Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners.

1463
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,210
他不是我的朋友
He is not my friend.

1464
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,760
他把我扔给了一群野蛮人
He has abandoned me to a congress of louts.

1465
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,990
你从不掩饰你的想法吗
You do not varnish your opinions.

1466
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,040
我们出发吗
Are we off?

1467
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,580
咱们把飞之凯蒂那票赚的分了吧
Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer.

1468
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,410
到老地方再分也来得及
They'll be time for that at the old place.

1469
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:01,960
我骑那匹灰的
I will mount the grey.

1470
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,210
你有别的任务
I have other plans for you.

1471
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:05,330
我得和医生骑一匹马吗
Must I double-mount with the Doctor?

1472
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,650
-不  -不
- No! - Nope.

1473
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,970
逃跑的话  两人骑一匹马太冒险了
Too chancy with two men up if it comes to a race.

1474
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,920
汤姆  你和这姑娘待在这儿
Tom, you wait here with the girl.

1475
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,890
到老马家后我会派卡罗尔
When we reach Ma's house I will send Carroll back

1476
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,250
带新马回来
with a fresh mount.

1477
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,620
你天黑出发
You will be out by dark

1478
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,490
我们在老地方见
and we'll meet you at The Old Place.

1479
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,100
我不想这样
I do not like that.

1480
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,440
让我和你一起走  奈德  离开这再说
Let me ride with you, Ned. Just out here anyway.

1481
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,640
缺一匹马
I was short a horse.

1482
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,310
这里会来大批法警的
Marshals will come swarming.

1483
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,900
得有段时间呢  如果他们真来的话
Hours, if they come here at all.

1484
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,530
他们会以为我们都走了
They'll think that we've all gone.

1485
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:31,040
我不要一个人和汤姆・切尼在一起
I am not staying here by myself with Tom Chaney.

1486
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,510
就这么定了
That's the way I will have it.

1487
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:33,630
他会杀了我的
He will kill me.

1488
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,600
你听见他说了  他已经杀了我爸爸
You heard him say it. He's killed my father,

1489
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,080
现在你还要让他杀了我
and now you will let him kill me.

1490
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,790
他不会这么干的
He will do no such thing.

1491
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,830
汤姆  你知道柏林路口吧
Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress Forks,

1492
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,540
圆木礼拜堂附近那个
near the log meetinghouse?

1493
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,280
到那儿的时候  你把这姑娘留下
When you mount it, you take the girl and leave her there.

1494
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,850
明白了吗  汤姆
You understand, Tom?

1495
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,470
你敢动这小妹妹一根皮毛
Any harm comes to that child,

1496
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,100
你就拿不到钱
you do not get paid.

1497
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,400
哈罗德  让我和你骑一匹吧
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1498
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,670
哈罗德  我从我那份里付五十块钱给你
Harold, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my winnings!

1499
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,150
我不重的
I am not heavy.

1500
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,270
再学个牛叫  哈罗德
Do the calf again, Harold.

1501
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,820
事事都跟我作对
Everything is against me.

1502
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,160
你没理由抱怨
You have no reason to whine.

1503
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,800
你按强盗头子的话做
If you act as the bandit chief instructed,

1504
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,460
不伤害我  就能在老地方拿到报酬
and no harm comes to me, you will get your winnings at The Old Place.

1505
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:43,880
狗屎运奈德扔下我一个人
Lucky Ned has left me,

1506
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,550
他知道我只能步行的话肯定会被抓的
knowing I am sure to be caught when I leave on foot.

1507
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:50,250
得考虑怎么逃出生天了
Must think over my position and how I may improve it.

1508
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,040
另一个加州金币在哪儿
Where's the second California gold piece?

1509
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,120
你把爸爸的马怎么样了
What have you done with Papa's mare?

1510
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,410
安静
Keep still.

1511
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,910
你是在猜测老地方在哪儿吗
Are you thinking about the old place?

1512
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,370
听着  如果你放了我
Look here, if you let me go

1513
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,790
我就写书面证词
I will swear to an affidavit

1514
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:08,730
你上法庭的时候会有利于你
and once you are brought to justice, it may go easier on you.

1515
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,200
告诉你  我能做得更好
I tell you I can do better than that.

1516
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,690
我不需要书面证词
I need no affidavit.

1517
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,260
我只需要你闭嘴
All I need is your silence.

1518
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:35,550
你爸和你一样爱管闲事
Your father was a busybody like you.

1519
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:38,060
说实话  我不后悔杀了他
In honesty, I do not regret shooting him.

1520
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,330
他看不起汤姆・切尼
He thought Tom Chaney was small.

1521
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:42,090
嘲笑我
Humor me.

1522
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,040
你还要给我提供书面证词
And you would give me an affidavit.

1523
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,990
你们都和我对着干  所有人
You're all against me! Everybody....

1524
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,690
这就是切尔姆斯福特
So that is Chelmsford.

1525
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,630
终于离他这么近了  有点奇怪
Strange to be so close to him at last.

1526
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,800
勒波义夫先生  你怎么会在这
Mr. LeBoeuf, how is it that you are here?

1527
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,610
我听到枪声
I heard the shot,

1528
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,350
到了河边
and went down to the river.

1529
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,860
考伯恩订了个计划
Cogburn outlined a plan.

1530
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,300
注意脚下  那有个坑
Mind your footing, there's a pit there.

1531
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,250
计划里面他的那部分
His part,

1532
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,360
我觉得有点鲁莽
I fear is rash.

1533
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,850
他回来抓捕狗屎运奈德
He returns for Lucky Ned.

1534
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,270
大公鸡
Yo, Rooster!

1535
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,690
你会让我们过去吗
Will you give us the road?

1536
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,440
一对四  太莽撞了
One against four. It is ill advised.

1537
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,670
他不听劝的
He would not be dissuaded.

1538
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:46,540
奈德  有几个人和那姑娘在一起
Hello, Ned. How many men are with the girl?

1539
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,450
只有切尼
Just Chaney.

1540
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,200
我们的协议已经执行了
Our agreement is in force.

1541
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,560
上次我看见她时  她还好得很呢
She was in excellent health, when last I saw her.

1542
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:58,410
法雷尔  我希望你和你兄弟都置身事外
Farrel, I want you and your brother to stand clear.

1543
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,780
你也一样  医生
You as well, Doctor.

1544
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,270
今天对你们没兴趣
I have no interest in you today.

1545
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,300
你想干什么  大公鸡
What is your intention, Rooster?

1546
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,920
你以为一对四能算旗鼓相当吗
Do you think one on four is a dogfall?

1547
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:12,170
我要在一分钟之内要你命  奈德
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1548
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,810
或者在帕克法官有空的时候
Or see you hanged at Fort Smith

1549
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,720
把你吊死在史密斯堡
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1550
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,980
你选哪种
Which will you have?

1551
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,990
你这是独眼肥猪的
I call that, bold talk

1552
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,860
痴心妄想
for a one-eyed fat man!

1553
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:31,170
把枪拿好  你个狗娘养的
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1554
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,640
开枪啊  勒波义夫先生
Shoot them, Mr. LeBoeuf!

1555
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,920
他们太远了  移动太快
To far, moving to fast.

1556
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,000
大公鸡
Well, Rooster?

1557
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:36,400
我被打散架了
I'm shot to pieces.

1558
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,750
看来我们没人
Seems neither of us,

1559
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:42,080
能见到帕克法官了
get's to see Judge Parker.

1560
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
主啊
Oh Lord.

1561
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,190
这一枪真绝了
Some bully shot.

1562
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,250
至少有四百码
That was four hundred yards at least.

1563
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,360
夏普斯卡宾枪  是...
the Sharps carbine, is a...

1564
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,480
站起来  汤姆・切尼
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1565
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,720
勒波义夫先生
M...Mr. LeBoeuf!

1566
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,340
你还活着吗
Are you alive?

1567
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,950
勒波义夫先生
Mr. LeBoeuf!

1568
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,420
勒波义夫先生
Mr. LeBoeuf!

1569
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,640
勒波义夫先生
Mr. LeBoeuf!

1570
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,390
你在那儿吗
Are you there?

1571
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,430
我在这
I'm here.

1572
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,850
你能爬出来吗
Can you clamber out?

1573
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,080
不能
I cannot.

1574
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,570
这有蛇
There are snakes!

1575
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:51,840
醒着的吗
They awake?

1576
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,080
醒着
Yes!

1577
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:07,340
我被咬了
I am bit!

1578
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,340
勒波义夫先生还活着吗
Does Mr. LeBoeuf survive?

1579
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,230
活着呢  就算撞了下头
He does. Even a blow to the head

1580
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:23,710
他也只会晕一小会
could silence him for only a few short minutes.

1581
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:25,070
你哪儿被咬了
Where are you bit?

1582
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,240
往边上看  就现在
Look away, now.

1583
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,210
找到她了
I have her!

1584
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,690
把我们拉上去
Up with us!

1585
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,750
好了  勒波义夫  扶她上马
Worked it, LeBoeuf! Take her.

1586
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:13,640
她被蛇咬了
Snakebit.

1587
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:17,470
我们马上出发
We are off.

1588
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,980
我会尽快找人救你
I'll send help for you as soon as I can.

1589
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:21,420
别乱走
Don't wander off.

1590
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:24,010
我们不能扔下他
We are not leaving him!

1591
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,490
要是我们不找医生  你肯定活不了
I must get you to a doctor, sis, or you are not going to make it.

1592
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,000
那枪我欠你的  伙计
I'm in your debt for that shot, pard.

1593
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:31,690
永远别怀疑德州骑警
Never doubt the Texas Ranger.

1594
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,220
走吧
Come on.

1595
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:36,230
保持健康
Ever stalwart.

1596
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:40,110
我们得停下
We must stop.

1597
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,280
小黑精疲力竭了
Little Blackie is played out.

1598
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:44,520
还有好几英里呢
We've miles yet.

1599
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:47,390
快跑
Come on you.

1600
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,240
不
No!

1601
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,160
不
No.

1602
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,480
这就对了  快跑
That's it, come on now.

1603
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:55,550
不  停下
No, stop.

1604
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:18,360
他逃跑了
He's getting away.

1605
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,110
谁逃跑了  小妹妹
Who's getting away, sis?

1606
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,330
切尼
Chaney.

1607
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,470
不  不
No.. NO!

1608
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:01,540
不  不  不
NO, no, no.

1609
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,520
不
Oh, no.

1610
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,400
不  住手
No, stop.

1611
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:40,450
我真是老了
I've grown old.

1612
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,810
四分之一世纪是一段漫长的时间
A quarter century is a long time.

1613
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,980
到巴格比的店时
By the time we reached Bagby's store,

1614
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:23,610
我的手已经黑了
my hand had turned black.

1615
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:26,660
截肢的时候我还处于昏迷中
I was not awake when I lost the arm.

1616
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,490
他们说考伯恩警官一直陪着我
The Marshal had stayed with me, I was told.

1617
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:33,850
直到我脱离险境
'til I was out of danger.

1618
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,280
但他在我醒来之前就离开了
But he departed before I came around.

1619
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,860
一到家  我就给他发了邀请
Once home. I wrote him with an invitation,

1620
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:42,840
请他下次经过耶尔县的时候过来坐坐
to come by, the next time he found himself near Yell County.

1621
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,930
并收下我欠他的五十块钱
And collect the fifty dollars I still owed him.

1622
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:48,780
我没有收到考伯恩警官的回音
I did not hear back from Marshal Cogburn.

1623
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,490
他也没再出现
And he did not appear.

1624
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,270
有一天我收到了警官的字条
Then one day I received a note from the Marshal,

1625
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:56,890
还附了张传单
with a flyer enclosed.

1626
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:59,200
科尔・扬戈与弗兰克・詹姆斯
狂野西部特别献映  每天两场

1627
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,700
大公鸡考伯恩  他的技巧和精力将震撼你

1628
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,440
他说他跟着狂野西部演出团巡演
He said he was traveling with the Wild West show.

1629
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:03,070
老了  也胖了
Getting older and fatter.

1630
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:06,980
他们到孟菲斯时  我还是想去看看他
But I like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis,

1631
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:08,960
和老朋友叙叙旧
and swap stories with an old trail mate.

1632
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,220
狂野西部演出

1633
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,870
就算路上拖久了  他也会理解的
He would understand if the journey were too long.

1634
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,760
他的字条虽然简短
Brief tho his note was.

1635
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,320
却错漏百出
It was rife with misspellings.

1636
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,780
女士您好
Yesum?

1637
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,670
我是科尔・扬戈
I am, Cole Younger.

1638
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,940
这是詹姆斯先生
This is Mr. James.

1639
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:32,790
很遗憾告诉您  您错过了大公鸡
It grieves me to tell you that you have missed, Rooster.

1640
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:35,770
他三天前去世了
He passed away three days ago.

1641
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:38,230
演出团那时在阿肯色州的琼斯伯勒
When the show was at Jonesboro Arkansas.

1642
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:41,210
他葬在那儿的联邦公墓里
Buried him there at a Confederate cemetery.

1643
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:47,100
鲁本抱怨他晚上老睡不好
Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as night hoss?

1644
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:50,520
我觉得是他承受不了暖和的天气了
And I believe the warm weather was too much for him.

1645
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:54,420
我们有过难忘的日子
We had some lively times.

1646
01:42:55,650 --> 01:42:58,270
你和他是什么关系呢
What was the nature of your acquaintance?

1647
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,430
我很久以前就认识警官了
I knew the Marshal long ago.

1648
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,420
我们也有过  难忘的日子
We too had, lively times.

1649
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:08,820
谢谢你  扬戈先生
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1650
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:13,170
继续坐着吧  醉鬼
Keep your seat, trash.

1651
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,850
我把他的遗体运回故地
I had the body removed to our plot

1652
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:19,360
多年来常去祭拜
and I had visited it over the years.

1653
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,890
考伯恩  耶尔县  车站保管

1654
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,120
毫无疑问  有很多闲话
No doubt people talked about that.

1655
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:29,860
他们说  "她甚至都不认识那个人"
They say, "Well, she hardly knew the man".

1656
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:32,190
"她是个神志不清的老处女吧"
"Isn't she a cranky old maid".

1657
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,550
确实  我没结婚
It is true, I have not married.

1658
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,470
我没有时间干这种傻事
I never had time to fool with it.

1659
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
鲁本・考伯恩

1660
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,850
我再也没有德州勒波义夫警探的消息
I heard nothing more of the Texas officer, LeBoeuf.

1661
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,300
如果他还活着  我很愿意和他联系
If he is yet alive. I would be pleased to hear from him.

1662
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,220
我猜他现在得有七十多岁了
I judge he would be in his seventies now.

1663
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,080
快八十岁
And near eighty in seventy.

1664
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:56,260
我希望他那乱蓬蓬的头发会整齐一点了
I expect some of the starch has gone out of that cowlick.

1665
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,070
时间总是静静从我们身边溜走
Time just gets away from us.

1666
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:13,870
是怎样的友谊  是怎样的无上快乐
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,

1667
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:20,450
依靠于永恒的臂弯
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

1668
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:26,670
我拥有怎样的恩惠  怎样的平静
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,

1669
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:33,240
依靠于永恒的臂弯
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

1670
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:40,250
依靠  依靠
Leaning, leaning,

1671
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:46,540
安全  安心  免于惊扰

1672
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:52,320
依靠  依靠

1674
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:06,450
这条朝圣之路多么甜蜜
Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,

1675
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:12,700
依靠于永恒的臂弯
Leaning on the everlasting arms

1676
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:19,130
这条路日复一日  愈发光明
Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,

1677
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:25,390
依靠于永恒的臂弯

1680
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:45,860
依靠  依靠
Leaning, leaning,

1681
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:58,160
