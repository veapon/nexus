304
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,729
业主会拿走总收入的部分

305
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106

Yeah well, it's the bosses' rule,

309
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,699
但事实上 他们能为所欲为

一大堆骗人的把戏

我看起来不像是可以自己 料理生意的人？
I don't look like I can conduct business myself?

668

-你可以待会帮我结账 -哦 得了吧！
- You can pay me later. - Oh, come on!

688
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,195
我不是那种... 你把我当什么人？
I'm not that kind of-- who do you think I am?

689
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,613
拜托 老兄 这家伙
Come on, bro. This guy.

690
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,365
他以为他妈的这样就可以打发我
He thinks he can fucking just pay me off.

691
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,991
-你们要喝香槟吗？ -快走

695
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,830
-我马上就回来 -是
- I'll be right back. - Yep.

696
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,291
该死的包厢 真贵 哇
Fucking room-- fancy shit, wow.

697
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,296
-那家伙就是个白痴 -智障
- The guy's an idiot, you know? - Retarded.

698
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,049
这些家伙什么时候变得这么有钱？
Since when do these jerk-offs have so much money?

699
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,094
我刚也在想这事
I was just thinking the same exact shit.

700
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,389
该死的混蛋
Chateau de Shit.

701
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,599
这混蛋有朝一朝得意 他会整晚都拿这说事
Asshole blows enough lines, he'll be talking all night.

702
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,642
没错
All right!

703
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,652
好像每个袋子里都有25万
There's like $25,000 in each bag.

704
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,238
而且每个袋子都锁在该死的门背后
And each bag is locked behind this fucking gate.

705
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,073
摄像机几乎看不到
The camera doesn't even look,

706
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,325
而且他是晚上整个地方的保安
and he's the only fucking security guy in the whole place at night.

707
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,035
啊 耶
Uh, yeah.

708
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,872
-你他妈的去哪了？ -克里斯
- Where the fuck were you? - Chris.

709
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,668
埃迪刚告诉了我们 关于25万的事
You know, Eddie was just telling us about the 25Gs.

710
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,129
晚上那只有你一个人 是真的吗？
That true you're the only guy there at night?

711
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,047
我们刚只是在聊天 老兄
We were just talking, bro.

712
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,925
你知道 我们只是好奇
Yeah, so, you know, I'm just curious,

713
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,178
你怎么...你怎么能偷这么多钱 而且他们什么都不知道？
you know, how can-- how can you take that much and they don't know nothing?

714
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,972
-嗯？ -告诉他们
- Hmm? - Tell them how they leave

715
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,265
卡车都是整晚带着钱留在外面
the truck outside overnight with the fucking money in it.

716
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,560
-够了 好吗 埃迪？ -他 告诉他们
- Enough, Eddie, okay? - Tell them that.

717
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,437
不管你们在打什么鬼主意 忘了这事
Whatever you guys are thinking, forget it.

718
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,647
伙计 他不知道他自己在说什么
Guys, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

719
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,611
-克里斯 只不过要简单的1 2 3条... -够了 好吗？够了
- Chris, it's-- it's a simple 1-2-3-- - Enough, okay? Enough.

720
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,118
埃迪 你为什么要跟那些人说？
Eddie, why would you say anything to those people?

721
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,162
你是不是脑子有问题 迈克...
I mean, it's like you're retarded. Mike--

722
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,038
他就是个疯子 你清楚
I mean, he's a maniac, you know that.

723
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,832
我们只是聊了几句 老兄 放松点
We were just talking, bro, relax.

724
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,042
你几乎都说出来了
You already said that.

725
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,961
除此之外 他们都是给斯皮罗工作的
Besides the fact, they work for Spiro!

726
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,464
去他妈的斯皮罗 他们根本不在乎斯皮罗
Fuck Spiro. They don't give a shit about Spiro,

727
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,507
没人在乎 你知道你没告诉我
nobody does. You know you didn't tell me

728
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,968
他们毫无理由的把卡车留在外面过夜
that they leave the truck outside overnight for no reason.

729
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,012
你知道我想采取行动 老兄
You know you wanted me to put it in action, bro.

730
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,557
谁想采取行动？你个白痴
Put what into action? Listen, you idiot,

731
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,185
脑子里都别打这些歪主意
get whatever stupid idea is in your head out of your head.

732
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,979
说正经的 我问你 会发生的 最糟的事 是什么？
Seriously, let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen, what?

733
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,982
乔吉当了偷车贼被判了多久 一年？
What did Georgie get that one time for auto theft, a year?

734
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,276
一年不值得让你尝试一百万？
And a year ain't worth a chance at a million dollars?

735
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,487
我们这跟偷车是两回事 埃迪
We're not talking about robbing a car, Eddie.

736
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,739
我不想余生都给做任人宰割的羔羊 老兄
I'm not cleaning lambjizz the rest of my life, bro.

737
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,949
我父亲在他42岁的时候就去世了
My father died when he was 42.

738
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,368
你父亲...我无意冒犯 但是他只是
Your father-- no offense, but he just got canned

739
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,496
-给斯皮罗清理厕所 -说话小心点
- for cleaning Spiro's toilets. - Watch your mouth.

740
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,663
好吧 对不起 听着
All right, I'm sorry. Look,

741
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,874
我说的就是你好好想想吧 好吗？
all I'm saying is think about it, okay?

742
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,460
你今晚回家的时候好好想想 好吗？
Just think about it when you go to your house tonight, okay?

743
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,630
最糟糕的结果就是 我会因为抢劫 运钞车而坐牢
Worst-case scenario, I go to jail for robbing a fucking truck,

744
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,965
你知道 坐一年
you know, for a year.

745
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,592
另外 我们都准备好了
Anything else, we're set.

746
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,303
我们准备好了
We're set.

747
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,846
好好想想吧
Fucking think about it.

748
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,683
我们准备好了 老兄
We're set, bro.

749
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,910
哈密尔顿博汉农 1978年
Hamilton Bohannon, 1978.

750
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,496
祝你今晚愉快 纽约
Have a great night, New York.

751
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,956
瞧瞧你 伙计
Look at you, buddy.

752
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,876
跟25万美金坐在那
Sitting in there with $25 million.

753
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,007
那可是一大笔钱
That's a lot of money.

754
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,249
好 埃迪 今晚 在餐厅
Okay, Eddie, the diner, tonight.

755
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,089
听着 克里斯 我得确保 这家伙会守口如瓶
Look, Chris, I just gotta know that this asshole can keep his mouth shut.

756
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,133
行吗？如果被斯皮罗知道 我和吉米
Okay? If Spiro finds out, we're dead,

757
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,093
-都死定了 -你不信任我？
- me and Jimmy. - Why, you don't trust me?

758
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,511
不！
No!

759
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,513
听着 别再废话了 好吗？
Listen, no more bullshitting, okay?

760
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,432
说正经的 迈克说的对
This is serious. And Mike's right.

761
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,809
只有天知地知 你知我知 好吗？
Nobody but us knows anything about anything, okay?

762
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,609
他怎么回事？
What's his problem?

763
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,239
我只是...我只是在想
I just-- I just think

764
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,159
如果我们要干这个 我们应该让斯皮罗也参与进来
if we're going to do this, we should let Spiro in on it, no?

765
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,370
如果你告诉斯皮罗 他会全吞了
You tell Spiro, he'll want it all.

766
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,830
是 但是我们不必全部都给他
Yeah, but we don't have to give it to him all.

767
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,290
我说的对吗？
See what I'm saying?

768
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,085
埃迪是对的
Eddie's right.

769
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,087
他是个白痴 不过他是对的
He's tr茅los, but he's right.

770
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,005
斯皮罗什么都不会知道
Spiro can't know nothing.

771
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,716
你觉得不会被他发现？
What, you don't think he's gonna find out?

772
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,801
不 我不觉得
No, I don't.

773
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,178
好
Okay.

774
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,390
好 吉米

该死的
Aww shit.

1080
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,985
嘿 你能不能在联邦调查局
Hey, you might want to go holler at your boy there

1081
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,154
来之前从这里离开
before these FBI clowns take over from him.

1082
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,289
你和你的同事们还真是混乱啊

1090
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,101
我不知道 我现在一片混乱
I don't know. My head's all messed up.

1091
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,189
一个月三次 还真是疯狂啊
Three times in a month is crazy.

1092

令人难以置信啊
Unbelievable.

1096
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,823
这狗竟然也因为害怕而晕倒了
The dog passed out from fear.

1097
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,618
那该死的人吓坏了它
9mm must have scared the shit out of him.

1098
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,287
他们看它没知觉了 还以为它死了
They found it unconscious. They thought it was dead.

1099
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,955
他们以为这狗死了

1101

we've got two men dead, we've got no arrests.

1104
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,178
这里有人知道
Does anybody here have any idea how many

1105
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:25,181
多少钱消失了吗？
dollars that disappeared from this spot?

1106
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,933
罗森侦探
Uh, Detective Ransone

1107
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,685
或这位先生...
or Mister-- how do you pronounce it?

1108
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,311
是帕特觅吗？
--Patemi, is it?

1109
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,479
是波特米提斯
Potamitis.

1110
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,816
是嘛 你们知道
Yeah. See, now you know why

1111
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,859
为什么联邦调查局来这了吗？
the FBI is rolling up in here.

1112
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,196
所以
Yeah, so.

1113
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,199
波特米提斯先生 是像圣诞老人
Mr. Potamias, you got Santa Claus

1114
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,326
一样的人从天花板上掉下来 是吗？
coming through your ceiling, right?

1115
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,994
他们破门而入
They break in your gate,

1116
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,455
以非常近的距离向狗开枪
shooting a 9mm within proximity of your dog

1117
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,624
而你却没察觉到
and you're unconscious.

1118
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,543
不 我...
Yeah. No, I, uh...

1119
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,130
我不知道 我当时正在巡视 回来后
I don't know. I was making the rounds. I come back

1120
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,631
我想应该是有人袭击了我
and I guess somebody hit me.

1121
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,550
你不是在打电话吗？
You weren't on the phone?

1122
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,761
不是打电话吗？ 可你刚才跟我说你在打电话？
No phonecall? Didn't you tell me you were on that phone?

1123
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,598
霍尼韦尔公司打电话过来 然后你说一切正常
Honeywell called and you said everything was okay.

1124
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,309
-是一切正常吗？ -就像我说的
- Was it okay? - Yeah, like I said--

1125
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,812
我在巡视 回来后
no, I was making the rounds. I come back and some--

1126
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,814
有人袭击了你
Somebody hit you.

1127
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,358
是的
Yeah.

1128
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,735
你就没看见什么？
Nothing caught your eye?

1129
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,612
当时就没什么不正常？
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at that time?

1130
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,406
外面的摄像头坏了
The camera outside's broke,

1131
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,033
所以我能看见的就是这房间的门
so the only visuals I had were on the money room and the doors.

1132
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,286
是啊 然后有人从天花板上掉了下来
Yeah, and somebody's coming through your ceiling.

1133
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,329
还真是一部精彩的电影啊
That's a brilliant move. Whew.

1134
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,832
-很聪明 -真的是很聪明
- Very clever. - It's really clever.

1135
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,792
很聪明 很狡猾
Very clever, very tricky.

1136
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,836
这些家伙不是人
Wow, these guys are something else, huh?

1137
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,046
-先生 我没听懂 -你还有别的什么要说的吗？
- Excuse me, sir. - So you got anything else for us,

1138
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,090
-这位... -帕特觅先生
- Mister... - Potami.

1139
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,258
帕特觅先生？
Potami?

1140
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,178
罗森侦探 你还有什么要问的吗？
Detective Ransone, any more questions?

1141
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,221
不 你们已经问完了
No, I think you guys covered everything.

1142
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,390
没有？很好 也就是说 我们在这的工作完成了 对吧？
No? Good. So we're done here, right?

1143
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,101
哪个人把他送医院去吧
Somebody get this kid to a hospital.

1144
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,772
-真是难以置信啊 -嗯哼
- Unbelievable. - Mmm.

1145
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,048
波特米提斯先生 我是欧尼阿拉托斯
Mr. Potamatis, Ernie Anastos.

1146
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,592

01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,561
-克里斯 听我的吧 -我很抱歉
- Chris, listen to me! - I'm sorry.

1174
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,438
如果因为那该死的埃迪
If goddamn Eddie has something to do with this

1175
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,065
你再被警察抓了的话 我会杀了他的 明白吗？
to make the police come for you again, I'm gonna kill him, you hear me?

1176
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,109
听见我说的话了吗
Listen to me!

1177
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,913
我是美国地方检察官朱利尼亚 欢迎你来
U.S. District Attorney Giuliani, welcome.

1178
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,206
-这是我的助手纽金特马里查 -嘿 你们好吗？
- Agents Nugent, Marichal. - Hey, how you doing?

1179
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,791
-非常欢迎你来 -很高兴见到你们
- Hot enough for you or what? - Good to see you.

1180
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,043
伙计 进展的怎么样？
How are you doing, fellas?

1181
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,086
被抢了多少钱？
So how much are we talking about being taken here?

1182
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,297
虽然报纸上说的不怎么详细
Yeah well, the newspapers are downplaying it,

1183
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,091
但我们认为应该超过1干万元
but we think it's upwards of $10 million.

1184
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,427
-天呐 -史上最大数额的案件了
- Jesus Christ. - The largest one in history.

1185
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,888
难道那里只有一个保安吗？
And the security guard, there was only one?

1186
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,432
只有一个 而且他好像根本就
Only one guard, but he doesn't really seem that capable

1187
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,935
-不能胜任那个工作 先生 -怎么看起来好像
- of much of anything, sir. - Well, seemed capable of shooting

1188
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:41,604
根据这个报道 两天内就能抓到抢劫犯啊
a would-be robber two nights prior according to this report here.

1189
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,231
不错 但是听着
You're right about that, sir, but listen,

1190
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,151
我们都觉得那只是个诱饵
we think that whole thing might have been a decoy.

1191
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,696
因为我们现在已经监视了那人
Because we've got the guy on surveillance tape, right?

1192
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:56,077
两天前 他在后面架了个摄像机
Two nights prior, he's disabling a video camera in the back.

1193
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,120
所以你觉得这有什么联系？
So you think the two are connected?

1194
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,415
是啊 这个细节 那个人
Yeah, but talking about details, manpower--

1195
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,584
很有可能会这样做的
there's no doubt about it--

1196
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,252
感觉好像我们在谈论科萨诺斯特拉 （黑手党 美国的一个秘密犯罪组织）
we're talking Cosa Nostra.

1197
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,964
而一开始就参与进来的侦探...
And the detective who's been on since the beginning--

1198
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,757
J.罗森侦探？
Detective J. Ransone?

1199
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,842
是啊 他现在刚好
Yeah, he's setting up a makeshift interrogation

1200
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,220
在帝国那时有临时审讯
over at Empire right now.

1201
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,765
-很好笑吗？ -朱利尼亚先生 那个
- You find that funny? - Mr. Giuliani, there's no way in hell

1202
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,810
外国佬肯定不能独自完成这件事的
that that greaseball guard could pull off this job on his own.

1203
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,646
对他来说这事太难了 其实我很乐意去帮他的
It's just too big for him. I'm willing to put my badge on it.

1204
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,274
让他去工作没什么坏处
Well, no harm in letting him follow through with the workers,

1205
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,819
但我还是同意马里查的看法
but I tend to agree with Marichal here.

1206
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,821
这是次集团犯罪
This thing stinks of organized crime.

1207
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,657
-不错 -继续走访那五家人
- Agreed. - Go after all five families.

1208
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,575
总有人会说的
Someone's gonna talk.

1209
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,289
在检察官鲁道夫朱利尼亚的部署下
Under District Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's orders

1210
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,792
五个犯罪家庭的成员
members of all five of New York's crime families

1211
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,837
都被捕以审讯 关于帝国抢劫案的细节
have been arrested to be questioned in regard to the Empire heist.

1212
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,046
你他妈的嘴唇上还留了东西
You missed some shit on your upper lip.

1213
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,423
-你应该弄干净来的 -这案子被认为是
- You should shave that off. - Now believed to be the largest

1214
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,341
自德国汉莎航空公司抢劫案 之后最大的案子
since Lufthansa.

1215
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,343
战争...
War...

1216
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,221
-八百万 九百万 到底多少钱 -嘿 你怎么样？
- $8 million, 9 million, how much is it? - Hey, how you doing?

1217
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,306
-好像没人知道什么事 -嘿 后退
- No one seems to know anything... - Hey, back off!

1218
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,392
-除了那次案件 -朱塞佩 钱在哪？
- ...Other than this is... - Where's the money, Giuseppe?

1219
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,561
这就是美国历史上最大的抢劫案了
...The biggest heist in U.S. history.

1220
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:08,357
女士们先生们 某个地方的人可是有一大笔钱的
Ladies and gentlemen, someone out there has a lot of cash.

1221
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,359
这就是你的一半 一分不少
It's your half right there, every penny.

1222
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,154
-我就说了可以成功吧 -操你妈的蠢蛋
- Told you we could pull that off. - You fucking ass!

1223
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,948
他妈的我的脸都被毁了
That's for breaking my fucking face.

1224
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,826
你怎么可以说
How else were you gonna say you had

1225
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,495
你跟这事没一点关系 嗯？ 操你妈的
nothing to do with it, huh? Fuck!

1226
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,789
我跟迈克说了 他想
I talked to Mike. He wants to, uh--

1227
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,541
他想见我们
Mike wants to meet with us.

1228
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:27,877
操你妈的
You fucking--

1229
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,547
我能怎么办？是他打电话给我的
What was I supposed to do? He called me.

1230
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,216
他说我们可以用 哥伦比亚人的方式跟他交易
He said we go in with the Colombian deal on him and that's it.

1231
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,552
而且他不会跟任何人说的
He won't say nothing to anybody, so that's it.

1232
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,679
-就这样 -我要进去了
- There it is. - I'm gonna get in my car.

1233
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,931
你再出现在我面前的话 我他妈的就杀了你
You come around me again, and I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1234
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,392
-我还能说什么？ -我他妈的要杀了你
- What else was I supposed to say? - I will fucking kill you.

1235
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,895
-听明白了吗？ -我他妈的刚给你了八百万
- You understand me? - I just handed you $8 fucking million!

1236
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,897
他妈的不是你给我的 明白了吗？
You didn't hand me fucking shit, you understand me?

1237
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,857
-把你那该死的... -他妈的不要用手这样指我
- Get the fuck-- - Didn't hand me fucking shit.

1238
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,400
他妈的给我走开
And you walk the fuck away

1239
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,319
还有迈克也是 要不然我把你们俩都杀了
and you tell Mike to do the same or I'll kill you both.

1240
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,029
-我他妈的会杀了你 -是啊 操你妈的
- I'll fucking kill you. - Yeah, fuck you!

1241
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,364
他妈的当你出现在那的时候 我就该杀了你
I should have shot you when you came through that fucking roof.

1242
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,699
操你妈的鸡巴
Fucking prick.

1243
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,102
该死的可卡因
This fucking cocaine.

1244
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,611
你知道我想杀了你吗？
You know I should kill you, right?

1245
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,781
想把你的喉咙撕裂
Slit your throat...

1246
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,950
就算当初 你对我做的那些卑鄙的事一样
for backstabbing me like you did.

1247
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,746
这也是我现在来这的原因
I mean, that's why I'm here right now.

1248
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,541
我会补偿你的
I'll pay you back.

1249
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,543
那你朋友呢？
And your friend?

1250
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,046
他不会 他只是...
He had nothing to do with it. He just...

1251
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,006
还没背叛我而已
didn't rat me out, so.

1252
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,592
就这样
That's it.

1253
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,012
埃迪 我不是笨蛋
I'm not an asshole, Eddie.

1254
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,391
你他妈的看着我 行吗？
Fucking look at me, okay?

1255
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,936
听着 我参与了
Listen, I'm in.

1256
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,230
我一直都参与了
I'm all the way in, so.

1257
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,275
但是克里斯却想置身事外 所以就成这样了
But Chris stays out of it and that's the way it's gonna be.

1258
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,776
你可以杀了我 你想怎么报复我都可以
You could shoot me, you could do whatever you want to do,

1259
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,194
但是你知道吗？
but you know what?

1260
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,449
杀了我的话 你也不知道钱在哪
Kill me, you don't find out where the money is, and...

1261
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,661
而且我还会跟斯皮罗 说关于吉米的事
you know, and I'll tell Spiro about Jimmy, so.

1262
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,163
你理解吗？
You know?

1263
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,790
好吧
Okay.

1264
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,169
那就推到明天解决
It goes down tomorrow then.

1265
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,462
很好
Good.

1266
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,965
千万不要给我玩失踪
Don't disappear.

1267
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,509
-那里都不去 -嗯 那就好
- Not going anywhere. - Yeah.

1268
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,970
很好 那现在给我滚出去
Good. Now get the fuck out.

1269
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,805
好吧
All right.

1270
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:58,485
-你有什么发现吗 -或许就在某个地方
- You got something? - Somewhere in here.

1271
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,326
找到了
Got it.

1272
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,870
-我们出去吧 -什么 出去？
- Let's get outta here. - What, we stepping out?

1273
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,246
-是的 -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay, let's do this.

1274
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,963
迈克尔 哪里是...
Michael, where's, um...

1275
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,426
-什么？ -吉米在哪里？
- Where's what? - Where's Jimmy?

1276
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,762
他最近去哪了？
Where's he been lately?

1277
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,765
-吉米在工作 -我知道 我的意思是他没有
- Jimmy's working. - No, I know, he hasn't been here in--

1278
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,225
他都快一星期没来这了
it's been like almost a week.

1279
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,060
他可是一直都跟你在一起的 所以我很好奇
He's always with you. I'm just wondering.

1280
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,519
我很好奇他在哪里
I'm just wondering where he is.

1281
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,396
他现在在工地上
I think he's got the-- the construction thing.

1282
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,315
-哦 是嘛 -他在电影院工作
- Oh yeah yeah. - He's been working at that movie house.

1283
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,108
-嗯哼 -所以会有点忙
- Mm-hmm. - So it's been real busy over there.

1284
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,361
雅尼 那看起来不错 你能打开吗？打不开吗？
Yanni, that looks good. Can you turn it on? You can't turn it on?

1285
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,321
背景里的好像是火山
There's a lava in the back I think.

1286
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,572
看起来还不错
It looks good anyway.

1287
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:44,990
你要去哪里？
Where the hell are you going?

1288
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,368
卫生间
Use the bathroom.

1289
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:52,957
[外语]

1290
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,878
嘿 我在找...
Hey, I'm looking for a...

1291
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,922
斯皮罗斯查基斯
Spiro Stravakis.

1292
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,383
-斯查基斯？ -是 斯查基斯
- Stavrakis. - Stavrakis!

1293
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,677
哦 是警察吗？
That's good. Are the police asking?

1294
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,596
-有这么明显吗？ -只有警察会来
- What, that obvious? - Only if you're the police.

1295
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,725
是的 我们是来询问关于帝国抢劫案的
Yeah, we came here about the Empire heist.

1296
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,103
我想知道有没有人知道什么信息
Just curious if anybody knew anything about it.

1297
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,063
是布朗克斯区的帝国抢劫案吗？
The Empire heist in the Bronx?

1298
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,856
-是的 -你们到这来找？
- Mm-hmm. - And you're here looking?

1299
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,943
报纸上不是说是马夫做的吗
I thought the papers said that was the Guineas.

1300
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,195
-他们可是一群暴民 -在我认为
- You know, the real mob. - Ah, you know.

1301
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,322
不管是一流的下层阶级 还是三流的下层阶级
Big-time lowlifes, small-time lowlifes--

1302
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,741
对我来说都是一样的
it's all the same to me.

1303
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,078
在那的是迈克尔...
Ain't that right there, Michael...

1304
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,872
迪米奇 我说的没错吧？
Dimitriu? Did I say that right?

1305
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,417
你到我的地盘 还能叫出我们的名字
You come into my place and you start saying people's names,

1306
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,877
-可你却没说自己的名字 -是啊
- but you never said your name. - You're right.

1307
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,505
-我们没有说 -你这是在暗示什么？
- We didn't. - And what are you insinuating?

1308
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:44,425
你是说迈克尔跟这抢劫案有关系吗？
That maybe Michael here had something to do with this robbery?

1309
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:47,303
我只是想问问他们 知不知道点什么 就这样
Just want to ask your boy if he have any ideas on it, that's all.

1310
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,597
伙计们 这侦探他妈的自我感觉
My boy, detectives, has the good fucking sense to know

1311
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,600
如果我身边的人跟那事有什么关系
that if he or anyone around me had anything to do with something like this

1312
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,936
他可以不经过我的同意就抓人
without my knowledge, that they'd lose their balls.

1313
01:11:55,978 --> 01:12:00,065
所以现在可以确信他根本 就是在捕风捉影
So no, you can be certain he has no ideas on this.

1314
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,359
你是在替他回答吗？
So you're answering for him?

1315
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,903
-我已经说过了 -他替你回答了
- I just did. - He's answering for you.

1316
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,994
好吧 我们没找到什么线索
Okay. Well, we got nothing else.

1317
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,333
-那再见？ -再见
- Yassou? - Yassou, yeah.

1318
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,709
好吧
All right.

1319
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,296
再见
Yassou.

1320
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:28,927
迈克尔 坐
Michael, have a seat.

1321
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,652
看 他在跟某个人说话
Look at him, he's talking to someone.

1322
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,282
-婊子养的混蛋 -你确信？
- Son of a bitch. - You sure?

1323
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,284
我相信他肯定看到摄像机了
I'm positive. He's looking right at the camera.

1324
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,203
我一下午可就是在找它
I've been looking at this thing all afternoon.

1325
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,538
啊 他来了
Ah, here he is.

1326
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,374
婊子养的混蛋
Son of a bitch.

1327
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,670
-嘿 克里斯 -嘿
Hey, Chris. Hey, man.

1328
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,339
-嘿 -你怎么样？
- Hey. - How you doing?

1329
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,966
进来吧 嘿 伙计们 让我单独跟他说话
Come on in. Hey, guys, give me the office for a sec.

1330
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,927
-知道了 -我还没机会
- Sure. - Hey, listen, I never got the chance

1331
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,054
说声谢谢呢 因为你救了我的命
to properly thank you for saving my life out there.

1332
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,806
谢谢你
So thank you.

1333
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,849
没事 看到你没事我就放心了
Yeah, I'm glad to see you're doing okay.

1334
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,601
是啊 我也是 你......
Yeah, me too. Here, grab a--

1335
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:19,144
随便找张椅子坐下吧
grab a seat, sit down.

1336
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,857
你能来 我很感谢
Listen, uh, thanks for coming down, man.

1337
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,984
你知道的 发生了这样的事
You know, any time something like this happens

1338
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,320
我们把你带过来 找人谈话
we gotta bring you down, we gotta talk to people.

1339
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,115
这都是程序上规定的 相信你他也明白
It's all the procedural bullshit. You know the drill.

1340
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,200
-是的 我知道 -那就好
- Yeah, for sure. - Okay.

1341
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,285
所以我想问你
So I gotta ask you...

1342
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,746
就没有什么不平常的事发生吗？
nothing seemed out of the ordinary? Not a thing?

1343
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,082
我知道听起来有些疯狂
Uh, I know it sounds crazy,

1344
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,126
但我四处拜访了一下
but, you know, I was making the rounds,

1345
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,587
然后就去上厕所 我没听见什么 然后就回来了
I went to the bathroom. I didn't hear anything. I come back.

1346
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,049
就这样
That's it.

1347
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,512
你认识这些家伙吗？
You know these guys?

1348
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,724
一个叫迈克尔迪米奇
That guy's a Michael Dimitriu

1349
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,144
另一个叫埃迪帕帕加斯
and another guy's Eddie Papastratos.

1350
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,522
是一些不重要的罪犯 但我就是想知道你认识他们吗
They're small time criminals, but I wanted to know if you knew them.

1351
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,944
-为什么？ -我只是想校对一下 没别的
- Yeah, why? - I was just checking, that's all.

1352
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,701
我没跟他们说过话 如果你知道...
I mean I haven't spoken to them in a while, you know, if--

1353
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,620
所以...
SO...

1354
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,581
我相信他们跟这事没关系
you know, I'm sure they had nothing to do with this

1355
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,083
-如果这是你说的话 -我没这样说
- if that's what you're saying. - I didn't say that.

1356
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,586
没事
But okay.

1357
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,466
好吧 那...
Okay, so,

1358
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,593
你还要问别的问题呢还是就这样？
you have any more questions or is that it?

1359
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,803
你说只有一个人
You said that there was only one guy, right,

1360
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,181
-闯进去了 就是劫匪 对吧？ -不不不 我没这样说
- who broke in, the robber? - No no, I didn't.

1361
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,475
我没看见任何人 所以
You know, I didn't see anyone, so.

1362
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,560
嗯
Huh.

1363
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,103
我们这有个视频
You know we got this video here

1364
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,273
就在钱柜附近
and, uh, near the money room

1365
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,275
正前方有个戴着面具的人
right before the guy with the ski mask

1366
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,611
他发现了并毁了这摄像机
looks up and he smashes the surveillance camera,

1367
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,446
看起来他好像在跟谁说话
it's like he's talking to someone.

1368
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,655
然后他向上看
Then he looks up

1369
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,116
好像是有人告诉他这里有个摄像机
like someone told him where the camera was.

1370
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,743
还真是不可思议啊
It's the weirdest thing.

1371
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:01,079
我已经说过了 我没看见任何人
Like I told you, I didn't see anyone, so.

1372
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,624
是啊 你已经说过几次了
Yeah, you said that already-- a few times.

1373
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:06,084
-是啊 -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

1374
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,878
好吧 你什么都不知道
Okay, you don't know nothing.

1375
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,593
那这算是结束了？
Okay, are we good?

1376
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,512
是的 我们结束了
Yeah yeah yeah. We're done.

1377
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,096
那就好
Okay, great.

1378
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,349
我感谢过你救了我的命 对吧？
I thanked you for saving my life, right?

1379
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,518
-是啊 -那就好
- Yeah. - Okay, good.

1380
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,355
但是这不意味着
But that don't mean for a goddamn second

1381
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:28,357
我不会揍扁你
that I won't hesitate to drag your ass in

1382
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,692
如果我发现你对我撒谎了的话
if I find out you've been lying to me about all this shit.

1383
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,820
明白了吗？
Do you understand?

1384
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,115
知道了
Yeah, I got it.

1385
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,202
那就好
All right, we're cool.

1386
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,830
好了 你可以走了
Now you can go.

1387
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,024
哇哦
Whoo!

1388
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,577
嘿
Hey!

1389
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,581
斯皮罗想谈一谈
Spiro wants to talk.

1390
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,208
进来
Get in.

1391
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:47,978
哟 奥兰德
Yo, Orlanda.

1392
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,575
请坐
Please, sit down, yeah?

1393
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,076
这里
Here.

1394
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,295
你迟到了 嗯？
You're late, huh?

1395
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,927
这就是我们要来的地方？
So this is where we hang out, huh?

1396
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,971
还真是愉快的时光啊
The big time.

1397
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,810
说吧 不要有所保留
Please, no secrets.

1398
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,314
把你们的包和我们的放在一起
Put your bag down right next to ours.

1399
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,443
好的
It's cool.

1400
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,663
八百万 都在这了
Eight mill, all there.

1401
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,458
纯可卡因呢？
The coke pure?

1402
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,460
为什么人们老是问这问题呢？
Why do people always ask that, huh?

1403
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,088
你以为在拍电影？肯定不是啊
It's the movies, yeah? Of course.

1404
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,300
干净的钱？
Clean?

1405
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,843
当然
Of course.

1406
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,686
看来你很认真啊
Now you must have serious financing

1407
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:13,522
迈克你竟然让这人代替了吉米
for Mike to make you his partner instead of Jimmy.

1408
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,607
-对吧？ -是的
- Right? - Yeah well,

1409
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,818
吉米不会再参与进来了
listen, Jimmy ain't a part of this no more.

1410
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,277
明白吗？
Okay?

1411
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,200
知道了
Okay.

1412
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,036
数一下
Let's count it.

1413
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,544
那我们现在就再等等 嗯？
And now we wait, huh?

1414
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,046
那可是一大笔钱啊
It's a lot of money to count.

1415
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:57,399
克里斯克里斯塔
Christo Christara.

1416
01:18:57,482 --> 01:19:00,527
哇 你最近可不常来了 嗯？
Wow, you've been through a lot lately, huh?

1417
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,988
是他妈的有些时日了
Some couple of fucking days.

1418
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,866
我们有事找你
We got something for you.

1419
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,784
我们的客人在哪呢？
Where's-- where's our special guest?

1420
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,369
有人知道我们的客人在哪吗？
Anybody know where our special guest is?

1421
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,080
-在拉尿 -拉尿？
- Taking a piss. - He's taking a piss?

1422
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,751
是的 拉尿
He's taking a piss.

1423
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,837
嘿 他竟然在拉尿
Hey, he's taking a piss.

1424
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,674
好吧
Okay, so.

1425
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,719
在你告诉我 你把从帝国那抢来的钱藏哪之前
Before you tell me where the money from the robbery is in the Bronx--

1426
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,846
你他妈的先告诉我你为什么要
and you're gonna fucking tell me, which is the only reason

1427
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,723
我们不马上把你脑袋拧下来的理由
we don't bash your fucking head in right now--

1428
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,017
不过在这和之前 我要你见个人
but before you do, there's somebody I want you to meet

1429
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,561
那人跟我说你不希望 我参与那抢劫案
who's been telling me about a robbery you didn't want to include me in on.

1430
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:35,937
斯皮罗 听着
Spiro, listen,

1431
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,898
我不知道你在说什么 好吗？
I don't know what you're talking about, okay?

1432
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,233
嘿 我知道我在说什么
Hey, I understand. I understand! That's why I'm saying

1433
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,110
我只是想让你先见个人
I just want you to meet somebody first.

它现在也从我们手中消失了
