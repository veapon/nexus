It's not even my money. If you take that my boss will kill me.

168
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,370
你没事吧 戴维? 我可以帮你 我可以报警

- 没问题  - 谢谢
- You got it.  - Appreciate it.

185

Oh! David Clark.

194
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,250
你还真不好找 别因为站在塑料布上就紧张
You're a hard man to find. Take it easy on the plastic.

195
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,761
喔 布莱德 这是他妈什么情况?
Whoa, Brad, what the fuck is this?

196
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,126
是这样的老兄 我本来要给你打回去的 别杀我
Look, man, I was gonna call you back. Do not kill me.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,521
- 我被抢了 好吧 我发誓  - 喔 喔 喔
- I got robbed, okay. I swear.  - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

198
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,766
你怎么...? 什么...?
What are you...? What...?

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,007
哦 你说塑料布?
Oh, the plastic?

200
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,441
是啊 你都用塑料布了
Yeah, the plastic.

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,687
我也看过"嗜血判官"
I've seen Dexter.

202
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,488
伙计 我只是装了个新的天窗 你个傻货 哈哈
Buddy, I'm putting in a new skylight, you idiot. Ha, ha.

203
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,043
你真该照照镜子 你都吓傻了
You should have seen your face just now. You shit a brick.

204
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,364
我还能怎么想 伙计?
Well, what am I supposed to think, man?

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,370
你让这些家伙们蒙上我的脸 行了
You've got these thugs throwing a bag over my head. Come on.

206
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,121
我很抱歉 我没想吓你
I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean to freak you out.

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,324
- 没事  - 不过你知道我杀过人的对吧?
- It's fine.  - You do know I've killed people though?

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,086
是的 布莱德 我知道
Yeah, Brad, I know.

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,486
哈... 哈 好了 坐下
Ha... ha. All right, have a seat.

210
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,605
喔 这是他妈什么?
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,083
什么? 哦 我的虎鲸? 嗯 我买了一条虎鲸
What? Oh, my orca? Yeah, I bought an orca.

212
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,324
我赚的钱很多
I make a lot of money.

213
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,961
那你就买了条鲸鱼?
So you bought a whale?

214
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,685
是啊 我不喜欢跑车
Well, I don't like sports cars.

215
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,360
- 嗯 是  - 那么我的钱哪去了 戴维?
- Yeah, yeah.  - So where's my money, David?

216
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,160
行行好 伙计 我们认识这么久了
Come on, man. We go back.

217
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,368
我们确实认识很久了 但这不是上大学的时候
We do go back. But it's not college anymore.

218
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,608
我们也不是在宿舍倒卖大麻的小贩了
We're not selling lids out of my dorm room.

219
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,371
话说回来 你还欠我4万3
And you owe me $43,000.

220
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,564
我告诉你了 我被抢了 布莱德 他们抢了我的全部财产 伙计
I told you, I got robbed, Brad. They took everything I had, man.

221
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,843
这一周的货款 还有我存的2万2 我完蛋了
This week's drop, 22 grand of my money that I'd saved. I'm fucked.

222
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,166
听着 这确实是个糟糕的局面 不过我也许能让我们双赢
Listen, this is a fucked-up situation. But I might have a win-win for both of us.

223
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,451
- 好啊  - 我从墨西哥订购了一点...
- Great.  - I have a smidge of very choice...

224
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,324
上等的大麻...
mari-ju-ana down in Mexico...

225
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,409
而我需要在周日晚上运过来
and I need it here by Sunday night.

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,444
给我运货的人被枪杀了
My regular courier is out because he got gunned down.

227
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,920
所以叫你来
That's where you come in.

228
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,727
你可以当我的骡子 我需要一个可以信任的人来运货
You could be my mule. I need someone I can trust.

229
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,527
去趟墨西哥 周日晚上把货运回来 我不仅会一笔勾销你欠我的债务...
Go to Mexico, bring it back by Sunday night, not only will I forgive your debt...

230
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,089
还会付给你一份10万的运费
I will pay you a standard courier fee of $100,000.

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,369
你要给我10万 就为了运一点货过境?
You're gonna give me 100 grand to move a smidge across the border?

232
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,447
比一点点多了那么一点吧 没多少
Smidge and a half. It's nothing.

233
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,644
兄弟 我只是个小角色而已
Dude, I got rolled by the fucking cast of Annie.

234
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,401
我一进来你要我当跨国毒枭
I come walking in here and you ask me to be an international drug dealer.

235
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,888
这钱唾手可得 戴维 你所要做的就是飞去墨西哥...
This is easy money, David. All you gotta do is pop down to Mexico...

236
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,527
找到这个地址 告诉他们你是来取巴勃罗・察孔的货的
go to this address, tell them you're there to pick up for Pablo Chacon.

237
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,848
- 谁他妈是巴勃罗・察孔?  - 我
- Who the fuck is Pablo Chacon?  - I am.

238
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,766
叫布莱德・嘉德林格的话 墨西哥人才不会正眼看你 明白吗?
You don't get respect from Mexicans when your name is Brad Gurdlinger, right?

239
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,522
我是说 那一听就是个白人的名字 看 大坏蛋布莱德的计划总是万无一失
I mean, that's white in any language. See? Big Bad Brad thought of everything.

240
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,091
不行 我不行 大哥 这对我来说难度太大了
I don't know. I don't think so, man. This is way out of my league.

241
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,685
万一被抓住 可是触犯联邦法律的
If something goes wrong, it's a federal crime.

242
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,805
如果我被逮到试图带一磅毒品过境 差不多 嗯...
If I got pinched at the border, trying to cross over with more than a pound, you're talking like, um...

243
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,009
会被判在墨西哥监狱服刑二十五年 还是在法官心情好的情况下
Twenty-five years in Mexican prison. If you get a happy judge.

244
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,242
是啊 天呐 是很冒险
Yeah. Jeez. Not good.

245
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,966
- 不过 你忘掉了一件事  - 什么?
- Although, you're forgetting one thing.  - What?

246
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,527
你他妈根本没得选
You don't have a fucking choice.

247
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,445
那么你现在就是要成为一个更大的毒贩了?
So now you're gonna become an even bigger drug dealer?

248
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,007
只运毒 肯尼 不一样的
Drug smuggler, Kenny. There's a difference.

249
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,001
你过境的时候是有可能被检查的
You're probably gonna get searched at the border.

250
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,722
不是我说 你看起来真的像个毒贩
No offense, you look like a total drug dealer.

251
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,605
- 没错 谢谢 伙计  - 你可以化化装
- No shit. Thanks, dude.  - You could wear a disguise.

252
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,605
- 什么?  - 化装
- What?  - A disguise.

253
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,484
我就知道你说的是这个 化装
That's what I thought. A disguise.

254
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,684
我化装成什么? 最近流行的万圣节装扮是什么?
So what should I dress up? Like a... I don't know. What's the hot Halloween outfit these days?

255
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,611
像蝙蝠侠里的贝恩那样的? 脸上带个什么东西?
Bane from Batman? Someone like that? Wear something over my face?

256
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,565
我这里没有毒品 你们不需要担心
There's no drugs in here. You've got nothing to worry about.

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,920
好主意
Great idea.

258
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,326
不好意思 嗨
Hey, pardon me. Hi.

259
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,162
抱歉打扰你们 我们一家想去动物园 可是我找不到方向了
Hate to bug you, but I'm trying to get the fam to the zoo and I'm lost as all heck.

260
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,930
滚蛋 弗兰德斯真人版
Fuck off, real-life Flanders.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,242
是我的错 一看地图 我就傻了
It's my fault. When it comes to reading maps, I sure can be an old flibbertigibbet.

262
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,724
嘿 先生 这里不能停车
Hey. No parking here, sir.

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,410
活该被罚 傻逼游客
Perfect. Fucking tourists.

264
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,041
哦 天呐 我非常抱歉 警官
Oh, jeez. I'm awful sorry, officer.

265
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,163
我不知道该走哪条路了
I don't know which way is up around here.

266
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,011
没关系 我们的城市有时候确实容易迷路
No problem. Our city can get confusing sometimes.

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,770
正在找去动物园的路
Trying to find our way to the zoo.

268
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,806
直走两个街区之后 左转 再过两个街区...
It's two blocks up that way, take a left, two blocks...

269
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,841
真他妈的
Holy fucking shit.

270
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,205
谢谢 混蛋们
Thank you, dickheads.

271

Rose, the guy at the bar asked for you by name.

- 求你 听我说  - 停 停 停 停
- Please. Listen to me.  - Duh, duh, duh, duh.

280
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,644
打住 打住
Ch-ch-ch-chuh.

281
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,330
你个混蛋
You asshole.

282
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,405
别担心 我不需要你脱光什么的
Don't worry. You don't have to get naked and all that stuff.

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,931
- 除非你想脱 其实 嗷!  - 嗯
- Unless you want to, you know. Oof!  - Mm-hm.

284
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,400
- 操  - 你要干什么?
- Fuck.  - What do you want?

285
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,523
你愿不愿意用国庆节的周末赚1万块?
How would you like to spend 4th of July weekend making 10 grand?

286
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,801
- 什么?  - 萝丝 听我说
- What?  - Rose, listen.

287
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,725
我只需要你陪我去一趟墨西哥
All I'm asking is that you go to Mexico with me.

288
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,125
好吧? 然后我们一起开着房车回来
All right? And then we drive home together in an RV.

289
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,401
嗯
Mm-hm.

290
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,080
- 不过那辆房车里边有点货  - 贩毒?
- And that RV has some pot in it.  - Drug dealing?

291
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,045
不 不是贩毒 不是 不是 是运毒
No, it's not drug dealing. It's not. No, it's smuggling.

292
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,402
- 你疯了?  - 萝丝 听我说
- Are you out of your mind?  - Rose, listen to me.

293
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,322
是这样 我自己过境 太扎眼 很招人注意 对吧?
Now, me crossing the border by myself, huge red flag. Huge, all right?

294
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,642
不过要是一家子的话 他们就不会在意了
But families, they don't get a second look.

295
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,730
萝丝 我需要你演我老婆
So, Rose, I need you to be my wife.

296
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,882
这可是我听说过最蠢的事了
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

297
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,641
你看 萝丝 1万块 而且机票钱不用你掏
Look, Rose, 10,000 bucks, and your flight's already paid for.

298
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,205
你不能拿钱买我
You can't buy me.

299
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,370
我不是买你 好吧? 我是租你
I'm not buying you, all right? I'm renting you.

300
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,607
嗯
Hmm.

301
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,006
像"风月俏佳人"里那样
Like Pretty Woman.

302
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,043
"风月俏佳人"? 她是个妓女
Pretty Woman? She was a prostitute.

303
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,924
而且我也不信任你
And I don't trust you.

304
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,171
- 她怎么说?  - 你他妈觉得呢? 她不干
- What did she say?  - What the fuck do you think? She said no.

305
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,331
好吧 估计那就剩咱俩了 那么 就是墨西哥父子游
Cool. So I guess it's just us, then. A little father and son bonding trip to Mexico.

306
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,485
你逗我吧? 咱俩男的开车走? 像不像搞基奥运会?
Are you kidding? You and me alone in a van? It'll look like the pervert Olympics.

307
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,882
不行 绝对不行 不行 我们需要个女的
No way. Absolutely not. No, we need a girl.

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,687
除非你能想到某个人跟我们明天出发 不然我就完蛋了
And unless you can think of someone that can leave town tomorrow, I'm fucked.

309
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,491
我认识个女的
I know a girl.

310
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,288
我不明白 有我什么好处?
I don't get it. What's in it for me?

311
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,690
我觉得有住处 有热饭 已经挺好的了
I'm thinking a roof over your head, some actual hot food. That'd be good enough.

312
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,166
我要一千块
I'm thinking 1000.

313
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,682
一千就一千 不过就这么多了
Fine, 1000 bucks, but that's it.

314
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,130
好的 而且如果我们被抓了我就说是你贩毒而且还绑架了我 好吧?
Great. And if we get caught I'll say you drugged and kidnapped me. Cool?

315
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,249
行 成交 不过就这些了
Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, that's fine. But that's it.

316
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,802
肯尼 来认识一下你的新妹妹
Kenny, meet your new sister.

317

- Come on. We gotta clean you up.  - What's wrong with you?

320
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,331
- 别这么说话  - 我并没想让她不舒服
- Don't say that.  - I didn't mean to make her uncomfortable.

325
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,043
我要给你宣布几项...
I wanted to go over a couple of minor policy changes...

326
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,050
- 俱乐部制度的新变化  - 例如?
- that we have here at the club.  - Like what?

327
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,562
例如 要你开始向客户卖身
Like, I want you to start having sex with the customers for money.

328
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,569
什么? 那是违法的 托德
What? That's totally illegal, Todd.

329
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,290
行了 那你还能做什么?
Come on, what are you gonna do?

330
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,088
我要跟街对面的那些婊子们竞争
I gotta stay competitive with those fuckers who opened up across the street.

331
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,725
你是说苹果专卖店么?
You mean the Apple Store?

That's it. I can't do it. I quit.

335
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,886
你听到那个好消息了吗?
Did you hear the good news?

336
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,367
现在我们可以卖身赚钱了
Now we get to fuck the customers for money.

"I get up every morning at 5:30 and commute for an hour to a bullshit job...

360
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,771
老板整天盼着我俯首帖耳...
where my boss expects me to kiss his balls all day...

so I can afford to keep my ungrateful kids decked out in Dora the Explorer shit...

362

供起我老婆撅着大屁股在自助租碟机前找片...
and my wife up to her fat ass in self-help videos...

363
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,285

口感增色不少
Adds that real special crunch.

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,048
房车使用手册

449
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,048
你看那玩意干什么?

452
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,523
"有意思" 你觉得这就是有意思 是吗?
"It's fun." That's your idea of fun, huh?

453
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,371
我有个关于90年代的录像机使用手册 你真该看看
I have a VCR manual from the '90s you should check out.

454

You are not my wife! And we are not a family!

469

明白吗? 这是项工作!
All right? This is a job!

470
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,005
我们不是和谐有爱的布雷迪家庭!
We are not the Brady Bunch!

471

我是主公你们都是我的忠臣!

Whoo! Did you see that? I told you this RV would work! We totally blend.

恭喜 你已经成功潜入墨西哥了

这家伙好大了 我是说 太大太豪华了
This thing is ginormous. I mean, it's ridiculous.

491

你已到达目的地
You have arrived at your destination.

492
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,483
导航现在结束
The route guidance is now finished.

493
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,682
你确定这些家伙是在等你吗?
Are you sure these guys are expecting you?

494
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,604
萝丝 没事的 知道吗?
Rose, we're good. All right?

Hey, I think that guy was in La Bamba.

499
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,124
那是在踢球吗? 真有意思 足球
Is that a little football over there? That's fun. Soccer.

500
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,845
有孩子是好事 我这么觉得
Kids are a good sign, I guess.

501
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,641
- 你们好  - 这是什么地方?

Will you look at this? It's a cute little drug-dealing community.

503
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,804
他们估计有西班牙油条卖
They probably sell churros.

504

你放松点好吗?
Will you relax?

505

You are the White Gringo with the haircut of a donkey.

Yeah. I know, I can't believe it either.

524
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,920
你们看见他的眼睛了吗? 上帝啊
Do you see his eye? Jesus Christ.

525
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,689
来! 取货了

很好 开始吧 好吧
That's great. Let's do it. Okay.

528
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,607
好了 大个子 大家说的那点大麻在哪?
All right, big fella, where's the smidge of weed everyone's talking about?

529
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,085
- 这可不止一点  - 哦 天呐
- This is a little more than a smidge.  - Oh, dear.

530
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,964
冷静点 好吗? 没事的
Calm down. Okay? We're gonna be fine.

531
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,571
哦 是啊 对 没事
Oh, yeah, sure, right.

532
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,684
我们只是要用房车拉着两吨大麻...
All we're doing is smuggling two metric tons of marijuana...

533
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,208
穿越国境而已!
across an international border in a rented motor home!

534
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,451
我也觉得这没什么大不了! 呃!
I don't see what could possibly go wrong! Ugh!

535
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,850
好吧 呃 我要打个电话
Okay, uh, I'm gonna make a phone call real quick.

536
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,607
肯尼 盯着点
Kenny, watch the pot.

537
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,921
这地方真不错
It's a great place.

538
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,851
去你的
Fuck you.

539
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,445
嘿 伙计
Hey. Buddy.

540
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,241
我告诉你一个小秘密 我是个很棒的雕塑家
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. I'm like an amazing sculptor.

541
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,006
- 你说什么呢?  - 我都忙了一天了
- What are you talking about?  - I've been working all day.

542
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,609
我在雕刻一条正在我老二下挣扎的虎鲸 因为我把我的老二戳进它的喷气孔深处了
It's an orca and he's breaching and I'm balls deep in his blow hole.

543
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,847
你他妈的在说什么啊?
What the fuck?

544
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,087
嗯哦 出什么问题了?
Uh-oh, something wrong?

545
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,891
是啊! 出问题了 出了很大很大的问题 好吧?
Yeah! Something's wrong. Something's very, very wrong. Okay?

546
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,371
你说是"一点货"
You said "a smidge of pot."

547
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,130
这可不是一点
This is not a smidge.

548
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,770
- 比一点多那么一点点? 不是吗?  - 不是
- Smidge and a half? No?  - No.

549
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,129
你让我运的大麻都够把他妈的威利・尼尔森毒死了 伙计!
You got me moving enough weed to kill Willie-fucking-Nelson, man!

550
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,324
是吗? 咱们说话的时候他们正他妈的排成人墙往房车里装呢!
Okay? They're using a goddamn bucket brigade to put it on the RV as we speak!

551
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,201
你进去跟他们说你要帮巴勃罗・察孔取货 他们只是说:
You walked in, told them you were picking up for Pablo Chacon and they were like:

552
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,170
- "没问题!"  - 等等
- "No problem!"  - Wait a minute.

553
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,403
你那么惊讶是怎么回事? 你跟他们说了我们要来的 对吧?
Why do you sound surprised? You told them we were coming, right?

554
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,607
放松!
Relax!

555
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,810
一切都会没事的 伙计 我贿赂了边境一号出口的人
Everything's gonna be fine, man. I greased the guard in lane one at the border.

556
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,731
他会放你们过境的 我们明天早晨见!
He'll let you breeze through, I'll see you in the morning!

557
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,251
我会给你买早午餐吃
I'll even buy you brunch.

558
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,284
我能说点别的了吗?
Can I change the subject for a second?

559
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,283
等你回来看到这雕塑...
If you get back and see the sculpture...

560
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,603
你看着它肯定会想 "哇 蛋蛋可真大"
you're gonna look at it and be like, "Whoa, those balls are huge."

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,445
只有蛋蛋是不符合解剖学标准的尺寸
The balls are the only part that are not anatomically correct.

562
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,130
其他部分都是完美的
Everything else is perfect.

563
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,444
只是我为了赞颂我的性能力而把蛋蛋雕得大了一点
But I made the balls a little larger as a tribute to my manhood.

564
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,761
操 布莱德
Fuck you, Brad.

565
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,888
这才是我爱的戴维!
That's the David I love!

566
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,611
来操吧! 来吧
Fuck you too! Come on, let's do this!

567
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,603
哈哈! 我们很快就见面了 我的小骡子!
Ha, ha! I'll see you soon, my little drug mule!

568
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,250
哼啊! 哼啊! 哼啊...
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw...

569
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,721
该死!
Shit!

570
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,721
哦 不用了 谢谢 我不想吃
Oh, no. Thank you. I'm good.

571
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,845
你拒绝我妈妈的礼物?
You reject my mother's gift?

572
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,931
我是说 我不知道该怎么说
I mean, I don't know whether I'd put it in those terms.

573
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,122
- 闭嘴然后接着水果  - 对 拿着
- Shut up and take the fruit.  - Right. Got it.

574
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,446
谢谢 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

575
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,489
- 你想害死我们吗?  - 什么?
- You wanna get us killed?  - What?

576
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,401
阿弥陀佛
Namaste.

577
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,881
喔
Whoa.

578
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,287
我觉得史诺普・道格肯定爱死这个冰箱了
I think Snoop Dogg would fuck this fridge.

579
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,851
至少可以保鲜
At least it keeps it fresh.

580
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,441
哦 只要没有人上车...
Well, as long as no one sets foot inside the RV...

581
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,484
从车窗外往里瞧 或者给我们过地磅...
looks through a window, or weighs us...

582
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,171
- 我们应该就没事  - 我们会没事的
- we should be pretty good.  - We'll be fine.

583
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,250
我们完蛋了
We're totally fucked.

584
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,369
啊 该死 这是他妈的什么?
Aw, shit. What the hell is this?

585
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,080
- 像什么啊? 是个条子 天才  - 冷静点
- What's it look like? It's a cop, genius.  - Be cool.

586
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,887
- 记住我们是米勒一家 好的  - 好的 好的
- Remember we're the Millers. Okay.  - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

587
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,487
- 哦 你好 警官  - 你好
- Oh. Buenos dias, officer.  - Hola.

588
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,445
如果违反了你们的交通法规我很抱歉
I'm sorry if we were violating some of your traffic laws.

589
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,883
是这样 我们家参加了一项路上游戏...
You see, the family and I got into a heated game of road bingo and...

590
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,122
- 别废话了  - 什么?
- Cut the shit.  - I'm sorry?

591
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,846
我看见你从巴勃罗・察孔的营地出来
I saw you leaving Pablo Chacon's compound.

592
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,084
我们都知道如果我搜你的车 会搜出什么来
And we both know if I search your mobile home, what I'd find.

593
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,282
那会蹲很久监狱的
Much prison time for such things.

594
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,811
是 是
Yeah. Yeah.

595
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,242
不过我没心情抓人...
But I don't feel like arresting anybody...

596
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,762
所以我直接受点贿然后就走了
so I'll just simply take my bribe and I'll be on my way.

597
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,083
哦 好啊 哈哈

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,925
太多了 嗯 我们现在身上没有那么多现金
It's a lot. Um, we don't have that sort of cash on us right now.

602
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,003
是这样 那可就麻烦了
You see, that's gonna be a problem.

603
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,366
是 是啊
Yeah, yeah.

Come on. Will you be a team player?

610
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,246
- 你他妈是耍我呢吗?  - 你别自私了好吗?
- Are you fucking kidding me?  - Will you stop being selfish?

611
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,761
等等 等等 女士 不要太紧张

What do you mean no? What's wrong?

633
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,605
- 哦 我不是基佬  - 你确定吗?
- Well, I'm not gay.  - Are you sure?

634
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,682
我是说 你没试过怎么会知道
I mean, you never really know until you know.

635
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,287
- 不 我不是基佬  - 好吧 这样 冷静一下
- No. I'm not gay.  - Okay. All right. Calm down.

636
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,485
是这样 你现在这种搞基恐惧症 恰恰说明你是基佬
Look, this gay panic situation you're having now, it's coming off a little homophobic.

637
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,401
什么 因为我不想给他吹箫?
What, because I don't want a penis in my mouth?

638
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,046
完全正确 基佬都这样
Exactly. It's exactly what homophobic means.

639
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,847
听着 你过去 你就假装那是个妹子的老二
Look, you go over there, you just, you know, you pretend it's a girl's dick.

640
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,605
任何一个你想要的妹子的老二
Any girl's dick you want.

641
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,565
- 我觉得这逻辑上说不通啊  - 来 听我的
- I'm not sure I agree with that logic.  - Look, listen to me.

642
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,171
- 他在给他讲什么?  - 不知道
- What is he saying to him?  - I have no idea.

643
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,402
好吗? 就听我的 好吗?
All right? Just listen to me. All right?

644
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,726
上吧 伙计
Come on, man.

645
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,321
这是你成为英雄的机会
This is your chance to be the hero.

646
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,847
- 我不明白 戴维  - 你这么做不是为了我
- I don't know, David.  - Don't do it for me.

647
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,442
也不是为了你自己 而是为了她们两个姑娘 为了萝丝和凯茜
Don't even do it for you. Do it for the girls. For Rose and Casey.

648
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,689
相信我 因为她们在墨西哥的监狱里两天都坚持不了
Because, believe me, they won't last two days in a Mexican prison.

649
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,844
- 好吧  - 好孩子!
- Okay.  - Attaboy!

650
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,128
- 为了她们两个姑娘  - 我为你骄傲
- I'll do it for the girls.  - I'm proud of you.

651
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,088
嘿 怎么回事?
Hey. What's going on?

652
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,851
要么来个人给我吹箫 要么给我一千比索(相当于77美金)
Somebody sucking my dick, or am I getting 1000 pesos?

653
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,610
不 他会给你...
No, he's gonna w...

654
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,806
- "比索"? 你怎么不早说?  - 嗯 一千
- "Pesos"? Why didn't you say so?  - Mm-hm. A thousand.

655
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,083
哦 哦 那就相当于 大概 80美元吧?
Oh, well, that's like, what, 80 bucks American?

656
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,601
给 给你 一百块 别找了
Here. Here you go. A hundred. Keep the change.

657
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,049
真不敢相信你居然想给那个家伙吹箫 行了 我们走
Can't believe you were gonna suck that guy's dick. Come on, let's go.

658
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,688
所有车辆 请按照指定路线缓慢通行...
All vehicles, please proceed slowly in assigned lanes...

659
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,649
并准备接受检查
and prepare for vehicle inspection.

660
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,011
好了 我们来了 就是这了
Okay, here we go. This is it.

661
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,645
肯尼 去拿帽子 快
Kenny, grab the hats. Hurry.

662
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,646
你说守卫会直接让我们过去的
You said the guard was just gonna wave us through.

663
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,242
会的 不过我们还是不能让别人觉得太可疑
He will. But let's look the part so the others don't get suspicious.

664
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,730
这家伙想搞什么鬼?
What the fuck does this guy want?

665
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,649
不知道 不过他在鸣笛示意
I don't know. But he's honking.

666
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,920
- 嗨!  - 别理他
- Hi!  - Just ignore them.

667
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,689
好吧 他真的在鸣笛而且够引人注目了 我觉得他只是想打个招呼
Okay, he's really honking and it's making a huge scene. I think he just wants to say hi.

668
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,450
哦 天呐 我不想打招呼
Oh, my God. I don't wanna say hi.

669
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,927
他们在招手 如果我们也招手 他就消停了
They're just waving. If we just wave, he'll stop.

670
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,849
好吧 我来打招呼 好吧
Fine. I'll say hi. Fine.

671
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,687
- 嗨!  - 嗨!
- Hi!  - Hi!

672
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,969
你们好! 你们家的房车不错啊 伙计
Howdy-doody! Quite a rig you got there, amigo.

673
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,290
你们的也不错
That is quite a rig you guys have there too.

674
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,960
哦 非常感谢 我们很喜欢她
Well, thank you very kindly. We do love her.

675
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,323
现在我们已经不像我女儿小时候那样经常开着她出去玩了
We don't take her out as often as we used to when our girl was small.

676
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,288
腾出时间全家一起旅行很不易 但时间挤挤还是有的 对吧?
It can be such a bear to carve out quality family time but you gotta do it, don't you?

677
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,608
对 我们是戴维・米勒和萝丝・米勒
Yeah, David and Rose Miller here.

678
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,926
哦
Oh.

679
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,806

This is my daughter, Casey, right here. And my son, Kenny.

680
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,371
- 真帅  - 很高兴认识你们
- How handsome.  - Pleased to make your acquaintance.

681
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,245
我叫唐・菲茨杰拉德 我的内人 伊迪斯...
Don Fitzgerald, my smoldering wife, Edith...

682
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,249
还有我们的女儿 打个招呼 梅丽莎
and our daughter. Say hi, Melissa.

683
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,120

684
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,686
先生 先生 请靠前
Sir. Sir, please pull forward.

685
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,206
车里有大麻
I got a joint here.

686
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,322
- 关闭一号通道  - 是药用的
- Shut down lane one.  - It's medicinal.

687
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,005
- 他说什么?  - 他带着大麻
- What'd he say?  - He has a joint.

688
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,645
那么点就被抓了?
That's it?

689
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,887
- 藏起来  - 好吧
- Hide it.  - Okay.

690
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,844
快藏好! 哦 天呐!
Get rid of it! Oh, my God!

691
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,485
该死的
Holy shit.

692
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,843
- 太险了  - 你有个小宝宝!
- Oh, that was so close.  - You have a baby!

693
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,011
- 哦 我喜欢小宝宝!  - 哦
- Oh, I love babies!  - Oh.
681

694
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,771
哦 快看那个可爱的小人儿!
Oh, look at that gorgeous little bundle of joy!

695
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,128
这个美丽的小宝贝叫什么名字?
What's that beautiful little baby's name?

696
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,043
- 他叫小...  - 勒布朗
- This is our little...  - LeBron.

697
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,010
- 他叫勒布朗  - 没错
- Name's LeBron.  - Yup.

698
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,487
- 哦  - 法国名儿
- Oh.  - A little French fella.

699
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,767
我们的小勒布朗
It's our little LeBron.

700
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,407
本来我不喜欢这个名字 但我太太超级心水那个...
I was against the name at first, but the missus has a real soft spot...

701
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,760
那个永远都不会像乔丹一样伟大还爱耍大牌的球星
for prima donnas who'll never be as good as Jordan.

702
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,405
我看不到他的小脸
I can't see the face.

703
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,005
- 我好想看看他的小脸  - 先生 请把车开到二车道
- I'm dying to see his face.  - Sir, pull forward to lane two.

704
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,489
- 该死! 都把帽子戴上  - 你得靠边停
- Oh, fuck! Okay, put on the hats.  - You gotta pull over.

705
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,081
- 就这样  - 好吧
- Here we go.  - Great.

706
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,331
- 天啊 我觉得自己像个白痴  - 就要这效果
- My God, I feel like a fucking idiot.  - That's the idea.

707
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,889
嘿 嘿 大家都微笑 听我指挥 明白吗?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Everybody smile and follow my lead, all right?

- But...  - Sir, is that actually necessary?

720
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,208
孩子们刚刚拉屎了 所以...

- I'll just put the baby down.  - We'll put the baby away.

726
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,923

It's okay, baby. It's just a puppy.

727
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,960
把它带走
Stand down.

728
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,042
没事了
All right. It's okay.

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,601
在我搜查汽车之前 有没有什么话想跟我说?
Before I search the vehicle, is there anything you wanna tell me about?

730
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,370
因为一旦门打开了...
Because after I open that door...

731
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,440
我就帮不了你们了
I can't help you.

732
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,722
最后的机会 我会把这辆车搜查得底朝天的
Last chance. I'm gonna search this vehicle top to bottom.

733
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,487
那好吧
All right.

734
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,681
有人逃跑!
We got runners!

735
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,684
有人逃跑!
We got runners!

736

Whoo! We did it!

742
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,002

Nicely done, Millers! Give it up! Very good job. Here you go.

743
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,806
萝丝! 耶! 戴维! 好样的!
Rose! Yeah! David! There you go!

744
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,483
我们现在都正式成为国际毒枭 别忘在你们的简历里写上一笔
We are all officially international drug smugglers. Add it to the resume.

745
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,524
哈哈 来首胜利小曲 怎么样?
Ha, ha. How about a little victory music, huh?

746
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,921
哦 不要这首
Oh, no, no, no.

747
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,407
- 别换 我喜欢这首歌  - 我也是
- Don't change it. I love this song.  - Me too.

748
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,126
什么? 这首歌流行的时候我都不喜欢听
What? I didn't even like this song when it was popular.

749
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,731
放松点嘛 戴维
Come on, loosen up, David.

750
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,407
# 请跟着小河走 #
# Please stick to the rivers #

751
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,762
# 你会来到曾经的那片湖 #
# And the lakes that you're used to #

752
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,047
别这样
Don't do this.

753
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,608
怎么回事? 这都不算一首胜利歌曲
What? This isn't even a good victory song.

754
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,842
停下来 你们别唱了
No, stop. We are not doing this.

755
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,169
太丢人了 停下
This is embarrassing. Stop.

756
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,726
# 来吧 #
# Ah, come on. #

757
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,009
# 昨天我看到了彩虹 经历了那么多风雨 #
# I seen a rainbow yesterday. But too many storms have come and gone #

758
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,407
# 它发出耀眼的光芒 照亮了我灰暗的生活 #
# Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray. Is it because my life is 10 shades of gray #

759
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,647
怎么回事?
What the fuck?

760
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,603
# 我希望自己告别灰暗 永远生活在阳光下 #
# I pray all 10 fade away Seldom praise him for the sunny days #

761
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,689
# 你说我太疯狂 世界太残酷 #
# You claim the insane. And name this place in time #

762
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,282
# 体制让你想犯罪 #
# For fallin' prey to crime, I swear. The system got you victim to your own mind #

763
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,484
# 梦想总是被摧毁 #
# Dreams are hopeless aspirations. In hopes of comin' true #

764
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,728
# 相信自己 命运在我手中 #
# Believe in yourself. The rest is up to me and #

765
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,651
# 不要随波逐流 #
# Don't go chasin' waterfalls #

766
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,286
- 哇!  - 哇 肯尼!
- Whoo!  - Whoo, yeah, Kenny!

767
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,050
你跟谁学的 唱得这么好?
Where did you learn to do that?

768
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,685
我才不管
Yeah, whatever.

769
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,847
察孔先生
Se?or Chacon.

770
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,529
没想到您会来
We were not expecting you.

771
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,645
我决定亲和美国佬一起来 以确保万无一失
I decided to bring the gringo myself to make sure everything goes as planned.

772
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,925
但是美国佬已经货运走了啊 先生
But the gringo has already left with the shipment, se?or.

773
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,281
哪个美国佬?
What gringo?

774
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,448
一个留着驴一样发型的美国佬
The gringo with the haircut of a donkey.

775
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,727
你说的是这个留着驴一样发型的美国佬吗?
You mean this gringo with the haircut of a donkey.

776
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,000
我让您失望了 先生
I have failed you, se?or.

777
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,726
如果再见到那个美国佬 你还能认出来吗?
If you saw this gringo again would you recognize him?

778
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,924
他和家人是开着一辆房车来的
He was driving an RV with his family.

779
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,691
上车
Get in the car.

780
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,688
哦 现在时速多少?
Oh, how fast are you going?

781
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,564
别紧张 我没超速 不会被警察拦下来的
Calm down, I'm going the speed limit. We won't get pulled over.

782
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,600
不 我是说像这样一辆装满货物的房车...
No, no. I mean, loaded down like this in a 15-ton vehicle...

783
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,161
爬10°的斜坡
going up a 10 percent grade.

784
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,890
你能不能用用脑子 戴维 我觉得你完全没考虑过这个
Just use your head, David. I don't think you think things through.

785
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,562
- 什么意思?  - 各部分应该合理分配负重
- What?  - Weight distribution loading and towing.

786
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,921
- 明白吗?  - 我知道
- See?  - Yeah, I do.

787
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,451
我早都计划好了
I thought this plan through.

788
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,881
- 一切都很顺利  - 哦 这下好了
- Seems to be working out.  - Oh, great.

789
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,485
哦 该死!
Oh, Shit!

790
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,524
搞什么 天啊...!
Seriously. God...!

791
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,088
这也是你计划之中的吗 戴维?
Was this part of your plan, David?

792
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,361
真该死
Damn it.

793
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,570
- 我们现在怎么办?  - 我不知...
- Wait, what are we gonna do now?  - I don't kno...

794
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,040
这里连信号都没有
I can't even get a signal.

795
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,491
我靠 这里真是前不着村后不着店
No shit. We're in the fucking middle of nowhere, dude.

796
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,370
哦 多谢 凯茜
Oh, gee, thank you, Casey.

797
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,166
谢谢你出色的办事能力 真是帮了大忙了
Thank you for your amazing problem solving skills. So helpful.

798
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,646
嘿 你要去哪?
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

799
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,287
我才不想在装满大麻的房车旁边傻站着
I'm not gonna stand on the side of the road next to an RV filled with pot.

800
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,806
我要去找人帮忙
I'm gonna try to find help.

801
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,163
- 去他的 我跟她一起去 再见  - 什么?
- Yeah, fuck this. I'm going with her. Bye.  - What?

802
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,006
- 等等我!  - 呃 太荒唐了!
- Wait up!  - Ugh. Ridiculous!

803
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,247
好吧 没关系 这主意不错 快去快回
Okay. Actually, that's fine. Good idea. Okay, hurry back though, please.

804
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,887
"一切我都计划好了" 是吗? 计划得不错 你根本没有计划
"Oh, I have a plan." Really? Good plan. You don't have any plans.

805
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,806
女人就是这样 对吧?
Women, am I right?

806
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,530
闭上臭嘴 肯尼
Shut the fuck up, Kenny.

807
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,401
他是个自大狂 我都快被弄疯了
And he's so smug. Ugh. He drives me crazy.

808
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,931
没错 他是个白痴
Well, yeah, he's an idiot.

809
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,487
不 他不白痴 其实他很聪明
No, he's not an idiot. He's actually kind of smart.

810
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,926
你干嘛替他说话?
Why are you defending him?

811
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,327
我没替他说话 我只是说...
I'm not defending him. I'm just saying that he...

812
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,286
你没看到我们落到什么田地了吗? 整个计划都愚蠢透顶
Have you seen where we are? This whole plan is so stupid.

813
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,646
哦 是吗?
Oh, really?

814
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,128
你计划的好 怎么沦落到露宿街头了?
What golden advice did you follow that ended with you on the streets?

815
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,648
我没有露宿街头 明白吗? 我寄住在朋友家
I don't live on the streets, okay? I crash with friends.

816
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,922
啊 好吧
Ah. Okay. I see.

817
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,885
那么说 戴维和肯尼找到你的时候 你正在四处蹭沙发睡
So you were kind of between couches when David and Kenny found you.

818
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,242
你要一直对我说教吗? 我要吐了
Are you gonna lecture me? Seriously, I'll puke.

819
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,169
我不是在对你说教
You know what, I'm not lecturing you.

820
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,011
那太好了 因为我不需要脱衣舞娘的建议
Okay, good. Because I don't need advice from a stripper.

821
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,240
知道吗 小混球? 我发誓...
All right, you know what you little shit? I swear...

822
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,771
这是搞什么?
What the hell is this?

823
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,970
看看这对可爱的搭便车的母女
Well, look at this cute little couple of hitchhikers.

824
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,571
我们是来帮助你们的
We're here to save your bacon.

825
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,246
快上来吧 姑娘们 哈哈!
Saddle up, little ladies. Ha-ha-ha!

826
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,442
嘿 怎么回事?
Hey. Hi, what's going on?

827
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,241
你们刚走他们就出现了 他们会把我们拖到修车厂的
They pulled up right after you guys left. They're gonna tow us to a mechanic. Okay?

828
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,363
但他们一直要抱大麻宝贝
They keeping asking to hold the weed baby.

829
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,921
好了 好了 淡定
All right, all right, calm down. Okay.

830
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,602
别紧张 好吗? 交给我来 看着
Just calm down, all right? I got this. Watch.

831
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,443
我要抱抱小宝贝
I'm holding that baby.

832
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,769
伊迪 你会抱到他的 但现在勒布朗该睡午觉了
Edie, you will, I promise, but it's nap time for LeBron.

833
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,041
大家都上车吧
Come on, guys, let's go.

834
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,409
快登上菲茨杰拉德特快列车 嘀嘀!
All aboard the Fitzgerald Express. Honk, honk!

835
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,080
- 哈哈哈  - 嘟嘟!
- Ha-ha-ha!  - Toot, toot!

836
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,566
看起来就像我们组装了一辆火车 但其实不是
It's like we're pretending it's a train, but it's not.

837
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,530
- 我被地精困住了  - 好的
- Surrounded by goblins.  - Okay.

838
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,966
哦 哦!
Oh, Oh, Oh!

839
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,766
等一下 好吗? 坚持住 别怕
One more sec, okay? Hold on, one second. Don't freak.

840
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,680
花样游泳运动员表演的时候...
When you're a synchronized swimmer...

841
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,081
不能用卫生巾 因为会被看到
you can't use a maxi pad, you can see it.

842
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,123
所以我朋友给我买了一盒卫生棉条
So my friend bought me a box of tampins.

843
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,846
跟你们说实话 刚开始塞进去真不容易
And I'll tell you, I had a hard time inserting those.

844
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,122
- 每次塞到一半就卡住了  - 嗯
- It would just stick halfway out.  - Mm-hm.

845
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,280
- 就像罗马焰火筒那样  - 嗯
- It was just like a Roman candle.  - Mm-hm.

846
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,569
就是这样我才发现自己的阴道很浅
And that is how I found out I was born with a shallow vagina.

847
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,570
- 真是个描写细腻的故事 伊迪  - 谢谢夸奖!
- That was such a detailed story, Edie.  - Thank you!

848
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,448
你应该去当脱口秀女主播 你知道吗? 你的表达很丰富
You gotta do a one-woman show. It's, like, so many layers, you know?

849
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,687
那你们有什么故事 戴维?
So, what's your story, David?

850
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,729
- 什么故事?  - 你们俩怎么认识的?
- What do you mean?  - How'd you two meet?

851
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,486
啊! 亲爱的 说说吧
Ah! Honey, tell her.

852
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,251
千万别落下任何浪漫的部分
And don't leave out any of the romantic parts.

853
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,931
好吧
Okay. All right.

854
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,248
我们在哪认识的 呃...
Where did we first meet. Um...

855
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,805
很美好
It's great.

856
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,641
那应该是萝丝刚搬到我住的公寓
Well, that would have been when Rose moved into my apartment building.

857
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,683
- 啊 是的  - 嗯
- Ah. That's right.  - Mm-hm.

858
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,443
我记得当时我通过门缝里看着她...
I remember watching her through the crack in my door as she was...

859
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,926
等一下 你偷看我?
Wait, you were spying on me?

860
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,885
亲爱的 虽然这个故事你已经听过几千遍了...
Now, hon, just because you've heard it a thousand times...

861
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,287
但你也不能打断我啊 要淑女
doesn't mean you should interrupt. Don't be rude.

862
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,002
好吧 继续
All right. Proceed.

863
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,410
好吧 我在偷看她
But, yeah, I was spying on her.

864
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,967
她一个人把行李从卡车上搬下来
She was unloading this U-Haul all by herself.

865
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,485
我想去帮忙 但又不想让她觉得我想泡她 因为...
I wanna go help her, but I don't wanna come off like I'm hitting on her, because...

866
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,924
因为我确实想泡她
you know, I'd like to hit on her maybe at some point.

867
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,282
那天...
And, uh...

868
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,884
她穿了一双海军蓝的查泰勒帆布鞋 和牛仔短裤
she was wearing these little navy blue Chuck Taylors and these jean shorts.

869
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,606
后面没有兜儿的那种款式
No pockets on the back, however that happened.

870
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,043
还有汤姆・威茨式的衬衫
And this, uh, Tom Waits T-shirt.

871
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,969
我心想 "哇 真酷"
I was like, "Oh, that's cool."

872
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,685
因为我喜欢汤姆・威茨
Because I love Tom Waits.

873
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,803
她看起来好美
And she just looked beautiful.

874
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,002
那种尖酸刻薄的美丽
If you're into that kind of mean, pretty thing.

875
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,607
然后...
So, anyway, uh...

876
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,488
她开始搬那些看起来很奇葩的大幅油画
she starts to bring up this really big weird-looking painting up the stairs.

877
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,526
我对自己说 "机会来了" 所以我开门出去...
And I'm like, "Okay, here's my shot." All right, so I go outside...

878
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,042
去帮她搬 至少我打算帮忙
and I help her with it. I'm trying to, at least.

879
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,969
她看着我大叫: "住手!"
She looks at me and goes: "Stop it!"

880
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,527
- 她冲着我大吼  - 是你先抢我的画的
- She just snaps at me.  - You started yanking at it.

881
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,683
接下来 拔河比赛就开始了...
Next thing you know, it's a tug of war...

882
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,087
拉过来 拉过去...
fulling it back and forth and out of nowhere...

883
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,443
他一拳正好洞穿画布
His fat fist goes right through the canvas.

884
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,803
- 那是个意外  - 我才不管! 反正你毁了我的画
- But it was an accident.  - Doesn't matter! You ruined my painting.

885
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,924
说实话 我觉得你应该好好感谢我
Okay. Honestly, I really think you should've thanked me.

886
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,202
因为那幅画太难看了
Yeah, because that painting was hideous.

887
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,331
那幅画是我祖父画的
My grandfather painted that painting.

888
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,330
它是这世界上我最宝贵的东西
And it was my favorite thing in the entire world.

889
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,690
于是我们在楼前像是开始比赛谁吼得大声一样
So we get in this screaming match in front of the whole building.

890
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,207
所有人都出来围观
And everybody comes out and is watching it.

891
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,608
从那时起 我们的梁子就结下了
I mean, from that moment, we hated each other.

892
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,285
天啊
Oh, man.

893
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,366
- 后来你们相爱了 哦!  - 嗯 我们相爱了
- And then you fell in love. Oh!  - Yeah. Then we fell in love.

894
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,610
- 哈哈哈!  - 嘿 出口到了
- Ha, ha!  - Hey, now. I think this is our exit.

895
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,280
戴维 能把手套箱里的地图递给我吗?
David, could you grab me the map out of the glove box?

896
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,131
没问题
Yes, sir.

897
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,611
- 哇 呃...  - 哇!
- Whoa. Whoa. Uh...  - Whoa!

898
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,770
哦 抱歉 哥们 吓到你们了
Oh, hey, sorry about that, buddy. Didn't mean to scare you there.

899
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,803
那是我的执勤用的手枪和警徽
That's just my service pistol and badge.

900
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,082
哦 警徽
Oh. Your badge.

901
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,126
- 你是警察吗?  - 不 不
- Are you a cop?  - No, no, no.

902
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,970
不是? 吓我一跳
No? Oh, God.

903
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,286
- 我是缉毒局的  - 哦
- I'm in the DEA.  - Oh.

904
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,130
我们家唐已经当了22年的探员了
Yeah, my Don has been an agent for the last 22 years.

905
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,004
之间有几次离职
On a bit of a hiatus at the moment.

906
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,090
他们不让他执勤 因为他人好欺负
They took him out of the field, he wasn't aggressive enough.

907
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,487
- 别说了  - 抱歉 不过他们不应该那样 唐
- That's enough.  - I'm sorry. It's not right, Don.

908
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,769
那些乳臭未干的臭小子连你一半都不如 那群小崽子们
None of those young guns aren't half the agent you are, those crumb-bums.

909
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,486
伊迪斯 你知道这样乱骂我是什么感受
Edith, you know how I feel about your cussing.

910
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,889
- 对不起 唐  - 伊迪斯就是有时候太热血了
- I'm sorry, Don.  - Edith can be a little hot-blooded at times.

911
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,890
- 我有1/8意大利血统 所以...  - 哦 没关系
- I'm 1/8 Italian, so...  - Oh. It's okay.

912
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,840
嘿 不好意思
Uh, hey, if you guys will excuse me.

913
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,849
- 要一块来吗?  - 你们去干嘛?
- Wanna join me?  - Where are you off to?

914
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,361
- 我们去看看孩子  - 去大便
- We're gonna check on the baby.  - Gonna take a dump.

915
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,927
- 看看孩子大便了吗  - 就是这个意思
- Check the baby's dumps.  - That's what we should say.

916
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,209
- 去看看勒八朗  - 勒布朗 他叫勒布朗
- Yeah, just go check on Lebanon.  - LeBron. His name's LeBron.

917
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,007
他老是闹肚子 腹泻什么的
He just has a terrible tummy. And it's just bad diarrhea stuff.

918
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,531
我们还有淀粉吗?
Do we still have cornstarch?

919
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,961
把淀粉抹在他屁股上
Yeah, there's cornstarch for his bottom.

920
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,844
- 家庭会议  - 好的
- Family meeting.  - Yep.

921
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,683
我正在抚摸我的小宝贝呢
I'm getting my hands on that baby.

922
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,322
他是缉毒警察? 你们有没有搞错?!
He's a narc? Are you fucking kidding me?!

923
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,002
别慌! 我们还没有露马脚 所以别紧张!
Stop panicking! We haven't done anything suspicious yet, so just relax!

924
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,648
是吗? 那他们要抱我们可爱的大麻宝贝怎么办?
Oh, really? Okay. What about when they wanna hold our precious weed baby?

925
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,171
把孩子给我 好吧?
Give me the baby, all right?

926
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,721
发生了什么 我都会担着的
I'll handle it if it happens. I'll totally take care of it.

927
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,481
现在我们要做的是想办法赶紧摆脱这家人
Right now, all we have to do is focus on getting away from that fucked up family.

928
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,490
该死 车为什么停了?
Oh, fuck. Why are we stopping?

929
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,162
他们听到了 该死 我们要进监狱了
They heard us. They heard us. Fuck, we're going to jail.

930
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,162
盖里汽车维修中心

931
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,042
不 不 是到车库了
No, no, no. We're just at the garage, okay?

932
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,210
大家都淡定 我们没做什么 会没事的
Everybody calm down. We haven't done anything. You're right.

933
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,927
我会以最快的速度搞定他 我们进去修好了车就走 好吗?
I'll ditch this guy real fast. We're gonna get in and get out of here, okay?

934
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,771
准备上场 好吗? 米勒一家的表演开始 走吧
Game face, okay? Miller time. Here we go.

935
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,684
附近还有别的修车店吗?
No other repair shops nearby?

936
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,010
老板是基督徒 并且周六晚饭后还营业的? 没有了 先生
Run by a Christian and open after supper on a Saturday night? No, sir.

937
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,887
该死 我可以把我们车的散热管给你们 你们就能上路了...
Ah, shoot. I'd give you the hose out of our rig and send you on your way...

938
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,764
但我们就走不了了
but we'd be stranded ourselves.

939
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,164
这样也好 还能让我们彼此增进了解
Besides, this way we can all get to know each other better.

940
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,727
- 怎么回事?  - 他们明早才能开门
- What's happening?  - They're closed till morning.

941
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,531
奥克拉荷马人怎么这样
Oklahoma.

942
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,287
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

943
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,086
你们今天可以和菲茨杰拉德一家一起露营了
You folks can make camp with the Fitzgeralds tonight.

944
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,330

I know a great spot. We'll set up the old tents and you can bed down in our Winni.

945
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,126
- 我会帮你们修修车  - 不用 不用
- I'll give you a hand with your gear.  - No, no, no.

946
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,368
没关系的 米勒一家人自己能行
That's okay. Millers carry their own weight.

947
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,564
- 我就喜欢你这点 戴维  - 肯尼 帮我把工具拿来?
- I knew I liked you, David.  - Kenny, you wanna get our shit?

948
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,601
- 嘿  - 这小宝贝一会肯定要开始哭闹了
- Hey.  - This will be a hoot.

949
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,289
我帮你照顾小家伙 这样你们就可以小睡一会了
I'll watch your little one so you and your man can have some snuggle time.

950
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,960
- 我不希望你们太...  - 我照顾小孩最拿手了
- I don't want you to have to...  - I am good with babies.

951
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,561
别这样! 哦 把孩子给我 把孩子给我!
Nonsense! Oh, give me the baby. Give me that baby!

952
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,047
该死!
Shit!

953
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,527
哦 天啊!

954
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,768
天啊!
Oh, my God!

955
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,649
天啊 为什么没流血?
Oh, my God. Why isn't there blood?!

956
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,730
哦 天啊! 怎么回事?
Oh, my God! What's happening?

957
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,931
真是谢谢你了 妈 现在我的健康课作业怎么办?
Thanks a lot, Mom. Now what am I supposed to use for my health project?

958
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,361
我会不及格的 然后必须上社区大学
I'm gonna fail and have to go to community college.

959
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,131
- 你毁了我的前途!  - 亲爱的
- My future's ruined!  - Honey.

960
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,323
菲茨杰拉德太太 你没事吧?
Mrs. Fitzgerald, are you all right?

961
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,842
- 那孩子是...?  - 哦 你不会以为勒布朗是...?
- That baby was...?  - Oh, did you think that LeBron was...?

962
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,886
- 哈哈哈  - 不 不 勒布朗是一袋草药
- Heh-heh-heh.  - No, no, no. LeBron was a sack of herbs.

963
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,684
牛至叶 罗勒草什么的
Oregano and basil mostly.

964
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,611
我们把它当做真的婴儿那么对待 这是孩子的暑假作业
We were just treating it like a real baby, you know, a summer project.

965
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,121
- 附加分  - 这让学生们了解到...
- Extra credit.  - It teaches the students that...

966
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,000
养孩子是最坑爹的事情
nothing ruins your life like children.

967
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,162
是的 还让孩子们明白 永远都要
Yeah. And it also sends that message to teens, just stick to the big A.

968
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,169
- 要走后门  - 你的意思是 要禁欲
- Yeah, anal.  - Abstinence, you meant.

969
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,243
- 这两种都不会有孩子  - 他弄混了
- Neither makes a baby.  - He confuses them.

970
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,850
总之很抱歉 伊迪 只是我们答应凯茜...
Anyway, I'm so sorry, Edie. We promised our Casey...

971
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,641
这个夏天我们会把它当做真正的婴儿 但我们做得有点过了
that we would treat it like a real baby all summer and we went too far.

972
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,927
习惯了就忘了 对不起
Got used to it. Sorry.

973
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,681
真是太不好意思了
And so I'm embarrassed, actually.

974
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,530
我觉得这样谁都会吓到的
I think that would scare anybody.

975
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,048
她很敏感的 她看电影"人鱼的童话"都哭到不行了
She's very emotional. You should have seen her at the end of Free Willy.

976
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,446
别说了 唐
Oh, stop it, Don.

977
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,291
我爱死那条鲸鱼了
I love that whale.

978
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,126
谁想参加篝火晚会?
Well, who loves campfire games?

979
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,123
哦 唐
Oh, Don.

980
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,081
女士们先生们 欢迎大家来到...
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to welcome you...

981
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,409
一年一度的菲茨杰拉德家族欢乐演唱会
to the annual singing Fitzgerald family jamboree.

982
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,368
我们的老朋友们没有来
Our usual guests couldn't be here this year.

983
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,207
- 他们是奥斯蒙德一家  - 哈哈!
- Uh, they're called the Osmond family.  - Ha-ha-ha!

984
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,204
但是很高兴今年我们请到了米勒一家人
But in their place this year we have the very talented and wonderful Miller family.

985
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,801
先来一首菲茨杰拉德家族的代表作
Let's get this party started with a Fitzgerald family favorite.

986
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,244
# 烈日下辛苦劳作 #
# Breakin' rocks in the hot sun #

987
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:39,760
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

988
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,251
# 法网恢恢 #
# It always does. #

989
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,728
# 我曾想偷点钱 因为我身无分文 #
# I needed to steal some money 'cause I had none #

990
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,167
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

991
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,407
下面米勒一家合唱
Now just the Millers.

992
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,042
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

993
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,722
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

994
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,685
你要想象一下自己犯了重罪 正要被送往监狱...
I want you to imagine you committed a felony, you've been tried and sent to prison...

995
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,561
你站在烈日下挥舞着锤子在砸石头...
and you're standing out in the sun breaking up rocks with a sledgehammer. And...

996
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,644
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

997
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,650
# 我曾想做点坏事 但没有得逞 #
# I fought the law and the law won #

998
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,719

Great choice.

1001
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,362
- 好了 孩子们  - 唱的真不错
- Great, kids.  - Well, that was an A for effort.

1002
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,166
- 哇! 我掌握了!  - 太好了
- Whoo! I got the spirit!  - That's great.

1003
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,600
是小鸟 是飞机
It's a bird, it's a plane.

锤齿鲨

1007
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,602
等到他们都睡着了 我们就溜进帐篷 怎么样?
We wait until they fall asleep and then we sneak into their tent, all right?

1008
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,723
割断他们的脖子
Mm. Cut their throats.

1009
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,369
- 什么?  - 怎么了?

- What the fuck's wrong with you?  - Nothing.

1012
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,242
我没要那么做 我以为你要那么做才说的
I wasn't saying to do that. I didn't say that. I thought you were gonna say it.

1013
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,841
你以为我要说"割断他们的喉咙"?
You thought I was gonna say "cut their throats"?

1014
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,681
你以为我是黑社会老大吗? 饶了我吧
Who do you think I am, Scarface? Give me a break.

1018
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,729
我要说的是: 我们溜进帐篷 偷了唐的钥匙...
What I was gonna say: We sneak into the tent, steal Don's keys...

1019
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,686
然后把房车开到修车厂 我就可以把他们的散热管换走
then we take the RV back to the shop and I can swap out their radiator hose for ours.

1020
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,928

非常简单
Plain and simple.

1024
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,484
基地组织! 基地组织!
AI Qaeda! AI Qaeda!

1025
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,640
是"非常简单"
It was "plain and simple."

我不会画画...
I'm a terrible drawer, so...

好了 肯尼 开始吧
All right, Kenny, here we go.

1034
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,887
- 好好画  - 好的 这是一条线
- Draw your brains out.  - All right, that's a line.

1035
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,242
- 一条斜线 枪与玫瑰  - 像一条溪水
- A slash. Guns and Roses.  - Looks like a spring.

1036
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,529
这是啥? 是... 呃 快画 肯尼
What is that? That's a... Kenny, come on, draw something, buddy.

- Rocket. It's a rocket or...  - Is that a cucumber?

1039
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,046
这太愚蠢了
This is really stupid.

1040
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,886
这是幅下流画吧 肯尼? 我的答案是"下流画"
Is it a bad drawing, Kenny? My guess is "bad drawing."

1041
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,643
- 这是...  - 我知道了!是阴茎
- It's...  - Oh! A penis! A penis.

1042
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,249
是个大鸡鸡 那是蛋蛋
It's a big dick. Those are balls.

1043
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,649
这是一个黑色大鸡鸡!
It's a big black dick! It's a drawing. Black! It's a big black dick.

1044
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,887
是一个又大又黑的鸡鸡!
It's a big, big black cock!

1045
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,801
黑鸡坠落!
Black Cock Down!

1046
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,200
这是滑板
It's a skateboard.

1047
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,245
- 没错 是滑板  - 当然了 就是滑板
- It's a skateboard, great.  - A skateboard. Of course it is.

1048
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,364
- 是一个巨大的黑的滑板  - 我看出来了
- It's a big black skateboard.  - I see it.

1049
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,604
当然了 很明显 不过 它是朝上的... 它...
Of course. It's very clear. But, you see, it was up... There's...

1050
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,043
它的轮子 我没注意它是放在地上的 它...
Its wheels, so I didn't see it down on the ground, and then it...

1051
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,651
黑鸡坠落? 黑鸡坠落?
Black Cock Down? Black Cock Down?

1052
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,491
很棒 梅丽尔・斯特里普 演得不错
Nice job, Meryl Streep. Very subtle character work.

1053
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,682
他画成那样让我怎么猜
Not my fault that Kenny can't draw.

1054
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,564
别把把责任推给肯尼
Don't you pick on Kenny.

1055
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,161
那东西看起来一点都不像滑板
Nothing about that looked like a skateboard.

1056
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,204
别说他了 肯尼去哪了?
You leave him alone. Where the hell's Kenny?

1057
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,482
- 过来看  - 怎么了?
- You guys, come here.  - What?

1058
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,364
- 怎么了?  - 看看他俩
- What's going on?  - Look at these two.

1059
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,403
- 喔  - 呃
- Aww.  - Uh-oh.

1060
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,811
- 我猜我不擅长画画  - 不 你画的很好
- Guess I'm not the best drawer.  - No, you were great.

1061
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,048
- 我看出来那是个滑板了  - 是啊
- I knew that was a skateboard.  - Yeah.

1062
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,324
- 我不知道问题出在哪  - 不 我...
- I don't know where the confusion was.  - No, I... That...

1063
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,130

I, um, really like your family. They're, uh...

1065
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,881
- 他们很特别  - 其实他们不是我的家人 我是说...
- They're different.  - Well, they're not my family. I mean...

1066
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,570

- She wants him to kiss her.  - Absolutely.

1068
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,202
- 她真的想  - 有时候我觉得我是被收养的...
- She does, right?  - And sometimes I feel like I'm adopted...

1069
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,528
或者是外星人还是别的什么
or an alien, you know, or something.

1070
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,644
是的 我就是这个意思
Right. That's what I meant. Um...

1071
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,406
不过说真的 我肯定会收养你
But also, you know, I would totally adopt you.

1072
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,126
嗯...
You know, um...

1073
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,928
我不是想当你爸爸 我只是...
Not that I wanna be your daddy. I just, uh...

1074
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,607
- 他废话太多了  - 他不会停的
- He's talking too much.  - He won't shut up.

1075
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,326
晚安
Uh, well, good night.

1076
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,324
- 明天见  - 好的 呃...
- I'll see you.  - Okay. Um...

1077
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,961
见鬼的拥抱
Fucking hug.

1078
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,241

- Yeah?  - Uh, watch out for bears.

1081
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,407
你知道 熊总是神出鬼没的
Um, you know. Can't see them coming.

1082
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,286
贴心的提醒
Good tip.

1083
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,850
可怜的孩子 你应该去和他谈谈
That poor kid. Well, you should go talk to him.

1084
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,486
谁?
Who?

1085
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,321
我说你应该去... 那你觉得是谁?
I said you should go... Well, who do you think?

1086
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,403
我? 我该说什么?
Me? What the hell am I gonna say?

1087
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,329
给他讲讲男人应该怎么做
Talk to him about guy stuff.

1088
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,929
- 见鬼  - 这有什么难的 去就是了
- Jesus fucking Christ.  - Come on, how hard is it? Just go.

1091
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,649
好的
Well, good, good, good, good. All right.

1092
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,491
那...
So, um...

1093
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,524
我刚才看见你和梅丽萨了
I saw what just happened with you and Melissa.

1094
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,924
- 好吧  - 嗯...
- Oh.  - Um...

1095
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,802
亲一个女孩完全没什么可怕的
You know, you don't have to be scared to kiss a girl. Heh-heh.

1096
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,329
九个小时之前你差点给一个男的口交 这有什么好害羞的
I mean, you damn near sucked a guy's dick nine hours ago. What are you shy now for?

1097
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,644
一点都不好笑 戴维
That's not funny, David.

1098
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,130
不好意思
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1099
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,048
不该说这破笑话
It was a bad joke. Ahem.

1100
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,085
你想知道我在你那个年纪怎么克服
You wanna know something I used to do when I was your age...

1101
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,487
和女孩在一起的时候的紧张吗?
kept me from getting nervous around girls?

1102
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,443
- 想知道  - 我会数到三
- Yeah.  - I would just count to three.

1103
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,283
- 数到三?  - 没错
- Count to three?  - Yeah.

1104
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,571
- 这就是你所说的好建议? 数到三?  - 是的
- That's your big advice? Count to three?  - Yeah.

1105
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,970
如果你想亲一个女孩或者约她出去或者...
I mean, if you ever wanna kiss a girl or ask her to go out, or I mean...

1106
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,687
无论什么情况你感到害怕 只要数到三
Actually, if you get scared of anything, just do this: just count to three...

1107
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,251
然后放手去做
and then do it.

1108
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,762
因为时间太久 你会想太多然后把自己逼疯
Because if you take too long, you overthink it and you'll just drive yourself crazy.

1109
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,803
相信我 这会改变你的生活
Trust me, it'll change your life.

1110
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,924
我猜这很有用
I guess that makes sense.

1111
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,527
- 多谢  - 别客气
- Thanks.  - Yeah. No problem.

1112
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,122
如果你有任何...
And, you know, if you have any other questions...

1113
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,288
性启蒙方面或者...
about, like, the birds and the bees...

1114
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,171
该如何做之类的问题...
who puts what into where, any of that fun stuff...

1115
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,006
尽管问 好吗?
just don't hesitate to ask, okay?

1116
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,287
- 好的  - 好
- Okay.  - Okay.

1117
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,040
- 愉快的谈话  - 是啊 很愉快
- Good talk.  - Yeah, good talk.

1118
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,003
我的背
Oh, my back.

1119
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,927
- 太老了  - 是啊
- So old.  - Yeah.

1120
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,883
等等 我在外边放风 你进去看 就这么定了
Wait. You go in. I'll keep a lookout, okay? Good.

1121
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,721
去你的 这是你想出来的 你给我进去
Fuck you. This was your idea. You're going the fuck in there.

1122
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,570
干嘛吼我?
Why are you yelling at me?

1123
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,808
我没吼你
I am not yelling at you.

1124
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,446
好吧
Okay. Okay.

1125
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,560
看好了
Watch.

1126
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,531
本拉登!
Bin Laden!

1127
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,205
发生什么了? 是浣熊吗?
What's happening? Is it raccoons?

1128
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,641
天呐
God.

1129
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,690
你说的对 伊迪丝
You were right about them, Edith.

1130
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,644
- 不 不好意思  - 我可以解释的
- No. I'm so sorry.  - Let me explain.

1131
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,251
我们绝对可以解释清楚
This is completely explainable.

1132
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,721
- 这是个误会  - 我们不是故意的
- A misunderstanding.  - We didn't mean to do this.

1133
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,760
- 事先声明  - 好
- You just have to understand something.  - Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1134
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,442
以前我们从没和别的夫妻做过类似的事
We have never done anything like this with another couple before.

1135
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,651
嗯
Uh-huh.

1136
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,446
不是对你们有偏见 我们没那么古板
That's no judgment on you. We're no squares.

1137
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,802
- 我还买了按摩棒  - 没错
- I own a vibrator.  - That's right, she does.

1138
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,360
- 不错  - 刚开始我不喜欢它
- Awesome.  - I wasn't for it at first.

1139
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,450
因为这鬼东西是中国制造的...
The darn thing's made in China, for cripes' sake...

1140
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,362
但是结婚时间长了就想找点什么增添情趣
but when you've been married this long you look for anything to spice things up.

1141
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,406
当然 我们也讨论过现在这种情况
So, of course we've discussed a scenario like this.

1142
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,725
没错 而且今晚你说出那个又大又黑的"传宗接代工具"
Yes. And tonight when you brought up that big black "babymaker"...

1143
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,848
- 我们就明白了  - 一清二楚
- Well, we got it.  - Loud and clear.

1144
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,361
我们的按摩棒叫"乔・摩根"
Our vibrator is named "Joe Morgan".

1145
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,724
当然这都是你们玩剩下的
We were picking up what you were putting down.

1146
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,048
- 彼此彼此  - 有点意思
- Same page.  - Interesting.

1147
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,330
看到这样的情形我们很高兴 不过 在这样的夜晚...
We're very flattered by this, but right now, in the middle of the night...

1148
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,922
我感觉我们还没准备好 天呐 唐
I'm not sure I'm really ready for it. Aw, Don.

1149
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,447
明白了 完全明白了 没问题的
Got it. Totally understood. Not a problem.

1150
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,005
我们只是问问 所以...
We just had to ask. So...

1151
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,486
等等 我有个想法
Wait. I have an idea.

1152
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,008
好吧 也许今晚我可以向前一小步
Okay. Maybe I could take a baby step tonight.

1153
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,771
我的嘴属于我们的婚姻
I mean, my mouth is for my marriage.

1154
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,924
但是我之前从没摸过别的女人
But I've never touched another woman before.

1155
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,328
我完全没有意见
I would be okay with that. Yeah.

1156
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,087
好极了
Oh, great.

1157
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,200
萝丝?
Rose?

1158
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,487
- 开始吧  - 好吧 我先坐下
- There you go.  - Okay. All right, I'm sitting.

1159
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,171
- 你没问题吧?  - 戴维
- Are you okay?  - David.

1160
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,370
- 母亲和母亲之间 没问题吧  - "母亲" 没问题
- Mother to mother, is this okay with you?  - Yes. "Mother." Yes.

1161
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,881
- 你确定?  - 开始吧
- Are you sure?  - Let's get this mother started.

1162
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,521
- 可以吗? 好的  - 哈哈哈
- Shall we? Okay.  - Ha-ha-ha!

1163
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,764
- 唐 你在看吗?  - 我很好
- Okay, Don, are you watching?  - I'm good.

1164
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,563
好吧
Okay. Uh, wow.

1165
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,411
我的心快要跳出来了
My heart's pounding so fast in my chest.

1166
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,251
- 啊 我们这是要出轨啦  - 是吗?
- Ahem. So I guess we're swinging.  - Hmm? Oh, yeah.

1167
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,283
啊 哦
Ooh. Ha, ha.

1168
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,925
久等了
Sorry that I'm taking so long.

1169
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,202
你好啊
Hello. Ha-ha-ha!

1170
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,889
我会很快的 来啦
Okay, I'm just gonna do it real fast. There we go.

1171
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,011
- 摸到了  - 就是这样
- There they are.  - There they are.

1172
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,488
- 哇!  - 你做到了
- Wow! Wow!  - It's happening. This is happening.

1173
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,563
唐 你在看吗? 我真的摸到了
Don, are you looking at this? I'm touching her boobs.

1174
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,008
- 这简直是个奇迹  - 确实是
- This is a miracle.  - Okey-doke.

1175
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,483
- 你想感受下我的吗?  - 我觉得今晚已经足够了
- Would you like to feel my breasts?  - I think that's enough for tonight.

1176
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,489
- 你说的对  - 别太贪心
- You're right.  - Don't give away the farm.

1177
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,444
- 精疲力尽了?  - 应该慢慢来
- A little roughhouse?  - We should wait.

1178
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,408
- 你们没有问题吗?  - 没问题
- Are you okay down there?  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1179
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,011
玩得开心点 年轻人
Have fun tonight, kids.

1180
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,285
- 太棒了  - 我再也不想洗手了
- Awesome.  - I'm never gonna wash these hands.

1181
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,845
姆啊, 姆啊, 姆啊!
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

1182
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,640
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

1183
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,080
- 晚安 今晚很棒  - 好的 拜拜
- Good night. That was great.  - Okay, bye, guys.

1184
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,202
很好 现在怎么办 小天才?
Great. What now, genius?

1185
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,408
- 你说... 怎么?  - 我不知道
- Tell me... What?  - Oh, Oh, oh. I don't know.

1186
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,090
刚才在里面他干了我的耳朵
I just got earfucked in a tent.

1187
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,050
要是让她给你指交一下 也许钥匙就到手了
If you let her finger bang you they would have given us the keys.

1188
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,965
是吗? 你怎么不进去给唐口交...
Oh, really? Why don't you go suck Don's dick for them...

1189
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,329
这样你就能拿到钥匙了? 他明显很喜欢你那对耳垂
and then you get the keys? He was certainly loving on those earlobes.

1190
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,882
首先 和你不同 我只会为我爱的男人口交 好吗?
Okay, look. First, unlike you, I only suck a man's dick if I'm in love, okay?

1191
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,724
这就是我做人的原则
That's kind of a personal rule I have.

1192
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,167
- 第二... 第二...  - 第二是什么?
- Yeah, and secondly... And secondly...  - What?

1193
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,289
没有第二 我忘了刚才想说什么了
I don't have a second one. I don't know where I was going with that.

1194
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,329
蠢货
Fucking idiot.

1195
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,883
我想到了一个
Oh, I thought of one. I got one.

1196
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,048
乔・摩根来啦
Here comes Joe Morgan up to the plate.

1197
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,811
哦 唐
Oh, Don.

1198
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,481
怎么了?
Okay, what?

1199
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,891
什么? 什么意思?
What? What do you mean?

1200
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,445
你想谈谈这件事...
I mean do you wanna talk about it...

1201
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,405
还是一直无精打采好像有谁踢了你的下体
or mope around like someone kicked you in the vagina?

1202
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,323
好吧
Okay. Um...

1203
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,568
我从没有...
Well, I've never really like...

1204
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,922
做过爱 令人震惊
Had sex before. Shocker.

1205
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,650
亲过女孩
Kissed a girl before.

1206
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,608
等等 真的? 我记得你说你18岁了
Wait, what? I thought you said you were like 18.

1207
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,401
- 好吧 还是别提了  - 好吧 等等
- Okay, you know what, forget it.  - Okay, okay, wait. Okay.

1208
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,604
过来 坐下 不用这么激动
Come on. Sit down. Don't need to be so dramatic.

1209
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,411
你没亲过女孩这没什么
Look, it's okay that you haven't kissed a girl.

1210
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,807
我确定会有女孩...
I'm sure there are some girls...

1211
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,764
我没见过的女孩...
who I've never met...

1212
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,567
想找你这样没经验的小可爱
that find inexperience kind of sweet.

1213
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,163
我才不想当那没经验让人亲都不想亲的小可爱
I don't wanna be a sweet, inexperienced guy who's never been worth kissing.

1214
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,648
我想变成能迷倒女孩然后亲吻她的人
I wanna be the guy who grabs a girl and kisses her. You know?

1215
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,445
好吧 我先声明
Okay, let me make one thing clear.

1216
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,689
这不是那种女生亲吻男生
This isn't one of those bullshit moments where the girl kisses the boy...

1217
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,884
然后意识到爱上了他了的情景 明白了吗?
and realizes she's been in love with him this entire time, okay?

1218
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,848
你是我的假弟弟而且你很可爱
You're my fake brother and you're a sweet kid...

1219
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,560
这是为了让你能把梅丽萨追回来
so this is for you to bring back to Melissa.

1220
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,888
- 什么?  - 我要亲你 笨蛋
- What is?  - I'm gonna kiss you, dingus.

1221
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,245
哦
Oh.

1222
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,491
- 你在干嘛? 闭上眼睛  - 好吧 不好意思
- What are you doing? Shut your eyes.  - Okay, sorry. Right.

1223
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,927
这样很奇怪 特别奇怪
That's weird. That's really weird.

1224
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,168
- 对不起  - 好了
- Sorry.  - All right. Ahem.

1225
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,962
不错 这次试试用舌头
That was okay. Now more tongue.

1226
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,401
用舌头 我可以的
Tongue. I can do that.

1227
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,287
太过了 太过了
Too much tongue. Too much tongue.

1228
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,088
是 太过了... 我的错 不好意思
Right. Too much... Yeah, that's my fault. My bad. Sorry.

1229
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,201
少用舌头
Less tongue.

1230
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,767
不错啊
That was good.

1231
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,884
这次 我希望你能让我窒息
All right, now this time, I want you to choke me a little bit.

1232
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,051
- 好的  - 这怎么回事?
- Uh, okay.  - Whoa. What's going on here?

1233
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,730
呃...
Uh, it's...

1234
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,844
- 不是你们看到的那样  - 真的?
- We're not doing what it looks like.  - Really?

1235
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,731
看起来像是凯西在教你如何亲吻
It looks like Casey's teaching you how to kiss out of pity.

1236
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,081
恩
Mm-hm.

1237
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,851
好吧 那就是看起来的那样
Uh, well, then it is what it looks like, yeah.

1238
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,486
这样啊
Really.

1239
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,285
你教他什么了
What did you teach him?

1240
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,404
最基础的 他之前从没亲过女孩
The basics. He's never kissed a girl before.

1241
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,531
从来没有? 好吧 来试试
You haven't? Oh. Well, honey, show me.

1242
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,882
- 呃 你确定?  - 当然
- Uh, really?  - Yes.

1243
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,606
好吧 呃...
Okay. Uh...

1244
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,447
还不错啊
Oh. Not bad.

1245
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,005
挺好的
It's not bad.

1246
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,164
- 试试这个  - 好的
- Try this.  - Okay.

1247
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,441
过来
Come here.

1248
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,047
就是这样
There you go.

1249
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,203
感觉到了? 我怎么用舌头的?
You feel that? What I did with my tongue?

1250
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,169
- 是的 女士  - 让凯西看看你学到了什么
- Yes, ma'am.  - Show Casey what you just learned.

1251
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,410
瞧瞧这个
Look at that.

1252
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,681
哇! 不错!
Mm! Whoa!

1253
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,120
等等
Wait. Hold on.

1254
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,251
我给你和你第一个亲吻的女孩拍张照片
I wanna get a picture of you with the first girl you ever kissed. Here you go.

1255
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,965
- 好看点  - 好的
- Mm-hm. Make it good one.  - Good.

1256
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,090
萝丝 来一起 就是这样 拍下来
Rose. Get in there. There you go. Photobomb it.

1257
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,606
- 有进步 越来越棒了  - 好的
- This is getting better, it's getting better.  - Okay.

1258
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,125
真可爱
It's so cute.

1259
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,521
试着用手 很有乐趣哦
Use your hands. They got so much fun stuff to play with.

1260
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,290
你没用手
You're not using your hands.

1261
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,730
肯尼?
Kenny?

1262
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,281

1263
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,010
梅丽萨 等等
Melissa, wait.

1264
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,206

Fuck.

1265
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,324
有一半的可能她会喜欢的
You know, there's a 50-50 chance she'll be into it.

1266
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,443
红头发的女孩 她们不可理喻
Redhead. They're crazy.

1267
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,565
拿好你们的东西 肯尼 拿着我的行李 谢了
Grab your things, guys. Kenny, grab my stuff. Thanks.

1268
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,166
- 我们走  - 看起来你已经准备好了
- Here we go.  - Well, looks like you're ready to roll.

1269
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,006
盖瑞跟我说 他特别希望你们尽快把车取走
Gary called me first thing. He seemed real eager for y'all to come pick her up.

1270
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,845
- 好的 好的  - 看来就是这样
- Good. Good, good, good. Okay.  - Guess this is it, then.

1271
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,765
- 祝你好运 戴维  - 多谢了 唐 照顾好自己
- Good luck to you, David.  - Hey, thank you, Don. Take care, will you?

1272
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,481
等等 我希望昨天晚上的事...
Hey, yeah, listen, I would appreciate it if you kept what happened last night...

1273
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,967
关于中国制造按摩棒的事 只有你知我知
all that Chinese vibrator talk, between us.

1274
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,169
- 当然  - 如果我们教堂的那帮家伙知道了...
- Yeah.  - If folks at my church found out about that...

1275
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,927
当然了 不必多说 我会守口如瓶的
Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, no. I get it. Yeah. No, say no more. Mum's the word, okay?

1276
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,201
在你走之前...
Before you go running off...

1277
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,681
- 怎么?  - 尽管昨天晚上...
- Yeah?  - Well, last night notwithstanding...

1278
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,730
我和菲茨杰拉德夫人
things bedroom-wise between me and Mrs. Fitzgerald...

1279
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,963
- 床笫之间还是没那么激情  - 好吧
- haven't been a real five-alarm fire of late.  - Okay.

1280
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,607
现在我没那么多工作了 我们有时间重燃激情...
Now that I'm not working as much, we finally have a chance to light the flame again...

1281
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,684
- 就像擦着湿火柴  - 恩
- but our matches are wet.  - Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1282
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,083
- 如果你明白我的意思  - 我明白了
- If you catch my drift.  - I do, yeah.

1283
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,083
我明白 火柴就是指老二
Yeah, the matches are genitals. I get it.

1284
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,050
不 我是指我们之间的激情
No, I was talking about our passion.

1285
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,282
哦 不好意思 我...
Right. Sorry, sorry. Of course. That's the way...

1286
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,090
- 没关系  - 嗯
- That's okay. That's all right.  - Yeah.

1287
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,924
所以我们一直在想办法
So we've been looking for new ideas...

1288
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,084
她在网上看到了关于手指的某些东西
and she read on the internet about this finger thing...

1289
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,483
- 唐 你不用和我分享这些的  - 没关系 我愿意和你分享
- Don, you don't need to share that with me.  - No, no, it's okay. I want to.

1290
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,210
好吧 只要你舒服
Okay, as long as you're comfortable.

1291
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,925
- 我需要你的建议 -嗯
- I need your advice, David.  - Mm-hm.

1292
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,050
你和萝丝好像能在彼此的
You and Rose seem hotter for each other than a couple mice...

1293
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,282
关系中找到许多激情
having sexual congress in a wool sock.

1294
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,365
- 有吗?  - 是的
- We do?  - Yeah.

1295
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,330
你们看对方的眼神就像新婚夫妇
You're like newlyweds, the way you keep looking at each other.

1296
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,400
- 我们?  - 我只是想知道...
- We are?  - Yeah. I guess I just wanna know...

1297
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,521
这么多年在一个鱼洞里钓鱼如何能保持激情
what do you do to keep things exciting after years in the same fishing hole?

1298
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,842
- 嗯  - 你们的秘密是什么?
- Hmm.  - What's your secret?

1299
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,406
这样
Right.

1300
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,642
- 你说的鱼洞意思是...  - 女阴
- And by fishing hole you mean...  - Genitals.

1301
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,080
生殖器 这样
That's genitals. Okay. Um.

1302
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,369
我的秘密? 嗯...
Yeah, um, my secret? Uh...

1303
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,328
你知道我怎么做吗 唐?
Well, you know what I do, Don?

1304
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,126
我只是把萝丝想象成一个脱衣舞娘
I just treat Rose like she's a stripper.

1305
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,050
- 真的?  - 真的
- No kidding?  - No kidding.

1306
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,362
就好像她是下流的脱衣舞娘
Like she's a dirty, dirty stripper.

1307
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,124
这样啊
Okay. Heh-heh-heh.

1308
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,765
越下流越好
Dirtier the better. Heh.

1309
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,082
- 哈哈  - 注意脚下
- Heh, heh.  - Okay, watch your step.

1310
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,131
好神奇 激情就这么来了
It surprise... It sneaks up on you.

1311
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,726
大家都带好行李了?
Everyone got your bags?

1312
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,847
很抱歉梅丽萨没来和大家告别
Oh. I am so sorry that Melissa isn't here to say goodbye.

1313
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,681
她就是不肯从卧室出来
She just won't come out of that bedroom.

1314
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,610
昨晚之后她的胃就一直不舒服
You know, she's been sick to her tummy ever since last night.

1315
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,128
- 我想她可能吃坏了  - 请告诉她我真的很抱歉
- I think it was something that she ate.  - Just tell her I'm really sorry.

1316
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,651
- 没问题  - 唉
- Oh, sure.  - Oh.

1317
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,451
一定会的
Sure will.

1318
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,129
多可爱的孩子
Oh, so sweet, kids.

1319
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,402
你将永远是我的特殊情人
You'll always be my special lover.

1320
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,082
啊! 伊迪
Ow! Oh, Edie.

1321
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,520
拜拜!
Bye!

1322
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,564
- 美国生日快乐!  - 拜拜!
- Happy birthday, America!  - Bye!

1323
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,524
- 再见!  - 再见
- See ya, now!  - Bye-bye, now.

1324
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,564
- 谢谢  - 拜拜
- Thank you.  - Bye.

1325
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,560
我们出发吧 你们去房车那 我去拿钥匙
Let's get out of here. You guys, go to the RV. I'll get the keys from Skeeter.

1326
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,451
有人吗?
Hello?!

1327
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,809
布莱德 我正要给你打电话呢
Hey, Brad, I was just gonna call you.

1328
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,208
你在哪? 你现在应该回来了
Where are you? Thought you'd be here by now.

1329
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,805
我说了我今天就要
I told you I needed it today.

1330
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,442
我知道 但是我的车有点问题
No, I know that. No, we just had a little bit of engine trouble's all, okay?

1331
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,929
五分钟后我们就上路 几个小时以后到了
We're gonna be on the road in five minutes, at your front door in just a few hours, okay?

1332
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,809
现在没什么能阻止我了
Nothing stopping us now.

1333
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,685
这怎么了?
What the fuck?

1334
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,410
把电话给我
Hand me the phone.

1335
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,961
布莱德 先别挂
Uh, Brad, can you hold on for a sec?

1336
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,322
好吧 别冲动
All right, let's not do anything rash.

1337
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,206
- 我是戴维 你是谁?  - 巴勃罗・察孔
- I'm David, what's your name?  - Pablo Chacon.

1338
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,488
闭嘴 闭嘴
Shut the fuck up. Stop, stop.

1339
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,371
- 你好啊 布莱德  - 巴勃罗!
- Hola, Brad.  - Pablo!

1340
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,051
你派这个外行的傻子来偷我?
You send this amateur fuck-up to steal from me?

1341
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,931
听着 我不知道戴维跟你说了什么 有人吗?
Listen, I don't know what David told you... Hello?

1342
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,685
我还想跟他说声再见呢
I would have loved to say good-bye to him.

1343
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,927
巴勃罗・察孔
Pablo Chacon.

1344
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,809
原来真的有巴勃罗・察孔 而且我们偷了他的东西
Turns out there's a real Pablo Chacon and we stole from him.

1345
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,806
也许会有个好的结局 我猜
So this is probably gonna end well, I would imagine.

1346
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,007
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1347
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,567
慢慢来
No rush.

1348
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,489
我以为我们为巴勃罗・察孔偷毒品
I thought you said we were picking up drugs for Pablo Chacon.

1349
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,291
我也以为是 布莱德告诉我他就是巴勃罗・察孔
I thought we were. Brad told me he was Pablo Chacon.

1350
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,681
- 你为什么相信那个家伙?  - 我不相信 好吗?
- Why do you trust that guy?  - I don't, okay?

1351
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,167
你们能先停五分钟吗?
Can you guys stop bickering for five seconds?

1352
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,482
好吧 可他怎么找到我们的?
Okay, how did he even find us?

1353
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,130
- 不知道  - 我不知道
- We don't know.  - I don't know.

1354
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,566
用这个
With this.

1355
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,524
这不是发射器吗? 就好像...
Cool, is that a transmitter? That's like a...

1356
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,967
你把它放到了房车上? 在袋子里?
You put that in the RV, huh? In one of the bags?

1357
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,330
- 你怎么就没想到呢?  - 因为我不知道我在做什么!
- How could you not think of that?  - Because I don't know what I'm doing!

1358
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,807
- 难道你没看出来?  - 都闭嘴!
- Have you not figured that out?  - Silence!

1359
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,610
现在你们都要死了
You all die now.

1360
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,081
但是一家人一起死 很荣幸
But together as a family, with honor.

1361
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,203
可我们根本就不是个真的家庭 我根本就不认识他们
But we're not even a real family, okay? I don't even know these people.

1362
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,003
她说的对 完全正确 我们之间根本就没有关系
She's right. That's absolutely right. No, no. We're not related at all, any of us.

1363
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,525
不 我们只是朋友
No. We're just friends.

1364
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,569
- 不 不是  - 我们不是朋友!
- No, we're not...  - We are not friends!

1365
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,166
我只是个小毒贩
Look, I'm just a small-time fucking drug dealer.

1366
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,685
我只卖小包的毒品
I sell dime bags, all right?

1367
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,487
我这个女儿只是个无家可归的街头朋克
My daughter here is just a homeless gutter punk, all right?

1368
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,890
我儿子 只是个和我住在一栋楼里的二货 我们长的一点都不像!
And my son is just a fucking dork that lives in my building. We don't look alike!

1369
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,725
- 没有关系  - 一个处男 还有我的"妻子"?
- Not related.  - A virgin, okay? And my "wife"?

1370
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,969
她只是个廉价的脱衣舞娘罢了
I mean, she's just a cheap stripper.

1371
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,088
谢了 戴维 说得好
Hey, thanks, David. Nice.

1372
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,811
- 我们什么都不会做... -等等
- We will not do anything if...  - Wait, wait. Heh.

1373
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,850
穿紧身裤和凉鞋的那个 是脱衣舞娘?
In the capri pants and the sensible footwear, a stripper?

1374
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,206
没错
Yes.

1375
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,366
是的 我是...
That's right, I am...

1376
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,890
察孔先生
Mr. Chacon.

1377
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,927
请给我一个机会...
Just give me one chance...

1378
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:13,206
证明我活着比死了有价值
to prove to you that I'm worth way more alive than I am dead.

1379
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,220
# 甜蜜 #
# Sweet #

1380
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:25,940
# 感情 #
# Emotion #

1381
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,130
# 说些没人在意的话题 #
# Talk about things and nobody cares #

1382
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,007
# 穿些没人穿的火辣外衣 #

tuck it back there.

1635
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,962
哇 发生什么了?
Whoa. What's going on in here?

1636

We didn't know if you were dead in a ditch! Huh?

1642
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,040
你就不能打个电话? 什么的?

Or send one of those text messages you're always sending out?

1666
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,441
如果你认为我会为了肯尼的这点小伤丢掉五十万美元的话...
If you think I'm gonna lose half a million dollars because of Kenny's boo-boos...

你赚五十万才给我三万?
You are making $500,000 and you were only gonna pay me 30?

1672
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,041
你能拿三万? 我才一千?
You're getting 30 grand? I'm getting a thousand!

I believe we are, right now, because you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for us.

1680
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,641
你说得对
You're right about that.

1681

1703
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,605
- 你知道吗?  - 什么?

Yeah. You think we can go someplace private and talk?

1712
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,727

1752
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,369
不好意思 我心情有点糟...
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling kind of cry-ey and that...

1753
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,363
- 我得走了  - 别这样
- I'm just gonna go, okay?  - Come on, girl.

1754
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,881
- 是你给我发的短信 是你叫我来的  - 斯科蒂
- You texted me. You know what's up.  - Scottie.

1755
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,320
嘿!
Hey!

1756
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,646
把你的脏手拿开!
Get your hands off of her!

1757
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,171
快过来 凯西
Come here, Casey.

1758
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,204
你再敢动她一根手指头...
You put your hands on her again...

1759
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,085
我就把那个纹身从你的身上撕下来
I will rip that fucking tattoo right off of your chest.

1760
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,361
听见了吗?
You know what I'm saying?

1761
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,608
- 真的吗 贱人?  - 是的 贱人
- Oh, really, bitch?  - Yeah, bitch.

1762
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,883
干嘛要欺负女士们呢
You know what? Why don't you leave the girls alone, man.

1763
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,684
你有意见吗 扫把眉?
What are you gonna do, eyebrows?

1764
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,685
一...
One...

1765
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,640
二...
two...

1766
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,408
啊! 我鼻子流血了
Ow! Broke my nose!

1767
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,764
你是个疯女人 你懂的哈?
You're an aggressive woman. Know what I'm saying?

1768
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,287
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

1769
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,000
我没事 太厉害了 你把他揍扁了!
I'm fine. That was awesome. You fucking decked him!

1770
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,521
工作时候我常遇到这样的混蛋
I've dealt with handsy assholes like him at work.

1771
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,000
我们走吧
Let's just get out of here.

1772
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,004
谢谢你帮忙 但为什么数数?
Thanks for the backup. Why the counting?

1773
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,447
要想揍别人 你就直接一拳挥上去
If you're gonna punch someone, punch them on one.

1774
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,005
戴维让我数数的
Well, David told me to count.

1775
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,481
戴维? 戴维从来没打过架
David? David hasn't punched anybody ever.

1776
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,243
出口在这边
I think this Way. Exit.

1777
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,691
我回来啦
I have returned.

1778
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,807
哈哈 事情是这样的
Ha-ha-ha. So here's what happened, okay?

1779
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:46,126
我一个人行驶在大马路上 心想我要发财了
I'm out on the open road, just by myself, right? And I'm just beelining it to a huge payday.

1780
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,681
但我突然觉得: 一个人好无聊啊
And I start to realize something: it's boring in here.

1781
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,800
所以我想 "你知道怎么做吧 兄弟?"
So I thought, "You know what you gotta do, dummy?"

1782
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,527
"还是回头去把那几个蠢货接上吧"
"You gotta turn this RV around and go back and get those dip sticks."

1783
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,923
我开玩笑的 你们不是蠢货
Heh. I'm just kidding, you're not dip sticks.

1784
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,889
我们一起回家怎么样? 走吧
What do you say we go home? Come on, let's go.

1785
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,849
嘿 戴维? 去死吧
Hey, David? Go fuck yourself.

1786
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,289
嗯...? 哈!
Uh...? Ha!

1787
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,360
"去死吧" "你才去死"
"Go fuck yourself." "You go fuck yourself."

1788
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:12,048
萝丝说 "是你去死" 然后肯尼说 "我才不会去死"
Rose, you say, "Go fuck yourself." Then Kenny's like, "I don't want to fuck anybody."

1789
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,283
我好想念那些吵吵闹闹
This is what I miss, right? The Ping-Pong action, the repartee.

1790
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,729
走吧 我们走吧 开着房车回家
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here, go home. Get in the RV, go home, get out of here.

1791
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,201
走了 出发吧!
Come on, let's go!

1792
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,125
- 嘿 等等 你们去哪啊?  - 你有没有搞错?
- Whoa, hey, hold on. Where you going?  - Are you serious?

1793
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,203
听着 好吧
Look, look, look. Okay.

1794
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,806
我明白你们的意思
I know what this is about, and I get it.

1795
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:33,009
我们平分这五百万
All right? We're gonna split the $500,000.

1796
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:37,051
我们四个人 平分
Evenly. Betwixt the four of us.

1797
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,489
好不好? 肯尼 你肯定会这样: "噗!"
You guys get what I'm saying here? Kenny, you wanna be like this: "Pfft!"

1798
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,087
就像你玩的... 是吧? 很多游戏里都这样
Like you're from... right? That's a lot of video games, kiddo.

1799
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,642
凯西 你可以买座房子 然后再离家出走
All right, Casey, you can buy a house, and run away from it.

1800
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,520
对吧? 反正就是 你分到十二万五千
You know what I mean? Like, whatever. You get $125,000.

1801
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,806
你分到十二万五千
You get $125,000.

1802
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,685
你分到... 我简直就是奥普拉 是吧?
You get a... I mean, I'm like fucking Oprah here. You know?

1803
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,486
我是白人版本的她 哈
If she was a white dude at a carnival. Heh.

1804
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,211
来吧 我们开着房车...
Come on, guys. Let's get in the RV...

1805
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,001
回到丹佛市拿到钱 我们就发财了
and take our butts back to Denver where we're gonna be rich and we're gonna get paid.

1806
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,766
- 走吧  - 戴维 听我说
- Come on, come on.  - Uh, David, listen.

1807
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,964
是你拐带了我们 又抛下我们
You misled us. You left us.

1808
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:15,045
然后你蹦蹦哒哒地回来了... 我不知道你怎么回事...
And then you come waltzing back in here all... I don't know what the hell that was...

1809
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,680
你想让我们就这么忘了那些事情
and you just expect that we all just forget about it.

1810
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,571
你有没有搞错?
What's wrong with you?

1811
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,447
我们还怎么相信你?
How do we trust you?

1812
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,404
好吧 你们想怎么样? 让我求你们吗?
Okay, look, what do you want? Do you want me to beg?

1813
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,170
孩子们? 你们怎么想的?
Kids? What do you think?

1814
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,051
- 那样确实能让我好受些  - 我也觉得
- That would make me feel a lot better.  - Works for me. Sure.

1815
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,124
你们开玩笑吧
You're joking.

1816
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,046
什么...?
Wha...?

1817
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,569
你们真的想让我跪下来? 求你们?
You really want me to get on my knees? And beg you?

1818
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,203
正好我穿着下跪专用裤
It's a good thing I'm wearing my begging pants.

1819
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,567
通常我只在滚床单之前才这么做
I usually only do this before sex.

1820
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,845
好了 好了 我这就跪 别走
Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going. Please, please.

1821
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,970
嗯 这样可以了吧
Ahem. Let's do it. Here we go.

1822
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,167
好了! 上车 我们走
Okay! To the RV, let's go.

1823
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,607
走吧 孩子们
Come on, Babs.

1824
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,440
哇 等等我 这里小丑好多
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. There's clowns everywhere.

1825
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,801
嘿 小心气球
Here, let Pops get in here.

1826
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,287
就是这里 我把它停在房车旁边
We're right down here. I parked it next to an RV.

1827
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,486
- 梅丽萨  - 肯尼
- Melissa.  - Kenny.

1828
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,250
- 萝丝!  - 伊迪
- Rose!  - Edie.

1829
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,646
- 该死  - 该死
- Shit.  - Shit.

1830
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,201
我还是学不会那么说话
I never get used to that language.

1831
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,171
你们他-妈-的怎么在这里?
What in the H-E-L-L are you people doing here?

1832
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,606
嗯...
Uh... Uh, uh...

1833
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,121
- 我们是来看焰火表演的  - 是的 焰火表演
- We came to see the fireworks.  - Yeah. Fireworks.

1834
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:34,810
我们也是! 真是太巧了! 表演肯定会很精彩
Us too! That's so weird! They're supposed to be amazing here.

1835
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,445
- 梅丽萨 我们能谈谈吗?  - 不
- Melissa, can we talk?  - No.

1836
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,404
- 妈 我们走吧  - 梅丽萨!
- Mom, come on, let's go.  - Melissa!

1837
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,882
怎么这么没礼貌?
Why are you being so rude?

1838
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,686
你大姨妈来了吗? 要不要棉条?
Do you have your period? Do you need a tampin?

1839
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,884
妈 我不要棉条 我只是不想看到他们
Mom, I don't need a tampin. I don't want to be near these people.

1840
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,248
- 肯尼 我们走吧  - 嗯 我们该走了
- Kenny. Let's go.  - We should get out of here.

1841
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,484
- 昨天晚上的事情证明我以前看错你们了  - 哦 天啊
- What happened last night comes out I was wrong.  - Oh, boy.

1842
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,004
天啊 她知道了
Oh, my God, she knows.

1843
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,802
我女儿知道了我们的事
My daughter knows what we've done.

1844
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,043
是的 梅丽萨 我不应该摸米勒太太的咪咪
Melissa, yes, it was wrong of me to fondle Mrs. Miller's breasts.

1845
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,406
你是对的 但我也不能否认那样做给我带来了快感
You're right. I'm not gonna deny that it gave me a certain amount of pleasure.

1846
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:13,726
其实你爸爸和我早就不再那么亲密了
That said, your father and I are struggling with some serious intimacy issues.

1847
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,046
停 别说了!
Okay, no, stop!

1848
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,765
我不像以前那么紧了
I'm not as tight as I once was.

1849
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,361
- 听着...  - 他总是滑出来
- Look...  - He just falls right out.

1850
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,608
就像走廊里的一根热狗
It's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.

1851
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,962
哦! 你到底在说什么?
Ew! What are you talking about?

1852
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:28,484
昨天晚上 我看到肯尼和他姐还有他妈亲热 而他爸爸在一边看着
I saw Kenny making out with his sister and mother while their dad watched.

1853
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,410
什么? 哦 天啊...!
What? Oh, my...!

1854
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,729
- 事情不是那样的  - 有些情况你不了解
- It wasn't quite like that.  - That's not exactly what happened.

1855
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,850
萝丝不是我妈 她不是我姐 我们不是真的一家人
Rose isn't my mom, she's not my sister. We're not a real family.

1856
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,208
别说了 儿子! 你在说什么呢?
That's enough, son! What are you saying?

1857
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,449
他喝多了 他在胡言乱语 别听他的
He's been drinking. It's hard to understand. He's being ridiculous.

1858
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:46,325
戴维雇我们帮他走私毒品
David hired us to help him smuggle drugs across the border.

1859
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,010
你们是毒贩?
You're drug dealers?

1860
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,370
不! 我们是毒品走私贩 这不一样
No! No, we're drug smugglers. There's a difference.

1861
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,170
这有什么不一样
There's not a difference.

1862
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,125
听我说 伊迪 听我解释
Okay, Edie, we can explain, all right?

1863
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,687
这里面有个小误会 真的
This is a small misunderstanding. It really is.

1864
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,486
他说"走私贩"的时候 根本不知道自己在说什么
When he says "smuggle," he doesn't know what he's saying.

1865
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,921
- 不是毒品  - 他都不知道毒品是什么
- It's not drugs.  - He doesn't know what drugs are.

1866
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,088
真的 其实是龙舌兰酒
Seriously. It's just a little tequila.

1867
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,641
什么?
What?

1868
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,887
哦 我的天!
Oh, my God!

1869
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,806
- 嘿 谢天谢地 你没死  - 他有枪!
- Hey. Ah, thank God you're alive.  - He's got a gun!

1870
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,202
听我说! 嘿 嘿 别这样! 等一下!
Listen! Hey, hey, hey. No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1871
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,291
这下有趣了!
This is gonna be fun!

1872
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,210
我还是有点本事的
I still got it.

1873
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,084
唐也是坏蛋啊
Don's a badass.

1874
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:42,007
哦 唐
Oh, Don.

1875
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,644
梅丽萨 快去报警

No. Drug smuggling, David?

1878
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,568
我还以为我们是坦诚相见的朋友
And to think of the moment we shared in that tent.

1879
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,205
不 唐 还有一个人
No, Don, there's another guy.

1880
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,484
我才不想听你的感情经历!
I don't want to hear about other men in your life!

1881
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:01,522

Buenas noches, Millers.

1886
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,364
他说什么? 什么意思?
What is he saying? What does that mean?

1887
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,289
就是一句墨西哥问候语
It's a familiar Mexican greeting.

1888
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,643
那个穿着短裤留着小胡子的 把枪给我
You in the short jeans and the funny mustache, give me the gun.

1889
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,126

- 给你们  - 你还好吧? 没事了
- Take her.  - Are you okay? It's okay.

1893
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:33,926
把车钥匙给我
Now the keys, please.

1894
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,606
给你 给你
Here. Here, here, here.

1895
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,163
好了 你拿到毒品了 没必要杀我们了
Okay, great. You have your drugs, so you don't have to kill us.

1896
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,124
哦 没必要杀你们 是吗?
Oh, I don't have to kill you, huh?

1897
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,407
你们偷走了我的毒品
You take my drugs.

1898
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,570
你们让我穿过边境来到这个鬼地方
You make me cross the border into this fucked-up country.

1899
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,922
你们用蒸汽烧我的脸!
You try to burn my face with steam!

1900
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,407
- 抱歉  - 你们毁了我的车!
- I'm sorry.  - You destroy my car!

1901
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:56,006
而且我不喜欢每次你们都这样对待我的小伙伴
And I don't like what you do to my man every time we meet.

1902
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,402
你们是我见过最差劲的一家人
You are the worst family I've ever met.

1903
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,242
但你们说得对 我没必要杀你们
But, you're right, I don't have to kill you.

1904
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,167
但我想杀了你们
I want to kill you. All of you.

1905

1906
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,930
别这样 不要伤害他们
Don't do this. Don't kill these people.

1907
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,607
这都是我的错 这些都是我干的 我是毒贩
This is all my fault. I'm the one that did this. I'm the drug dealer here.

1908
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,165
他们只是无辜的一家人...
These people is just an innocent family...

1909
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,601
碰巧出现在这里
in the wrong place at the wrong time. Okay?

1910
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,206
而这个孩子?
And this kid?

1911
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,649
这个孩子是我这辈子见过最勇敢的人
This kid's got the biggest fucking heart I've ever seen in my life.

1912
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,130
我很幸运有他这样的朋友
And I'm lucky to call him a friend.

1913
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,286
一个小时之前 为了你我可以杀了这个女孩
Man, an hour ago, I would have killed this girl for you.

1914
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:40,609
但她很坚强 而且比我聪明百倍
But she's tough as hell. And a lot smarter than me.

1915
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,166
而这位
And this one.

1916
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,491
你 萨拉
You. Sarah.

1917
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,727
你是我认识的最坚强的女性
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.

1918
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,684
你还是个好妈妈
And you'd make a great mom.

1919
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,845
我爱他们每个人
I love all of them.

1920
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,160
别杀他们
Don't kill them.

1921
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,926
求你了
Please.

1922
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,451
杀了我吧
Just kill me.

1923
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,806
- 那好吧 我有个主意  - 说吧
- Tell you what, I'll make a deal, okay?  - Okay.

1924
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,407
我先杀了你 这样你就不用看着你的家人死掉了
I kill you first so you don't watch your family die.

1925
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,005
戴维
David.

1926
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,563
肯尼! 你太棒了!
Kenny! That was amazing!

1927
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,089
我想是我教他的
I'd like to think I taught him that.

1928
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,326
- 嗯  - 是我教他的
- Mm.  - I know I taught him that.

1929
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,088
把你的舌头收回去 小伙子
Put that tongue back in your mouth, young man.

1930
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,120

我相信你们是好人

1946

但你们触犯了法律
But you broke the law. All of you.

1947
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,007
更过分的事 你们让我妻子和女儿陷入了危险

Deadline was last night, so, sorry, buddy, no deal.

1958
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,484
布莱德 为了帮你我差点送命 两次呢
Brad, I almost got killed over this shit. Twice.

1959
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:56,480
我可不是不讲究的人 我拿到了两吨上好的大麻
I'm not gonna be an asshole about this. I got two tons of premium weed.

1960
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,526
是的! 而且你害察孔被抓起来了...
Yes! And you got Chacon pinched in the process...

1961
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,843
- 布莱德队大获全胜  - 嗯
- which is a huge win for team Brad.  - Mm-hm.

1962
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:07,169
所以我们握一下手 算是扯平了
So how about we shake hands and call it even.

1963
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,811
- 你本就没打算给我报酬 是吧?  - 哦! 答对了 加十分
- You were never gonna pay me, were you?  - Oh! Bingo. Heh-heh.

1964
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,361
这样做混蛋吗? 我也不知道
Was that a dick move? I can't even tell anymore.

1965
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,404

安全!
Clear!

1968
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,481
你出卖了我
You double-crossed me.

1969
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,370
有点混蛋 是吧?
Kind of a dick move, right?

1970
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,010
你没有证据的!
You got nothing on me!

1971
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,691
没有
Nothing at all.

1972
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,251
哦 天啊! 看看谁来了
Oh, shit! Look at this guy.

1973
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:46,329
谁把50美分请来了?
Who let in 50 Cent?

1974
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,082
- 干得不错 戴维  - 谢谢夸奖 唐
- Nice work, David.  - Thank you, Don.

1975
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,328
虽然你没有拿到钱...
Now, I know you don't get your money...

1976
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,689
但是做正义之事会让你更加满足的
but doing the right thing had to feel a whole lot better.

1977
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,491
没有
No.

1978
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,445
好吧 是有一点满足
All right, maybe a little bit.
