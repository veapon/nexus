00:01:58,855 --> 00:01:59,953
That one.

00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,577
Here boy.

4
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,459
You're heavy.

5
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:16,312
And slobbery.

6
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:23,545
There.

7
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,100
You're a good boy!

8
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:29,683
You're my good boy!

00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,421
Hello!

11
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,689
Honey, I don't have much time!

12
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:45,193
<i>Daddy?</i>

13
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,154
<i>Are you okay?</i>

14
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,866
Something's came up at work, honey.

15
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,979
Daddy is not gonna be home for a while.

16
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:56,193
I don't understand.

17
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:59,608
<i>You can't go back to the house Penny, okay?</i>

18
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:01,977
<i>What's happening?</i>

19
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,734
<i>It's alright. You won't be alone.</i>

20
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,742
<i>You have Bolt.</i>

21
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:10,253
I've altered him.

22
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,617
He can protect you now.

00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:56,790
<i>Thank you, which of course, is wonderful news.</i>

25
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,745
<i>Everything is positioning nicely.</i>

26
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,562
There he is, doctor Calico!

27
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,146
Any luck getting our guest to spill his guts?

28
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,041
<i>Oh, his guts will spill.</i>

29
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,911
<i>One way or another.</i>

30
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,125
<i>Never! I'll never talk.</i>

31
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:20,132
Daddy!

32
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,797
<i>You're beginning to irk me profesor, I'm irked.</i>

33
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,197
<i>And that will not do. As the package arrived...</i>

34
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:33,941
<i>...I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative.</i>

35
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,081
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

36
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,473
<i>Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight.</i>

37
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,090
Bolt, let's go!

38
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:26,265
<i>We only need the girl!</i>

39
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,952
- What? - Where is Calico?

40
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:04,927
I'm not talking to you.

41
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:09,805
Bolivia, Bolivia, Calico is in Bolivia!

42
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,325
Near lake Rogaguado!

43
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:15,933
Lake Rogaguado? I should have known!

44
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,640
Come on Bolt, let's go.

45
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,343
Bolivia!

46
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,691
There is a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

47
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,628
Bolt, zoom zoom!

48
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,506
Bolt, dispatch!

49
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:20,720
Puppy!

50
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,667
LOCK

51
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:43,473
Good boy!

52
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:44,982
Airport!

53
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,429
Bolt, speak.

54
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,208
Okay, okay...

55
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:39,916
Good job, buddy.

56
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,728
Mission accomplished!

57
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,647
That's a keeper!

58
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,665
It's alright tough guy, you caught them all.

59
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,696
Don't worry Bolt, you've saved the day again.

60
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:16,151
<i>Good boy!</i>

61
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:17,762
<i>Airport!</i>

62
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,515
<i>Bolt, speak.</i>

63
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,522
Boom mike!

64
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,274
- We got a boom mike. - That's a boom mike.

65
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,144
That's sloppy.

66
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:42,193
The dog could've seen that. He could've seen that!

67
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:45,693
Uh, who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?

68
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:51,547
Forgive me for answering a question with a question,...

69
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,915
...but who are you?

70
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,527
Mindy Parker, from the network.

71
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:02,418
Of course. Let me ask you, Mindy from the network...

72
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,033
What do you see here?

73
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:10,116
- Uhh... the dog? - "The dog" she says.

74
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:14,934
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor Mindy.

75
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,727
Am I missing something?

76
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:20,432
You're missing everything, Mindy.

77
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:24,630
You see a dog. I see an animal that believes...

78
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:28,860
...with every fiber of his being, every fiber...

79
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,953
...that the girl he loves is in mortal danger.

80
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:34,836
I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine the likes of which...

81
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,337
...has never been captured on screen before.

82
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,812
Never, Mindy from the network.

83
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,139
We jump through hoops to make sure Bolt believes everything is real.

84
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,754
It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot.

85
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,905
And it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes!

86
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,350
Because, Mindy from the network,...

87
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:05,417
...if the dog believes it,...

88
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:09,835
...the audience believes it.

89
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:16,231
Wow. Okay, you want reality, here you go chief.

90
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,936
The show's too predictable.

91
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,160
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her from the creepy english guy, we get it.

92
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,811
There's always a happy ending.

93
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:25,921
And our focus groups tell us 18 to 35 year olds are unhappy.

94
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,063
They're not happy with happy.

95
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,834
So maybe you should, I don't know,...

96
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,665
...spend a little less time worrying about the dog's method acting,...

97
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:35,290
...and more time figuring out how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka...

98
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,556
...from changing the channel.

99
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,274
Because if you lose so much as half a rating point,...

100
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:43,862
...so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with you!

101
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,994
How's that for real?

102
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:51,526
There. Perfect.

103
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,419
You saved me again, Bolt.

104
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,235
It's okay, it's nothing.

105
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,236
No more bad guys.

106
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,955
Do you want some food, Bolty? Huh? Are you hungry?

107
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,086
You've got them, Bolt, no one is gonna hurt me.

108
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:18,492
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

109
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,137
Come here buddy, come here!

110
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:26,250
Go, get it Bolt! Go, get it!

111
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,356
Yeah, that one is no funny either.

112
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,484
Well, what we have here?

113
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:37,769
Your old buddy, Mister Carrot!

114
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,279
Oh, Bolt!

115
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,990
You know I have to go.

116
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,369
Yeah, you are my good boy.

117
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:29,211
And there she is, my little superstar!

118
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,371
Let's get to that "Teen" vogue cover shoot.

119
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,835
Mam, I wanna take Bolt home for this weekend.

120
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:38,453
- Well, I... I'm... - Oh, that be nice. That be great.

121
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,262
That would. A little girl and her dog.

122
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,543
Nothing better that.

123
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,794
So I can bring Bolt home?

124
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:52,645
As your friend, I say yes, absolutely...

125
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,311
...but as your agent, I have to remind you. This is Bolt's world.

126
00:15:57,714 --> 00:16:01,138
He has to stay right here. Okay, let's go.

127
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,128
But he never gets to be a real dog.

128
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,964
And it will be only for the weekend and I just once...

129
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,587
What? You know what? It's a fair question. Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.

130
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,688
Pin in, there you go. Now, let's let that hang there a little bit...

131
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:16,400
...and then we'll address that when we thought things through, okay?

132
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,302
Good enough for everybody? Smiles all around!

133
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:19,555
Let's get out of here. Come on.

134
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:23,142
I don't need to think it through. I wanna take Bolt home.

135
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:27,369
Look at this face! I have a little girl at home,...

136
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,473
...love of my life. I would do anything for her.

137
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:34,189
And I would trade her for you in a heartbeat!

138
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:35,755
True story.

139
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:38,886
That reminds me, uh, we need to begin over to wardrobe.

140
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,034
Let's go.

141
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,600
- I need every... - I... I just...

142
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:55,170
So, the dog thinks this is all real?

143
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:58,763
Oh, yeah. Hear new. Guy never leaves the set.

144
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:03,112
It's unbelievable. Whenever I get a chance this is the perfect way to unwind.

145
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,322
I like to start with an evil laugh.

146
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,387
Hello, hairballs!

147
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,999
You may have one today Bolt, but in the end...

148
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,127
...we will get your little Penny.

149
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:24,701
Not likely cat. For you've choosen to follow the path of evil,...

150
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:28,829
...ultimately we'll destroy you, along with your fiendish puppet master.

151
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,904
- Wow! - I know. Okay, watch this.

152
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:38,544
She is a goner, dog. But green-eyed man has a plan...

153
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,010
...and soon he will execute it.

154
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah and then he will execute her!

155
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:48,989
Nice!

156
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,300
I would super bark you both back into the hole you crawled out of...

157
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,861
...but I need you alive...

158
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:57,332
...because I got a little message for you to take back to your green-eyed man.

159
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,874
You tell him, his old friend Bolt said he...

160
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,142
Is it long?

161
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,445
- Is what long? - The message.

162
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,800
Is it a long message? Because I have a horrible memory.

163
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,341
Yeah, I'll make a brief, all right? You tell him I said, I'm gonna...

164
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,049
You know what? Why don't we do this?

165
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:16,479
You remember the first half of the message and then I remember the second.

166
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,886
And then we can pass it on green-eyed man together.

167
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:21,482
I don't care how the message is translated, alright?

168
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:25,547
Just do it, okay? Tell the green-eyed man, that I will not sleep,...

169
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:29,060
...I will not rest until my Penny is safe from his evil clutches.

170
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,987
You tell the green-eyed man, I'll...

171
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:36,698
Way too many words! I was like, "what?", and then I was like "huh?"...

172
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:41,259
...and then "I got a little bored". Some about clutches?

173
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,277
Anyway, I'll do my best! Ciao!

174
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,995
By the way, huge fan, love it, love you, gotta go. Thank you!

175
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:52,437
Get back here, you... You sick! Revolting, low some little...

176
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,327
Dogs!

177
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:00,833
Cats!

178
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,536
I'll never let them get you, Penny!

179
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,025
You ready, Bolt?

180
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,036
Let's widen out camera three.

181
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,561
Ready four! Go four!

182
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,365
And... driver.

183
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,014
Thanks, Larry.

184
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:56,937
<i>Alright Scooter, right the grade. Ready on to propel bars.</i>

185
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:03,362
<i>And track with them!</i>

186
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,125
Calico's super computer.

187
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:09,879
If we can access it...

188
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,690
...we'll find and learn where they're keeping my father.

189
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,120
The weapon is hot.

190
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:36,805
"Heat vision" time.

191
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:39,176
Bolt, stare!

192
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,803
Now!

193
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,874
Nice move.

194
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,025
Come on, come on!

195
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:06,624
Such devotion... It brings tears to my eyes!

196
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:07,919
Calico!

197
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,579
Your father's discoveries could be a great use to our organization.

198
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,971
I'm sure, he will be more commutating...

199
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:22,582
...now that I've got his "lucky Penny"!

200
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:23,946
Bolt!

201
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:30,032
World domination is waiting my grasp!

202
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:44,303
How did your focus groups feel about the end of this?

203
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:47,685
You asked for unhappy 18 to 35 years olds,...

204
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:52,359
...I give you unhappy 18 to 35 year olds.

205
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,923
<i>Bolt, it's okay Bolt. I'm fine.</i>

206
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:58,137
<i>Guards, stop her!</i>

207
00:21:58,242 --> 00:21:59,494
- Hey, hey! - Bolt!

208
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,849
- Hold on! - Listen to him.

209
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,766
- He needs to know I'm okay. - No, you're not okay.

210
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,929
You've been kidnapped by fiendish Doctor Calico.

211
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,289
At least that is what the dog needs to think but...

212
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,704
...just imagine, close your eyes and imagine how excited he'll be...

213
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:17,645
...when he saves you, tomorrow. OK?

214
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,934
But he's gonna be freaking out all night. Please, just let me...

215
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:24,345
Wait a second. What's that behind your ear?

216
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:28,153
Is that a... Yes, it is! It's a pin!

217
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:32,329
Let's do this. Let's take the pin and put it in this conversation.

218
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:36,447
And we will not take it down, no m'am, until this matter is resolved.

219
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,463
- But I just... - What's that reminds me up?

220
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,071
The DVD release junket. Let's get going. It's a big push.

221
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:44,003
I want to go with a modern looks.

222
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:50,657
Alright, okay. Let's give her some air. Let's not crowd the talent.

223
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,907
I've been working on my evil laugh. Is there an evil laugh like...

224
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:06,540
Like that?

225
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,832
Okay, here is the thing. You're not ready for the evil laugh.

226
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,496
You could do a chuckle, like a mildly upset chuckle...

227
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,999
...after my evil laugh. Listen to mine.

228
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,660
Hey Bolt!

229
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:18,471
Climbing here!

230
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,690
Bolt, come back!

231
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,711
I'm too late.

232
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:30,075
- Bolt, help! - I'm coming Penny!

233
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:32,336
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

234
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,858
Hold on, Penny. Hold on!

235
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,240
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

236
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,190
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

237
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,908
Penny!

238
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,776
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

239
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:55,711
Okay, Bolty, okay! Stay cool! You're cool, Bolty!

240
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:04,912
The green-eyed man!

241
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,090
Penny! Penny!

242
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:58,440
Penny!

243
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:01,742
Target acquired!

244
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,015
It ends here!

245
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:28,865
Penny!

246
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,686
Penny! They moved her.

247
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:39,144
There is no time for formalities, brothers.

248
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,153
My person is in danger and I... I...

249
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:44,345
- Wow! What're you doing? - Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,827
- You wanna sniff mine first? - What?

251
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,321
- Not from around here, are you? - Hey, stop it!

252
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:51,095
- What? - This is serious.

253
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,711
Hey, there. Are you lost sweety?

254
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,384
Hey, wait!

255
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:22,947
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

256
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:24,983
Oh, buddy!

257
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,050
You got your head stucked pretty good, huh guy?

258
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:35,732
Hey guys, come here. Check this out! He's got his melon stucked.

259
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,741
Yup, that is one stucked melon.

260
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,114
Hey, hey buddy, take it easy! Slow down.

261
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:48,729
I will not take it easy, because I'm missing my person.

262
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:56,474
Hey buddy, relax. Like this, turn and pull. Turn and pull.

263
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:58,974
Forget about it, you'll be out no time.

264
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,056
What are these things? They're weaken me.

265
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:22,876
- Polystyrofoam packing peanuts. - Styrofoam?

266
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:25,738
This has a "green-eyed man" written all of it!

267
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,696
Have you seen the man with a green eye?

268
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:32,938
You know, I gotta say something, if I could say something here.

269
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,429
You look familiar. Joey, look at this guy's mug.

270
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:40,441
Yeah, you know, I could've sworn I've seen this guy before.

271
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:41,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:44,242
I gotta tell ya, I never forget a face.

273
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,806
- He never does. - Oh, yeah, yeah.

274
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,205
- Never. - Yeah, he's really good with the faces and such.

275
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:52,301
Listen, listen! The man with the green eye. Tell me what you know, birds!

276
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,126
- I know this dog. - Yeah, yeah, me too!

277
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,787
I gotta remember, it's gonna kill me. Hold on.

278
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:09,297
No, I don't know. I, I, I thought I know.

279
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,422
Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?

280
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:16,705
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kelvin, the Labrador. - What?

281
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:20,108
You gotta gimme something here, cause this is redonkulous.

282
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:22,027
Absolutely redonkulous!

283
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:24,120
Capisch redonkulous! Ya know what that means?

284
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,376
You pigeons are useless.

285
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,673
I need someone on the inside, someone close to the green-eyed man.

286
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,909
- A cat. - Oh, a cat?

287
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:38,256
Yeah, a cat. When I find him...

288
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:42,207
When I find him, I'm gonna make that cat wish never born.

289
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,572
I think we know just the cat.

290
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:55,965
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

291
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:02,002
Okay, Saul, nice work. Let's find some mustard next time. Okay, babe?

292
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

293
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,912
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?

294
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:11,782
- Attaboy! - Good day, Mittens.

295
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,448
Louie!

296
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:18,160
What is this?

297
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:22,529
It was a slow week. I mean, that's half of what I got.

298
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:27,349
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

299
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,316
And when the old stomach starts talking, it ain't talking to me.

300
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:36,546
- It's talking to... the claws! - Not the claws! Please!

301
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:41,969
I'm holding these bad boys back as best as I can, but the thing is it's not up to me.

302
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,791
The stomach got a direct line to these babies,...

303
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:48,440
...and I'm picking up a lot of chatter!

304
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:52,233
So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange...

305
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:57,377
...next week, all your food comes to me. - But that's not our deal!

306
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:01,171
I bring you half, you give me protection! That's our deal.

307
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:04,875
Yeah, well, the deal just expired. Now, get lost.

308
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:07,319
Mark my words, Mittens.

309
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:13,231
One day, someone's gonna stand up to you! Someone's gonna teach you a lesson!

310
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,435
Yeah, I'm really scared now.

311
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,645
You should be!

312
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,585
Aaah! Okay! You...

313
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:20,680
Where is she?

314
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,780
- Who? - You know why I'm here!

315
00:31:25,227 --> 00:31:26,331
Where is she?

316
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:30,098
Okay, okay! Look buddy, I don't know what you're getting at, but...

317
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:35,018
Come on, Mittens. Just tell the guy where she is.

318
00:31:35,124 --> 00:31:39,286
- Tell the dog, make him happy. - Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens! Tell him!

319
00:31:41,144 --> 00:31:44,910
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

320
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:47,970
Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat?

321
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:52,091
- You got her, pal! - That's her!

322
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:55,606
- She's the one! - That is definitely the right cat!

323
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:59,323
Looks like we're gonna do this the hard way.

324
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,043
Whoa! Aaah! Are you crazy, man?

325
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:08,419
Hey Joey, do we go to far on this?

326
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,378
You kidding? This is the best day in my life.

327
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:15,743
You work for Ben and Bart, who work with the man green-eye.

328
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:18,273
They take him Penny. Where is she?

329
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:21,366
- I don't know what you're talking about. - This is becoming tiresome cat...

330
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:24,225
...in fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

331
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:28,448
Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk. I know where Penny is.

332
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,098
Yeah, they have her.

333
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:34,974
Yes, the men in black and the guy, the guy with the blue eyes.

334
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:36,080
Blue eyes?

335
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,911
Oh, green! Yes, green! The one green eye.

336
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:45,178
You just can't stop lying, can you cat? It's in the genes. This is gross.

337
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,529
I know, it's disgusting, I disgust myself.

338
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,550
Hollywood?

339
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:57,068
But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is.

340
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:11,214
You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

341
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,314
Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me...

342
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:18,179
...not to betray the trust of the green-eyed man.

343
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:23,536
Okay, this is a top, top secret map...

344
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,300
...of the entire earth!

345
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:31,576
Now, we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch.

346
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:34,592
And my boss has Penny locked up...

347
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:41,099
Right, right over... Here, here! By the waffle with the sun glasses!

348
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:44,309
Now all you need to do is get from here to there.

349
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:50,844
Well, I told you where you find her, so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

350
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,621
I'll release you cat, when we found Penny.

351
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:57,561
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal! We had a deal!

352
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,865
Your deal just expired.

353
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,232
She said that to me, not 10 minutes ago.

354
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:05,399
The irony!

355
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:12,311
Perfect.

356
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:19,200
Hmm... padlock.

357
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,933
Listen Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts,...

358
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:31,159
...do not, I beg of you do not make me bring out these bad boys!

359
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,079
It gets ugly!

360
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,176
- What are you doing? - Stay back!

361
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:41,314
If I stare at the lock really hard, it'll burst into flames and melt.

362
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:44,361
Now I'm concerned on a number of levels.

363
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:46,848
- Easy, watch! Watch it those! - I'm good. We gotta go.

364
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:47,847
Intruders!

365
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:51,056
Hey! Slow down you screwy borrowed of mind...

366
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:58,216
- Oh, boy, this thing is heavy. - Hey, hey! Put it down.

367
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,075
I forgot the keys.

368
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,188
I'll be right back.

369
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:14,436
Hey, lucky Penny.

370
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:17,248
Thanks. Now move your butt.

371
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:21,935
Okay, just upon your left. Yeah. I got... No, I got, I got mine.

372
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:22,979
You got it?

373
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,668
It's on tipping my tongue. I know that dog.

374
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,141
I'm telling you, Joey. Bobby, you guys looking at me like, you don't know. I'm telling you...

375
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:42,004
...I know this dog. I've seen him somewhere.

376
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,760
You remember it tonight, when you're perching.

377
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:46,743
Alright, that's... That's will happen.

378
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,995
- I've got some good news! - Really?

379
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:19,938
Yes, I do. I just booked you, on the tonight show's "main guest"!

380
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:22,953
That's right. That, I mean...

381
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:27,648
...which means just absolutely nothing, if Bolt is still missing.

382
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:31,878
It's not even a good news, like whatever, so up tonight show. Who cares? I don't care.

383
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:35,683
It's okay, baby.

384
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:41,658
- He must be so scared. - Scared? This is Bolt we're talking about.

385
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:44,069
He's not scared of anything.

386
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,580
I bet Bolt would want you to the tonight show.

387
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:48,937
It is...

388
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:54,111
I just... or maybe not.

389
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:59,887
Bolt loves you very much sweety. And you're here.

390
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:03,201
He couldn't have gone far.

391
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,931
Welcome to Ohio. So much to Discover!

392
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:15,328
So, if you got super powers, I guess that would make you, what...

393
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,633
...like some kind a super dog? - That information is classified.

394
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,522
Oh, come on! Like, what's your best power?

395
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,522
You go to move. How about flying? Can you fly?

396
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,484
Don't be silly, I can't fly.

397
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,891
Okay, okay, fine. If you don't have any powers,...

398
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:32,912
...you don't have any powers. What's it to me?

399
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:38,933
- I have super bark. - A super bark? Wow, you're kidding me?

400
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:45,110
What exactly this one do with the super bark?

401
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,779
I really can't talk about it. It's classified.

402
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:51,688
I suggest you pipe down and take me to Penny.

403
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,856
You're awfully attached to this Penny character, huh wags?

404
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:59,723
- She is my person. - Oh, please. She's a person.

405
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:04,744
And if you ask me, the only good person is a...

406
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:10,117
Styrofoam!

407
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:11,773
Tag and roll!

408
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:14,787
Tag and what?

409
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:35,525
What? What is this red liquid coming from my paw?

410
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:37,886
It's called blood, hero!

411
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:41,099
- Do I need it? - Yes.

412
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:44,413
So if you want it to keep inside your body where it belongs,...

413
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:48,419
...you should stop jumping off trucks doing eighty on the interstate!

414
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:52,698
Yeah, well, normally I'm a tad more indestructible. Must have been the...

415
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:56,565
Styrofoam! That stuff, it weakens me!

416
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,879
- What are you doing? Put that down! - Alright, that's it. I've had with you.

417
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:06,158
Untie me, pooch or I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Uhmm... I'm gonna seriously wound you!

418
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:08,806
I'm gonna seriously wound you with this styrofoam!

419
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,511
Are you mad? You don't know the power of styrofoam!

420
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:15,031
Oh, you bet on that, baby. And I'm about to unleash it!

421
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,457
- The power of the styrofoam! - No!

422
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:22,055
Alright, cat. Okay, you win. I'll untie you.

423
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,698
That's a weird push to put a piano!

424
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,585
- Are we gonna have any more problems, cat? - No, no, no. No more problems.

425
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,361
I'll take you to Penny.

426
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:41,854
Ah! What is that?

427
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,018
- What? - That!

428
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:47,521
Okay, you have two seconds to tell me what you've implanted in me, cat!

429
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:51,149
Poison? A parasite? Poison? Wait, I just said that, didn't I?

430
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:53,347
See, I'm all discombobulated! I can't think straight!

431
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:56,409
Oh, I don't believe this. You're hungry!

432
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,647
- Where is the antidote? - Okay, okay! Alright!

433
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,564
There's your antidote...

434
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:08,761
Food!

435
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:10,088
<i>Alright! Who wants burgers?</i>

436
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:11,712
<i>- I'll take one. - Me too!</i>

437
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:13,285
<i>Watch this!</i>

438
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,495
Go on, use the dog face. This gonna be beatiful.

439
00:40:18,302 --> 00:40:22,677
You know, beg. Do the dog face!

440
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:26,437
What? The dog face? What is that mean?

441
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,304
Figures, I'm tied to the one dog on earth who doesn't know how to beg, huh.

442
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,906
Okay, if you want the food...

443
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:37,986
...the antidote, you're gonna have to do exactly what I say.

444
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:43,357
No, not likely. You're a degenerate creature of darkness.

445
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,101
Yeah, yeah, granted but that's it.

446
00:40:45,102 --> 00:40:47,944
All I'm asking you to do is just tilt your head a little.

447
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:50,296
You could do that, can't you? Come on.

448
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:54,975
- More, more... - This is stupid.

449
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,720
No, no. Come on. Work with on this. Please, you're almost there.

450
00:40:57,826 --> 00:40:59,077
Oh, boy!

451
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,793
Okay, try the other way.

452
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:08,468
There you go! Tilt up! Down. Now, a little smile. Lose the smile.

453
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:12,522
Drop your left ear. Your other left. Okay, the other way was better.

454
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,571
Now, drop them both. Hold it right there.

455
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:19,127
And ever so slightly, look up.

456
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:21,762
Soup is on, baby!

457
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:35,895
Here you go.

458
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:37,954
Yes!

459
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:44,292
Oh, look at you, you little guy!

460
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:50,890
Here you stupid cat!

461
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:04,333
<i>...what really happened. And why is that matter to you?</i>

462
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,218
<i>- Because I'm involved. - With rich?</i>

463
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,917
<i>- With James. - If you and James are romantic...</i>

464
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:10,786
<i>...I wanna know all about it. - What? So you can...</i>

465
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:12,805
<i>Come undone!</i>

466
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,921
<i>You gonna get stop that leaking!</i>

467
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,451
<i>Go Larry, go Larry, go Larry! Stop!</i>

468
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:23,580
<i>It really does help and it really releases the serotonin and...</i>

469
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,241
<i>Hey, man! This time we'll do it my way!</i>

470
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:39,197
Well, hello puppy. Did you come for some of grandma's butter bean dumplings?

471
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,186
You wait right there.

472
00:42:49,138 --> 00:42:52,755
Look at you. You're quite a little actor, huh?

473
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:55,204
I haven't eating like this in ages.

474
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:58,357
Hey, look! My stomach distended. How great is that!

475
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:01,421
Yeah, well. Don't get used to it. We gotta keep moving.

476
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:04,605
But this place is a gold mine. What's wrong with you?

477
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:09,226
Every week, new RVs bring us new suckers, who bring us new food.

478
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:12,172
Look around! It's perfect.

479
00:43:17,038 --> 00:43:22,261
Do my eyes deceive me? Is this some apparition I see before real?

480
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:26,579
Or could it be? My hero!

481
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:28,694
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

482
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:35,495
You're Bolt, the super dog. You're fully awesome.

483
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,650
Wait a minute. You know this dog?

484
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:43,990
- Oh, I do. He is fully awesome! - Ah, yeah, yeah. We've established that.

485
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,213
- Who are you? - I'm Rhino.

486
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:48,357
Rhino, the hamster?

487
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:52,798
Well, you know, my ancestry isn't all hamster. I'm 1,16% wolf...

488
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:55,094
...with a yellow wolverine and there is some...

489
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,846
But that beside the point!

490
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:02,061
We have before us a legend. Bolt, the super dog!

491
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:07,446
You can outrun speeding missiles, and burn through solid metal with his heat vision.

492
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:12,988
And best of all, he can obliterate large structures with his super bark!

493
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,820
Wait a minute, you've seen the super bark?

494
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:21,158
- Have you been observing me? - Oh, yeah. I watch you all the time.

495
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,978
- That's incredible. - Oh, it's nothing, really.

496
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:27,828
But I'm always so vigilant! No one can avoid my detection!

497
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:32,446
- You are a phantom. - Ah, if you say so...

498
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,116
Oh, hey! Check it out!

499
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:39,069
Take a gander at this Bolt action. Scary, huh?

500
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:44,752
- It's like, we're twins. - Yeah, scary.

501
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:49,630
- So, where is Penny? - She was kidnapped by the green-eyed man.

502
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,110
Kidnapped? This is terrible! She could be in grave...

503
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:57,447
Grave danger. I know. But I've captured this cat.

504
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:01,384
An agent of the green-eyed man, I presume!

505
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:04,581
You presumed correctly. She is taking me to Penny.

506
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,920
You! You are a vile vermin.

507
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:13,114
How did you sleep at night? Penny is the most wonderful person ever.

508
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:18,592
She loves Bolt and he is awesome. And you're a monster!

509
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:23,203
How dare you disrupt their relationship with your evil!

510
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:25,459
- Die! Die! - Whoa! Whoa!

511
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,552
I can take her Bolty.

512
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:31,242
- Die! Die! - Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

513
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:34,806
You're right, we need her alive.

514
00:45:35,996 --> 00:45:37,112
We?

515
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:41,365
Yes. Bolt, I can be a valuable addition to your team.

516
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:43,572
- I'm listening. - I'm lightning quick.

517
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,651
I have razor sharp reflexes and I'm a master of stealth.

518
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,120
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

519
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:56,098
- The road will be rough. - I have a ball.

520
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,613
- There is no turning back. - I guess I have to roll with the punches.

521
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:02,525
- Easy won't be a part of the equation. - Promise.

522
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:06,793
Gotta warn you, going into the belly of the beast, danger in every turn.

523
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:10,147
- I eat danger for breakfast. - You're hungry?

524
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:13,712
- Starving. - Welcome aboard.

525
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,494
Hey, can we talk for a second?

526
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:23,162
I don't know what's going on here but I'm just a little bit concerned...

527
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:25,574
...about the numbers of lunatics on this trip.

528
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:28,888
- My limit is one. - He is coming with us.

529
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:29,932
But I...

530
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:33,640
Move it prisoner, we're losing daylight.

531
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:34,799
I agree.

532
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,626
Now, we need to find a fast set of wheels.

533
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,708
I've got a better idea. Follow me!

534
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:57,409
Okay, so what we do here is we give the target a quick fly over...

535
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,829
...we adjust the trajectory and land dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino?

536
00:47:02,055 --> 00:47:05,131
Just the knowledge that every minute spent in your company becomes...

537
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:06,710
...the new greatest minute of my life!

538
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:12,192
No, forget it! How do you say, "No way, I'm doing this" in crazy?

539
00:47:12,267 --> 00:47:15,688
- Calm down, cat. You're with me. - That's the problem.

540
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,374
Oh, would you be relax?

541
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,969
Every time you get this on the "magic box", it was awesome!

542
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,067
Magic what?

543
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:29,778
You know, "magic box", people stare at.

544
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,627
Wait a minute! Is this "magic box" have moving pictures on it?

545
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:35,357
Yeah and Bolt's pictures are the best.

546
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:38,625
Bolt's pictures? Of course! He's a former...

547
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:42,112
Oh, no! Oh, no! No, wait, wait! Bolt, guys! Hear me out!

548
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:47,524
- Let it begin! Let it begin! Let it begin! - Wait, you're not a super he...

549
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:56,794
What are you doing?

550
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,149
Mittens!

551
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:17,166
Mittens, take my paw. I need you alive.

552
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,945
Yeah, of course! Stay away from me!

553
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:24,928
- Squeeze my paw, I'll save you! - No, you won't. You're not really a...

554
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,188
Bolt!

555
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:47,180
Saboteur!

556
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:50,630
Ah! Ouch! You moron!

557
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:54,459
- Stop it! I'm trying to help him. - Help him? Yeah, right.

558
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:58,592
Don't worry Bolt! I'll stop her.

559
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,074
I can't hold it.

560
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:17,713
- Let it go, you monster! - Bolt!

561
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:52,858
The real world hurts, doesn't it? But you wouldn't know about that, would you?

562
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:55,346
Get down here cat. We don't have time for this.

563
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,116
I'll get a ladder.

564
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:01,674
Look, genius. You're a part of a TV show.

565
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,594
You know what that is, television? It's an entertainment for people.

566
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:09,689
It's fake! Nothing you think is real as real!

567
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:11,495
That's has preposterous!

568
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:15,063
Think about it Bolt. Since you got lost, none of your powers are working, aren't they?

569
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:18,072
For the first time you're hungry, you're bleeding.

570
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:21,247
I mean, do you really think that you were born with a birthmark...

571
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:24,498
...in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?

572
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:27,345
It's my mark of power, cat!

573
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:29,618
It's the mark of a make-up artist, dog!

574
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,780
You're ridiculous! Now, get down here!

575
00:50:34,446 --> 00:50:35,501
No.

576
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:39,084
Mittens, so help me, I will super bark you out of that tree.

577
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,938
Yeah, go nuts. Let's see how that works out for you.

578
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:44,551
You leave me no choice.

579
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:56,641
Oh, the super bark. Scary, scary!

580
00:50:56,943 --> 00:50:59,453
Yeah, that's really really super.

581
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:03,771
It's not true. This is not true.

582
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:10,597
Wow, that one felt really super.

583
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:13,061
Wait! No, it didn't.

584
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,334
Okay, okay. I get the idea, you can stop now.

585
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,853
That's enough! Seriously dog, stop! I'm not kidding.

586
00:51:23,757 --> 00:51:25,113
Would you stop?

587
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,746
Okay, fine. You're the super dog. Bolt, be quiet, please.

588
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:35,307
Bolt, we gotta run!

589
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,119
- Bolt! - Come here.

590
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:44,813
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER

591
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:01,632
LOST DOG - BOLT

592
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:05,071
He is white with a lightning bolt on his side. REWARD! Please help me get my friend back.

593
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:12,338
Look who we found young lady! It's Bolt!

594
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:15,716
- They found him! - Bolt!

595
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,178
Isn't that right you little puppy dog?

596
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,211
That is not Bolt.

597
00:52:26,397 --> 00:52:29,541
Well, that depands on how you look at it.

598
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:34,695
You know, when I was little, I want a bicycle for my birthday...

599
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:37,846
...but my parents got me a baseball glove. So...

600
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:43,809
You know what I did? I pretended that baseball glove was a bicycle.

601
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:46,591
And I rode it to school every day.

602
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:48,249
True story.

603
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:53,220
- It's not him. - I think it's him. I do.

604
00:52:54,718 --> 00:52:55,924
Thank you.

605
00:52:56,029 --> 00:52:58,667
Look kid, it's time we are honest with you.

606
00:52:58,836 --> 00:53:01,850
If we don't get back in the production, people are gonna lose their jobs.

607
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,213
- Good people with families. - But Bolt is still out there.

608
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,972
- And I... - I know, we feel for you.

609
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:11,217
And the last thing we wanna do is ask a little girl to make a grown up decision.

610
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,622
But it's come to that, we need you to move on.

611
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:18,896
We need you to let Bolt go.

612
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:48,348
It must be made of styrofoam!

613
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:52,117
No, no! No, no, no! Please, it can't end like this!

614
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,695
Stop worrying cat. I'll get us out of here.

615
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,386
You can't, Bolt. You got nothing.

616
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:00,048
No super strength, no super bark.

617
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,060
And no heat vision.

618
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,890
Listen to me, okay? We've been taking to a place...

619
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:09,307
...where humans go animal shopping, alright?

620
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:12,450
And this is what humans do. They always pick the cute ones.

621
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:14,502
The ones that look like you, Bolt.

622
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,271
But the rest of us never come back out.

623
00:54:17,272 --> 00:54:19,279
I said, I'll get us out of here, alright?

624
00:54:29,925 --> 00:54:31,396
My hero!

625
00:54:46,194 --> 00:54:50,316
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny!

626
00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:53,919
I've been expecting your call.

627
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:34,037
Oh, would you give it up already? You're liquefying, whatever brains you have left.

628
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:38,898
I can not be contained in any container.

629
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:41,762
You quitter! Watch this!

630
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,956
I did it! I'm back!

631
00:55:53,362 --> 00:55:55,155
That styrofoam is a wicked stuff.

632
00:55:55,192 --> 00:56:00,967
Totally awesome! There is no truck that I know that can keep Bolt and Rhino!

633
00:56:01,396 --> 00:56:04,637
Rhino, what are you doing here?

634
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:08,714
Oh, nothing. I was enjoying an evening stroll and thought that I'd just...

635
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:11,640
...pop the hatch on hack that containment unit!

636
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:16,761
- You... You opened the door? - Yes, I did.

637
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,510
That's... That's great, Rhino.

638
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:23,526
Yeah, that's... That's really good.

639
00:56:23,527 --> 00:56:26,702
Alright, let's go get the prisoner back.

640
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,773
I... I can't do it.

641
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,814
What did you say?

642
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:52,769
- I can't. - What... Who are you?

643
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:55,276
Rhino, you're just... Just a little...

644
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:57,686
- You are Bolt. - But I'm not...

645
00:56:57,687 --> 00:57:01,109
Who single handedly destroyed the green-eyed man's under sea labs?

646
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:01,944
Me, but...

647
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:07,170
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

648
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:10,005
- Who, Bolt, who? Who? - Me, but none of them...

649
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:15,370
You! You can, Bolt. Because, all over this planet...

650
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:18,270
...there are animals who feel like they can't.

651
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:24,915
Like a little hamster, who once spent his days in a RV park.

652
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:30,604
Dreaming of the day when he too would save a little girl from danger and be told:

653
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,913
"You did it! You did it, Rhino! You saved the day."

654
00:57:36,561 --> 00:57:38,615
They need a hero, Bolt!

655
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,817
Someone, who never mind what the odds, will do what's right.

656
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:47,230
They need a hero to tell them that sometimes the impossible...

657
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:52,118
...can become possible, if you're awesome!

658
00:57:53,664 --> 00:57:57,036
Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino.

659
00:57:57,588 --> 00:57:59,056
Mittens does need a hero.

660
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,363
I guess I'll have to do.

661
00:58:03,364 --> 00:58:08,125
Such modesty! Now, who is going to save that cat?

662
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:10,293
- Me. - Who? Tell me who?

663
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:11,398
Me.

664
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:15,677
I'll get my ball.

665
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:18,362
ELMWOOD COUNTY ANIMAL SHELTER

666
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:32,120
Over there.

667
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:36,338
There it is.

668
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:46,845
This will be just like the time, you infiltrated Calico's R.D. cover base!

669
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:50,135
It's not gonna be exactly like that, Rhino.

670
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,905
We're gonna have to do things a little differently.

671
00:58:54,817 --> 00:58:57,278
Oh, stealth mode!

672
00:58:58,976 --> 00:59:01,085
ADOPT A PET WEEK

673
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,257
- Good night, Ester. - Good night, Lloyd.

674
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:12,442
Lloyd?

675
00:59:15,506 --> 00:59:20,477
Lloyd Spoon, you jump out and scare me, and I'm gonna pepper spray ya again!

676
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:27,615
I swear it, it's like I work with toddlers!

677
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:34,035
Threat nullified.

678
00:59:38,183 --> 00:59:40,006
I feel alive!

679
00:59:45,522 --> 00:59:46,785
There's a guard.

680
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:48,743
I'll snap his neck.

681
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,907
We need to get away him from that door.

682
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:00,115
- Ball! - Ball?

683
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:02,957
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

684
01:00:06,524 --> 01:00:11,548
Oh, come... I'm just... I'm read... I'm just... Oh, god! Just quiet down!

685
01:00:23,676 --> 01:00:24,928
Mittens?

686
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:27,242
Bolt!

687
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,283
- What are you doing here? - I'm busting you out.

688
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:36,875
You came all the way back here, for me?

689
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:37,884
Yeah.

690
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:41,357
But how did you... I mean... You don't have any super powers.

691
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:42,797
- I know. - Really?

692
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:44,471
- Yeah. - Wow!

693
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:48,202
- Crazy day for you, huh? - It's been a lot. Yes, it has.

694
01:00:48,472 --> 01:00:50,631
- Are you ready for this? - No.

695
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,043
Me neither.

696
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:58,546
Hey, hey, hey! What is twisting your giblets?

697
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,202
Hey, wait! Where did you get that hamster?

698
01:01:01,308 --> 01:01:03,266
Give it, give it.

699
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,524
Hey, wait!

700
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,136
Initiating escape!

701
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:17,880
Lloyd, block the door! Block the door! Block the door! Block the door!

702
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:20,019
Super bark! Super bark!

703
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:48,637
Sweet Sister Francis! What did you do my new truck?

704
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:49,830
You hold that back later!

705
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:52,779
Oh, sally Ester!

706
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:58,277
- Both you boys need serious help! - Spicy eyes!

707
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:04,558
- We need a ride. - I've got a big one.

708
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:06,165
You're welcome!

709
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:28,143
I can't believe it! My whole life, I wanted to see a real live super bark.

710
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:33,122
You are legendary!

711
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:46,630
Mittens...

712
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:52,706
If... If I don't chase bad guys, then what am I?

713
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:54,710
I mean... What...

714
01:02:57,924 --> 01:03:01,409
Don't worry about it. Being a regular dog,...

715
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,251
...is like the greatest gig in the world, okay?

716
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:07,665
Look, I'm gonna let you in, on a little secret, okay?

717
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,316
A little known cat secret.

718
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:11,688
You know why we hate dogs?

719
01:03:11,897 --> 01:03:15,228
Because we wanna be dogs, we have dog complexes.

720
01:03:15,943 --> 01:03:18,913
But... But what are dogs do?

721
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:22,042
Slubber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes.

722
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:24,086
You don't exactly need a master's degree.

723
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:26,647
You know, most dogs living in a place like this.

724
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:29,668
And uhm... Well, I don't know, they do things like...

725
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:32,759
Out of this? But... But...

726
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,780
- And this is your dog bowl. - What is?

727
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:40,200
This! The entire floor! It's the ground, goes to the hound.

728
01:03:40,293 --> 01:03:41,703
How cool is that?

729
01:03:42,495 --> 01:03:46,482
And on cold nights, this and a ball of yarn...

730
01:03:47,636 --> 01:03:49,444
Oh, it doesn't get better than that.

731
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:53,361
You... You seem to know a lot about this places.

732
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:57,583
Yeah, I did my time in one of these, but I'm more be an alley cat at heart, you know?

733
01:03:57,622 --> 01:04:00,391
Sprung out first chance I got, never looked back.

734
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,004
<i>Rhino is awesome! He is so awesome!</i>

735
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:14,158
He is... He is beyond awesome. He... He is "be awesome"!

736
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,316
He is... Uh!

737
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:20,175
I... I am "be awesome".

738
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:30,632
I think it's about time I introduce you to a regular dog piece d'resistance.

739
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:35,225
- Get your head out. - Why?

740
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:36,722
Just do it.

741
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:45,175
This... This is awesome.

742
01:04:46,774 --> 01:04:48,605
And stick your tongue out!

743
01:04:53,104 --> 01:04:55,883
This is totally awesome! Why don't you try it?

744
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:59,343
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:30,343
Alright. Now, open them.

785
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:35,326
Bask in the glow, baby!

786
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,439
Just let me give you the grand tour, okay?

787
01:08:39,242 --> 01:08:44,114
This one, this one is mine. And this one is all yours.

788
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:47,876
- Mittens, I... - Oh, I found this really soft pillow thing for you.

789
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:51,371
And get this! I found some styrofoam and I stuffed it inside...

790
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,307
...which I thought both kind of creative and ironic. You know what I mean?

791
01:08:54,308 --> 01:08:56,416
- Mittens, I don't think that... - Check it out!

792
01:08:57,211 --> 01:09:01,085
Total privacy and completely sound proof!

793
01:09:01,087 --> 01:09:04,625
- Yeah, well, I don't think that I... - Okay, I lied. It's not sound proof.

794
01:09:04,727 --> 01:09:07,254
- But, you know... - Mittens, I can't stay here.

795
01:09:10,075 --> 01:09:13,539
- What? - We're one waffle away from Penny.

796
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:17,258
You still going back to her?

797
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:20,419
Mittens, she is my person.

798
01:09:23,837 --> 01:09:25,402
Ouch! Ouch! Ear, ear!

799
01:09:28,545 --> 01:09:31,446
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

800
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,478
Now, how about this, huh? Is that real?

801
01:09:34,973 --> 01:09:39,600
Is this look real to you? Or that? Is that real? Or that?

802
01:09:40,003 --> 01:09:43,853
How about that, Bolt? She is an actress.

803
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:48,014
- She is just pretending. - Not Penny.

804
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:51,992
There is no Penny. She is fake.

805
01:09:52,027 --> 01:09:53,684
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

806
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:57,302
No, no Bolt. That's what they do, okay?

807
01:09:57,366 --> 01:10:00,867
They act like they love you. They act like they'll be there forever.

808
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,847
And then one day, they pack up all their stuff and move away,...

809
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:06,075
...and take their love with them.

810
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:09,926
And leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself!

811
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:17,370
They leave her...

812
01:10:17,859 --> 01:10:21,988
...wondering what she did wrong.

813
01:10:27,787 --> 01:10:29,745
I'm sorry Mittens, but...

814
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:33,418
Penny is different.

815
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,992
Then go.

816
01:10:39,924 --> 01:10:42,238
- Mittens, I... - Get out of here, Bolt!

817
01:10:43,855 --> 01:10:46,065
I never should take a pitty on you.

818
01:10:47,169 --> 01:10:49,290
- Oh, Mittens... - Just get out of here, Bolt!

819
01:10:58,784 --> 01:11:00,482
You take care of Mittens.

820
01:11:37,867 --> 01:11:41,556
That meat lover's pizza is not loving me back at all!

821
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:46,252
- Hey there, Rhino. - Morning, cat.

822
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:51,525
- Where is Bolt? - He is... Uh...

823
01:11:52,529 --> 01:11:56,349
- He's gone. - Bolt left?

824
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:02,326
Yeah, but he... Uhm... He instructed me to tell you, that he... Uhm...

825
01:12:02,672 --> 01:12:05,512
He had to face the green-eyed man alone.

826
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:12,524
- Where are you going? - To Bolt.

827
01:12:13,194 --> 01:12:15,503
But he doesn't need us anymore.

828
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:19,156
Trust me, I've seen that a million times before.

829
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:23,898
In the cold, dark night before the battle when the steely fangs of evil...

830
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:25,821
...are sharpened and posed to strike...

831
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:29,865
...the hero must go and face his greatest challenge alone.

832
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:33,186
But if Bolt's taught me anything,...

833
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:37,179
...it's that you never abandon a friend in a time of need!

834
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:40,685
When your team mates in trouble, you go.

835
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:43,396
Whether they ask or not, you go!

836
01:12:43,747 --> 01:12:45,995
Not knowing if you're coming back dead or alive...

837
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,001
He went the other way.

838
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:52,795
...you go! Knowing how deep the shrapnels gonna pierce your hide, you go!

839
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,195
Penny!

840
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:24,800
No way! Wow! Bolt! I'm really a big fan of yours, brother.

841
01:13:24,836 --> 01:13:27,439
I'm Blake. This is my partner, Tom. Tom, say what's up.

842
01:13:27,564 --> 01:13:28,607
- What's up? - Wow!

843
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:29,633
Oh, no!

844
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:31,584
And this is our personal assistant, Billy...

845
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,661
...who is supposed to wait up on the wire.

846
01:13:33,662 --> 01:13:36,384
Bolt, I've been admired you such a long time and there is something I always wanted...

847
01:13:36,421 --> 01:13:38,247
...to tell you if I ever get a chance to meet you. And now...

848
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,036
Okay Billy, that was horrifying what you just did.

849
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,132
Why don't you make yourself useful? Go, get me some bread crumbs. Whole grain. Go!

850
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:45,353
Whole-wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy!

851
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:47,080
- Not the same, Billy! - Do not come out with whole-wheat!

852
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:48,568
Or pumpernickle Billy!

853
01:13:48,919 --> 01:13:52,260
- Okay guys, but I really gotta get going. - I know. I know you're a busy dog.

854
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,902
But if you got a second, we'd love to pitch you an idea for your show.

855
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:57,251
Tom's better pitching. I'll let him taking from here.

856
01:13:57,252 --> 01:13:58,780
Tom has got the spotlight.

857
01:14:02,082 --> 01:14:03,689
Wait for it!

858
01:14:05,597 --> 01:14:07,656
- Aliens. - Holy snap!

859
01:14:07,858 --> 01:14:11,020
- Aliens? - Audiences love aliens.

860
01:14:11,021 --> 01:14:11,752
Holy crap!

861
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:14,586
- It'll be huge man, huge! - You can't touch us!

862
01:14:17,298 --> 01:14:21,264
I love it. I'll tell you what, if you guys can help me find Penny,...

863
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:23,323
...the girl from the television show...

864
01:14:23,775 --> 01:14:27,591
...I'd love hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way.

865
01:14:27,981 --> 01:14:30,107
- We got a nibble! - Don't freak out.

866
01:14:30,122 --> 01:14:31,942
This is how you blew with Nemo.

867
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,138
We open exterior outer space scenery.

868
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,406
Calico comes for your Penny.

869
01:14:39,443 --> 01:14:40,903
And then you squish him.

870
01:14:50,477 --> 01:14:54,134
And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny toward to alien mother ship...

871
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,622
...we fade to black.

872
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:58,169
And we have a great pop song for the end credits.

873
01:14:58,206 --> 01:15:00,161
Talk your people. We're ready to move on this.

874
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:02,027
He's so on board!

875
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:12,306
There it is!

876
01:15:16,247 --> 01:15:19,422
The most terrifying place on earth!

877
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:44,025
At long last, we've arrived at he belly of the beast.

878
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:47,758
The lair of the green-eyed man!

879
01:15:48,614 --> 01:15:50,070
Rhino, hold up!

880
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:53,039
Hold up!

881
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:55,712
What, what is the problem? I'm... I'm pumped!

882
01:15:56,254 --> 01:16:01,523
Listen, this may be really hard for you to understand...

883
01:16:01,559 --> 01:16:04,565
...but you see, sometimes things aren't what they seem to be...

884
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,757
...and sometimes when you think something is really real and it's not,...

885
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,796
All of my training has prepared me for this moment.

886
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:15,703
Die! Die!

887
01:16:18,243 --> 01:16:22,663
Prepare yourself, foul man-beast! I will eat your pancreas...

888
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:26,276
...with your spleen and then I will rip your liver out of your...

889
01:16:28,288 --> 01:16:31,440
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

890
01:16:31,715 --> 01:16:34,411
<i>Oh, I had a hamster just like you when I was a kid.</i>

891
01:17:05,194 --> 01:17:06,299
<i>Bolt!</i>

892
01:17:08,752 --> 01:17:10,711
Bolt! You're okay!

893
01:17:12,143 --> 01:17:13,599
Oh, you came back!

894
01:17:22,483 --> 01:17:25,608
Bolt, I thought I've lost you.

895
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:40,261
You're my good boy.

896
01:18:06,403 --> 01:18:07,349
Good boy.

897
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:10,980
Okay, people. Let's move to stage 7 and do it for real.

898
01:18:18,635 --> 01:18:21,095
- I miss him. - I know, honey.

899
01:18:22,351 --> 01:18:23,807
I do too.

900
01:18:26,962 --> 01:18:28,778
<i>First positions, please!</i>

901
01:18:39,968 --> 01:18:41,675
Okay, hold still a little sweetie.

902
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:56,423
<i>15, take 1. Mark.</i>

903
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,672
<i>And action.</i>

904
01:19:08,881 --> 01:19:11,494
Ah, Professor.

905
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:15,296
I'd like to thank you for granting us an access...

906
01:19:15,332 --> 01:19:19,487
...to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

907
01:19:19,592 --> 01:19:21,897
You know I'd never do such a thing.

908
01:19:21,998 --> 01:19:28,232
Unless it was only way to save your little girl's life!

909
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,534
- Penny! - Daddy!

910
01:19:31,237 --> 01:19:33,096
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

911
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:37,614
Your dog is nowhere near...

912
01:19:40,778 --> 01:19:43,088
Get that dog!

913
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:48,907
Go! Go, go!

914
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,076
It's okay, boy. Come here.

915
01:19:58,152 --> 01:20:01,015
Fire! Fire! Fire! It's fire!

916
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:08,889
Hey Wags!

917
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:13,196
Mittens? What are you doing here?

918
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:18,083
Long story, short I was tied to a delusional dog and dragged across the country...

919
01:20:19,038 --> 01:20:22,352
...but that is not important now. The real question is,...

920
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:26,318
...what are you doing here and why aren't you in there?

921
01:20:27,912 --> 01:20:30,026
You were right about her, Mittens.

922
01:20:31,955 --> 01:20:35,709
She, uh, well... it wasn't real.

923
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,118
No Bolt, it is real.

924
01:20:38,223 --> 01:20:41,324
I was in there just now, I saw her face after you left.

925
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:43,450
She's broken hearted.

926
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:47,756
She doesn't want just any dog, she loves you.

927
01:20:49,564 --> 01:20:54,840
She's your person, Bolt, and you are her dog.

928
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:01,716
- Bolt, you just gonna have to trust me on this. - Mittens, be quiet!

929
01:21:02,771 --> 01:21:06,039
- No, you need to hear this! - No, no, seriously, be quiet!

930
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:08,589
What is it?

931
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:11,740
Penny!

932
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:16,323
- Help! Please, help! Help! - Hold on!

933
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,194
Please!

934
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:36,514
Oh, my gosh! The stage!

935
01:21:36,694 --> 01:21:38,903
Yeah, you better run!

936
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:44,407
- I'm on your six. - What are we do?

937
01:21:44,684 --> 01:21:46,420
Just make sure I get inside that building!

938
01:21:49,786 --> 01:21:50,791
Bolt?

939
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:55,651
- Is anyone still in there? - I don't know.

940
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,700
Coming through!

941
01:22:04,428 --> 01:22:09,178
- It's a good day to die! - Not on my watch, rodent!

942
01:22:38,507 --> 01:22:39,512
Bolt!

943
01:22:53,855 --> 01:22:55,261
I knew you'll come back.

944
01:23:17,175 --> 01:23:19,384
Bolt, zoom zoom!

945
01:23:54,974 --> 01:23:56,017
Bolt...

946
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:01,190
Bolt, just... just go on and out.

947
01:24:03,473 --> 01:24:04,771
Go.

948
01:24:06,687 --> 01:24:07,941
It'll be okay.

949
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:18,637
You're my good boy.

950
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:21,635
I love you.

951
01:24:32,496 --> 01:24:35,559
Have you seen my daughter? Has anyone seen my baby?

952
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:07,613
- Did you hear that? - Yeah.

953
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:10,107
Quiet! Everyone be quiet!

954
01:25:17,595 --> 01:25:19,603
It's the super bark!

955
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:23,506
- It's coming from over there! - Come on, let's go, go!

956
01:25:37,663 --> 01:25:41,282
Over here! We found them! They're here! We found them!

957
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:48,847
Alright, we got a RG coming through people! Make it hole!

958
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,989
<i>For your own safety, stay away from the building!</i>

959
01:25:59,394 --> 01:26:01,353
- Bolt. - Sweetie!

960
01:26:02,762 --> 01:26:06,482
You're okay! Oh, you gotta be okay. You're gonna be just fine.

961
01:26:06,796 --> 01:26:08,783
- She is stable. - We're gonna take her to the hospital...

962
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:10,035
...just to be safe.

963
01:26:19,453 --> 01:26:22,157
I'm so, so, so sorry does happened.

964
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:24,152
I can't imagine, what you must feeling.

965
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:28,843
No mother should ever have to go through something like this, but I...

966
01:26:29,276 --> 01:26:33,743
...promise you, we're going to make this work for us.

967
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:38,150
I'm talking cover stories, production deals, executive producer credit...

968
01:26:38,295 --> 01:26:40,102
This is so great!

969
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,746
We quit!

970
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:49,682
No, no, wait! Let's not make any rush decisions.

971
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:52,174
Let's put a pin on it.

972
01:27:04,124 --> 01:27:07,235
I'm afraid your injuries far more severe...

973
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:09,347
...then we've previously thought, my dear.

974
01:27:09,848 --> 01:27:13,465
We have to completely reconstruct your face.

975
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:17,126
Have a look.

976
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,936
At least Calico won't be able to recognize me.

977
01:27:29,012 --> 01:27:30,484
Calico!

978
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:43,933
Bolt!

979
01:27:53,089 --> 01:27:54,132
What?

980
01:28:04,964 --> 01:28:06,529
Aliens!

981
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:13,567
That is totally unrealistic.

982
01:28:13,903 --> 01:28:17,727
- Absolutely "redonkulous". - You could say that again.

983
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,736
Oh! Oh, yeah! Right there! Right there! Over!

984
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:24,104
Yeah, that's the spot.

985
01:28:33,587 --> 01:28:34,892
Hey, silly doggy!

986
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:42,324
That's a keeper.

987
01:28:42,826 --> 01:28:46,291
You wanna go play outside, huh? You wanna go play outside?

988
01:28:47,044 --> 01:28:48,149
Let's go!

989
01:29:01,205 --> 01:29:07,439
- Is that dog look familiar? - Nope. I've never seen him before in my life.

990
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:22,412
<i># There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

991
01:29:22,517 --> 01:29:29,905
<i># cuz that home belongs to you.</i>
