The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol,,

星星为何不会从天空坠落
why don't the stars fall from the sky

圆周运动主宰宇宙
Because the circle reigns in the heavens,

22
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:19,535
因而星星永不坠落
the stars have never fallen and they never will.

No, you're both speaking about the same thing,

If there were no center

Will it make a little difference,

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,616
好了
There.

144
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,161
谢谢您
Thank you.

145
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:10,626
我想让你知道主人对此很失望
I want you to know that the Master is upset with himself about this.

146
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,550
那是什么?
What is that?

147
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,721
是我做的小玩意  女主人
Something I made, Mistress.

148
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,932
这看上去像是一个
But it looks like a,

149
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:28,894
这到底是什么?
What is it?

150
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:31,814
这是托勒密的天体系统
It's Ptolemaic System.

151
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:33,565
的确如此
It is.

152
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,444
这是你做的吗?
Did you do this?

153
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,656
这是地球
Earth

154
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:43,909
她是宇宙的中心
is the center of the cosmos

155
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,454
而环绕四周的有
and revolving around it

156
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,290
太阳以及5大行星
the Sun and the five wanderers:

157
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,168
水星  金星  火星  木星  土星
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

158
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:54,962
并没有遵守圆周运行轨迹的规律
Obstinately disobeying the law of the circle.

159
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,465
然而托勒密却向我们证明
Nevertheless, Ptolemy shows us that

160
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,508
他们遵守圆周规律
they do obey.

161
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,553
他们之所以绕圈运动
The fact that we see them move in a loop

162
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:06,015
是由两个天体环形运转合力而为
is due to the joint effect of two circles.

163
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:10,394
其中一个绕地球旋转
One that travels around the Earth

164
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:16,233
另一个沿着较小的圆形轨迹自转
and another lesser circle prophet to each wanderer.

165
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,193
看  那是本轮
Look, the epicycles.

166
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:19,987
你们所看到的并非真正的规律
See, it's not heaven or earth.

167
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,781
只是双眼蒙骗了我们
But our eyes that deceive us.

168
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,992
说的真好  达乌斯
Well said, Davus.

169
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:26,869
你的讲解证明
I'd like you to know that your exposition shows me

170
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:34,251
你比在座的某些人更加用心
that you've been paying closer attention than One or two,others here.

171
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,381
听着  上帝在造物之前
I tell you, the gods should have consulted me

172
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,716
都应该先征询我的意见
before they created anything.

173
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,969
你这从何说起  俄瑞斯特斯
Why do you say that, Orestes?

174
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,764
所有的这些都太古怪了
It all seem so whimsical!

175
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,600
为什么是两个天体  环形运转合力而为呢
Why the joint effect of two circles?

176
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:54,813
如果行星不按自己的本轮公转
Wouldn't it be more perfect, if the wanderers didn't wander,

177
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:57,816
而只按一个环形轨迹公转  不是更合理吗
and a single circle gave sense to everything?

178
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,070
俄瑞斯特斯  你有什么资格  评判上帝的杰作
Orestes, by what authority do you judge the work of God?

179
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:05,657
我哪儿得罪你了吗?  基督徒
What is wrong with you, Christians?

180
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,286
难道人都不能开口说话了吗?
Can a man no longer open his mouth in this city?

181
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:11,997
你批判天地万物  你批判我们的主
If you criticize creation, you criticize our Lord and you offend us.

182
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:13,415
因而你冒犯了我们
You should move out to the desert.

183
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:14,625
你该搬到沙漠里去
You won't hear anything,

184
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,710
这样你永远都不会听到这些逆耳之词
to offend you out there.

185
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,339
你们不知所云  所有人都如此
You know nothing of what you speak. None of you.

186
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:27,346
辛奈西斯  欧基里得的第一公理是什么?
Synesius, what is Euclid's first rule?

187
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:30,474
你为什么问这个?
Why the question?

188
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:32,434
只要回答我
Just, answer me.

189
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,231
那个
If,

190
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:40,567
等于同量的量
if two things are equal to a third thing,

191
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,778
彼此相等
then they are all equal to each other.

192
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,446
很好
Good.

193
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,783
你们都和我非常熟识吧
Now, are you both not similar to me?

194
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:52,788
是的
Yes.

195
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:54,540
那你呢?  俄瑞斯特斯
And you, Orestes?

196
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,959
也是
Yes.

197
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:02,381
在此我向你们郑重声明
Now, I'm actually saying this to everybody here in this room.

198
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,718
我们要团结而不是分裂
More things unite us than divide us.

199
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,346
无论外面事态如何  我们都亲如手足
Now, whatever maybe going on in the streets. We are brothers.

200
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,974
我们亲如手足
We are brothers.

201
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,435
我希望你们记住
I want you to remember

202
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,020
我们并非奴隶或者乌合之众
that brawls are for slaves and periphera.

203
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,733
现在我们用热烈的掌声
Now I think we should all honor Davus,

204
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,818
感谢达乌斯为我们讲解这些知识
with some very well earned applause.

205
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,411
他们会决定我们每个人是生是死
He'll judge us all alive and dead.

206
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,788
到了那个时候就为时已晚
And then it will be too late,

207
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:38,876
只有那些信仰耶稣的人
because only those who believed in Jesus

208
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:40,627
才能得到救赎
will be saved.

209
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,130
你们此时不皈依吾主
What are you waiting for?

210
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,215
更待何时
What are you waiting for?

211
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,552
上帝之国在你我上方
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

212
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,680
你们听懂我说的话了吗?
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

213
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,140
听懂了
Yes.

214
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,976
你们明白要像个人吗?
Yeah but do you understand like men do?

215
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:58,562
或者你们不明白  就像只小羊羔
Do you, not your head, a sheep?

216
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,818
你在这看什么?
What are you looking at?

217
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,820
对  就是你
Yes, you.

218
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,697
你在这里干什么?
What are you looking here?

219
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,200
你是阿摩尼阿斯吗?
Are you Ammonius?

220
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,659
那个创造奇迹的人
The man who performed the miracle?

221
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,788
你想看到奇迹吗?
Do you want to see a miracle?

222
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,082
你是他吗?
Are you the one?

223
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,541
我是
I am.

224
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,461
跟我来
Come with me.

225
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:29,009
耶稣走遍加利利
Jesus went throughout Galilee

226
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:31,428
在各会堂里教训人
teaching in their synagogues.

227
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:34,223
传送天国的福音
Preaching the good news for you

228
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:38,519
医治百姓各样的病症
and healing the diseases of sick.

229
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,690
他的名声就传遍了叙利亚
News about him spread going to Syria

230
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,235
来自世界各地的人们  都慕名前来朝拜他
and people came from all over the world.

231
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:48,112
那是西奥勒斯
That is Theophilus.

232
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:50,614
我们的主教
Bishop.

233
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,411
因为天国是他们的
For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

234
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,122
哀恸之人有福了
Blessed are those who mourn

235
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,708
因为他们必得安慰
for they will be comforted.

236
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,878
温柔之人有福了
Blessed are the meek

237
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,757
因为他们必继承土地
for they will inherit the earth.

238
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,345
饥渴慕义之人有福了
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness

239
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:16,265
因为他们必得饱足
for they will be filled.

240
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:17,725
天主的世界
The word of God!

241
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,810
怜恤人之人有福了
Blessed are the merciful

242
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,979
因为他们必蒙怜恤
for they will be shown mercy.

243
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,649
清心之人有福了
Blessed are the pure in heart,

244
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,818
因为他们必得见神
for they will see God.

245
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,531
天主与你同在
The Lord be with you.

246
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:36,160
你是怎么穿过那火焰的?
So how are you able to escape the flames?

247
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,871
-天主与你同在  -也与你同在
-The Lord be with you. -And with you.

248
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,915
你觉得呢?我祈祷而已
What do you think I did? I prayed.

249
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,961
你可能都不知道该如何祈祷吧?
You probable do not even know how.

250
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,883
你那包里有什么?
What do you have in that sack?

251
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,677
-有吃的吗?  -这是我主人的
-Do you have any food here? -It's for my Master.

252
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,679
你没什么毛病吧?
What's wrong with you?

253
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:58,599
给你的话  我就得自己掏腰包了
I have to pay for that with my own money!

254
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,185
你要钱干什么?
What do you need money for?

255
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,896
看看他们的眼神
Look at their faces.

256
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,443
来
Here.

257
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,154
我想让你自己来试试
I want you to try it yourself.

258
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,783
然后我教你怎么祈祷
And afterwards I will teach you how to pray.

259
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:17,368
来
Go on.

260
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,290
-天主与你同在  -主保佑你
-The Lord be with you. -Bless you.

261
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,167
看见了吗?
See?

262
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,169
这就是奇迹
That is a miracle!

263
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:30,297
继续  接着发
Go on, keep doing it.

264
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:37,471
神与你同在
The Lord be with you.

265
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,264
谢谢
Please.

266
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,393
谢谢你
Thank you.

267
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:48,941
神保佑你
Bless you,

268
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,985
主保佑你
God bless you.

269
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,197
保佑你
Bless you.

270
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,840
奴隶
Hey, slave!

271
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,299
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

272
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:20,848
达乌斯
Davus.

273
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,559
奴隶达乌斯
Davus the slave!

274
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,021
你像个真正的基督圣战士
Now, you look like a true parabolani.

275
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,732
一名真正的耶稣的战士
A true soldier of Christ.

276
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,076
他们说什么呢?
What are they saying now?

277
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,370
让他们跳舞
Telling them to dance.

278
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,081
他们正畅饮美酒呢
The men are now heavy with wine.

279
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,169
出海旅行
All aboard!

280
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,628
多么不幸的旅途
Oh what an unfortunate wreck.

281
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:53,797
救救你的奴仆吧
Save your servants!

282
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,591
第二幕结束
End of Part Two!

283
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,269
谢谢观看  各位观众
Thank you, audience, thank you.

284
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:10,564
我们现在要更换道具以及演出服装
Now, excuse the delay while we move things around,

285
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,648
希望大家谅解
and change our costumes.

286
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,368
不好意思
Good evening

287
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,870
原谅我的大胆
Forgive my boldness.

288
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:26,747
我是俄瑞斯特斯
I am Orestes,

289
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,415
俄瑞斯特斯家的儿子
son of Orestes.

290
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,669
我在这
I'm here to,

291
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:38,008
我在这想说出  对哲学家希帕蒂亚的爱意
I'm here to declare my love for Hypatia, the philosopher.

292
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,719
而她也深知这点
I mean, you all no doubt know

293
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,555
我采纳了她给我的建议
for some time now, following her counseling.

294
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:46,558
我投身于音乐当中
I have devoted myself to music.

295
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:50,104
希望在声音的和谐中寻求到一丝慰藉
In the hope of seeking solace in the harmony of its sounds.

296
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:52,815
但对我来说
But for me,

297
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,985
只有我倾慕的女士身上才有这种和谐
such harmony resides only in my lady.

298
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,030
所以
So,

299
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,659
我站在这只是为了
My purpose here is merely to,

300
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,953
献上我的音乐
offer my melody

301
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,580
并且希望
in the hopes of,

302
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,252
不用再说了
Stop talking.

303
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:12,246
那人肯定很有前途
That man will go far, I tell you.

304
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:17,751
如果我准备的是香蕉而不是无花果
He's my preferred fruit for the banana not the fig,

305
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,420
我早就扔在他脚下了
I would have already fallen at his feet.

306
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:24,842
你准备怎么回礼呢?
Wouldn't it be best to please him?

307
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,635
我吗?
Me?

308
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,762
怎么回礼?
How?

309
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,015
格来提  你能阻止的了你的女儿吗?
Granting him your daughter's hand.

310
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,308
难道你不打算让她嫁人吗?
Why don't you ever plan to marry her off?

311
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,563
希帕蒂亚嫁给一个男人  不读书不教书
Hypatia subject to a man? Without freedom to teach?

312
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:41,525
甚至不谈她的那些想法吗?
Or even to speak her mind.

313
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,445
我认识的最杰出的哲学家
The most brilliant philosopher I know

314
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,530
必须要放弃科学
having to give up her science.

315
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,658
不  那会让她生不如死的
No, that could be death to her.

316
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:57,291
没错  她的工作受人敬仰
It's true. Her work is admirable.

317
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,627
并且她德才兼备
That she's brilliant and virtuous.

318
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:03,672
可是赛昂
But Theon,

319
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:06,675
别忘了她的处境啊
She has not found her gift.

320
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:09,261
她只是个女人
Being a woman, I mean.

321
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:16,477
我们在天上的父  宅心仁厚
Our Father who art in heaven,

322
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,027
别让她答应别人
Don't let anyone have her.

323
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:30,532
求你别让她答应别人
Please, don't anyone else have her.

324
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:36,080
别让别人  别让她答应任何人
Don't let anyone else have her.

325
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:42,419
阿门
Amen.

326
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,093
早安  老师
Good day, lady.

327
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:50,678
早安  老师
Good day, lady.

328
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,346
早安
Good day, lady.

329
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:56,934
早安  老师
Good day lady.

330
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,277
昨天很多人看到  你们的同学把他的乐器
Yesterday, many of you would have seen one of your colleagues

331
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,863
献给了我
present me an ollos

332
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:13,283
我接受了礼物
I accepted the gift.

333
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:17,162
而今天我也想回送给他一份礼物
And today I wish to make him earn a gift of my own in return.

334
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:30,300
这是给你的
This is for you.

335
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,522
这是我的经血
It is the blood of my cycle.

336
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:49,153
俄瑞斯特斯你
Orestes you,

337
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:52,614
你说你在我身上找到了和谐
You say that you have found harmony in me.

338
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,909
那我建议你看看周围
Well, I am suggesting that you look elsewhere

339
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,662
因为我觉得周围也存在着
because I think that there is little harmony or,

340
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,582
和谐和美丽
beauty in that.

341
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,170
你觉得呢?
Don't you agree?

342
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:19,808
昨天我们谈到了阿波罗尼斯锥
Yesterday we were discussing the Apollonian cone.

343
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:23,562
我们讲了圆形  椭圆  物线
We discussed the circle, the ellipse, the parabola.

344
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,398
-今天我们来讲双曲线  -老师
-Today we will discuss the hyperbola. -Lady!

345
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,401
不好意思  老师
Forgive me, Lady.

346
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,364
奥林匹斯要你赶快到神庙去
Olympius requires your presence urgently in the Serapeum.

347
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,991
你们也是
You as well.

348
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:53,926
感谢主  感谢主
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

349
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,011
感谢主
Thank you, Lord.

350
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:01,016
难道我们要忍受他们诋毁我们的信仰
How are we to enjoy them force feeding us the faith

351
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,062
习俗  甚至我们的人民吗?
and customs to people who until recently becoming outlaws?

352
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,147
-发生什么事了?  -这是种亵渎
-What's happening? -It's despicable. A sacrilege.

353
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,192
基督徒已经在城市广场集会了
Christians have gathered in the Agora.

354
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:12,277
他们在嘲弄我们的神明
They are mocking the gods.

355
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:14,863
我们必须阻止这些亵渎
We must put an end these insults!

356
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,448
他们也许不怕他
They may not fear him,

357
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,660
但他们一定会怕我们的利剑
but they will fear our swords.

358
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:24,456
等等
Wait!

359
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:25,708
等等
Wait!

360
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,584
你们要干什么?
Now, what is it you are going to do?

361
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:30,295
你们要去袭击他们吗?
Are you going to attack them?

362
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,174
只因为他们的无礼  就让他们血溅当场吗?
Are you going to stain your hands with blood for an insult?

363
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:38,762
是对神明们  对神明们的亵渎
To the gods! An insult to the gods!

364
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:40,556
如果你觉得他们过分
Well, if you think it is so outrageous then go

365
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,099
应该直接去通知本地的提督
and announce their acts before the prefect.

366
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,768
你好像在保护他们
One might think that you're protecting them.

367
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:47,896
我在尽力保护我们的学生们
I am trying to protect our disciples.

368
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:50,399
而你  在煽动他们成为野蛮的杀人犯
You, are inciting them to be violent murderers.

369
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:55,279
赛昂  作为首领  由你来决定吧
Theon, as director, you have the last word.

370
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:04,163
必须压制他们对神明们的不敬
The insult must be answered.

371
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,832
犹太教徒可以自愿参加
Those Jews amongst you do as you please.

372
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,334
这不是你们的战争
This is not your battle.

373
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,251
而这里的基督徒们
As for you Christians

374
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:11,045
你们最好去找你们的耶稣
you would do well to join those of your own fate.

375
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:14,798
你不能让我的学生走出这个建筑
You will not caused my disciples out of this house!

376
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,677
-塞拉皮斯万岁  -为了神明们
-Glory be to Serapis! -And all the gods!

377
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:21,180
等我的命令
Wait for my command!

378
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,058
在我们包围他们前  不会有人怀疑我们的
No one must suspect us until we have them surrounded.

379
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:28,687
这些剑是给奴隶的  奴隶们
The clubs are for the slaves. Slaves!

380
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,856
奴隶也要参加
Slaves are all for summon!

381
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,652
达乌斯  回去
Davus, back.

382
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:37,321
不  回去
No. Go back.

383
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,406
杀了基督徒
Death to Christians!

384
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,999
塞拉皮斯万岁
Glory be to Serapis!

385
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,354
让我们聆听她的声音
Let's listen to her now!

386
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:15,984
你们听到她的抱怨了吗?
Do you hear any complaint?

387
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:17,569
没有
No!

388
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:21,240
这一座也失声了
This one has lost her voice too!

389
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,496
他们的嘴不能说话
Their mouths do not speak,

390
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:29,456
他们的眼看不到东西
their eyes do not see,

391
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:31,542
他们的鼻子闻不到味道
their nose doesn't smell.

392
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:36,755
但多神教徒却要跪倒在他们面前
Yet still, pagans come here and kneel before them.

393
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,012
这是多么的疯狂啊
What madness is this?

394
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,437
顺从神明们的旨意
For the gods!

395
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:53,582
梅多罗
Medorus!
Take care of your master! Protect it,!

396
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:01,215
上帝只有一个
God is one!

397
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:11,517
打倒异教徒
Death to the pagans!

398
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:17,773
你  你看什么呢?  打啊
You! What are you looking at? Get there and fight!

399
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:29,660
打啊
Fight!

400
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,205
你聋了吗?  我说打啊
Are you deaf? I said fight!

401
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:48,971
我是个基督徒
I'm a Christian!

402
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:53,892
我是个基督徒
I am a Christian!

403
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,355
我是个基督徒
I am a Christian!

404
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:08,657
-什么是基督?  -基督是神
-What is Christ? -Christ is one!

405
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,160
打倒异教徒
Death to the pagans!

406
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,579
上帝只有一个
God is one!

407
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,835
不  不
No! No!

408
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,631
入口  我们必须守住入口
The entrance! We must defend the entrance!

409
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,925
怎么了?
What's happening?

410
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,636
我们的人被基督徒打败了
Our men are being sent back by the Christians!

411
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,197
父亲
Father!

412
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,034
没事  没事
It's alright. It's alright.

413
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:55,913
怎么了?
What happened?

414
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,415
是他的奴隶干的
It was his slave.

415
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:04,046
达乌斯  给我拿些布那些水来  快
Davus, get me some cloth some water, quickly.

416
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,131
父亲
Father,

417
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:12,721
辛奈西斯  我们得离开这里
Synesius, we must get out of here.

418
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,139
扶住他别动
Hold him still.

419
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:30,114
基督徒们来了
Parabolani are coming!

420
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:47,089
上帝与我们同在
God is with us!

421
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,551
哈利路亚  哈利路亚
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

422
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,345
-关上大门  -别  我们的人还在外面
-Close the gates! -You know our men are still out there!

423
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,431
愿神明们保佑他们
May the gods protect them.

424
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,516
我说关上大门
Close the gates,I said!

425
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,502
别杀他  我们把他留作人质像那其它基督徒一样
Don't kill him! He'll be our hostage like the others.

426
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:27,796
大家都听见了吗?
Did you hear it everyone?

427
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:30,382
你抓到的所有基督徒
Any Christian you catch

428
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:31,842
如今都是人质
is now a hostage.

429
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:35,304
把我们的伤者送去寺院
Take our wounded to the temple

430
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:37,056
基督徒带到地下室去
and the Christians down into the cellars.

431
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:39,975
眼神好的人去墙上观察情况
And anyone with a good eye and a good aim up on the walls.

432
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:41,018
奥林匹斯
Olympius.

433
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:43,187
他是个基督徒
This one is a Christian.

434
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,481
没错  还有那三个
Yes, and those three as well.

435
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:49,276
如果他们是基督徒  他们就得去地下室
If they are Christians, they will go down to the cellars.

436
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:49,777
奥林匹斯
Olympius

437
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,278
如果你要囚禁我的兄弟们
if you are going to imprison my brothers

438
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:53,197
你就得把我也关起来
then you are going to have to imprison me with them.

439
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:56,325
如果必须如此  我会这样做的
If it is necessary, I will do that.

440
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,078
如果任何人
If anyone,

441
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:01,955
任何人
anyone,

442
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:07,169
敢碰我兄弟们一根指头
dare lay a finger on one of my brothers

443
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:10,714
我发誓我会刺穿他的身体
I swear I'll run in for you.

444
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,510
看
Look!

445
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,679
看这个
Look at this!

446
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:25,646
俄瑞斯特斯
Orestes.

447
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:28,691
谢谢你
Thank you.

448
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,876
什么时候开始?
Since when were there

449
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,336
有这么多基督徒的
so many Christians?

450
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:51,922
我们不得不和他们谈判了
We'll talk to them to negotiate.

451
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:24,913
我们在等什么?
What are we waiting for?

452
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:26,665
一个基督徒君主能做些什么呢
What can we expect from a Christian emperor?

453
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:28,542
除非我们收起刀剑
Except we'll be put in a sword.

454
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:32,087
至少我现在活了下来
Our sense of positive being the life when his verdict arrives.

455
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:33,422
小心
Here will do.

456
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,884
请大家都不要擅自行动
No one should leave the group, please.

457
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:40,721
他们要整夜祈祷吗?
Are they going to pray all night?

458
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:47,728
达乌斯
Davus.

459
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:49,271
待在这儿
Stay here.

460
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,856
这里很安全
It's safer here.

461
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,155
好好的留在这吧
Just stay with him first.

462
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:42,491
辛奈西斯  你要干什么?
Synesius! What are you doing?

463
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:49,248
老师  姐姐  母亲
Lady, sister and mother,

464
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:52,167
愿主祝福并保护你
May God bless you and protect you.

465
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,376
退后
Move back!

466
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:17,586
奴隶至死都吃这个
Slaves take it to the back.

467
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:20,589
奴隶排最后
Slaves get to the back!

468
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:23,509
三个一出现了
If this three one come out.

469
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,678
会是场灾难
It's a disaster.

470
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:27,680
父亲  你什么时候才能不掷骰子?
Father, why don't you leave the dice?

471
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:30,808
今天有人看过伤口了吗?
Have you been seen today?

472
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:32,810
-没有  -没有吗?
-No. -No?

473
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:36,105
让我看一下
Let's have a look.

474
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,858
孩子  向我保证
Promise me, my child, that,

475
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:44,154
在我死后  忘记现在这个愚蠢的老头
when I'm gone, you won't remember this foolish old man.

476
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:45,614
我保证
I promise.

477
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:50,327
记住我曾经的样子
Remember me as I was before.

478
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:55,207
记住那个还能思考  并且
Before when I could still think and,

479
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,292
我
I,

480
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,212
与你共事的我
work with you and,

481
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,632
记住我倾听你心事时的样子
I listen to you.

482
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,511
我怎么会犯下这样的大错?
How could I have been so wrong?

483
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:11,598
如今因为我的错误  让你被困在这里
Seeing you here locked up because of my,

484
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,142
父亲  请别说了
Father, please.

485
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:15,936
我希望你能够自由
I wanted you to be free.

486
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:25,654
我是自由的
I am free.

487
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:30,451
基督徒们
Hey, Christians.

488
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:32,745
基督徒们
Christians!

489
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,498
你们对上帝的那份自信哪儿去了?
What's that confident God of yours doing now?

490
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,501
进棺材吧  人渣
Maybe coffins for you, scums!

491
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,440
告诉我
So tell me.

492
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:04,026
那些神如今在哪里?
Where are the gods now?

493
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,737
他们在哪?
Where are they?

494
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:10,783
-可能也去找别人了吧?  -别人
-Might as well look for others. -Others?

495
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,161
哪一个?  基督徒的上帝吗?
Which one? The God of the Christians perhaps?

496
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:16,330
真是太放肆了
Such boldness!

497
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:23,504
你怎么想  老师?  你是如此的勇敢
What do you think, Lady? You are so bold.

498
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:30,302
把这盆火灭掉
Put the fire out.

499
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,445
你的确很大胆
You are indeed bold.

500
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:51,573
非常大胆
Very bold.

501
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:54,284
我一直在想你对我说过的那些事
I've been thinking about something you said to me.

502
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:55,536
我吗?
Me?

503
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:58,998
那天你质疑天体的运动轨迹
That day that you criticize the heavenly mechanism

504
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:03,711
而且你把它称为无稽之谈
and you called it whimsical.

505
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,129
是的  尽管
Yes, although,

506
00:42:05,546 --> 00:42:06,714
其实
Actually,

507
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:08,757
我是在质疑托勒密的理论
I was criticizing Ptolemy.

508
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,011
他的本轮理论让一切都变复杂了
For complicating everything with his epicycles.

509
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,681
但我不确定  也许只是有些欠考虑
I don't know perhaps I'm just simple-minded.

510
00:42:15,848 --> 00:42:16,807
不是
No.

511
00:42:18,892 --> 00:42:20,269
天空之上
No, the heavens

512
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,021
应当是简单的
should be simple.

513
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:26,608
那么我是对了还是
So am I right or,?

514
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:32,114
如果
What if,

515
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,618
如果有个更简单的理论可以解释
What if there were simpler explanations

516
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,995
那些行星又当如何?
for the wanderers?

517
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:40,789
有的
There is.

518
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,502
但却太荒谬了  太陈旧了
But it is so absurd, so old.

519
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:48,213
没有人愿意相信它
That no one gives it any credit.

520
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,631
那是什么理论?
What theory is that?

521
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,216
你是在说阿里斯塔克斯吗?
Do you think of Aristarchus?

522
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,927
阿里斯塔克斯认为
Aristarchus maintained

523
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,804
地球本身在移动
that the earth moves.

524
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:59,850
而几大行星的奇怪行为
The strange behavior of the wanderers

525
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:03,020
仅仅是我们的星球
was nothing more than an optical illusion

526
00:43:03,312 --> 00:43:06,106
在围绕着太阳运动时
caused by our movement

527
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:09,568
所产生的光学幻觉而已
in combination with Earth around the sun.

528
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:13,113
-以太阳为中心的模型  -是的
-Heliocentric model. -That's right.

529
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:15,199
太阳在中心
The sun would be in the center

530
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:18,410
仿佛它是宇宙众星的尊贵之王
acting as speaking of it as "King of the Stars".

531
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:21,997
-让我们变成了  -他的著作
-It would make Earth just,another wanderer. -His work was lost

532
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,209
在主图书馆的一场大火中被烧毁了
in the fire that destroyed the mother library.

533
00:43:26,043 --> 00:43:30,214
这就是我们必须好好保护  这地方的原因
This is why we have to take great care of this place.

534
00:43:30,422 --> 00:43:32,257
我们的图书馆
Our library

535
00:43:32,257 --> 00:43:35,928
存留着人类的所有智慧
is all that remains of the wisdom of men.

536
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,847
但每次扔一个物体
But everytime you drop an object here.

537
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:42,184
谁在说话
Who speaks?

538
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:44,812
原谅我  女主人
Forgive me, Mistress.

539
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:49,608
我一直在听
I was listening.

540
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,819
说吧  达乌斯
Speak up, Davus.

541
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,613
如果地球在移动
If the earth is moving,

542
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:57,866
每当扔下一个物体
every time dropping an object it would,

543
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,244
它就会落到后面才对
fall further behind.

544
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:04,331
而风应该会保持迎面吹来
And the wind would always blow against us.

545
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,418
鸟儿会迷失航向
And the birds would lose their way in flight.

546
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:09,420
我跟你说过
I told you

547
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:13,090
阿里斯塔克斯的假说一点都讲不通
Aristarchus' hypothesis makes no sense at all.

548
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:18,387
我觉得你刚才说的可以被驳倒
I feel that what you just said can be refuted.

549
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,896
但现在我不知道如何去驳倒
But right now I don't know how.

550
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:51,420
给提督让道
Make way for the prefect!

551
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:53,339
让开
Make way!

552
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,342
给提督让道
Make way for the prefect!

553
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:58,135
让开
Make way!

554
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,527
大家都听着
Listen one and all!

555
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:20,115
请大家认真听并遵守君主的裁决
Prepare to hear and obey the verdict of our Emperor.

556
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,705
我  弗拉维乌斯・狄奥多西・奥古斯都
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

557
00:45:26,914 --> 00:45:30,209
猎户区省的君主和最高行政长官
Emperor and Supreme Head of the provinces of the Orient,

558
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:32,127
最近了解到
having been informed of the events,

559
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:35,547
在亚历山大城发生的大事
which recently took place in the City of Alexandria,

560
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:38,050
特此宣布并命令大家
do hereby declare and command

561
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:41,053
这些起义者将会得到保护
that the insurgents shall be pardoned and freed.

562
00:45:51,063 --> 00:45:53,065
而作为我宽宏大量的交换
In exchange for my generosity,

563
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:55,192
起义者必须马上
the insurgents will

564
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:58,696
离开神殿和图书馆
abandon the Serapeum and the Library immediately

565
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:01,949
同时允许基督徒进入
allowing the Christians to enter

566
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:03,575
并处理掉所有卷轴
and dispose off the premises

567
00:46:05,577 --> 00:46:06,745
按其心意
as they see fit.

568
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,964
我们在期待什么?  他们会毁掉一切的
What are we to expect? They'll destroy everything!

569
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,509
多神教徒将会从后门离开
Pagans will leave by the stable.

570
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:21,427
那些书
The Books.

571
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:24,471
从那里你们会被护送至你们的家里
And they will be escorted to their homes.

572
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:27,266
马上执行
Obey this, instant!

573
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:38,110
派一半军队去那边
Send half of the regiment to the other side.

574
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:40,612
其余的等会过去
and send the rest later.

575
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,072
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

576
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:45,075
提督
Prefect.

577
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:47,494
我们这样坚持不了多久
We won't be able to contain this, not for long.

578
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:51,749
以十字架的名义  以十字架的名义
On the cross! On the cross!

579
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,053
留下那些次要的书
Leave the lesser works.

580
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:07,389
-哪些是次要的?  -拿走那些重要的
-Which are the lesser works? -Just take the important ones. The important ones.

581
00:47:12,936 --> 00:47:14,313
士兵们后撤了
The soldiers are withdrawing!

582
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:39,421
奴隶
Slave!

583
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,590
-你们看到我的女主人了吗?  -快过来帮忙
-Have you seen my mistress? -Just get over here and help!

584
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,768
-我们拿不了这么多  -我们需要更多帮助
-They're not carrying so many. -We need more help.

585
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,524
请带我的父亲离开这里
Please go and get my father out of here.

586
00:47:58,524 --> 00:47:59,650
快带他离开这里
Get him out of here now.

587
00:48:07,574 --> 00:48:08,617
奴隶
Slave!

588
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,120
快  快走  快走
Go! Go! Go! Go!

589
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,123
快点  快点
Come on, quickly!

590
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,295
希帕蒂亚和他的学生还在正厅里
Hypatia and her students are still in the atrium.

591
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:21,547
他们疯了吗?
Are they out of their minds?

592
00:48:22,881 --> 00:48:25,384
既然他们想那样  就随他们去吧
If that's what they want, let them burn.

593
00:48:26,218 --> 00:48:27,177
快点
Come on!

594
00:48:27,594 --> 00:48:28,637
快点
Quickly!

595
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:41,900
小姐
Lady.

596
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:45,321
你去哪儿了?  把那个袋子捡起来
Where have you been? Pick up that sack.

597
00:48:45,529 --> 00:48:48,032
-小姐我们得走了  -把那个袋子捡起来
-Lady We have to go. -Pick up the sack!

598
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:53,579
为什么到需要的时候  奴隶总是不在身边
Why are slaves never around when you needed them?

599
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:57,833
-我刚才在  -快点走啊  快点
-I was, -Move!, move your feet, move!

600
00:48:58,876 --> 00:48:59,835
白痴
Idiot!

601
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:19,855
快跑
Run!

602
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,443
快点  没有时间了
There is no time!

603
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:28,280
老师
Lady!

604
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,408
别管这些了
Leave them.

605
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:41,126
上帝只有一个
God is one!

606
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:54,682
赶快
Run!

607
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:05,734
达乌斯
Davus!

608
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:08,112
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

609
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,781
-我们得走了  -达乌斯  你要去哪儿?
-We have to go! -Davus, where are you going?

610
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:12,908
如果他想为我们的神而死  就随他吧
If he wants to die for our gods, let him.

611
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:14,576
达乌斯  不要  不要这样做
Please, no. Please don't do this.

612
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:16,161
-快点  -达乌斯
-Come on! -Davus!

613
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:17,788
-达乌斯  不要  -快走
-Davus, no! -Come on!

614
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:46,775
以十字架的名义
God is one!

615
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:47,586
哈利路亚  哈利路亚  哈利路亚
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

616
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:05,396
奴隶
Slave!

617
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:11,360
达乌斯
Davus!

618
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:13,779
达乌斯
Davus!

619
00:52:15,406 --> 00:52:17,324
奴隶达乌斯
Davus the slave!

620
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:20,327
帮我弄倒这个
Help me with this!

621
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:22,413
帮我
Help me!

622
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:26,792
哈利路亚  哈利路亚  哈利路亚
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

623
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:32,191
多神教徒的人渣
Pagan sinners!

624
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:24,470
最沉重的伤痛都过去了
The Master's wound is festering.

625
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:28,515
我知道
I know.

626
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:33,395
我知道
I know.

627
00:56:05,552 --> 00:56:06,595
达乌斯
Davus.

628
00:56:33,288 --> 00:56:34,331
达乌斯
Davus!

629
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:57,498
你自由了
You're free.

630
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,209
走
Go.

631
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:02,211
走吧

632
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:27,236
从现在开始  在亚历山大
Hence forth, in Alexandria

633
00:58:27,444 --> 00:58:31,073
只许举行基督教和犹太教的庆典
only Christian and Jewish worship shall be permitted.

634
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:32,741
禁止一切多神教的祭祀
Pagan sacrifices,

635
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:36,078
禁止膜拜多神教的象征物
worshipping pagan symbols

636
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:39,748
禁止参观多神教教堂
and visiting pagan temples shall no longer be allowed.

637
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:44,461
任何人敢这么做或注视它们的
Should anyone commit such an act or dare raise his eyes on the statues

638
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,133
古老神像  都将会得到严厉的惩罚
of former gods. He shall be punished without penance.

639
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:05,941
图书馆沦陷后  许多多神教徒皈依基督教

640
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:09,028
希帕蒂亚则继续教学和进行研究

641
00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:11,113
而他之前的学生

642
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:14,283
成为了社会的中流砥柱

643
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:17,369
整个帝国被一分为二

644
00:59:17,369 --> 00:59:20,539
许多基督徒认为  这是世界终结的前兆

645
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:22,583
于是决定过更神圣的生活

646
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,296
基督教圣战士穿梭在大街小巷

647
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:29,882
精力充沛地监督基督徒的品行

648
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:36,263
而犹太教徒的存在让他们无法释怀

649
01:01:57,237 --> 01:01:58,989
该死的犹太人
Damn Jews!

650
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:00,449
该死的犹太人
Damn Jews!

651
01:02:06,413 --> 01:02:09,667
他们只是一群没用的恶棍  畜生
They're just a bunch of good for nothing thugs, packed animals!

652
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,544
乔瑞恩  我亲爱的朋友  冷静点
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

653
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:16,423
让西里尔主教解释一下吧
Let Bishop Cyril speak in his own defense.

654
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,218
提督
Prefect

655
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:21,220
我们那些神圣的圣战士
our blessed parabolani,

656
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:24,223
他们仅仅是
Whom he has just called

657
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:26,433
在打拍子而已
the Beast of Burden.

658
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,895
只是为了附和他们打拍子而已
Devote themselves true enough to carrying burdens.

659
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,982
他们都是残疾人或者病人
crippled, the sick, the lepers,

660
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:34,483
还有石头
And stones!

661
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:36,318
提督  他们带了石头
Prefect, they carry stones.

662
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:38,445
突然冲进剧院
And now, they burst into the theatre

663
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:41,240
他们知道我们无法自卫  还用石头砸我们
and stone us knowing we will do nothing to defend ourselves.

664
01:02:41,323 --> 01:02:44,326
因为今天是安息日
Because it is the Sabbath!

665
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:46,245
在安息日这天  你们应该
On the Sabbath you should honor God

666
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:49,164
在犹太教会堂向主祈祷
in your synagogues instead stuffing yourselves

667
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:50,958
而不是在剧院欣赏戏剧
with sweet set of theater.

668
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,544
正因为这个石头才会落到你们头上
That is why the stones fell upon you.

669
01:02:54,712 --> 01:02:59,008
提督  听到了吗?  他威胁我们  这太过分了
Prefect, do you hear that? Now, he's threatening us. This is too much.

670
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,761
友爱些  我们是合众院
Friends, there are more things that unite us than divide us.

671
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,638
我们是兄弟  我们全都亲如手足
We are brothers! We're all brothers.

672
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:08,976
没有犹太人哪会有你们基督徒?
Where would you Christians be without the Jews?

673
01:03:08,976 --> 01:03:10,102
耶稣就是犹太人
Jesus was a Jew!

674
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:12,438
耶稣就是犹太人
Jesus was a Jew!

675
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:45,679
我发现了点东西
There is,something I find

676
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:47,765
可以反驳你所说的
disturbing in what you've told me.

677
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,142
-是什么?  -好吧
-What?  -Well,

678
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,980
西里尔为什么要开始清理城市?
Why does Cyril speak of cleaning up the city?

679
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:57,358
他已经拥有这么多了还不满足吗?
Is he not satisfied with what he already has?

680
01:03:57,566 --> 01:03:59,652
他只想吓吓犹太人
I think he's just trying to frighten the Jews.

681
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,612
可为什么要当你的面说?
But why say it in front of you?

682
01:04:02,154 --> 01:04:06,116
如果他想对付的是你  而不是他们怎么办?
What if really he was addressing you and not them?

683
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:09,870
我  为什么?  我和他一样都是基督徒
Me? Why? I'm as much as Christian as he is.

684
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:11,038
是的  可你忘记了
Yes, but you forget

685
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:14,124
你圈子里许多人不是基督徒
that many of us from your circle are not.

686
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,251
满帆  提督
And a full sail, prefect.

687
01:04:18,337 --> 01:04:19,338
走吧
Let's go.

688
01:04:22,299 --> 01:04:24,885
-亚斯巴修  准备好了吗?  -是的  女主人
-Aspasius, you ready? -Yes, mistress.

689
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:29,139
我要你拿着麻袋爬到桅杆的顶端
I would like you to take the sack and climb to the top of the mast.

690
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,739
好了  老师
And now, Lady,

691
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,784
你能给我解释一下  这是怎么回事吗?
Will you finally tell me what the point of all this is?

692
01:04:50,035 --> 01:04:52,121
当亚斯巴修扔下麻袋的同时
When Aspasius drops the sack,

693
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,373
船在往前走
the boat will be moving forward.

694
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:55,958
因此麻袋
Therefore, the sack

695
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,877
不会掉在桅杆下
won't fall at the foot of the mast,

696
01:04:59,086 --> 01:05:03,257
而是会掉得往后一些  我想大概
but will fall further back. I would say about,

697
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,470
大概会在这儿
about here.

698
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,764
这样做有什么意义吗?
And what is so special about that?

699
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:27,448
-太好了  -可你错了
-Yes! -But you were wrong!

700
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:31,327
是  但这是决定性证据
Yes, but this is definite proof!

701
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:35,581
决定性的  麻袋就像是在静止的船上那样掉下来
It's definitive. The sack behaved as if the boat was stationary.

702
01:05:35,664 --> 01:05:37,458
那意味着什么?
What does that mean?

703
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:40,586
我不知道
I don't know.

704
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:44,006
但同样的原理也可以应用在地球上
But the same principle could be applied to the Earth.

705
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:49,011
它可能绕着太阳转而我们却不知道
It could be moving around the Sun without us realizing.

706
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,098
-阿里斯塔克斯的理论  -没错
-Aristarchus. -Exactly.

707
01:05:54,975 --> 01:05:57,895
你为什么要那么执着呢  老师?
Why do you torment yourself with that, Lady?

708
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,689
托勒密理论虽不完善
Ptolemy's not perfect but,

709
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,483
但却很管用
it works.

710
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:04,777
俄瑞斯特斯  当时是你提出的
Orestes, but you are the one who,

711
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:09,156
提督  几年前你可没有这么务实
A few years ago, you weren't so pragmatic, prefect.

712
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:13,118
几年前我总是不经思考就发言
Well, a few years ago, I talked first and thought later.

713
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,681
我看到了仙王座三
I have Cepheus third.

714
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:37,726
三十七
37.

715
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,812
四十八
48.

716
01:06:43,357 --> 01:06:46,402
金星和木星共同落在水瓶座里
Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius.

717
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,827
我父亲定会用美酒庆祝这种结合
My father would have celebrated such a conjunction with a good wine.

718
01:06:56,578 --> 01:06:58,789
-星星永远不会落下  -真的吗?
-The stars will not fall. -Oh really?

719
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:01,709
是的  因为它们都镶在盒盖上
No, because they're fixed to the lid of their chests.

720
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,254
盖子会打开两颗心  然后耶稣就诞生了
The lid will open in two hearts and then Jesus will appear.

721
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:08,048
你说的是什么盒子?
What chest are you talking about?

722
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:13,053
你不知道宇宙是个巨大的盒子吗?
Don't you know that the universe is a gigantic chest?

723
01:07:13,804 --> 01:07:17,683
天堂是盖子  地球是底部
Heaven is the lid on top and the Earth, the ground,

724
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:22,021
他们没告诉这个笨蛋地球是圆的
They haven't told this fool that the Earth is round.

725
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:23,939
地球是扁的
The Earth is flat.

726
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:26,233
你的脑袋是扁的
Your head is flat.

727
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:27,985
去看看圣经吧
Read the Scriptures!

728
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:30,279
如果地球是圆的
If the earth is round,

729
01:07:30,571 --> 01:07:33,407
为什么住在下端的人们不会掉下去?
Why don't the people at the bottom fall off?

730
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:37,786
住在侧面的人呢?
What about the ones on the sides?

731
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,997
他们为什么不会滑下去呢?
Why don't they slide off?

732
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:43,417
想想看
Think about that.

733
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,545
达乌斯知道
Davus knows.

734
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:48,088
兄弟
Hey, brother.

735
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,548
你有什么看法?
What do you say?

736
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:52,718
地球是扁的还是圆的
Is the earth is flat or round?

737
01:07:56,263 --> 01:07:58,015
只有上帝才知道这些
Only God knows those things.

738
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:04,897
放在地上别动
Leave them on the ground!

739
01:08:05,105 --> 01:08:07,650
别管它们  它们就该放地上
Leave them on the ground! That's where they belong.

740
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,818
女士  请您不要灰心丧气
Lady, you must not lose heart.

741
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:12,613
今天在船上您已经取得了很大的进展
Today on the boat you made great progress.

742
01:08:12,905 --> 01:08:16,575
为什么所有行星的亮度的变化
Why do the wanderers bury their brightness?

743
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,078
会如此变化无常
So unexpectedly.

744
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:22,331
更糟的是
And what is worse,

745
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:24,500
为什么太阳
Why does the sun?

746
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:28,671
为什么它的体积在夏天和冬天会不同
Why does it change size from summer to winter?

747
01:08:29,296 --> 01:08:33,467
也许是因为它有时近
Perhaps because sometimes it is nearer,

748
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,135
有时远
and other times it is farther away.

749
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,638
可是  亚斯巴修
But Aspasius

750
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:39,932
看
Watch.

751
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:44,186
按阿里斯塔克斯的理论  太阳一定
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

752
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:45,980
是在万物的中心
at the center of everything.

753
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,191
而我们的地球
With us, the Earth,

754
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,444
绕着它沿圆周轨迹在公转
traveling in a circle around it.

755
01:08:54,613 --> 01:08:57,658
因此  这就是关键
Therefore, and this is the key.

756
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,246
我们和它一直
We're always at exactly,

757
01:09:03,497 --> 01:09:08,085
保持着同样的距离
the same distance.

758
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,547
如果按你说的  距离会改变
Now, if as you just said, we accept the changes in distance

759
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,507
那么我们就得
then we are forced to add

760
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,844
在地球轨道上加一个本轮
and epicycle to the Earth's orbit.

761
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:21,015
这样它才会时近时远
So it's going to be nearer and then it's going to be farther away.

762
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,643
这样我们就陷入托勒密的谜团里了  .
But now we fall into the same trap as Ptolemy.

763
01:09:25,185 --> 01:09:26,562
-圈套着圈  -没错
-Circle upon circles. -Exactly!

764
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,233
我不知道如何解决这个矛盾
So I just do not know how to resolve this conflict.

765
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,741
你觉得我们能解决
I mean, the only thing we could do is,

766
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,455
把太阳从中心移走  那么
displace the sun from the center and well,

767
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:46,749
并非必须在中心
not to have a center.

768
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,959
这让我感到伤心  亚斯巴修
It breaks my heart, Aspasius.

769
01:09:51,378 --> 01:09:53,756
告诉我  我该怎么做?
So tell me, what do I do?

770
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:57,718
休息一下吧  女士
Rest, lady.

771
01:10:10,648 --> 01:10:12,524
基督圣战士
Parabolani!

772
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:15,361
-圣战士们  -怎么了?
-Parabolani! -What is happening?

773
01:10:15,736 --> 01:10:18,781
圣战士们  快来救命啊
Parabolani, quick! Help!

774
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,741
圣亚里罕德罗着火了
St. Alexander's on fire!

775
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,451
着火了
It is a fire.

776
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,245
快点
Come on!

777
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,878
去提水  拿上水桶  拿着这个
Gather water! Get the water! Quick! Take this!

778
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,673
快点
Hurry!

779
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:38,717
快
Quick!

780
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,722
快  快点  跑快点
Come on, come on!

781
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:52,022
圣战士们
Parabolani!

782
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:54,733
圣战士们啊
Parabolani!

783
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,652
圣战士  快啊
Parabolani, quick!

784
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:00,781
哪着火了?
Where's the fire?

785
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,994
在那边  那边
Where's the fire?

786
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:15,004
是犹太人  这是陷阱
Jews! It's a trap.

787
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:16,672
这是陷阱
It's a trap!

788
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:41,090
基督徒们
Christians, all.

789
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,635
昨夜是悲惨的一夜
Last night was a night to deplore.

790
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,097
现在我告诉你们
Now I say to you.

791
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:53,102
不要再为死去的兄弟们感到悲伤
Grieve no longer for our dead brothers.

792
01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:55,688
不要哭泣
Weep not.

793
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,652
把眼泪留给其它人吧
Shed your tears for the others,

794
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:04,655
他们是刽子手
for they are executioners.

795
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,583
没错  没错
Yes, yes.

796
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:19,670
为那些干这件事的人哭泣吧
Weep for them. For those who have done this,

797
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:22,089
他们对上帝一无所知
Know not of God,

798
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:24,675
没有爱  没有同情心
nor of love nor of parity.

799
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:26,969
他们什么都不懂
They know not

800
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:32,933
因为今天他们重现了圣经里的情景
because it is they who repeat the words of the Scriptures

801
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,685
却对此一无所知
with no understanding at all.

802
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:39,315
他们只看到一个人
It is they who saw only a man

803
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:42,318
那就是上帝的儿子  站在他们面前
when the Son of God was standing in front of them.

804
01:13:42,526 --> 01:13:45,237
也正是他们愚昧地嘲笑他
And it is they who in their blindness

805
01:13:45,237 --> 01:13:47,865
还将他钉死在十字架上
mocked him and crucified him.

806
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:57,958
哭泣吧  哭泣吧  为犹太人哭泣
Yes Weep! Weep for the Jews,

807
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,461
他们害死了我们的主
those evil butchers of our Lord.

808
01:14:02,963 --> 01:14:04,423
因为上帝
Because God,

809
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:09,428
上帝已经责罚他们了
because God, God, God has already condemned them.

810
01:14:09,637 --> 01:14:10,971
这是上帝的旨意
It is God's will,

811
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,390
让他们成为奴隶
that they live as slaves

812
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:17,227
被诅咒  被流放  直到世界末日
cursed and exiled until the end of time.

813
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:19,647
被诅咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

814
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:22,983
被诅咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

815
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,197
被诅咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

816
01:14:51,971 --> 01:14:54,056
女士  别停下  女士
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

817
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,983
所有的犹太人都想要复仇
Now all the Jews will want to retaliate.

818
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:48,736
恐怕你不清楚目前的状况
I'm afraid you don't understand what's really happening.

819
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:53,490
一切结束后  亚历山大  就不再有犹太人了
When this is all over, there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.

820
01:16:00,706 --> 01:16:02,791
很抱歉这样冒失地闯了进来
I'm sorry for busting in like this.

821
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,711
老师  你不该冒险来这里的
Lady, you should the risk of coming here.

822
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:07,546
军队在哪?
Where are the troops?

823
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,216
为什么街道上没有士兵?
Why are there no more soldiers on the streets?

824
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,637
在那种混乱中  没有军队  可以控制整个城市
No army could contain that mob. The entire city is in a frenzy.

825
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,726
他要求杀光所有的妇女和儿童
Calling to the annihilation of women and children.

826
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:22,811
他是主教
A bishop!

827
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:25,397
-他是基督徒  -那就把他关起来
-A Christian! Then lock him up.

828
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:32,363
提督  你应该逮捕他
Prefect. You should have him arrested.

829
01:16:36,784 --> 01:16:37,826
事情没那么简单
It's not so easy.

830
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:43,415
女士  西里尔知道我们有相同的信仰
Lady, Cyril knows they both share the same faith.

831
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,171
这让我们的长官进退两难
That places our prefect in a very awkward position.

832
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,590
如果他为犹太人辩护
If he defends the Jews, half the city will rise up

833
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,759
会有一半的市民反对政府
against his government.

834
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:56,887
我明白了
I see.

835
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:01,892
可如果现在你什么都不做
But if you choose to do nothing now,

836
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:06,438
我相信西里尔  会继续重复相同的事
I believe Cyril will continue to do the same thing over and over again and until,

837
01:17:06,438 --> 01:17:11,986
直到杀光城里的最后一个人
until there is no one left in this city.

838
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:14,613
就没人可以让政府管理了
No people for this government to govern.

839
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,628
我太幼稚了
How naive of me.

840
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:35,676
我真幼稚  居然寄希望于最终的改变
How naive of me to think we have finally chose.

841
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:20,429
犹太人滚出去
Jews out!

842
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:43,661
他们先杀了他们
First, they kill them

843
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:45,746
然后埋了他们
then they bury them.

844
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,802
是昔兰尼的主教
The Bishop of Cyrene.

845
01:19:00,219 --> 01:19:02,972
-他来这儿干什么?  -我去看看
-What is he doing here?  -I'll find out.

846
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:08,060
这是我的小亚历山大图书馆
It's my little library of Alexandria.

847
01:19:12,856 --> 01:19:14,733
我在这里教孩子们知识
This is where I teach  the children.

848
01:19:17,444 --> 01:19:18,988
阿波罗尼斯圆锥体
An Apollonian cone.

849
01:19:19,446 --> 01:19:22,533
是的  我用它来教孩子们四种不同曲线
Yes, I built it to teach them about the four curves.

850
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,118
圆形
The Circle.

851
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,954
椭圆形
The ellipse.

852
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,625
俄瑞斯特斯应该早到了才对
Orestes should really be here by now.

853
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,002
物线
Parabola.

854
01:19:33,794 --> 01:19:35,379
双曲线
And hyperbola.

855
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,716
真是美极了
It's truly beautiful.

856
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:42,678
我常看着它去思考
You know, I often look at it and I always wonder

857
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:44,763
为什么相同的圆轴?
why does the circle coexist with such

858
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:46,765
会产生如此多不同的形状
impure shapes?

859
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:52,688
不如我坐在这里再听你讲一次课
When I get to sit here and listen to you again.

860
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:54,356
看来让你无聊了
I bore you.

861
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,817
我已经很久没有教书了
It's been a long time since I've done anything but,

862
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:58,319
只是在研究天体系统上绞尽脑汁
beat my head against a stone.

863
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:02,197
然而却无人关注它的重要性
Anyhow, there are more important matters at hand.

864
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:03,324
我来晚了
Forgive me.

865
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,464
一个多神教徒控制着两个基督徒
Two Christians in the hands of a heathen.

866
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,090
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage!

867
01:20:27,598 --> 01:20:28,974
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage!

868
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:53,999
-这里有多少?  -不知道  但会发出恶臭
-How many left? I don't know but it smells.

869
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01,840
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius.

870
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,843
上帝跟你说过话吗?
Does God speak with you?

871
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,763
你总是这样
All the time.

872
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:12,434
阿摩尼阿斯这样  阿摩尼阿斯那样
Ammonius this, Ammonius that. Ammonius, Ammonius, Ammonius.

873
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:15,062
今天他对我说得极快
Today, he spoke to me

874
01:21:15,145 --> 01:21:18,524
非常快  我不得不请求他说慢点
so quickly, I had to ask him slow down.

875
01:21:21,026 --> 01:21:22,444
告诉我
Tell me something.

876
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:25,489
你认为我们是错的吗?
Do you ever think we're mistaken?

877
01:21:28,534 --> 01:21:29,451
为什么这么说?
Why?

878
01:21:35,374 --> 01:21:36,959
我曾被宽恕过
I always forgive and,

879
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:42,464
但现在  我无法宽恕别人
but now, I can't forgive.

880
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,301
宽恕
Forgive?

881
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:47,177
谁?
Who?

882
01:21:48,554 --> 01:21:49,680
犹太人吗?
The Jews?

883
01:21:53,559 --> 01:21:55,394
耶稣在十字架上宽恕了他们
Well, Jesus pardon them on the cross.

884
01:21:58,439 --> 01:21:59,898
耶稣是上帝
Jesus was God

885
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,235
只有他才有这种宽容心
and only He can show such clemency.

886
01:22:03,861 --> 01:22:06,780
你怎么敢拿自己跟上帝相提并论
How dare you compare yourself to God?

887
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:12,119
兄弟
Brother.

888
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:17,416
我们现在还活着
We are still alive.

889
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:19,835
因为什么?
Why?

890
01:22:20,419 --> 01:22:21,587
因为
Because it was

891
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,298
是上帝的旨意  让我们没被石头打死
His will to save us from the stones.

892
01:22:27,718 --> 01:22:30,012
上帝让我们在此  行该做之事
God wants us here, doing what we do.

893
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,723
你不再相信这些了吗?
Don't you believe in that anymore?

894
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,783
阁下
My Lord,

895
01:22:57,665 --> 01:22:59,208
西里尔是个骄傲的男人
Cyril is a very proud man.

896
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:02,878
他同意会面  但只协商和平议题
He'll agree to meet, but he wouldn't discuss the Jews,

897
01:23:02,878 --> 01:23:04,338
不商讨犹太人问题
only discuss peace.

898
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:07,549
和平
Peace?

899
01:23:07,758 --> 01:23:11,512
作为您卑微的参谋  我的建议是
My suggestion, as your humble adviser in this affair,

900
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,514
请您接受提议
is for you to accept.

901
01:23:14,473 --> 01:23:15,808
和平是最重要的
Let peace be foremost.

902
01:23:17,768 --> 01:23:20,187
-老师  你怎么看?  -我
-Lady, what do you think? -Well,I,

903
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:23,107
我觉得这个提议并没有那么好
I don't think it's very encouraging.

904
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:25,943
为什么他来见俄瑞斯特斯?
Why would he want to come and see Orestes without any concrete proposals?

905
01:23:26,026 --> 01:23:29,154
而且还有别的东西
And there's something else.

906
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:31,740
他要来见你
He won't come to you.

907
01:23:33,117 --> 01:23:34,910
但需要你在图书馆和他见面
Demands he meet you in the Library,

908
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:36,453
在星期天的礼拜中
during the Sunday service.

909
01:23:36,662 --> 01:23:39,039
在图书馆吗?  为什么?
In the Library? Why?

910
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,500
那次抢占之后
Only Christians are being permitted to enter the Library

911
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,335
只有基督徒才能进入图书馆
since it was stoned.

912
01:23:43,544 --> 01:23:45,629
这是挑衅
It is a provocation!

913
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,301
请允许我说几句
Allow me to suggest.

914
01:23:51,468 --> 01:23:53,762
如果你觉得你的到场
If you consider your presence

915
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:55,222
是如此的重要
so essential

916
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,433
为什么你不接受洗礼呢?
why not let yourself be baptized?

917
01:24:00,644 --> 01:24:02,313
我们中的大多数人
The majority of us here,

918
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:05,232
包括最高长官  都已经接纳了基督教
beginning with our prefect, have accepted Christ.

919
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,443
剩余的这些人为什么不行呢?
Why not the rest of you?

920
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,654
这只是个时间问题  你们心知肚明
It's only a matter of time and you know it!

921
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,031
是吗?
Really?

922
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,326
这真的只是个时间问题吗?
It is just a matter of time?

923
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:17,828
请容许我说几句
Well, excuse me,

924
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:19,830
尊敬的元老  但据我所知
honored member but as far as I'm aware

925
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:22,249
你们的上帝并不能证明他自己
your God has not yet proved himself

926
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,669
比他的前任们更公正更仁慈
to be more just or more merciful than his predecessors.

927
01:24:25,878 --> 01:24:26,503
老师
Lady.

928
01:24:26,712 --> 01:24:30,466
让我接受你们的信仰  真的只是时间问题吗?
Is it really just a question of time before I accept your faith?

929
01:24:31,508 --> 01:24:32,968
那是什么?
Why, then,

930
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:35,137
难道这次会议
should this assembly

931
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:39,224
要接受一个毫无信仰的人
accept the counsel of someone who admittedly

932
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,561
提出的提议吗?
believes in absolutely nothing?

933
01:24:44,855 --> 01:24:46,607
我信仰哲学
I believe in philosophy.

934
01:24:49,777 --> 01:24:51,111
哲学
Philosophy.

935
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,614
正是现在这种时候
Just what we need

936
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:55,574
我们所需要的东西
in times like this.

937
01:24:56,617 --> 01:24:57,993
够了
Enough!

938
01:25:09,129 --> 01:25:11,340
这些年来  我一直在研究
All these years, I've been studying.

939
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:15,719
完全没有了自己的生活
With absolutely no life of my own.

940
01:25:16,428 --> 01:25:18,222
我想知道  我这样为了什么?
And I wonder, what was the point?

941
01:25:20,599 --> 01:25:24,269
忘了今天那些话吧
Whoa, forget about what was said today.

942
01:25:27,398 --> 01:25:29,608
是生活困住了我吗?
Is this all life holds for me?

943
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,112
还能是什么?
What else?

944
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,782
我觉得没人能看出
I doubt anyone could see as a,

945
01:25:37,116 --> 01:25:38,450
你是一位忠诚的妻子
devoted wife

946
01:25:38,659 --> 01:25:39,702
一位尽心的母亲
and mother.

947
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:41,662
我认为
I think,

948
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:45,749
城里的所有人都听说了手帕的故事
I think everyone in the city knows the story of the handkerchief.

949
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:51,296
所以
So,

950
01:25:56,093 --> 01:25:57,845
我父亲也会喜欢女人
My father loved a woman.

951
01:25:58,595 --> 01:25:59,847
连他也不例外
Even he,

952
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,350
有谁不爱呢?
Who have I ever loved?

953
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:08,105
除了你
Except you,

954
01:26:08,105 --> 01:26:09,273
黎巴农斯
Libanius.

955
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:22,494
如果我能
If I could just,

956
01:26:26,373 --> 01:26:28,042
解开这个谜团
just unravel this,

957
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,710
只需要再多努力一点
just a little bit more.

958
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:37,968
只要离答案再接近一些  那么
And just get a little close to the answer then,

959
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:40,304
这样  我就能
then I would,

960
01:26:42,389 --> 01:26:44,767
我就能安然入土
then I would go to my grave a happy woman.

961
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:48,187
为什么?
Why?

962
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,814
为什么这些对你如此重要?
Why does that mean so much to you?

963
01:26:53,859 --> 01:26:55,110
就是现在
Right now,

964
01:26:56,236 --> 01:27:00,199
就在这一秒  整个世界可能都在移动
this very second, the whole Earth could be moving

965
01:27:00,407 --> 01:27:02,493
却没有人意识到这些
and no one realizes it.

966
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:05,204
只有你和我知道
Except you and me.

967
01:27:05,329 --> 01:27:07,706
相信我  老师  幸亏没人意识得到
Believe me Lady, it's best no one does.

968
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:12,628
你觉得这些真的不重要吗?
Do you really not think it important?

969
01:27:12,836 --> 01:27:13,712
我不明白你为什么
I don't understand

970
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:15,339
坚信人们脚下的土地是移动的呢
why you insist on moving the ground we walk on.

971
01:27:15,339 --> 01:27:17,716
你也看到了船上发生的
Well, you saw for yourself what happened on the boat.

972
01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:20,844
是的  但那也不能证明地球在移动
Yes, I did. But that does not necessarily mean the Earth moves.

973
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:23,222
如果确实是这样呢?
What if it does?

974
01:27:23,889 --> 01:27:25,975
希帕蒂亚  看看你的周围
Hypatia, look around you.

975
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:27,518
死亡
Death,

976
01:27:27,726 --> 01:27:28,978
恐惧
horror

977
01:27:29,186 --> 01:27:30,521
毁灭
destruction.

978
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:33,482
如果地球真的在圆形轨道中移动
If the stars move in a circle

979
01:27:34,108 --> 01:27:36,485
他们为什么  不把完美分给我们一些呢?
why would they share their perfection with us?

980
01:27:39,613 --> 01:27:41,073
所以我们没有移动
So we do not move,

981
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:42,741
只是不在圆形轨道中
In a circle.

982
01:27:43,033 --> 01:27:44,493
我们不是按照圆形
We don't move,

983
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:49,623
运动的
Circle.

984
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:53,168
我们并非在圆形轨道中移动
We do not move in a circle.

985
01:28:02,469 --> 01:28:03,929
从柏拉图开始
Ever since Plato,

986
01:28:04,138 --> 01:28:07,891
所有人  包括阿里斯塔克斯  希巴克斯  托勒密
all of them: Aristarchus Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

987
01:28:08,392 --> 01:28:11,937
所有人都试图用圆形轨道
they have all tried to reconcile their observations

988
01:28:12,146 --> 01:28:14,023
来解释他们的观察结果
with circular orbits but,

989
01:28:14,315 --> 01:28:16,650
但如果在宇宙中隐藏着其它形状呢?
What if another shape is hiding in the heavens?

990
01:28:16,942 --> 01:28:18,610
其它形状
Another shape?

991
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,696
女士  没有任何形状比圆形更完美
Lady, there is no shape purer than the circle.

992
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:21,947
这是你教我们的
You taught us that.

993
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:25,200
我知道  只是假设
I know, but suppose just suppose the,

994
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:26,535
正是圆形的完美
purity of the circle

995
01:28:26,744 --> 01:28:30,497
让我们忽视了其它的一切
has blinded us from seeing anything beyond it.

996
01:28:30,789 --> 01:28:32,791
就像耀眼的太阳让我们
The same way that the glare of the sun

997
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:34,543
看不见星星一样
blind us from actually seeing the stars.

998
01:28:35,085 --> 01:28:36,754
我必须重新
I must begin all over with,

999
01:28:36,962 --> 01:28:39,340
重新审视这个问题
with new eyes.

1000
01:28:40,424 --> 01:28:43,218
我必须重新思考一切
I must rethink everything.

1001
01:28:43,844 --> 01:28:44,803
所有的一切
I have to rethink everything.

1002
01:28:58,233 --> 01:29:01,487
从保罗写给提摩太的第一封信开始读
Reading from the first letter of Paul to Timothy.

1003
01:29:01,862 --> 01:29:05,616
我渴望男人  无处不在
I desire therefore, that everywhere

1004
01:29:06,367 --> 01:29:09,370
举起圣洁的手  随处祷告
men should lift up holy hands in prayer

1005
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:13,123
无忿怒  无争论
without anger or disputing.

1006
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:18,587
同样  又愿女人
In like manner, I desire women

1007
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:21,173
廉耻  自守
to dress modestly,

1008
01:29:22,216 --> 01:29:25,260
以正派衣裳为妆饰
with decency and propriety

1009
01:29:25,344 --> 01:29:26,887
不以编发
not with braided hair

1010
01:29:28,472 --> 01:29:31,183
黄金  珍珠
or gold or pearls

1011
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,268
和贵价的衣裳为妆饰
or expensive clothes,

1012
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:37,856
-只要有善行  -为什么读这段?
-but with good deeds. -Why is he reading this passage?

1013
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:39,525
不知道  首领
I don't know, prefect.

1014
01:29:39,525 --> 01:29:41,819
但我肯定这不是事先说好的那段
I assure you it is not the one we agreed on.

1015
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:44,947
女人要沉静学道
That a woman learn

1016
01:29:45,155 --> 01:29:48,492
一味的顺服  我不许女人讲道
in quietness and in full submission. I do not permit a woman,

1017
01:29:48,701 --> 01:29:52,121
也不许他辖管男人
to teach or to have authority over a man,

1018
01:29:54,957 --> 01:29:56,333
只要
but to be

1019
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,627
沉静
in silence.

1020
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:07,261
这是上帝之言
This is the word of God!

1021
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:08,846
阿门
Amen.

1022
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:10,514
阿门
Amen.

1023
01:30:12,599 --> 01:30:14,059
当耶稣把自己的神圣遗产
Jesus himself

1024
01:30:14,768 --> 01:30:16,770
托付给他的十二门徒时
knew this when he

1025
01:30:16,937 --> 01:30:20,190
他自己非常了解这些
entrusted his holy legacy to twelve men

1026
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:22,276
全是男人
Men.

1027
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:24,653
没有一个女人
Not a woman among them.

1028
01:30:25,904 --> 01:30:27,281
但是
And yet,

1029
01:30:29,074 --> 01:30:31,368
我知道亚历山大有些人
I know of some in Alexandria

1030
01:30:31,577 --> 01:30:34,163
他们仰慕某个女人并且对她的话
who admire and even trust

1031
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:35,706
言听计从
in the word of a woman.

1032
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:38,042
哲学家希帕蒂亚
The philosopher Hypatia.

1033
01:30:39,293 --> 01:30:41,795
这个女人曾公然表示过
A woman who declared,

1034
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:44,590
她对上帝的不忠
in public, her ungodliness.

1035
01:30:49,178 --> 01:30:50,137
她是个女巫
A witch!

1036
01:30:53,766 --> 01:30:54,933
官员们
Dignitaries,

1037
01:30:55,643 --> 01:31:00,356
你们现在应该全部信奉基督
it is time for you all to reconcile yourselves with Christ.

1038
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,077
这是上帝之言
This is the word of God.

1039
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:18,707
在圣经面前下跪  并接受真理吧
Kneel before it and embrace its truth.

1040
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:02,501
跪下
Kneel.

1041
01:32:04,044 --> 01:32:05,796
他不准备跪下吗?
Is he not going to kneel?

1042
01:32:09,466 --> 01:32:11,343
他不准备跪下吗?
Is he not going to kneel?

1043
01:32:20,019 --> 01:32:21,145
跪下
Kneel!

1044
01:32:21,353 --> 01:32:23,147
跪下
Kneel!

1045
01:32:38,996 --> 01:32:40,748
罪人
Sinner!

1046
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:44,084
我是基督徒
I am a Christian!

1047
01:32:45,127 --> 01:32:46,712
-我是基督徒  -不  你不是
-I am a Christian! -You're not a Christian!

1048
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,214
我是和你们一样的基督徒
I'm as Christian as you are.

1049
01:32:49,715 --> 01:32:52,217
给提督让路
Make way for the prefect!

1050
01:32:53,052 --> 01:32:54,219
让路
Make way!

1051
01:33:05,481 --> 01:33:07,566
我是受过洗礼的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1052
01:33:08,275 --> 01:33:10,152
我是受过洗礼的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1053
01:33:14,448 --> 01:33:16,325
我要杀了你
I'll kill you.

1054
01:33:21,622 --> 01:33:22,998
我是和你们一样的基督徒
I am as Christian as you.

1055
01:33:24,124 --> 01:33:25,876
我是和你们一样的基督徒
I am as Christian as you are.

1056
01:34:11,797 --> 01:34:13,632
怎么会发生这种事
I mean, how could such a thing be possible?

1057
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:16,135
罪犯已经被绳之以法了
The culprit has been executed.

1058
01:34:16,885 --> 01:34:18,846
立即带我去见提督
I would like you to take me to the prefect immediately.

1059
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:20,556
女士  他亲自下令
Lady, he himself gave the order

1060
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,642
让你待在家里等进一步的通知
for you to be confined to the house until further notice.

1061
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:27,104
现在这种情况  我建议你  不要在街上出现
At the moment your presence on the streets is not advisable.

1062
01:34:28,564 --> 01:34:29,690
为什么?
For what reason?

1063
01:34:32,943 --> 01:34:35,946
西里尔对你进行了严厉的谴责
Cyril has made some serious accusations against you.

1064
01:34:38,574 --> 01:34:39,616
那么
And um,

1065
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:42,411
他控诉我什么罪名?
What does he accused me of?

1066
01:34:43,162 --> 01:34:44,621
对上帝不虔诚
Ungodliness,

1067
01:34:45,664 --> 01:34:47,041
还有使用巫术
And witchcraft.

1068
01:34:52,963 --> 01:34:54,131
我知道了
I see.

1069
01:35:05,976 --> 01:35:07,770
你在为什么事而烦恼吗?女士
Is something bothering you, Lady?

1070
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:09,938
没有
No.

1071
01:35:13,817 --> 01:35:15,986
不如你来告诉我你在担心什么?
Why don't you tell me what's worrying you?

1072
01:35:39,259 --> 01:35:41,011
提督  咬住这个
Prefect, why don't you bite on it?

1073
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,598
说
Speak.

1074
01:35:44,682 --> 01:35:46,892
昔兰尼的主教想见您
The Bishop of Cyrene wishes to see you.

1075
01:35:49,478 --> 01:35:50,938
所有人都出去
All of you,

1076
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:52,731
提督  伤口还没处理好
Prefect, the wound is not yet closed.

1077
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:55,109
出去  出去
Get out. Get out!

1078
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,782
所有人出去
All of you out! Out!

1079
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:12,960
你们没能杀死我啊
Well, that went well.

1080
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,298
你认为我也参与这件事了吗?
You think I had a part on this?

1081
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,925
如果我想背叛你  怎么还会来到你面前
Would I show my face here if I wanted to betray you?

1082
01:36:20,134 --> 01:36:23,470
-你是瞎了吗?  -是的  我是瞎了
-Are you blind?  -I was, yes, I was blind.

1083
01:36:24,722 --> 01:36:25,973
他一直想要的
Well, it's my head.

1084
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:28,767
是我的头  他想让我死
He's wanted all along, it's me,

1085
01:36:28,892 --> 01:36:30,561
随后就有了这次袭击
that snake is after.

1086
01:36:31,603 --> 01:36:33,772
这个政府
This government!

1087
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,774
这座城市
This city!

1088
01:36:37,651 --> 01:36:38,777
听着
Now, listen.

1089
01:36:40,904 --> 01:36:42,448
-战争即将到来  -我知道
-War is brewing. I know.

1090
01:36:43,282 --> 01:36:44,742
我知道
I know.

1091
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:50,039
那么宣誓对我效忠吧
Do you swear your loyalty to me?

1092
01:36:52,249 --> 01:36:54,043
向国家宣誓  快
To the Empire? Do it.

1093
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:59,256
要么谴责他  要么滚出去
Condemn him or get out.

1094
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:07,556
我会这么做的
I will do it.

1095
01:37:08,599 --> 01:37:11,226
如果有必要  我甚至会跪下来
On my knees, if necessary.

1096
01:37:12,186 --> 01:37:13,604
而且不只如此
And not only that.

1097
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,523
几天之内  我可以召集其它省的主教
In a few days, I can gather other bishops from the province

1098
01:37:16,523 --> 01:37:19,485
和沙漠里的修道士们来对抗西里尔
and amongst from the desert all against Cyril.

1099
01:37:30,829 --> 01:37:32,706
但首先我要问你个问题
First, I must ask you a question.

1100
01:37:33,957 --> 01:37:36,251
俄瑞斯特斯  你相信耶稣吗?
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

1101
01:37:37,378 --> 01:37:38,128
你问我什么?
Do I what?

1102
01:37:38,337 --> 01:37:40,089
-你相信耶稣吗?  -你问我什么?
-Do you believe in Jesus?  -Do I what!?

1103
01:37:40,339 --> 01:37:42,007
你到底是真正的基督徒
Are you a true Christian?

1104
01:37:42,216 --> 01:37:45,094
还是你像那些寥寥众生  仅仅臣服于
Or did you like so many others, only convert

1105
01:37:45,636 --> 01:37:47,513
-自己的政治生涯  -辛奈西斯
-to prosper in politics? -Synesius.

1106
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:49,181
你为什么不下跪?
Why didn't you kneel?

1107
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,141
-我有什么选择?  -你为什么不下跪?
-What choice did I have? -Why didn't you kneel?

1108
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:52,726
我还有什么选择?
What choice did I have?

1109
01:37:54,186 --> 01:37:55,854
背叛希帕蒂亚
Betray Hypatia?

1110
01:37:56,897 --> 01:37:58,357
谴责她吗?
Condemn her?

1111
01:37:58,649 --> 01:37:59,817
你会那么做吗?
Would you have done that?

1112
01:38:00,025 --> 01:38:01,819
我绝不会冒犯上帝的
I would never offend God.

1113
01:38:01,902 --> 01:38:04,905
是他  是他冒犯了上帝
It's he, he is offending God. He is offending him.

1114
01:38:05,114 --> 01:38:06,824
他在歪曲圣经
He's twisting his words

1115
01:38:06,824 --> 01:38:09,118
他在曲解圣经的意思
he's using the Scriptures.

1116
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:13,288
他只是在宣读圣经
He read what is written.

1117
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:17,251
有多少女人可以对你发号施令
How many women do you obey?

1118
01:38:18,377 --> 01:38:19,753
多少个?
How many?

1119
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:22,881
你仰慕的同时  又能听你倾诉  的女人有几个
How many do you admire and listen to?

1120
01:38:25,259 --> 01:38:26,385
只有
Only

1121
01:38:26,844 --> 01:38:27,970
一个
One.

1122
01:38:32,266 --> 01:38:33,392
只有一个
Only one.

1123
01:38:33,892 --> 01:38:35,144
圣经
The Scripture,

1124
01:38:35,811 --> 01:38:37,980
圣经是正确的
The Scripture is correct,

1125
01:38:40,274 --> 01:38:42,276
只是由于在他的手中
and it was in His hands.

1126
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:46,322
兄弟  你还不明白吗?
Brother, don't you see?

1127
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:48,824
你不明白你那样做是在众人面前
Don't you see the insult to God?

1128
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:52,911
侮辱上帝吗?
In front of everyone.

1129
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,917
我不知道
I don't know,

1130
01:39:02,296 --> 01:39:03,714
我不知道该相信什么?
I don't know what, what I believe.

1131
01:39:03,922 --> 01:39:05,299
你必须告诉他
You have to tell him.

1132
01:39:05,716 --> 01:39:07,468
别跟我说  俄瑞斯特斯
Go tell him now, Orestes.

1133
01:39:07,468 --> 01:39:08,552
告诉上帝你相信圣经
Tell him you believe in what is written.

1134
01:39:09,595 --> 01:39:12,097
-我信奉  -别跟我说  去跟他说
-I believe, -Don't tell me. Tell Him.

1135
01:39:14,058 --> 01:39:15,643
告诉上帝
Tell God.

1136
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,394
跪下
Kneel!

1137
01:39:43,963 --> 01:39:45,339
许多人至今都记得
Many are those who remember today the miracles

1138
01:39:45,339 --> 01:39:48,175
我们挚爱的兄长曾创造的奇迹
our beloved brother performed in life.

1139
01:39:51,178 --> 01:39:54,223
比如那次他将自己托付给圣父
Like the time he commended himself to the Father

1140
01:39:54,431 --> 01:39:57,017
踏过火堆却毫发无损
and threw himself into fire and was not even singe.

1141
01:39:58,477 --> 01:39:59,645
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius,

1142
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:04,316
因为英勇捍卫对基督的信仰而献身
dead of bravely defending your faith in Christ.

1143
01:40:07,027 --> 01:40:09,238
我追封你为
I proclaim you a martyr.

1144
01:40:11,115 --> 01:40:12,449
圣徒
A saint.

1145
01:40:17,162 --> 01:40:19,957
从此以后你将会被人们称为
From now on, you shall be known as,

1146
01:40:20,165 --> 01:40:22,459
圣图梅西斯
Saint Taumasius.

1147
01:40:35,597 --> 01:40:37,182
我们要讨回公道
We want justice!

1148
01:40:37,266 --> 01:40:39,685
公道
Justice!

1149
01:40:44,148 --> 01:40:45,733
愿上帝指引我们  我亲爱的
May God show us the way,

1150
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:48,736
圣战士们  我言尽于此
my dear parabolani. Little else can I say to you.

1151
01:40:55,951 --> 01:40:57,703
尼帝亚的修道士有多少
What about the monks of Nitria?

1152
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:00,748
他们至少有500人  而且
We can win at least 500 of them.

1153
01:41:00,831 --> 01:41:02,708
我们还有500人
plus 500 of our own men,

1154
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:05,544
你以为这就够了吗?  他可是地区提督
Do you think that's enough? He's the prefect,

1155
01:41:05,836 --> 01:41:07,588
都有的军队都会保卫他
He has a whole army to protect him.

1156
01:41:07,713 --> 01:41:08,839
听着
Listen!

1157
01:41:09,506 --> 01:41:12,217
我们何不找个简单又有效的方法
Why don't we do something much more simple and effective?

1158
01:41:12,301 --> 01:41:13,677
你指的是什么?
What are you talking about?

1159
01:41:14,386 --> 01:41:16,805
我们可以伤害他最关心的东西
We can hurt him where it hurts most,,,

1160
01:41:18,557 --> 01:41:19,600
如何?
How?

1161
01:41:20,017 --> 01:41:21,894
-那个婊子  -谁啊?
-That whore. -Who?

1162
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:27,232
如果我们敢于面对世界的本相会怎样?
What if we dared to look at the world just as it is?

1163
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:31,570
我们先摒弃那些先入为主的想法
Let us share for a moment every preconceived idea.

1164
01:41:31,695 --> 01:41:34,740
它会是什么形状?  什么形状?
What shape would it show us? What shape?

1165
01:41:34,948 --> 01:41:38,494
你曾说过问题在于太阳体积的不一致
You once said that the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

1166
01:41:38,702 --> 01:41:40,579
没错  我说过  很好  说清楚一点
Yes I did, good,good Put it into words.

1167
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:46,377
太阳一定要在中心  因为我们绕着它旋转
The sun must be at the center, since we revolve around it.

1168
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:47,836
与此同时
And at the same time,

1169
01:41:48,087 --> 01:41:51,507
它又在其它位置  因为它离我们时远时近
in another position since our distance from it varies.

1170
01:41:51,715 --> 01:41:53,509
-没错  正是如此  -怎么会?
-Yes, exactly. -How?

1171
01:41:54,259 --> 01:41:59,014
它是如何同时占据两个位置的?
How could it occupy two positions?

1172
01:42:01,392 --> 01:42:03,894
它是如何同时占据两个位置的?
How could it occupy two positions?

1173
01:42:05,062 --> 01:42:07,147
怎么同时占据两个位置的?
How could I occupy two positions at once?

1174
01:42:08,899 --> 01:42:11,527
怎么同时占据两个位置的?
How could I occupy two positions at once?

1175
01:42:28,919 --> 01:42:30,087
亚斯巴修
Aspasius,

1176
01:42:45,936 --> 01:42:48,647
没错  没错  就是那儿  另一个放在这儿
Yes, yes. There. And then the other one here.

1177
01:42:48,856 --> 01:42:50,858
保持相同的比例
Keeping the same proportion.

1178
01:42:54,486 --> 01:42:56,989
很好  把那端栓在火炬上
Good. Very good. Now, tie this end to that torch.

1179
01:43:04,496 --> 01:43:05,414
亚斯巴修
Aspasius.

1180
01:43:06,165 --> 01:43:08,375
我要你把这个想象成是地球
I want you to imagine that this is the Earth.

1181
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,377
每把火炬代表
And that each of these flames represent

1182
01:43:10,377 --> 01:43:12,921
它距离太阳的两个极限位置
the two extreme positions of the sun in relation to it.

1183
01:43:13,172 --> 01:43:14,715
也就是冬天和夏天
In winter and in summer.

1184
01:43:15,549 --> 01:43:19,720
如果这两个位置都是同一个圆
What would happen if both these positions with the two centers

1185
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,597
的圆心会是什么样
of one and the same circle?

1186
01:43:22,723 --> 01:43:24,308
这是不可能的  主人
But it is impossible, mistress.

1187
01:43:24,516 --> 01:43:25,893
等等  圆是什么?
Wait. What do we know about a circle?

1188
01:43:25,893 --> 01:43:27,227
我们知道圆心
We know that the center of a circle

1189
01:43:27,436 --> 01:43:30,147
到圆周上任一点的距离总是相等
is always the same distance from any point along its perimeter.

1190
01:43:30,356 --> 01:43:31,398
-没错  -是的
-Exactly. Yes, so,

1191
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:33,192
那如果我们把这个圆心分成两个呢
What if I divide the center into two,

1192
01:43:33,901 --> 01:43:35,444
让圆周上的点到
but what I keep constant

1193
01:43:35,444 --> 01:43:38,614
这两个圆心的距离之和保持不变
is the sum of their two distances to the perimeter.

1194
01:43:40,574 --> 01:43:44,203
好吧  我给你演示一下  看着  当我沿着
Alright, look. I'll show you. Watch.  As I move this rod along

1195
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:46,622
这个圆周移动棒子  绳子的一部分增加时
the cord, as one segment increases

1196
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,999
另一部分就会减少  反之亦然
the other segment decreases, and vice versa.

1197
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:52,252
因此两者之和
Therefore the sum of the two is always going to be constant.

1198
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:54,463
保持不变  你明白了吗?
Do you see that?

1199
01:43:55,714 --> 01:43:59,218
如果我们把这个理论运用到
Now, what if we apply this

1200
01:44:00,469 --> 01:44:01,637
地球的移动之上呢?
to the movement of the Earth?

1201
01:44:15,818 --> 01:44:16,986
我们会
What,

1202
01:44:19,989 --> 01:44:21,448
得到
figure,

1203
01:44:21,865 --> 01:44:23,951
什么图形呢?
will be obtained?

1204
01:44:27,705 --> 01:44:28,956
一个椭圆轨道
An ellipse!

1205
01:44:29,790 --> 01:44:33,335
太阳在它的一个焦点之上
With the sun at one of its foci.

1206
01:44:35,296 --> 01:44:36,463
因为
Because,

1207
01:44:37,089 --> 01:44:38,882
这种椭圆轨道
what is a circle except

1208
01:44:39,049 --> 01:44:41,051
除了它的焦点太近以至于
a very special ellipse

1209
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:44,930
看上去似乎合二为一了  还能是什么别的
whose foci have joined so close together that they appear to be one.

1210
01:44:49,935 --> 01:44:52,104
或许只是异想天开而已  亚斯巴修
Perhaps, I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

1211
01:44:52,313 --> 01:44:55,774
为什么非这样不可  也许我只是
I mean, why should this be so? Maybe I'm just,

1212
01:44:56,275 --> 01:44:57,735
也许我
Maybe I'm,

1213
01:45:08,037 --> 01:45:09,538
你怎么看?
What do you think?

1214
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:17,463
很可能就是这样的  主人
It could well be solved, mistress.

1215
01:45:27,348 --> 01:45:30,267
太好了  我们明天再继续
Well done, we'll continue with this tomorrow.

1216
01:45:30,893 --> 01:45:32,478
去休息吧
Get some sleep.

1217
01:45:32,561 --> 01:45:34,021
-晚安  主人  -晚安
-Good night, mistress. -Good night.

1218
01:45:36,315 --> 01:45:37,483
谢谢你
Thank you.

1219
01:46:49,847 --> 01:46:50,889
达乌斯
Davus!

1220
01:46:54,518 --> 01:46:55,561
达乌斯
Davus!

1221
01:46:59,732 --> 01:47:01,317
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1222
01:47:24,757 --> 01:47:25,924
老师
Lady.

1223
01:47:27,593 --> 01:47:29,136
让我看看
Let me see.

1224
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:31,847
你去那边坐下吧
Why don't you sit down?

1225
01:47:35,601 --> 01:47:37,061
大家都去哪了
Where is everybody?

1226
01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:38,729
请坐
Please sit down.

1227
01:47:39,772 --> 01:47:40,814
我有
I have,

1228
01:47:41,023 --> 01:47:42,691
我也有消息要告诉你
I have news for you too.

1229
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:52,493
所有的已经皈依
All dignitaries

1230
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:54,995
基督教的官员们
who have yet to embrace the Christian faith

1231
01:47:55,204 --> 01:47:57,206
将要在公众面前
are to be baptized

1232
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,708
接受洗礼
in public.

1233
01:48:04,254 --> 01:48:05,714
目的非常明确
The aim very clear:

1234
01:48:05,965 --> 01:48:10,511
为了增加拥护者  使市里所有的基督徒
It's to add to our cause, all the Christians in the city

1235
01:48:12,846 --> 01:48:15,224
以及正派人士们
decent folk, better

1236
01:48:15,849 --> 01:48:17,726
都为我尽忠
to fight for me.

1237
01:48:20,145 --> 01:48:22,106
你指的是宣扬信仰吗?
You speak of battling faith.

1238
01:48:31,782 --> 01:48:32,866
非常好
Very well.

1239
01:48:34,827 --> 01:48:37,204
既然所有的事都已成定局
It seems everything seems to have been decided already.

1240
01:48:37,246 --> 01:48:40,165
我不懂你还让我来这里做什么?
I don't understand why you required my presence here.

1241
01:48:55,889 --> 01:48:57,891
我又不是政府的一员
I am not a member of government.

1242
01:48:58,267 --> 01:49:01,937
你不是  但你更重要  你是我最信任的人
No, you are more than that. You are the person I trust most

1243
01:49:02,146 --> 01:49:03,272
众人皆知
and everyone knows it.

1244
01:49:03,522 --> 01:49:05,399
你在说什么?
What can I say?

1245
01:49:13,949 --> 01:49:14,992
老师
Lady.

1246
01:49:18,287 --> 01:49:19,872
很多年前
Many years ago,

1247
01:49:22,166 --> 01:49:24,335
很多年前你教导我们
years ago, you taught us something.

1248
01:49:25,586 --> 01:49:26,670
如果
If,

1249
01:49:27,171 --> 01:49:31,133
等同于同量的量
If two are equal to a third they are,

1250
01:49:31,342 --> 01:49:33,552
彼此相等  还记得吗?
all are equal to each other. Do you remember?

1251
01:49:33,636 --> 01:49:34,553
是的
Yes

1252
01:49:34,678 --> 01:49:37,514
我们三个  我们都是好人
The three of us, we are all good people.

1253
01:49:37,598 --> 01:49:41,060
你和我们一样  都是虔诚的基督徒
And you, you are as Christian as we are!

1254
01:49:45,814 --> 01:49:48,776
辛奈西斯  你对你的信仰深信不疑
Synesius, you don't question what you believe.

1255
01:49:51,153 --> 01:49:52,529
但我不能
You cannot.

1256
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:57,409
我必须怀疑
I must.

1257
01:50:09,922 --> 01:50:11,382
那真是太遗憾了
That's a pity,

1258
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:12,758
老师
Lady.

1259
01:50:12,967 --> 01:50:14,593
莫大的遗憾
A great pity.

1260
01:50:16,303 --> 01:50:18,472
我们所尊敬的老师
Our revered teacher

1261
01:50:18,681 --> 01:50:21,392
竟然背弃了自己曾教给过我们的东西
taken away from what she herself taught us.

1262
01:50:22,977 --> 01:50:25,145
你以为我不知道你  所执迷那些愚蠢的事
Or do you think I'm not aware of the insane things you invoke.

1263
01:50:25,354 --> 01:50:28,482
-辛奈西斯  -地球围绕太阳旋转
-Synesius! With Earth moving around the Sun.

1264
01:50:29,942 --> 01:50:31,610
接下来又会是什么?  老师
What next, Lady, what next?

1265
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:34,738
求你让我离开吧
You must let me go.

1266
01:50:35,572 --> 01:50:37,032
让我进去  让我进去
Let me in! Let me in!

1267
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:39,743
-我有话对她说  -一个圣战士
-I'll go straight to her. -Why does she wanna see a parabolani?

1268
01:50:39,952 --> 01:50:42,871
-老师  -在我们逮捕你之前快滚
-Lady! Go away before we arrest you.

1269
01:50:43,706 --> 01:50:45,582
-走开  -亚斯巴修
-Leave! -Aspasius!

1270
01:50:45,874 --> 01:50:48,711
是我  达乌斯  达乌斯  放开我
It's me, Davus. Get off me.

1271
01:50:49,545 --> 01:50:50,796
-告诉他们你认识我  -你认识他吗?
-Tell them who I am -I know this man, please.

1272
01:50:51,005 --> 01:50:52,464
是的  你想干嘛?
What do you want?

1273
01:50:52,589 --> 01:50:55,175
我有话对她说  她在哪?
I need to speak to the mistress. Where is she?

1274
01:50:55,384 --> 01:50:57,886
-女主人不在家  -十万火急  她在哪?
-Mistress is not here. -It's urgent! Where is she?

1275
01:50:58,721 --> 01:50:59,972
她在提督宫殿里
She's at the prefect's palace.

1276
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:01,932
-哪里?  -她在提督宫殿里
-Where? -The prefect palace!

1277
01:51:02,057 --> 01:51:04,768
-提督宫殿  -谢谢  快点滚
-Prefect's palace. -Thank you. Get out of here.

1278
01:51:06,353 --> 01:51:07,396
那到底是谁?
Who was that?

1279
01:51:09,064 --> 01:51:10,607
他以前是这儿的奴隶
He was a slave once.

1280
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,783
等等  求你  等一下  求你了
Wait, please! Wait! I beg you.

1281
01:51:29,293 --> 01:51:33,881
如果你不同意的话  我就不能再保护你了
If you don't agree, I won't be able to protect you any longer.

1282
01:51:35,341 --> 01:51:38,427
我也不能和你交往
I won't be able to have dealings with you

1283
01:51:40,137 --> 01:51:41,680
甚至不能和你打招呼
neither greet you.

1284
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,726
希帕蒂亚
Hypatia.

1285
01:51:47,311 --> 01:51:48,687
你还不明白吗?
Don't you see?

1286
01:51:49,605 --> 01:51:51,815
没有你我活不下去的
I can't go on without you.

1287
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:54,318
我不行
I cannot.

1288
01:52:00,366 --> 01:52:02,451
没有你我无法打败西里尔
Without you, I can't defeat Cyril.

1289
01:52:04,328 --> 01:52:05,579
俄瑞斯特斯
Orestes.

1290
01:52:12,002 --> 01:52:14,004
西里尔已经赢了
Cyril has already won.

1291
01:52:31,939 --> 01:52:32,982
谢谢
Thank you.

1292
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:34,984
但我不需要你们的保护
I do not need you.

1293
01:53:03,637 --> 01:53:04,555
达乌斯!
Davus!

1294
01:53:07,391 --> 01:53:09,560
兄弟  你要去哪里?
Brother! Where are you going?

1295
01:53:10,102 --> 01:53:11,270
我们找到她了
We found her!

1296
01:53:55,689 --> 01:53:57,024
婊子  快走
Come on, walk!

1297
01:53:57,232 --> 01:53:58,817
快走  罪人
Move it, sinner!

1298
01:54:02,321 --> 01:54:04,239
婊子
Whore!

1299
01:54:15,084 --> 01:54:15,793
妖女
Witch!

1300
01:54:18,212 --> 01:54:19,338
多神教的人渣
Pagan sinner!

1301
01:54:32,893 --> 01:54:36,230
走啊  快走
Move! Come on!

1302
01:54:38,524 --> 01:54:39,650
妖女
Witch!

1303
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:04,383
把她扒光
Strip her naked!

1304
01:55:13,642 --> 01:55:14,685
站起来
Get up.

1305
01:55:17,104 --> 01:55:21,275
就这样  这样上帝  可以看清你的污秽  妖女
That's it. So that God can behold in all your filth, whore.

1306
01:55:21,483 --> 01:55:22,860
看清你如何蛊惑提督  娼妇
The way you knock the prefect so hard.

1307
01:55:23,068 --> 01:55:24,903
异教徒
Heathen!

1308
01:55:25,654 --> 01:55:26,697
娼妇
Whore.

1309
01:55:27,031 --> 01:55:27,865
看啊
Look,

1310
01:55:28,073 --> 01:55:29,199
她一点反应都没有
she's not reacting.

1311
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:32,745
把刀子插进她的皮肤她就叫得出来了
She will scream all right when we skin her alive.

1312
01:55:33,454 --> 01:55:35,372
-有多少人有刀子  -没有
-How many of you have knives? -None.

1313
01:55:39,543 --> 01:55:41,712
不要让不洁的血液玷污你们的双手
Don't stain your hands with impure blood.

1314
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,591
用石块砸死她吧
Let's stone her!

1315
01:55:46,925 --> 01:55:48,927
-我们用石块砸死这个妖女  -去找些石块
-Let's stone this witch! -Get some stones.

1316
01:55:49,928 --> 01:55:51,430
-快点  我们扔俄瑞斯特斯的石头
-Quickly! The ones we throw at Orestes.

1317
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:52,890
还在这里
they are still here.

1318
01:55:53,098 --> 01:55:55,267
我看着她
I'll stay with her.

1319
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:02,811
她晕过去了
She fainted.

1320
01:58:34,385 --> 01:58:36,470
希帕蒂亚的尸体残缺不全  留下的部分
The body of Hypatia was mutilated and the remains,

1321
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:38,555
被拖去游街  焚烧
were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.

1322
01:58:38,555 --> 01:58:40,641
俄瑞斯特斯被永久性的放逐  而西里尔,
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cyril,

1323
01:58:40,641 --> 01:58:46,897
则掌握了亚历山大的大权
took control of the power in Alexandria.

1324
01:58:48,983 --> 01:58:53,153
不久之后  西里尔被封为圣徒  教会圣士
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.

1325
01:58:57,324 --> 01:58:59,410
尽管希帕蒂娅的成果  没有被保存下来
Although not any of Hypatia works remains,

1326
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:01,495
但她仍然被后人当作杰出的天文学家
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer,

1327
01:59:01,495 --> 01:59:04,540
并且以对圆锥曲线的研究而著称
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.

1328
01:59:09,837 --> 01:59:11,922
1200年后
One thousand two hundred years later,

1329
01:59:11,922 --> 01:59:14,008
17世纪  天文学家约翰内斯・开普勒
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler,

1330
01:59:14,008 --> 01:59:16,093
解释了圆锥曲线之中的
described that one of those curves,,

1331
01:59:16,093 --> 01:59:19,221
椭圆  正是它主宰着星球的运动轨迹
the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
