The late fourth century A.D. the Roman Empire began to crumble.

地處于埃及行省的亞歷山大港
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt

如同落日余暉
still retained some of its luster,,

該港擁有古代世界七大奇跡之一
possessed one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world:,

7
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,730
享譽盛名的亞歷山大燈塔
the legendary lighthouse

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,280
以及人類早期歷史上最偉大的圖書館
and the biggest library known.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,910
這個書館不僅是文化寶庫  也是宗教象征
The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol,,

10
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,000
多神教徒在此參拜他們的祖先神
a place where the pagans worshiped their ancestral gods.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,700
如今傳統的多神教徒與猶太教徒
The traditional pagan worship in the city now coexisted,

12

在此共存
with the Jews,

Christianity.

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,500
少有傻瓜會捫心自問
How many fools do you think have asked themselves?

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,310
星星為何不會從天空墜落
why don't the stars fall from the sky

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,540
可你不同  你受過智者的教育
But you, who've had the teachings of the wise,

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,180
你知道星星只會升起或落下
You know that the stars move neither up nor down.

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,000
自東至西轉動
they merely revolve from east to west,

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,640
沿著最完美的軌跡
following the most perfect course ever conceived,

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,520
做圓周運動
The circle.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,390
風暴佳人

23
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,470
圓周運動主宰宇宙
Because the circle reigns in the heavens,

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,910
因而星星永不墜落
the stars have never fallen and they never will.

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,770
但是在地球上呢?
But, what about here on Earth?

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,910
在地球上  物體自由降落
Here, bodies do fall.

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,290
但是他們的運行軌跡  不是環形而是線形
But their movements are not circular but linear.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,750
再看一次
Watch again.

29
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,720
再看一次
Watch again.

30

別撿  放那兒
No, leave it.

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,290
那么
So,

32
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,720
你們認為在地面之下究竟蘊藏著
What mysterious wonder do you all think might be

33
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,210
何種神奇物質?
lurking beneath the Earth

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,930
使得人類  動物
that would make every single person and animal

35

所有的物體以及奴隸適得其所
and object and slaves circular?

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,970
那會是什么呢?
What might it be?

The weightiness.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,440
不對  你們說的是一樣東西
No, you're both speaking about the same thing,

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,930
但你們都沒有切中要害
but you're not talking about the primary course.

43
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,560
你們有沒有人想過你們的
Have any of you ever wondered that your,

站立在宇宙的正中央
are standing on the very center of the cosmos

47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,450
而宇宙承載萬物
that holds all things together

48
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,850
并將萬物緊密相連
and pulls them together

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,720
如果沒有中心
If there were no center

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,530
那么宇宙將會混沌不清
then the universe would be

51
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,700
無窮無盡  無狀之狀  雜亂不堪
shapeless, infinite, formless, chaotic.

52
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,210
無論我們身處何方
Will it make a little difference,

53
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,180
都將毫無二致
if we were here or there or anywhere?

54
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,540
那我們不降臨人間豈不更好
And we'd all be better off never have been born.

如果我說不是  那就是欺騙主人
If I said no, that'd mean I lied to my master.

143
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,290
我不知哪個情節更嚴重?
I don't know which one's worst.

144
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,660
那你就該緘默不語
Then you should say nothing at all.

145
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,430
好了
There.

146
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,970
謝謝您
Thank you.

147
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,430
我想讓你知道主人對此很失望
I want you to know that the Master is upset with himself about this.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,350
那是什么?
What is that?

149
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,490
是我做的小玩意  女主人
Something I made, Mistress.

150
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,700
這看上去像是一個
But it looks like a,

151
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,660
這到底是什么?
What is it?

152
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,580
這是托勒密的天體系統
It's Ptolemaic System.

153
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,350
的確如此
It is.

154
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,200
這是你做的嗎?
Did you do this?

155
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,430
這是地球
Earth

156
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,660
她是宇宙的中心
is the center of the cosmos

157
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,200
而環繞四周的有
and revolving around it

158
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,060
太陽以及5大行星
the Sun and the five wanderers:

159
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,930
水星  金星  火星  木星  土星
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

160
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,710
并沒有遵守圓周運行軌跡的規律
Obstinately disobeying the law of the circle.

161
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,200
然而托勒密卻向我們證明
Nevertheless, Ptolemy shows us that

162
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,270
他們遵守圓周規律
they do obey.

163
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,310
他們之所以繞圈運動
The fact that we see them move in a loop

164
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,750
是由兩個天體環形運轉合力而為
is due to the joint effect of two circles.

165
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,120
其中一個繞地球旋轉
One that travels around the Earth

166
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,950
另一個沿著較小的圓形軌跡自轉
and another lesser circle prophet to each wanderer.

167
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,910
看  那是本輪
Look, the epicycles.

168
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,700
你們所看到的并非真正的規律
See, it's not heaven or earth.

169
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,520
只是雙眼蒙騙了我們
But our eyes that deceive us.

170
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,700
說的真好  達烏斯
Well said, Davus.

171
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,580
你的講解證明
I'd like you to know that your exposition shows me

172
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,970
你比在座的某些人更加用心
that you've been paying closer attention than One or two,others here.

173
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,070
聽著  上帝在造物之前
I tell you, the gods should have consulted me

174
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,430
都應該先征詢我的意見
before they created anything.

175
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,660
你這從何說起  俄瑞斯特斯
Why do you say that, Orestes?

176
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,470
所有的這些都太古怪了
It all seem so whimsical!

177
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,290
為什么是兩個天體  環形運轉合力而為呢
Why the joint effect of two circles?

178
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,510
如果行星不按自己的本輪公轉
Wouldn't it be more perfect, if the wanderers didn't wander,

179
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,520
而只按一個環形軌跡公轉  不是更合理嗎
and a single circle gave sense to everything?

180
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,750
俄瑞斯特斯  你有什么資格  評判上帝的杰作
Orestes, by what authority do you judge the work of God?

181
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,330
我哪兒得罪你了嗎?  基督徒
What is wrong with you, Christians?

182
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,970
難道人都不能開口說話了嗎?
Can a man no longer open his mouth in this city?

183
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,680
你批判天地萬物  你批判我們的主
If you criticize creation, you criticize our Lord and you offend us.

184
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,090
因而你冒犯了我們
You should move out to the desert.

185
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,290
你該搬到沙漠里去
You won't hear anything,

186
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,370
這樣你永遠都不會聽到這些逆耳之詞
to offend you out there.

187
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,020
你們不知所云  所有人都如此
You know nothing of what you speak. None of you.

188
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,000
辛奈西斯  歐基里得的第一公理是什么?
Synesius, what is Euclid's first rule?

189
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,120
你為什么問這個?
Why the question?

190
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,100
只要回答我
Just, answer me.

191
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,890
那個
If,

192
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,220
等于同量的量
if two things are equal to a third thing,

193
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,410
彼此相等
then they are all equal to each other.

194
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,080
很好
Good.

195
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,410
你們都和我非常熟識吧
Now, are you both not similar to me?

196
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,410
是的
Yes.

197
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,180
那你呢?  俄瑞斯特斯
And you, Orestes?

198
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,580
也是
Yes.

199
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,000
在此我向你們鄭重聲明
Now, I'm actually saying this to everybody here in this room.

200
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,330
我們要團結而不是分裂
More things unite us than divide us.

201
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,970
無論外面事態如何  我們都親如手足
Now, whatever maybe going on in the streets. We are brothers.

202
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,580
我們親如手足
We are brothers.

203
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,030
我希望你們記住
I want you to remember

204
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,640
我們并非奴隸或者烏合之眾
that brawls are for slaves and periphera.

205
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,330
現在我們用熱烈的掌聲
Now I think we should all honor Davus,

206
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,410
感謝達烏斯為我們講解這些知識
with some very well earned applause.

207
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,000
他們會決定我們每個人是生是死
He'll judge us all alive and dead.

208
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,390
到了那個時候就為時已晚
And then it will be too late,

209
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,450
只有那些信仰耶穌的人
because only those who believed in Jesus

210
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,220
才能得到救贖
will be saved.

211
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,720
你們此時不皈依吾主
What are you waiting for?

212
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,810
更待何時
What are you waiting for?

213
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,140
上帝之國在你我上方
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

214
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,270
你們聽懂我說的話了嗎?
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

215
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,720
聽懂了
Yes.

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,540
你們明白要像個人嗎?
Yeah but do you understand like men do?

217
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,140
或者你們不明白  就像只小羊羔
Do you, not your head, a sheep?

218
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,390
你在這看什么?
What are you looking at?

219
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,370
對  就是你
Yes, you.

220
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,250
你在這里干什么?
What are you looking here?

221
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,750
你是阿摩尼阿斯嗎?
Are you Ammonius?

222
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,200
那個創造奇跡的人
The man who performed the miracle?

223
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,330
你想看到奇跡嗎?
Do you want to see a miracle?

224
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,620
你是他嗎?
Are you the one?

225
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,080
我是
I am.

226
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,000
跟我來
Come with me.

227
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,560
耶穌走遍加利利
Jesus went throughout Galilee

228
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,950
在各會堂里教訓人
teaching in their synagogues.

229
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,770
傳送天國的福音
Preaching the good news for you

230
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,040
醫治百姓各樣的病癥
and healing the diseases of sick.

231
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,200
他的名聲就傳遍了敘利亞
News about him spread going to Syria

232
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,750
來自世界各地的人們  都慕名前來朝拜他
and people came from all over the world.

233
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,620
那是西奧勒斯
That is Theophilus.

234
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,120
我們的主教
Bishop.

235
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,910
因為天國是他們的
For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

236
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,620
哀慟之人有福了
Blessed are those who mourn

237
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,220
因為他們必得安慰
for they will be comforted.

238
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,390
溫柔之人有福了
Blessed are the meek

239
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,250
因為他們必繼承土地
for they will inherit the earth.

240
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,830
饑渴慕義之人有福了
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness

241
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,750
因為他們必得飽足
for they will be filled.

242
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,200
天主的世界
The word of God!

243
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,290
憐恤人之人有福了
Blessed are the merciful

244
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,470
因為他們必蒙憐恤
for they will be shown mercy.

245
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,120
清心之人有福了
Blessed are the pure in heart,

246
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,310
因為他們必得見神
for they will see God.

247
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,000
天主與你同在
The Lord be with you.

248
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,640
你是怎么穿過那火焰的?
So how are you able to escape the flames?

249
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,350
-天主與你同在  -也與你同在
-The Lord be with you. -And with you.

250
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,370
你覺得呢?我祈禱而已
What do you think I did? I prayed.

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,430
你可能都不知道該如何祈禱吧?
You probable do not even know how.

252
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,330
你那包里有什么?
What do you have in that sack?

253
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,140
-有吃的嗎?  -這是我主人的
-Do you have any food here? -It's for my Master.

254
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,120
你沒什么毛病吧?
What's wrong with you?

255
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,040
給你的話  我就得自己掏腰包了
I have to pay for that with my own money!

256
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,640
你要錢干什么?
What do you need money for?

257
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,350
看看他們的眼神
Look at their faces.

258
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,870
來
Here.

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,580
我想讓你自己來試試
I want you to try it yourself.

260
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,220
然后我教你怎么祈禱
And afterwards I will teach you how to pray.

261
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,790
來
Go on.

262
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,720
-天主與你同在  -主保佑你
-The Lord be with you. -Bless you.

263
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,600
看見了嗎?
See?

264
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,580
這就是奇跡
That is a miracle!

265
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,700
繼續  接著發
Go on, keep doing it.

266
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,890
神與你同在
The Lord be with you.

267
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,660
謝謝
Please.

268
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,790
謝謝你
Thank you.

269
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,350
神保佑你
Bless you,

270
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,370
主保佑你
God bless you.

271
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,600
保佑你
Bless you.

272
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,200
奴隸
Hey, slave!

273
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,660
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

274
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,220
達烏斯
Davus.

275
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,930
奴隸達烏斯
Davus the slave!

276
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,370
你像個真正的基督圣戰士
Now, you look like a true parabolani.

277
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,080
一名真正的耶穌的戰士
A true soldier of Christ.

278
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,430
他們說什么呢?
What are they saying now?

279
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,720
讓他們跳舞
Telling them to dance.

280
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,430
他們正暢飲美酒呢
The men are now heavy with wine.

281
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,500
出海旅行
All aboard!

282
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,950
多么不幸的旅途
Oh what an unfortunate wreck.

283
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,140
救救你的奴仆吧
Save your servants!

284
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,910
第二幕結束
End of Part Two!

285
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,580
謝謝觀看  各位觀眾
Thank you, audience, thank you.

286
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,870
我們現在要更換道具以及演出服裝
Now, excuse the delay while we move things around,

287
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,950
希望大家諒解
and change our costumes.

288
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,680
不好意思
Good evening

289
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,180
原諒我的大膽
Forgive my boldness.

290
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,060
我是俄瑞斯特斯
I am Orestes,

291
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,720
俄瑞斯特斯家的兒子
son of Orestes.

292
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,950
我在這
I'm here to,

293
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,310
我在這想說出  對哲學家希帕蒂亞的愛意
I'm here to declare my love for Hypatia, the philosopher.

294
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,020
而她也深知這點
I mean, you all no doubt know

295
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,830
我采納了她給我的建議
for some time now, following her counseling.

296
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,850
我投身于音樂當中
I have devoted myself to music.

297
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,390
希望在聲音的和諧中尋求到一絲慰藉
In the hope of seeking solace in the harmony of its sounds.

298
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,100
但對我來說
But for me,

299
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,270
只有我傾慕的女士身上才有這種和諧
such harmony resides only in my lady.

300
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,290
所以
So,

301
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,930
我站在這只是為了
My purpose here is merely to,

302
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,220
獻上我的音樂
offer my melody

303
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,830
并且希望
in the hopes of,

304
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,520
不用再說了
Stop talking.

305
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,370
那人肯定很有前途
That man will go far, I tell you.

306
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,890
如果我準備的是香蕉而不是無花果
He's my preferred fruit for the banana not the fig,

307
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,560
我早就扔在他腳下了
I would have already fallen at his feet.

308
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,970
你準備怎么回禮呢?
Wouldn't it be best to please him?

309
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,750
我嗎?
Me?

310
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,890
怎么回禮?
How?

311
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,130
格來提  你能阻止的了你的女兒嗎?
Granting him your daughter's hand.

312
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,400
難道你不打算讓她嫁人嗎?
Why don't you ever plan to marry her off?

313
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,660
希帕蒂亞嫁給一個男人  不讀書不教書
Hypatia subject to a man? Without freedom to teach?

314
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,620
甚至不談她的那些想法嗎?
Or even to speak her mind.

315
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,530
我認識的最杰出的哲學家
The most brilliant philosopher I know

316
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,640
必須要放棄科學
having to give up her science.

317
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,770
不  那會讓她生不如死的
No, that could be death to her.

318
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,370
沒錯  她的工作受人敬仰
It's true. Her work is admirable.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,700
并且她德才兼備
That she's brilliant and virtuous.

320
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,750
可是賽昂
But Theon,

321
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,750
別忘了她的處境啊
She has not found her gift.

322
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,350
她只是個女人
Being a woman, I mean.

323
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,540
我們在天上的父  宅心仁厚
Our Father who art in heaven,

324
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,080
別讓她答應別人
Don't let anyone have her.

325
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,600
求你別讓她答應別人
Please, don't anyone else have her.

326
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,120
別讓別人  別讓她答應任何人
Don't let anyone else have her.

327
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,470
阿門
Amen.

328
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,140
早安  老師
Good day, lady.

329
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,700
早安  老師
Good day, lady.

330
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,370
早安
Good day, lady.

331
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,950
早安  老師
Good day lady.

332
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,300
昨天很多人看到  你們的同學把他的樂器
Yesterday, many of you would have seen one of your colleagues

333
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,870
獻給了我
present me an ollos

334
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,310
我接受了禮物
I accepted the gift.

335
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,160
而今天我也想回送給他一份禮物
And today I wish to make him earn a gift of my own in return.

336
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,290
這是給你的
This is for you.

337
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,520
這是我的經血
It is the blood of my cycle.

338
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,140
俄瑞斯特斯你
Orestes you,

339
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,580
你說你在我身上找到了和諧
You say that you have found harmony in me.

340
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,880
那我建議你看看周圍
Well, I am suggesting that you look elsewhere

341
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,620
因為我覺得周圍也存在著
because I think that there is little harmony or,

342
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,540
和諧和美麗
beauty in that.

343
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,120
你覺得呢?
Don't you agree?

344
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,770
昨天我們談到了阿波羅尼斯錐
Yesterday we were discussing the Apollonian cone.

345
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,520
我們講了圓形  橢圓  拋物線
We discussed the circle, the ellipse, the parabola.

346
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,330
-今天我們來講雙曲線  -老師
-Today we will discuss the hyperbola. -Lady!

347
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,350
不好意思  老師
Forgive me, Lady.

348
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,310
奧林匹斯要你趕快到神廟去
Olympius requires your presence urgently in the Serapeum.

349
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,910
你們也是
You as well.

350
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,830
感謝主  感謝主
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

351
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,910
感謝主
Thank you, Lord.

352
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,910
難道我們要忍受他們詆毀我們的信仰
How are we to enjoy them force feeding us the faith

353
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,970
習俗  甚至我們的人民嗎?
and customs to people who until recently becoming outlaws?

354
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,060
-發生什么事了?  -這是種褻瀆
-What's happening? -It's despicable. A sacrilege.

355
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,080
基督徒已經在城市廣場集會了
Christians have gathered in the Agora.

356
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,160
他們在嘲弄我們的神明
They are mocking the gods.

357
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,770
我們必須阻止這些褻瀆
We must put an end these insults!

358
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,330
他們也許不怕他
They may not fear him,

359
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,560
但他們一定會怕我們的利劍
but they will fear our swords.

360
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,350
等等
Wait!

361
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,600
等等
Wait!

362
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,470
你們要干什么?
Now, what is it you are going to do?

363
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,180
你們要去襲擊他們嗎?
Are you going to attack them?

364
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,040
只因為他們的無禮  就讓他們血濺當場嗎?
Are you going to stain your hands with blood for an insult?

365
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,620
是對神明們  對神明們的褻瀆
To the gods! An insult to the gods!

366
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,410
如果你覺得他們過分
Well, if you think it is so outrageous then go

367
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,950
應該直接去通知本地的提督
and announce their acts before the prefect.

368
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,620
你好像在保護他們
One might think that you're protecting them.

369
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,750
我在盡力保護我們的學生們
I am trying to protect our disciples.

370
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,250
而你  在煽動他們成為野蠻的殺人犯
You, are inciting them to be violent murderers.

371
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,140
賽昂  作為首領  由你來決定吧
Theon, as director, you have the last word.

372
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,000
必須壓制他們對神明們的不敬
The insult must be answered.

373
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,680
猶太教徒可以自愿參加
Those Jews amongst you do as you please.

374
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,160
這不是你們的戰爭
This is not your battle.

375
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,100
而這里的基督徒們
As for you Christians

376
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,870
你們最好去找你們的耶穌
you would do well to join those of your own fate.

377
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,620
你不能讓我的學生走出這個建筑
You will not caused my disciples out of this house!

378
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,480
-塞拉皮斯萬歲  -為了神明們
-Glory be to Serapis! -And all the gods!

379
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,980
等我的命令
Wait for my command!

380
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,890
在我們包圍他們前  不會有人懷疑我們的
No one must suspect us until we have them surrounded.

381
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,480
這些劍是給奴隸的  奴隸們
The clubs are for the slaves. Slaves!

382
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,660
奴隸也要參加
Slaves are all for summon!

383
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,460
達烏斯  回去
Davus, back.

384
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,120
不  回去
No. Go back.

385
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,210
殺了基督徒
Death to Christians!

386
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,790
塞拉皮斯萬歲
Glory be to Serapis!

387
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,140
讓我們聆聽她的聲音
Let's listen to her now!

388
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,770
你們聽到她的抱怨了嗎?
Do you hear any complaint?

389
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,330
沒有
No!

390
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,980
這一座也失聲了
This one has lost her voice too!

391
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,230
他們的嘴不能說話
Their mouths do not speak,

392
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,210
他們的眼看不到東西
their eyes do not see,

393
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,290
他們的鼻子聞不到味道
their nose doesn't smell.

394
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,500
但多神教徒卻要跪倒在他們面前
Yet still, pagans come here and kneel before them.

395
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,750
這是多么的瘋狂啊
What madness is this?

396
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,180
順從神明們的旨意
For the gods!

397
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,270
梅多羅
Medorus!
Take care of your master! Protect it,!

398
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,870
上帝只有一個
God is one!

399
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,180
打倒異教徒
Death to the pagans!

400
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,430
你  你看什么呢?  打啊
You! What are you looking at? Get there and fight!

401
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,310
打啊
Fight!

402
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,850
你聾了嗎?  我說打啊
Are you deaf? I said fight!

403
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,580
我是個基督徒
I'm a Christian!

404
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,480
我是個基督徒
I am a Christian!

405
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,960
我是個基督徒
I am a Christian!

406
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,270
-什么是基督?  -基督是神
-What is Christ? -Christ is one!

407
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,770
打倒異教徒
Death to the pagans!

408
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,160
上帝只有一個
God is one!

409
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,410
不  不
No! No!

410
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,210
入口  我們必須守住入口
The entrance! We must defend the entrance!

411
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,500
怎么了?
What's happening?

412
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,210
我們的人被基督徒打敗了
Our men are being sent back by the Christians!

413
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,750
父親
Father!

414
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,600
沒事  沒事
It's alright. It's alright.

415
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,460
怎么了?
What happened?

416
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,960
是他的奴隸干的
It was his slave.

417
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,580
達烏斯  給我拿些布那些水來  快
Davus, get me some cloth some water, quickly.

418
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,660
父親
Father,

419
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,230
辛奈西斯  我們得離開這里
Synesius, we must get out of here.

420
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,680
扶住他別動
Hold him still.

421
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,620
基督徒們來了
Parabolani are coming!

422
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,600
上帝與我們同在
God is with us!

423
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,040
哈利路亞  哈利路亞
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

424
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,850
-關上大門  -別  我們的人還在外面
-Close the gates! -You know our men are still out there!

425
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,930
愿神明們保佑他們
May the gods protect them.

426
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,020
我說關上大門
Close the gates,I said!

427
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,960
別殺他  我們把他留作人質像那其它基督徒一樣
Don't kill him! He'll be our hostage like the others.

428
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,230
大家都聽見了嗎?
Did you hear it everyone?

429
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,830
你抓到的所有基督徒
Any Christian you catch

430
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,290
如今都是人質
is now a hostage.

431
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,730
把我們的傷者送去寺院
Take our wounded to the temple

432
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,480
基督徒帶到地下室去
and the Christians down into the cellars.

433
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,410
眼神好的人去暀W觀察情況
And anyone with a good eye and a good aim up on the walls.

434
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,460
奧林匹斯
Olympius.

435
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,640
他是個基督徒
This one is a Christian.

436
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,930
沒錯  還有那三個
Yes, and those three as well.

437
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,700
如果他們是基督徒  他們就得去地下室
If they are Christians, they will go down to the cellars.

438
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,220
奧林匹斯
Olympius

439
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,700
如果你要囚禁我的兄弟們
if you are going to imprison my brothers

440
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,640
你就得把我也關起來
then you are going to have to imprison me with them.

441
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,770
如果必須如此  我會這樣做的
If it is necessary, I will do that.

442
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,480
如果任何人
If anyone,

443
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,390
任何人
anyone,

444
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,600
敢碰我兄弟們一根指頭
dare lay a finger on one of my brothers

445
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,140
我發誓我會刺穿他的身體
I swear I'll run in for you.

446
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,920
看
Look!

447
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,100
看這個
Look at this!

448
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,060
俄瑞斯特斯
Orestes.

449
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,080
謝謝你
Thank you.

450
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,250
什么時候開始?
Since when were there

451
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,710
有這么多基督徒的
so many Christians?

452
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,310
我們不得不和他們談判了
We'll talk to them to negotiate.

453
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,250
我們在等什么?
What are we waiting for?

454
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,000
一個基督徒君主能做些什么呢
What can we expect from a Christian emperor?

455
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,870
除非我們收起刀劍
Except we'll be put in a sword.

456
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,420
至少我現在活了下來
Our sense of positive being the life when his verdict arrives.

457
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,770
小心
Here will do.

458
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,210
請大家都不要擅自行動
No one should leave the group, please.

459
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,060
他們要整夜祈禱嗎?
Are they going to pray all night?

460
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,040
達烏斯
Davus.

461
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,600
待在這兒
Stay here.

462
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,170
這里很安全
It's safer here.

463
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,460
好好的留在這吧
Just stay with him first.

464
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,730
辛奈西斯  你要干什么?
Synesius! What are you doing?

465
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,500
老師  姐姐  母親
Lady, sister and mother,

466
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,420
愿主祝福并保護你
May God bless you and protect you.

467
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,540
退后
Move back!

468
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,730
奴隸至死都吃這個
Slaves take it to the back.

469
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,750
奴隸排最后
Slaves get to the back!

470
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,670
三個一出現了
If this three one come out.

471
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,850
會是場災難
It's a disaster.

472
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,830
父親  你什么時候才能不擲骰子?
Father, why don't you leave the dice?

473
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,960
今天有人看過傷口了嗎?
Have you been seen today?

474
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,940
-沒有  -沒有嗎?
-No. -No?

475
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,270
讓我看一下
Let's have a look.

476
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,020
孩子  向我保證
Promise me, my child, that,

477
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,290
在我死后  忘記現在這個愚蠢的老頭
when I'm gone, you won't remember this foolish old man.

478
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,750
我保證
I promise.

479
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,440
記住我曾經的樣子
Remember me as I was before.

480
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,330
記住那個還能思考  并且
Before when I could still think and,

481
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,400
我
I,

482
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,330
與你共事的我
work with you and,

483
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,770
記住我傾聽你心事時的樣子
I listen to you.

484
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,620
我怎么會犯下這樣的大錯?
How could I have been so wrong?

485
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,690
如今因為我的錯誤  讓你被困在這里
Seeing you here locked up because of my,

486
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,250
父親  請別說了
Father, please.

487
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,060
我希望你能夠自由
I wanted you to be free.

488
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,750
我是自由的
I am free.

489
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,540
基督徒們
Hey, Christians.

490
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,830
基督徒們
Christians!

491
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,580
你們對上帝的那份自信哪兒去了?
What's that confident God of yours doing now?

492
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,600
進棺材吧  人渣
Maybe coffins for you, scums!

493
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,480
告訴我
So tell me.

494
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,080
那些神如今在哪里?
Where are the gods now?

495
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,790
他們在哪?
Where are they?

496
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,850
-可能也去找別人了吧?  -別人
-Might as well look for others. -Others?

497
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,190
哪一個?  基督徒的上帝嗎?
Which one? The God of the Christians perhaps?

498
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,370
真是太放肆了
Such boldness!

499
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,560
你怎么想  老師?  你是如此的勇敢
What do you think, Lady? You are so bold.

500
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,330
把這盆火滅掉
Put the fire out.

501
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,460
你的確很大膽
You are indeed bold.

502
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,580
非常大膽
Very bold.

503
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,290
我一直在想你對我說過的那些事
I've been thinking about something you said to me.

504
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,540
我嗎?
Me?

505
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,980
那天你質疑天體的運動軌跡
That day that you criticize the heavenly mechanism

506
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,700
而且你把它稱為無稽之談
and you called it whimsical.

507
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,120
是的  盡管
Yes, although,

508
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,690
其實
Actually,

509
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,770
我是在質疑托勒密的理論
I was criticizing Ptolemy.

510
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
他的本輪理論讓一切都變復雜了
For complicating everything with his epicycles.

511
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,650
但我不確定  也許只是有些欠考慮
I don't know perhaps I'm just simple-minded.

512
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,790
不是
No.

513
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,230
天空之上
No, the heavens

514
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,000
應當是簡單的
should be simple.

515
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,580
那么我是對了還是
So am I right or,?

516
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,100
如果
What if,

517
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,600
如果有個更簡單的理論可以解釋
What if there were simpler explanations

518
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,940
那些行星又當如何?
for the wanderers?

519
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,750
有的
There is.

520
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,440
但卻太荒謬了  太陳舊了
But it is so absurd, so old.

521
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,150
沒有人愿意相信它
That no one gives it any credit.

522
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,600
那是什么理論?
What theory is that?

523
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,170
你是在說阿里斯塔克斯嗎?
Do you think of Aristarchus?

524
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,870
阿里斯塔克斯認為
Aristarchus maintained

525
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,750
地球本身在移動
that the earth moves.

526
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,810
而幾大行星的奇怪行為
The strange behavior of the wanderers

527
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,940
僅僅是我們的星球
was nothing more than an optical illusion

528
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,060
在圍繞著太陽運動時
caused by our movement

529
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,500
所產生的光學幻覺而已
in combination with Earth around the sun.

530
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,040
-以太陽為中心的模型  -是的
-Heliocentric model. -That's right.

531
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,120
太陽在中心
The sun would be in the center

532
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,350
仿佛它是宇宙眾星的尊貴之王
acting as speaking of it as "King of the Stars".

533
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,920
-讓我們變成了  -他的著作
-It would make Earth just,another wanderer. -His work was lost

534
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,120
在主圖書館的一場大火中被燒毀了
in the fire that destroyed the mother library.

535
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,120
這就是我們必須好好保護  這地方的原因
This is why we have to take great care of this place.

536
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,160
我們的圖書館
Our library

537
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,850
存留著人類的所有智慧
is all that remains of the wisdom of men.

538
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,770
但每次扔一個物體
But everytime you drop an object here.

539
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,100
誰在說話
Who speaks?

540
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,710
原諒我  女主人
Forgive me, Mistress.

541
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,500
我一直在聽
I was listening.

542
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,690
說吧  達烏斯
Speak up, Davus.

543
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,500
如果地球在移動
If the earth is moving,

544
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,730
每當扔下一個物體
every time dropping an object it would,

545
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,120
它就會落到后面才對
fall further behind.

546
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,190
而風應該會保持迎面吹來
And the wind would always blow against us.

547
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,310
鳥兒會迷失航向
And the birds would lose their way in flight.

548
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,290
我跟你說過
I told you

549
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,940
阿里斯塔克斯的假說一點都講不通
Aristarchus' hypothesis makes no sense at all.

550
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,250
我覺得你剛才說的可以被駁倒
I feel that what you just said can be refuted.

551
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,730
但現在我不知道如何去駁倒
But right now I don't know how.

552
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,270
給提督讓道
Make way for the prefect!

553
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,150
讓開
Make way!

554
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,170
給提督讓道
Make way for the prefect!

555
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,940
讓開
Make way!

556
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,330
大家都聽著
Listen one and all!

557
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,920
請大家認真聽并遵守君主的裁決
Prepare to hear and obey the verdict of our Emperor.

558
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,480
我  弗拉維烏斯·狄奧多西·奧古斯都
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

559
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,020
獵戶區省的君主和最高行政長官
Emperor and Supreme Head of the provinces of the Orient,

560
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,900
最近了解到
having been informed of the events,

561
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,330
在亞歷山大城發生的大事
which recently took place in the City of Alexandria,

562
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,830
特此宣布并命令大家
do hereby declare and command

563
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,850
這些起義者將會得到保護
that the insurgents shall be pardoned and freed.

564
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,830
而作為我寬宏大量的交換
In exchange for my generosity,

565
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,960
起義者必須馬上
the insurgents will

566
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,460
離開神殿和圖書館
abandon the Serapeum and the Library immediately

567
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,690
同時允許基督徒進入
allowing the Christians to enter

568
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,350
并處理掉所有卷軸
and dispose off the premises

569
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,480
按其心意
as they see fit.

570
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,690
我們在期待什么?  他們會毀掉一切的
What are we to expect? They'll destroy everything!

571
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,230
多神教徒將會從后門離開
Pagans will leave by the stable.

572
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,170
那些書
The Books.

573
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,190
從那里你們會被護送至你們的家里
And they will be escorted to their homes.

574
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,000
馬上執行
Obey this, instant!

575
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,830
派一半軍隊去那邊
Send half of the regiment to the other side.

576
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,330
其余的等會過去
and send the rest later.

577
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,790
是的  長官
Yes, sir.

578
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,810
提督
Prefect.

579
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,210
我們這樣堅持不了多久
We won't be able to contain this, not for long.

580
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,450
以十字架的名義  以十字架的名義
On the cross! On the cross!

581
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,770
留下那些次要的書
Leave the lesser works.

582
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,100
-哪些是次要的?  -拿走那些重要的
-Which are the lesser works? -Just take the important ones. The important ones.

583
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,980
士兵們后撤了
The soldiers are withdrawing!

584
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,080
奴隸
Slave!

585
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,270
-你們看到我的女主人了嗎?  -快過來幫忙
-Have you seen my mistress? -Just get over here and help!

586
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,420
-我們拿不了這么多  -我們需要更多幫助
-They're not carrying so many. -We need more help.

587
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,160
請帶我的父親離開這里
Please go and get my father out of here.

588
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,290
快帶他離開這里
Get him out of here now.

589
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,250
奴隸
Slave!

590
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,750
快  快走  快走
Go! Go! Go! Go!

591
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,770
快點  快點
Come on, quickly!

592
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,920
希帕蒂亞和他的學生還在正廳里
Hypatia and her students are still in the atrium.

593
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,170
他們瘋了嗎?
Are they out of their minds?

594
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,020
既然他們想那樣  就隨他們去吧
If that's what they want, let them burn.

595
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:02,790
快點
Come on!

596
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,250
快點
Quickly!

597
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,480
小姐
Lady.

598
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,920
你去哪兒了?  把那個袋子撿起來
Where have you been? Pick up that sack.

599
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,620
-小姐我們得走了  -把那個袋子撿起來
-Lady We have to go. -Pick up the sack!

600
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,150
為什么到需要的時候  奴隸總是不在身邊
Why are slaves never around when you needed them?

601
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,420
-我剛才在  -快點走啊  快點
-I was, -Move!, move your feet, move!

602
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,400
白癡
Idiot!

603
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,400
快跑
Run!

604
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,980
快點  沒有時間了
There is no time!

605
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,830
老師
Lady!

606
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,960
別管這些了
Leave them.

607
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,650
上帝只有一個
God is one!

608
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,190
趕快
Run!

609
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,230
達烏斯
Davus!

610
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,620
你要去哪兒?
Where are you going?

611
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,310
-我們得走了  -達烏斯  你要去哪兒?
-We have to go! -Davus, where are you going?

612
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,420
如果他想為我們的神而死  就隨他吧
If he wants to die for our gods, let him.

613
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,080
達烏斯  不要  不要這樣做
Please, no. Please don't do this.

614
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,650
-快點  -達烏斯
-Come on! -Davus!

615
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,310
-達烏斯  不要  -快走
-Davus, no! -Come on!

616
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,270
以十字架的名義
God is one!

617
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:23,000
哈利路亞  哈利路亞  哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

618
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,810
奴隸
Slave!

619
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,750
達烏斯
Davus!

620
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,150
達烏斯
Davus!

621
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,690
奴隸達烏斯
Davus the slave!

622
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,710
幫我弄倒這個
Help me with this!

623
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,790
幫我
Help me!

624
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,170
哈利路亞  哈利路亞  哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

625
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,480
多神教徒的人渣
Pagan sinners!

626
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,650
最沉重的傷痛都過去了
The Master's wound is festering.

627
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,710
我知道
I know.

628
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,600
我知道
I know.

629
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,730
達烏斯
Davus.

630
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,440
達烏斯
Davus!

631
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,560
你自由了
You're free.

632
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,270
走
Go.

633
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,250
走吧

634
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,250
從現在開始  在亞歷山大
Hence forth, in Alexandria

635
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,100
只許舉行基督教和猶太教的慶典
only Christian and Jewish worship shall be permitted.

636
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,770
禁止一切多神教的祭祀
Pagan sacrifices,

637
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,100
禁止膜拜多神教的象征物
worshipping pagan symbols

638
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,750
禁止參觀多神教教堂
and visiting pagan temples shall no longer be allowed.

639
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:19,440
任何人敢這么做或注視它們的
Should anyone commit such an act or dare raise his eyes on the statues

640
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,130
古老神像  都將會得到嚴厲的懲罰
of former gods. He shall be punished without penance.

641
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:40,900
圖書館淪陷后  許多多神教徒皈依基督教

642
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,020
希帕蒂亞則繼續教學和進行研究

643
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,100
而他之前的學生

644
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,230
成為了社會的中流砥柱

645
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,350
整個帝國被一分為二

646
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,480
許多基督徒認為  這是世界終結的前兆

647
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,560
于是決定過更神圣的生活

648
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,250
基督教圣戰士穿梭在大街小巷

649
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,850
精力充沛地監督基督徒的品行

650
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,210
而猶太教徒的存在讓他們無法釋懷

651
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,810
該死的猶太人
Damn Jews!

652
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,270
該死的猶太人
Damn Jews!

653
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,440
他們只是一群沒用的惡棍  畜生
They're just a bunch of good for nothing thugs, packed animals!

654
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,350
喬瑞恩  我親愛的朋友  冷靜點
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

655
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:51,210
讓西里爾主教解釋一下吧
Let Bishop Cyril speak in his own defense.

656
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,020
提督
Prefect

657
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,000
我們那些神圣的圣戰士
our blessed parabolani,

658
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,020
他們僅僅是
Whom he has just called

659
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,210
在打拍子而已
the Beast of Burden.

660
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,650
只是為了附和他們打拍子而已
Devote themselves true enough to carrying burdens.

661
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,770
他們都是殘疾人或者病人
crippled, the sick, the lepers,

662
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,230
還有石頭
And stones!

663
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,100
提督  他們帶了石頭
Prefect, they carry stones.

664
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,210
突然沖進劇院
And now, they burst into the theatre

665
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,000
他們知道我們無法自衛  還用石頭砸我們
and stone us knowing we will do nothing to defend ourselves.

666
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,080
因為今天是安息日
Because it is the Sabbath!

667
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,000
在安息日這天  你們應該
On the Sabbath you should honor God

668
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,920
在猶太教會堂向主祈禱
in your synagogues instead stuffing yourselves

669
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,690
而不是在劇院欣賞戲劇
with sweet set of theater.

670
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,290
正因為這個石頭才會落到你們頭上
That is why the stones fell upon you.

671
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,730
提督  聽到了嗎?  他威脅我們  這太過分了
Prefect, do you hear that? Now, he's threatening us. This is too much.

672
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,480
友愛些  我們是合眾院
Friends, there are more things that unite us than divide us.

673
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,380
我們是兄弟  我們全都親如手足
We are brothers! We're all brothers.

674
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,690
沒有猶太人哪會有你們基督徒?
Where would you Christians be without the Jews?

675
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,850
耶穌就是猶太人
Jesus was a Jew!

676
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,150
耶穌就是猶太人
Jesus was a Jew!

677
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,380
我發現了點東西
There is,something I find

678
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,460
可以反駁你所說的
disturbing in what you've told me.

679
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,850
-是什么?  -好吧
-What?  -Well,

680
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,650
西里爾為什么要開始清理城市?
Why does Cyril speak of cleaning up the city?

681
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,040
他已經擁有這么多了還不滿足嗎?
Is he not satisfied with what he already has?

682
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,330
他只想嚇嚇猶太人
I think he's just trying to frighten the Jews.

683
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,310
可為什么要當你的面說?
But why say it in front of you?

684
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:40,790
如果他想對付的是你  而不是他們怎么辦?
What if really he was addressing you and not them?

685
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,540
我  為什么?  我和他一樣都是基督徒
Me? Why? I'm as much as Christian as he is.

686
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,690
是的  可你忘記了
Yes, but you forget

687
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,810
你圈子里許多人不是基督徒
that many of us from your circle are not.

688
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,900
滿帆  提督
And a full sail, prefect.

689
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,020
走吧
Let's go.

690
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,540
-亞斯巴修  準備好了嗎?  -是的  女主人
-Aspasius, you ready? -Yes, mistress.

691
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,810
我要你拿著麻袋爬到桅桿的頂端
I would like you to take the sack and climb to the top of the mast.

692
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,380
好了  老師
And now, Lady,

693
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,400
你能給我解釋一下  這是怎么回事嗎?
Will you finally tell me what the point of all this is?

694
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,730
當亞斯巴修扔下麻袋的同時
When Aspasius drops the sack,

695
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,020
船在往前走
the boat will be moving forward.

696
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,580
因此麻袋
Therefore, the sack

697
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:33,500
不會掉在桅桿下
won't fall at the foot of the mast,

698
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:37,880
而是會掉得往后一些  我想大概
but will fall further back. I would say about,

699
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,080
大概會在這兒
about here.

700
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,380
這樣做有什么意義嗎?
And what is so special about that?

701
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,040
-太好了  -可你錯了
-Yes! -But you were wrong!

702
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:05,900
是  但這是決定性證據
Yes, but this is definite proof!

703
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,170
決定性的  麻袋就像是在靜止的船上那樣掉下來
It's definitive. The sack behaved as if the boat was stationary.

704
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:12,040
那意味著什么?
What does that mean?

705
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,170
我不知道
I don't know.

706
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,600
但同樣的原理也可以應用在地球上
But the same principle could be applied to the Earth.

707
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,600
它可能繞著太陽轉而我們卻不知道
It could be moving around the Sun without us realizing.

708
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,670
-阿里斯塔克斯的理論  -沒錯
-Aristarchus. -Exactly.

709
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,460
你為什么要那么執著呢  老師?
Why do you torment yourself with that, Lady?

710
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,270
托勒密理論雖不完善
Ptolemy's not perfect but,

711
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,040
但卻很管用
it works.

712
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,330
俄瑞斯特斯  當時是你提出的
Orestes, but you are the one who,

713
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,710
提督  幾年前你可沒有這么務實
A few years ago, you weren't so pragmatic, prefect.

714
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,670
幾年前我總是不經思考就發言
Well, a few years ago, I talked first and thought later.

715
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,190
我看到了仙王座三
I have Cepheus third.

716
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,250
三十七
37.

717
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,330
四十八
48.

718
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,900
金星和木星共同落在水瓶座里
Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius.

719
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,330
我父親定會用美酒慶祝這種結合
My father would have celebrated such a conjunction with a good wine.

720
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,290
-星星永遠不會落下  -真的嗎?
-The stars will not fall. -Oh really?

721
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:36,210
是的  因為它們都鑲在盒蓋上
No, because they're fixed to the lid of their chests.

722
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,750
蓋子會打開兩顆心  然后耶穌就誕生了
The lid will open in two hearts and then Jesus will appear.

723
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,560
你說的是什么盒子?
What chest are you talking about?

724
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:47,560
你不知道宇宙是個巨大的盒子嗎?
Don't you know that the universe is a gigantic chest?

725
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:52,150
天堂是蓋子  地球是底部
Heaven is the lid on top and the Earth, the ground,

726
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:56,520
他們沒告訴這個笨蛋地球是圓的
They haven't told this fool that the Earth is round.

727
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,400
地球是扁的
The Earth is flat.

728
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,690
你的腦袋是扁的
Your head is flat.

729
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,460
去看看圣經吧
Read the Scriptures!

730
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,750
如果地球是圓的
If the earth is round,

731
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,880
為什么住在下端的人們不會掉下去?
Why don't the people at the bottom fall off?

732
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,250
住在側面的人呢?
What about the ones on the sides?

733
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,440
他們為什么不會滑下去呢?
Why don't they slide off?

734
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,880
想想看
Think about that.

735
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,000
達烏斯知道
Davus knows.

736
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,560
兄弟
Hey, brother.

737
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,020
你有什么看法?
What do you say?

738
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,150
地球是扁的還是圓的
Is the earth is flat or round?

739
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,460
只有上帝才知道這些
Only God knows those things.

740
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,330
放在地上別動
Leave them on the ground!

741
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,070
別管它們  它們就該放地上
Leave them on the ground! That's where they belong.

742
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,230
女士  請您不要灰心喪氣
Lady, you must not lose heart.

743
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,040
今天在船上您已經取得了很大的進展
Today on the boat you made great progress.

744
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,000
為什么所有行星的亮度的變化
Why do the wanderers bury their brightness?

745
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,500
會如此變化無常
So unexpectedly.

746
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:56,730
更糟的是
And what is worse,

747
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:58,920
為什么太陽
Why does the sun?

748
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,080
為什么它的體積在夏天和冬天會不同
Why does it change size from summer to winter?

749
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:07,880
也許是因為它有時近
Perhaps because sometimes it is nearer,

750
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,540
有時遠
and other times it is farther away.

751
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,040
可是  亞斯巴修
But Aspasius

752
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,330
看
Watch.

753
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:18,600
按阿里斯塔克斯的理論  太陽一定
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

754
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,380
是在萬物的中心
at the center of everything.

755
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,600
而我們的地球
With us, the Earth,

756
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:26,830
繞著它沿圓周軌跡在公轉
traveling in a circle around it.

757
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,040
因此  這就是關鍵
Therefore, and this is the key.

758
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,630
我們和它一直
We're always at exactly,

759
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,460
保持著同樣的距離
the same distance.

760
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,900
如果按你說的  距離會改變
Now, if as you just said, we accept the changes in distance

761
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,880
那么我們就得
then we are forced to add

762
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,210
在地球軌道上加一個本輪
and epicycle to the Earth's orbit.

763
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:55,380
這樣它才會時近時遠
So it's going to be nearer and then it's going to be farther away.

764
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,020
這樣我們就陷入托勒密的謎團里了  .
But now we fall into the same trap as Ptolemy.

765
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,900
-圈套著圈  -沒錯
-Circle upon circles. -Exactly!

766
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,580
我不知道如何解決這個矛盾
So I just do not know how to resolve this conflict.

767
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,080
你覺得我們能解決
I mean, the only thing we could do is,

768
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,810
把太陽從中心移走  那么
displace the sun from the center and well,

769
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,100
并非必須在中心
not to have a center.

770
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,290
這讓我感到傷心  亞斯巴修
It breaks my heart, Aspasius.

771
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,080
告訴我  我該怎么做?
So tell me, what do I do?

772
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,040
休息一下吧  女士
Rest, lady.

773
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,830
基督圣戰士
Parabolani!

774
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,650
-圣戰士們  -怎么了?
-Parabolani! -What is happening?

775
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,080
圣戰士們  快來救命啊
Parabolani, quick! Help!

776
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,060
圣亞里罕德羅著火了
St. Alexander's on fire!

777
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,730
著火了
It is a fire.

778
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,540
快點
Come on!

779
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,150
去提水  拿上水桶  拿著這個
Gather water! Get the water! Quick! Take this!

780
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,960
快點
Hurry!

781
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,980
快
Quick!

782
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,980
快  快點  跑快點
Come on, come on!

783
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,310
圣戰士們
Parabolani!

784
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,020
圣戰士們啊
Parabolani!

785
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,900
圣戰士  快啊
Parabolani, quick!

786
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,060
哪著火了?
Where's the fire?

787
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,230
在那邊  那邊
Where's the fire?

788
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,230
是猶太人  這是陷阱
Jews! It's a trap.

789
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,900
這是陷阱
It's a trap!

790
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,270
基督徒們
Christians, all.

791
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,810
昨夜是悲慘的一夜
Last night was a night to deplore.

792
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,250
現在我告訴你們
Now I say to you.

793
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:27,250
不要再為死去的兄弟們感到悲傷
Grieve no longer for our dead brothers.

794
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,850
不要哭泣
Weep not.

795
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,790
把眼淚留給其它人吧
Shed your tears for the others,

796
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,810
他們是劊子手
for they are executioners.

797
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,690
沒錯  沒錯
Yes, yes.

798
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,810
為那些干這件事的人哭泣吧
Weep for them. For those who have done this,

799
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,210
他們對上帝一無所知
Know not of God,

800
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,810
沒有愛  沒有同情心
nor of love nor of parity.

801
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,100
他們什么都不懂
They know not

802
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:07,060
因為今天他們重現了圣經里的情景
because it is they who repeat the words of the Scriptures

803
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,810
卻對此一無所知
with no understanding at all.

804
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,400
他們只看到一個人
It is they who saw only a man

805
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,420
那就是上帝的兒子  站在他們面前
when the Son of God was standing in front of them.

806
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,330
也正是他們愚昧地嘲笑他
And it is they who in their blindness

807
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,940
還將他釘死在十字架上
mocked him and crucified him.

808
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:32,050
哭泣吧  哭泣吧  為猶太人哭泣
Yes Weep! Weep for the Jews,

809
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,540
他們害死了我們的主
those evil butchers of our Lord.

810
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,500
因為上帝
Because God,

811
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:43,500
上帝已經責罰他們了
because God, God, God has already condemned them.

812
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,060
這是上帝的旨意
It is God's will,

813
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,460
讓他們成為奴隸
that they live as slaves

814
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:51,310
被詛咒  被流放  直到世界末日
cursed and exiled until the end of time.

815
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,710
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

816
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,040
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

817
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,250
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

818
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,080
女士  別停下  女士
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

819
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,950
所有的猶太人都想要復仇
Now all the Jews will want to retaliate.

820
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,710
恐怕你不清楚目前的狀況
I'm afraid you don't understand what's really happening.

821
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,460
一切結束后  亞歷山大  就不再有猶太人了
When this is all over, there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.

822
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,730
很抱歉這樣冒失地闖了進來
I'm sorry for busting in like this.

823
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,650
老師  你不該冒險來這里的
Lady, you should the risk of coming here.

824
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,520
軍隊在哪?
Where are the troops?

825
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,170
為什么街道上沒有士兵?
Why are there no more soldiers on the streets?

826
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:48,600
在那種混亂中  沒有軍隊  可以控制整個城市
No army could contain that mob. The entire city is in a frenzy.

827
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,650
他要求殺光所有的婦女和兒童
Calling to the annihilation of women and children.

828
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:56,730
他是主教
A bishop!

829
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,330
-他是基督徒  -那就把他關起來
-A Christian! Then lock him up.

830
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:06,310
提督  你應該逮捕他
Prefect. You should have him arrested.

831
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,730
事情沒那么簡單
It's not so easy.

832
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:17,350
女士  西里爾知道我們有相同的信仰
Lady, Cyril knows they both share the same faith.

833
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,080
這讓我們的長官進退兩難
That places our prefect in a very awkward position.

834
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,480
如果他為猶太人辯護
If he defends the Jews, half the city will rise up

835
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,670
會有一半的市民反對政府
against his government.

836
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,790
我明白了
I see.

837
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,790
可如果現在你什么都不做
But if you choose to do nothing now,

838
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:40,340
我相信西里爾  會繼續重復相同的事
I believe Cyril will continue to do the same thing over and over again and until,

839
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:45,860
直到殺光城里的最后一個人
until there is no one left in this city.

840
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:48,500
就沒人可以讓政府管理了
No people for this government to govern.

841
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,500
我太幼稚了
How naive of me.

842
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,540
我真幼稚  居然寄希望于最終的改變
How naive of me to think we have finally chose.

843
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,230
猶太人滾出去
Jews out!

844
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,460
他們先殺了他們
First, they kill them

845
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,540
然后埋了他們
then they bury them.

846
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,600
是昔蘭尼的主教
The Bishop of Cyrene.

847
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,730
-他來這兒干什么?  -我去看看
-What is he doing here?  -I'll find out.

848
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,830
這是我的小亞歷山大圖書館
It's my little library of Alexandria.

849
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,500
我在這里教孩子們知識
This is where I teach  the children.

850
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,770
阿波羅尼斯圓錐體
An Apollonian cone.

851
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:56,310
是的  我用它來教孩子們四種不同曲線
Yes, I built it to teach them about the four curves.

852
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,880
圓形
The Circle.

853
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,690
橢圓形
The ellipse.

854
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,380
俄瑞斯特斯應該早到了才對
Orestes should really be here by now.

855
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,730
拋物線
Parabola.

856
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,130
雙曲線
And hyperbola.

857
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,460
真是美極了
It's truly beautiful.

858
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,420
我常看著它去思考
You know, I often look at it and I always wonder

859
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,500
為什么相同的圓軸?
why does the circle coexist with such

860
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,480
會產生如此多不同的形狀
impure shapes?

861
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,420
不如我坐在這里再聽你講一次課
When I get to sit here and listen to you again.

862
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,080
看來讓你無聊了
I bore you.

863
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,540
我已經很久沒有教書了
It's been a long time since I've done anything but,

864
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,040
只是在研究天體系統上絞盡腦汁
beat my head against a stone.

865
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,900
然而卻無人關注它的重要性
Anyhow, there are more important matters at hand.

866
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,040
我來晚了
Forgive me.

867
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:52,150
一個多神教徒控制著兩個基督徒
Two Christians in the hands of a heathen.

868
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,810
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage!

869
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,670
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage!

870
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:27,670
-這里有多少?  -不知道  但會發出惡臭
-How many left? I don't know but it smells.

871
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,480
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius.

872
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,500
上帝跟你說過話嗎?
Does God speak with you?

873
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,420
你總是這樣
All the time.

874
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:46,100
阿摩尼阿斯這樣  阿摩尼阿斯那樣
Ammonius this, Ammonius that. Ammonius, Ammonius, Ammonius.

875
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,710
今天他對我說得極快
Today, he spoke to me

876
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,150
非常快  我不得不請求他說慢點
so quickly, I had to ask him slow down.

877
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,100
告訴我
Tell me something.

878
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:59,130
你認為我們是錯的嗎?
Do you ever think we're mistaken?

879
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,080
為什么這么說?
Why?

880
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,580
我曾被寬恕過
I always forgive and,

881
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:16,100
但現在  我無法寬恕別人
but now, I can't forgive.

882
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:18,920
寬恕
Forgive?

883
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,790
誰?
Who?

884
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,290
猶太人嗎?
The Jews?

885
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,020
耶穌在十字架上寬恕了他們
Well, Jesus pardon them on the cross.

886
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,500
耶穌是上帝
Jesus was God

887
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,830
只有他才有這種寬容心
and only He can show such clemency.

888
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,380
你怎么敢拿自己跟上帝相提并論
How dare you compare yourself to God?

889
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,690
兄弟
Brother.

890
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,000
我們現在還活著
We are still alive.

891
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,400
因為什么?
Why?

892
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,170
因為
Because it was

893
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:57,880
是上帝的旨意  讓我們沒被石頭打死
His will to save us from the stones.

894
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:03,600
上帝讓我們在此  行該做之事
God wants us here, doing what we do.

895
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,310
你不再相信這些了嗎?
Don't you believe in that anymore?

896
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,330
閣下
My Lord,

897
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,770
西里爾是個驕傲的男人
Cyril is a very proud man.

898
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:36,430
他同意會面  但只協商和平議題
He'll agree to meet, but he wouldn't discuss the Jews,

899
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:37,880
不商討猶太人問題
only discuss peace.

900
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,100
和平
Peace?

901
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:45,060
作為您卑微的參謀  我的建議是
My suggestion, as your humble adviser in this affair,

902
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,040
請您接受提議
is for you to accept.

903
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,330
和平是最重要的
Let peace be foremost.

904
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,710
-老師  你怎么看?  -我
-Lady, what do you think? -Well,I,

905
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,630
我覺得這個提議并沒有那么好
I don't think it's very encouraging.

906
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,440
為什么他來見俄瑞斯特斯?
Why would he want to come and see Orestes without any concrete proposals?

907
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,660
而且還有別的東西
And there's something else.

908
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,270
他要來見你
He won't come to you.

909
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:08,400
但需要你在圖書館和他見面
Demands he meet you in the Library,

910
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,960
在星期天的禮拜中
during the Sunday service.

911
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,560
在圖書館嗎?  為什么?
In the Library? Why?

912
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,990
那次搶占之后
Only Christians are being permitted to enter the Library

913
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,830
只有基督徒才能進入圖書館
since it was stoned.

914
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,130
這是挑釁
It is a provocation!

915
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,810
請允許我說幾句
Allow me to suggest.

916
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,250
如果你覺得你的到場
If you consider your presence

917
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,710
是如此的重要
so essential

918
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:30,900
為什么你不接受洗禮呢?
why not let yourself be baptized?

919
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,790
我們中的大多數人
The majority of us here,

920
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,710
包括最高長官  都已經接納了基督教
beginning with our prefect, have accepted Christ.

921
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:40,900
剩余的這些人為什么不行呢?
Why not the rest of you?

922
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:44,130
這只是個時間問題  你們心知肚明
It's only a matter of time and you know it!

923
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,480
是嗎?
Really?

924
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,810
這真的只是個時間問題嗎?
It is just a matter of time?

925
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,310
請容許我說幾句
Well, excuse me,

926
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,290
尊敬的元老  但據我所知
honored member but as far as I'm aware

927
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,690
你們的上帝并不能證明他自己
your God has not yet proved himself

928
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,130
比他的前任們更公正更仁慈
to be more just or more merciful than his predecessors.

929
01:23:59,330 --> 01:23:59,960
老師
Lady.

930
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:03,920
讓我接受你們的信仰  真的只是時間問題嗎?
Is it really just a question of time before I accept your faith?

931
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,420
那是什么?
Why, then,

932
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:08,600
難道這次會議
should this assembly

933
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:12,670
要接受一個毫無信仰的人
accept the counsel of someone who admittedly

934
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,000
提出的提議嗎?
believes in absolutely nothing?

935
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,060
我信仰哲學
I believe in philosophy.

936
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,540
哲學
Philosophy.

937
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,040
正是現在這種時候
Just what we need

938
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:29,020
我們所需要的東西
in times like this.

939
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,420
夠了
Enough!

940
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,750
這些年來  我一直在研究
All these years, I've been studying.

941
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,130
完全沒有了自己的生活
With absolutely no life of my own.

942
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,630
我想知道  我這樣為了什么?
And I wonder, what was the point?

943
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,670
忘了今天那些話吧
Whoa, forget about what was said today.

944
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,980
是生活困住了我嗎?
Is this all life holds for me?

945
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,520
還能是什么?
What else?

946
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,170
我覺得沒人能看出
I doubt anyone could see as a,

947
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,830
你是一位忠誠的妻子
devoted wife

948
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,080
一位盡心的母親
and mother.

949
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,060
我認為
I think,

950
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:19,110
城里的所有人都聽說了手帕的故事
I think everyone in the city knows the story of the handkerchief.

951
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,650
所以
So,

952
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,210
我父親也會喜歡女人
My father loved a woman.

953
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,190
連他也不例外
Even he,

954
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,710
有誰不愛呢?
Who have I ever loved?

955
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:41,470
除了你
Except you,

956
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,620
黎巴農斯
Libanius.

957
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,850
如果我能
If I could just,

958
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,370
解開這個謎團
just unravel this,

959
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,060
只需要再多努力一點
just a little bit more.

960
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,310
只要離答案再接近一些  那么
And just get a little close to the answer then,

961
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,610
這樣  我就能
then I would,

962
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:18,090
我就能安然入土
then I would go to my grave a happy woman.

963
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,520
為什么?
Why?

964
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,130
為什么這些對你如此重要?
Why does that mean so much to you?

965
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,400
就是現在
Right now,

966
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:33,500
就在這一秒  整個世界可能都在移動
this very second, the whole Earth could be moving

967
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:35,790
卻沒有人意識到這些
and no one realizes it.

968
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,500
只有你和我知道
Except you and me.

969
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,000
相信我  老師  幸虧沒人意識得到
Believe me Lady, it's best no one does.

970
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,900
你覺得這些真的不重要嗎?
Do you really not think it important?

971
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,990
我不明白你為什么
I don't understand

972
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:48,610
堅信人們腳下的土地是移動的呢
why you insist on moving the ground we walk on.

973
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,000
你也看到了船上發生的
Well, you saw for yourself what happened on the boat.

974
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:54,130
是的  但那也不能證明地球在移動
Yes, I did. But that does not necessarily mean the Earth moves.

975
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:56,520
如果確實是這樣呢?
What if it does?

976
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:59,230
希帕蒂亞  看看你的周圍
Hypatia, look around you.

977
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,790
死亡
Death,

978
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,250
恐懼
horror

979
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,810
毀滅
destruction.

980
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,730
如果地球真的在圓形軌道中移動
If the stars move in a circle

981
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,750
他們為什么  不把完美分給我們一些呢?
why would they share their perfection with us?

982
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,340
所以我們沒有移動
So we do not move,

983
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,000
只是不在圓形軌道中
In a circle.

984
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,770
我們不是按照圓形
We don't move,

985
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,880
運動的
Circle.

986
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,420
我們并非在圓形軌道中移動
We do not move in a circle.

987
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:37,150
從柏拉圖開始
Ever since Plato,

988
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,110
所有人  包括阿里斯塔克斯  希巴克斯  托勒密
all of them: Aristarchus Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

989
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:45,170
所有人都試圖用圓形軌道
they have all tried to reconcile their observations

990
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,250
來解釋他們的觀察結果
with circular orbits but,

991
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,860
但如果在宇宙中隱藏著其它形狀呢?
What if another shape is hiding in the heavens?

992
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,840
其它形狀
Another shape?

993
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:53,920
女士  沒有任何形狀比圓形更完美
Lady, there is no shape purer than the circle.

994
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,170
這是你教我們的
You taught us that.

995
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,400
我知道  只是假設
I know, but suppose just suppose the,

996
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,750
正是圓形的完美
purity of the circle

997
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,710
讓我們忽視了其它的一切
has blinded us from seeing anything beyond it.

998
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,000
就像耀眼的太陽讓我們
The same way that the glare of the sun

999
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,770
看不見星星一樣
blind us from actually seeing the stars.

1000
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,960
我必須重新
I must begin all over with,

1001
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:12,560
重新審視這個問題
with new eyes.

1002
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,420
我必須重新思考一切
I must rethink everything.

1003
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,980
所有的一切
I have to rethink everything.

1004
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:34,650
從保羅寫給提摩太的第一封信開始讀
Reading from the first letter of Paul to Timothy.

1005
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,810
我渴望男人  無處不在
I desire therefore, that everywhere

1006
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,560
舉起圣潔的手  隨處禱告
men should lift up holy hands in prayer

1007
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,310
無忿怒  無爭論
without anger or disputing.

1008
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,730
同樣  又愿女人
In like manner, I desire women

1009
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:54,340
廉恥  自守
to dress modestly,

1010
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,400
以正派衣裳為妝飾
with decency and propriety

1011
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,060
不以編發
not with braided hair

1012
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:04,340
黃金  珍珠
or gold or pearls

1013
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,420
和貴價的衣裳為妝飾
or expensive clothes,

1014
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:11,000
-只要有善行  -為什么讀這段?
-but with good deeds. -Why is he reading this passage?

1015
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:12,680
不知道  首領
I don't know, prefect.

1016
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,960
但我肯定這不是事先說好的那段
I assure you it is not the one we agreed on.

1017
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,090
女人要沉靜學道
That a woman learn

1018
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,630
一味的順服  我不許女人講道
in quietness and in full submission. I do not permit a woman,

1019
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,270
也不許他轄管男人
to teach or to have authority over a man,

1020
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,440
只要
but to be

1021
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:31,730
沉靜
in silence.

1022
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,380
這是上帝之言
This is the word of God!

1023
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,940
阿門
Amen.

1024
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,610
阿門
Amen.

1025
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:47,150
當耶穌把自己的神圣遺產
Jesus himself

1026
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,860
托付給他的十二門徒時
knew this when he

1027
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:53,290
他自己非常了解這些
entrusted his holy legacy to twelve men

1028
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,380
全是男人
Men.

1029
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,770
沒有一個女人
Not a woman among them.

1030
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,380
但是
And yet,

1031
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:04,440
我知道亞歷山大有些人
I know of some in Alexandria

1032
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,250
他們仰慕某個女人并且對她的話
who admire and even trust

1033
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,810
言聽計從
in the word of a woman.

1034
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:11,110
哲學家希帕蒂亞
The philosopher Hypatia.

1035
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,860
這個女人曾公然表示過
A woman who declared,

1036
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,670
她對上帝的不忠
in public, her ungodliness.

1037
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,190
她是個女巫
A witch!

1038
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,980
官員們
Dignitaries,

1039
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:33,400
你們現在應該全部信奉基督
it is time for you all to reconcile yourselves with Christ.

1040
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,110
這是上帝之言
This is the word of God.

1041
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,730
在圣經面前下跪  并接受真理吧
Kneel before it and embrace its truth.

1042
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,480
跪下
Kneel.

1043
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,810
他不準備跪下嗎?
Is he not going to kneel?

1044
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,340
他不準備跪下嗎?
Is he not going to kneel?

1045
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,130
跪下
Kneel!

1046
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,110
跪下
Kneel!

1047
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,710
罪人
Sinner!

1048
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,040
我是基督徒
I am a Christian!

1049
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,650
-我是基督徒  -不  你不是
-I am a Christian! -You're not a Christian!

1050
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,150
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I'm as Christian as you are.

1051
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:25,170
給提督讓路
Make way for the prefect!

1052
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,150
讓路
Make way!

1053
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,480
我是受過洗禮的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1054
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:43,090
我是受過洗禮的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1055
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,230
我要殺了你
I'll kill you.

1056
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,900
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I am as Christian as you.

1057
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,810
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I am as Christian as you are.

1058
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,520
怎么會發生這種事
I mean, how could such a thing be possible?

1059
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,020
罪犯已經被繩之以法了
The culprit has been executed.

1060
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,710
立即帶我去見提督
I would like you to take me to the prefect immediately.

1061
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:53,400
女士  他親自下令
Lady, he himself gave the order

1062
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,520
讓你待在家里等進一步的通知
for you to be confined to the house until further notice.

1063
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,960
現在這種情況  我建議你  不要在街上出現
At the moment your presence on the streets is not advisable.

1064
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,560
為什么?
For what reason?

1065
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:08,810
西里爾對你進行了嚴厲的譴責
Cyril has made some serious accusations against you.

1066
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,460
那么
And um,

1067
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:15,270
他控訴我什么罪名?
What does he accused me of?

1068
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,460
對上帝不虔誠
Ungodliness,

1069
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,860
還有使用巫術
And witchcraft.

1070
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:26,940
我知道了
I see.

1071
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,590
你在為什么事而煩惱嗎?女士
Is something bothering you, Lady?

1072
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:42,770
沒有
No.

1073
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:48,810
不如你來告訴我你在擔心什么?
Why don't you tell me what's worrying you?

1074
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,810
提督  咬住這個
Prefect, why don't you bite on it?

1075
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,360
說
Speak.

1076
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,650
昔蘭尼的主教想見您
The Bishop of Cyrene wishes to see you.

1077
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,710
所有人都出去
All of you,

1078
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,480
提督  傷口還沒處理好
Prefect, the wound is not yet closed.

1079
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,880
出去  出去
Get out. Get out!

1080
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,540
所有人出去
All of you out! Out!

1081
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,690
你們沒能殺死我啊
Well, that went well.

1082
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:50,060
你認為我也參與這件事了嗎?
You think I had a part on this?

1083
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,670
如果我想背叛你  怎么還會來到你面前
Would I show my face here if I wanted to betray you?

1084
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,210
-你是瞎了嗎?  -是的  我是瞎了
-Are you blind?  -I was, yes, I was blind.

1085
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,710
他一直想要的
Well, it's my head.

1086
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,520
是我的頭  他想讓我死
He's wanted all along, it's me,

1087
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,290
隨后就有了這次襲擊
that snake is after.

1088
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,520
這個政府
This government!

1089
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:08,500
這座城市
This city!

1090
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:11,520
聽著
Now, listen.

1091
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,170
-戰爭即將到來  -我知道
-War is brewing. I know.

1092
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,460
我知道
I know.

1093
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,770
那么宣誓對我效忠吧
Do you swear your loyalty to me?

1094
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,730
向國家宣誓  快
To the Empire? Do it.

1095
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,940
要么譴責他  要么滾出去
Condemn him or get out.

1096
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,270
我會這么做的
I will do it.

1097
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:43,920
如果有必要  我甚至會跪下來
On my knees, if necessary.

1098
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,310
而且不只如此
And not only that.

1099
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:49,200
幾天之內  我可以召集其它省的主教
In a few days, I can gather other bishops from the province

1100
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,150
和沙漠里的修道士們來對抗西里爾
and amongst from the desert all against Cyril.

1101
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,380
但首先我要問你個問題
First, I must ask you a question.

1102
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:08,920
俄瑞斯特斯  你相信耶穌嗎?
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

1103
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:10,790
你問我什么?
Do I what?

1104
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,770
-你相信耶穌嗎?  -你問我什么?
-Do you believe in Jesus?  -Do I what!?

1105
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,650
你到底是真正的基督徒
Are you a true Christian?

1106
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,770
還是你像那些寥寥眾生  僅僅臣服于
Or did you like so many others, only convert

1107
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:20,170
-自己的政治生涯  -辛奈西斯
-to prosper in politics? -Synesius.

1108
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,840
你為什么不下跪?
Why didn't you kneel?

1109
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,810
-我有什么選擇?  -你為什么不下跪?
-What choice did I have? -Why didn't you kneel?

1110
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,380
我還有什么選擇?
What choice did I have?

1111
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,500
背叛希帕蒂亞
Betray Hypatia?

1112
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,000
譴責她嗎?
Condemn her?

1113
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,460
你會那么做嗎?
Would you have done that?

1114
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:34,440
我絕不會冒犯上帝的
I would never offend God.

1115
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:37,560
是他  是他冒犯了上帝
It's he, he is offending God. He is offending him.

1116
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,450
他在歪曲圣經
He's twisting his words

1117
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:41,730
他在曲解圣經的意思
he's using the Scriptures.

1118
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,900
他只是在宣讀圣經
He read what is written.

1119
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:49,860
有多少女人可以對你發號施令
How many women do you obey?

1120
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,360
多少個?
How many?

1121
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,480
你仰慕的同時  又能聽你傾訴  的女人有幾個
How many do you admire and listen to?

1122
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,020
只有
Only

1123
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,590
一個
One.

1124
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,000
只有一個
Only one.

1125
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,770
圣經
The Scripture,

1126
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,590
圣經是正確的
The Scripture is correct,

1127
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,860
只是由于在他的手中
and it was in His hands.

1128
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:18,920
兄弟  你還不明白嗎?
Brother, don't you see?

1129
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,420
你不明白你那樣做是在眾人面前
Don't you see the insult to God?

1130
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,480
侮辱上帝嗎?
In front of everyone.

1131
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:31,520
我不知道
I don't know,

1132
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,310
我不知道該相信什么?
I don't know what, what I believe.

1133
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,880
你必須告訴他
You have to tell him.

1134
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:40,030
別跟我說  俄瑞斯特斯
Go tell him now, Orestes.

1135
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,110
告訴上帝你相信圣經
Tell him you believe in what is written.

1136
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,650
-我信奉  -別跟我說  去跟他說
-I believe, -Don't tell me. Tell Him.

1137
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,190
告訴上帝
Tell God.

1138
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:49,960
跪下
Kneel!

1139
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,890
許多人至今都記得
Many are those who remember today the miracles

1140
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:20,690
我們摯愛的兄長曾創造的奇跡
our beloved brother performed in life.

1141
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:26,730
比如那次他將自己托付給圣父
Like the time he commended himself to the Father

1142
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,540
踏過火堆卻毫發無損
and threw himself into fire and was not even singe.

1143
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,150
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius,

1144
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,840
因為英勇捍衛對基督的信仰而獻身
dead of bravely defending your faith in Christ.

1145
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,730
我追封你為
I proclaim you a martyr.

1146
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,960
圣徒
A saint.

1147
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,460
從此以后你將會被人們稱為
From now on, you shall be known as,

1148
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:54,960
圣圖梅西斯
Saint Taumasius.

1149
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,650
我們要討回公道
We want justice!

1150
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,150
公道
Justice!

1151
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:18,190
愿上帝指引我們  我親愛的
May God show us the way,

1152
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,210
圣戰士們  我言盡于此
my dear parabolani. Little else can I say to you.

1153
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,170
尼帝亞的修道士有多少
What about the monks of Nitria?

1154
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,190
他們至少有500人  而且
We can win at least 500 of them.

1155
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:35,170
我們還有500人
plus 500 of our own men,

1156
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,980
你以為這就夠了嗎?  他可是地區提督
Do you think that's enough? He's the prefect,

1157
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:40,060
都有的軍隊都會保衛他
He has a whole army to protect him.

1158
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,310
聽著
Listen!

1159
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,650
我們何不找個簡單又有效的方法
Why don't we do something much more simple and effective?

1160
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:46,110
你指的是什么?
What are you talking about?

1161
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,230
我們可以傷害他最關心的東西
We can hurt him where it hurts most,,,

1162
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,040
如何?
How?

1163
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,340
-那個婊子  -誰啊?
-That whore. -Who?

1164
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:59,650
如果我們敢于面對世界的本相會怎樣?
What if we dared to look at the world just as it is?

1165
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:04,020
我們先摒棄那些先入為主的想法
Let us share for a moment every preconceived idea.

1166
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:07,150
它會是什么形狀?  什么形狀?
What shape would it show us? What shape?

1167
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,900
你曾說過問題在于太陽體積的不一致
You once said that the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

1168
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,980
沒錯  我說過  很好  說清楚一點
Yes I did, good,good Put it into words.

1169
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:18,810
太陽一定要在中心  因為我們繞著它旋轉
The sun must be at the center, since we revolve around it.

1170
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:20,270
與此同時
And at the same time,

1171
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,920
它又在其它位置  因為它離我們時遠時近
in another position since our distance from it varies.

1172
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:25,900
-沒錯  正是如此  -怎么會?
-Yes, exactly. -How?

1173
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:31,430
它是如何同時占據兩個位置的?
How could it occupy two positions?

1174
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:36,310
它是如何同時占據兩個位置的?
How could it occupy two positions?

1175
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,540
怎么同時占據兩個位置的?
How could I occupy two positions at once?

1176
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:43,920
怎么同時占據兩個位置的?
How could I occupy two positions at once?

1177
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:02,460
亞斯巴修
Aspasius,

1178
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:21,000
沒錯  沒錯  就是那兒  另一個放在這兒
Yes, yes. There. And then the other one here.

1179
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:23,190
保持相同的比例
Keeping the same proportion.

1180
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,340
很好  把那端栓在火炬上
Good. Very good. Now, tie this end to that torch.

1181
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,770
亞斯巴修
Aspasius.

1182
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,690
我要你把這個想象成是地球
I want you to imagine that this is the Earth.

1183
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,690
每把火炬代表
And that each of these flames represent

1184
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:45,270
它距離太陽的兩個極限位置
the two extreme positions of the sun in relation to it.

1185
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,040
也就是冬天和夏天
In winter and in summer.

1186
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,040
如果這兩個位置都是同一個圓
What would happen if both these positions with the two centers

1187
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,920
的圓心會是什么樣
of one and the same circle?

1188
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,630
這是不可能的  主人
But it is impossible, mistress.

1189
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,210
等等  圓是什么?
Wait. What do we know about a circle?

1190
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,540
我們知道圓心
We know that the center of a circle

1191
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,460
到圓周上任一點的距離總是相等
is always the same distance from any point along its perimeter.

1192
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:03,710
-沒錯  -是的
-Exactly. Yes, so,

1193
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,480
那如果我們把這個圓心分成兩個呢
What if I divide the center into two,

1194
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:07,770
讓圓周上的點到
but what I keep constant

1195
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,900
這兩個圓心的距離之和保持不變
is the sum of their two distances to the perimeter.

1196
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,520
好吧  我給你演示一下  看著  當我沿著
Alright, look. I'll show you. Watch.  As I move this rod along

1197
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,920
這個圓周移動棒子  繩子的一部分增加時
the cord, as one segment increases

1198
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:21,310
另一部分就會減少  反之亦然
the other segment decreases, and vice versa.

1199
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,540
因此兩者之和
Therefore the sum of the two is always going to be constant.

1200
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,730
保持不變  你明白了嗎?
Do you see that?

1201
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:31,520
如果我們把這個理論運用到
Now, what if we apply this

1202
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:33,920
地球的移動之上呢?
to the movement of the Earth?

1203
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:49,230
我們會
What,

1204
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,710
得到
figure,

1205
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:56,210
什么圖形呢?
will be obtained?

1206
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,210
一個橢圓軌道
An ellipse!

1207
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:05,590
太陽在它的一個焦點之上
With the sun at one of its foci.

1208
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,710
因為
Because,

1209
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,110
這種橢圓軌道
what is a circle except

1210
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:13,290
除了它的焦點太近以至于
a very special ellipse

1211
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,150
看上去似乎合二為一了  還能是什么別的
whose foci have joined so close together that they appear to be one.

1212
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:24,340
或許只是異想天開而已  亞斯巴修
Perhaps, I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

1213
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:27,980
為什么非這樣不可  也許我只是
I mean, why should this be so? Maybe I'm just,

1214
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,960
也許我
Maybe I'm,

1215
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:41,730
你怎么看?
What do you think?

1216
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:49,650
很可能就是這樣的  主人
It could well be solved, mistress.

1217
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,460
太好了  我們明天再繼續
Well done, we'll continue with this tomorrow.

1218
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,650
去休息吧
Get some sleep.

1219
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:06,210
-晚安  主人  -晚安
-Good night, mistress. -Good night.

1220
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,650
謝謝你
Thank you.

1221
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:22,980
達烏斯
Davus!

1222
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:27,670
達烏斯
Davus!

1223
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,400
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1224
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,980
老師
Lady.

1225
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:01,210
讓我看看
Let me see.

1226
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,920
你去那邊坐下吧
Why don't you sit down?

1227
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:09,130
大家都去哪了
Where is everybody?

1228
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:10,790
請坐
Please sit down.

1229
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,880
我有
I have,

1230
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:14,750
我也有消息要告訴你
I have news for you too.

1231
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:24,540
所有的已經皈依
All dignitaries

1232
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,040
基督教的官員們
who have yet to embrace the Christian faith

1233
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:29,230
將要在公眾面前
are to be baptized

1234
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,730
接受洗禮
in public.

1235
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,770
目的非常明確
The aim very clear:

1236
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:42,560
為了增加擁護者  使市里所有的基督徒
It's to add to our cause, all the Christians in the city

1237
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,250
以及正派人士們
decent folk, better

1238
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,750
都為我盡忠
to fight for me.

1239
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:54,130
你指的是宣揚信仰嗎?
You speak of battling faith.

1240
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,860
非常好
Very well.

1241
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,220
既然所有的事都已成定局
It seems everything seems to have been decided already.

1242
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:12,150
我不懂你還讓我來這里做什么?
I don't understand why you required my presence here.

1243
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,860
我又不是政府的一員
I am not a member of government.

1244
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:33,920
你不是  但你更重要  你是我最信任的人
No, you are more than that. You are the person I trust most

1245
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:35,270
眾人皆知
and everyone knows it.

1246
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:37,360
你在說什么?
What can I say?

1247
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,940
老師
Lady.

1248
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:51,840
很多年前
Many years ago,

1249
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:56,310
很多年前你教導我們
years ago, you taught us something.

1250
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,610
如果
If,

1251
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:03,090
等同于同量的量
If two are equal to a third they are,

1252
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:05,480
彼此相等  還記得嗎?
all are equal to each other. Do you remember?

1253
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:06,520
是的
Yes

1254
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:09,440
我們三個  我們都是好人
The three of us, we are all good people.

1255
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,980
你和我們一樣  都是虔誠的基督徒
And you, you are as Christian as we are!

1256
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:20,690
辛奈西斯  你對你的信仰深信不疑
Synesius, you don't question what you believe.

1257
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,440
但我不能
You cannot.

1258
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:29,340
我必須懷疑
I must.

1259
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,290
那真是太遺憾了
That's a pity,

1260
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,650
老師
Lady.

1261
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,520
莫大的遺憾
A great pity.

1262
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,380
我們所尊敬的老師
Our revered teacher

1263
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:53,290
竟然背棄了自己曾教給過我們的東西
taken away from what she herself taught us.

1264
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:57,040
你以為我不知道你  所執迷那些愚蠢的事
Or do you think I'm not aware of the insane things you invoke.

1265
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:00,380
-辛奈西斯  -地球圍繞太陽旋轉
-Synesius! With Earth moving around the Sun.

1266
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,500
接下來又會是什么?  老師
What next, Lady, what next?

1267
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,630
求你讓我離開吧
You must let me go.

1268
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,920
讓我進去  讓我進去
Let me in! Let me in!

1269
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,630
-我有話對她說  -一個圣戰士
-I'll go straight to her. -Why does she wanna see a parabolani?

1270
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,750
-老師  -在我們逮捕你之前快滾
-Lady! Go away before we arrest you.

1271
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:17,460
-走開  -亞斯巴修
-Leave! -Aspasius!

1272
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:20,590
是我  達烏斯  達烏斯  放開我
It's me, Davus. Get off me.

1273
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:22,670
-告訴他們你認識我  -你認識他嗎?
-Tell them who I am -I know this man, please.

1274
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,340
是的  你想干嘛?
What do you want?

1275
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,040
我有話對她說  她在哪?
I need to speak to the mistress. Where is she?

1276
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,750
-女主人不在家  -十萬火急  她在哪?
-Mistress is not here. -It's urgent! Where is she?

1277
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:31,830
她在提督宮殿里
She's at the prefect's palace.

1278
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,810
-哪里?  -她在提督宮殿里
-Where? -The prefect palace!

1279
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,630
-提督宮殿  -謝謝  快點滾
-Prefect's palace. -Thank you. Get out of here.

1280
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:39,230
那到底是誰?
Who was that?

1281
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,460
他以前是這兒的奴隸
He was a slave once.

1282
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:51,630
等等  求你  等一下  求你了
Wait, please! Wait! I beg you.

1283
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:05,690
如果你不同意的話  我就不能再保護你了
If you don't agree, I won't be able to protect you any longer.

1284
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:10,270
我也不能和你交往
I won't be able to have dealings with you

1285
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,500
甚至不能和你打招呼
neither greet you.

1286
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,560
希帕蒂亞
Hypatia.

1287
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,480
你還不明白嗎?
Don't you see?

1288
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:23,610
沒有你我活不下去的
I can't go on without you.

1289
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,110
我不行
I cannot.

1290
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:34,230
沒有你我無法打敗西里爾
Without you, I can't defeat Cyril.

1291
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,360
俄瑞斯特斯
Orestes.

1292
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:45,790
西里爾已經贏了
Cyril has already won.

1293
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:04,750
謝謝
Thank you.

1294
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:06,730
但我不需要你們的保護
I do not need you.

1295
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,310
達烏斯!
Davus!

1296
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:41,310
兄弟  你要去哪里?
Brother! Where are you going?

1297
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,980
我們找到她了
We found her!

1298
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,710
婊子  快走
Come on, walk!

1299
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,480
快走  罪人
Move it, sinner!

1300
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,900
婊子
Whore!

1301
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:47,460
妖女
Witch!

1302
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:51,000
多神教的人渣
Pagan sinner!

1303
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:07,880
走啊  快走
Move! Come on!

1304
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,310
妖女
Witch!

1305
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,000
把她扒光
Strip her naked!

1306
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:46,310
站起來
Get up.

1307
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:52,880
就這樣  這樣上帝  可以看清你的污穢  妖女
That's it. So that God can behold in all your filth, whore.

1308
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,440
看清你如何蠱惑提督  娼婦
The way you knock the prefect so hard.

1309
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:56,520
異教徒
Heathen!

1310
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,290
娼婦
Whore.

1311
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,440
看啊
Look,

1312
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,790
她一點反應都沒有
she's not reacting.

1313
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,340
把刀子插進她的皮膚她就叫得出來了
She will scream all right when we skin her alive.

1314
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:06,940
-有多少人有刀子  -沒有
-How many of you have knives? -None.

1315
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:13,290
不要讓不潔的血液玷污你們的雙手
Don't stain your hands with impure blood.

1316
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,150
用石塊砸死她吧
Let's stone her!

1317
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,480
-我們用石塊砸死這個妖女  -去找些石塊
-Let's stone this witch! -Get some stones.

1318
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:22,980
-快點  我們扔俄瑞斯特斯的石頭
-Quickly! The ones we throw at Orestes.

1319
01:55:23,190 --> 01:55:24,440
還在這里
they are still here.

1320
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:26,840
我看著她
I'll stay with her.

1321
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,230
她暈過去了
She fainted.

1322
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:07,880
希帕蒂亞的尸體殘缺不全  留下的部分
The body of Hypatia was mutilated and the remains,

1323
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,960
被拖去游街  焚燒
were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.

1324
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,040
俄瑞斯特斯被永久性的放逐  而西里爾,
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cyril,

1325
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:18,290
則掌握了亞歷山大的大權
took control of the power in Alexandria.

1326
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:24,540
不久之后  西里爾被封為圣徒  教會圣士
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.

1327
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:30,790
盡管希帕蒂婭的成果  沒有被保存下來
Although not any of Hypatia works remains,

1328
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:32,880
但她仍然被后人當作杰出的天文學家
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer,

1329
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,900
并且以對圓錐曲線的研究而著稱
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.

1330
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:43,290
1200年后
One thousand two hundred years later,

1331
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:45,380
17世紀  天文學家約翰內斯·開普勒
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler,

1332
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,460
解釋了圓錐曲線之中的
described that one of those curves,,

1333
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:50,590
橢圓  正是它主宰著星球的運動軌跡
the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
