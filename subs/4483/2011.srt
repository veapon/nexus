1
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,385
这样的表演才是人们想在
Now, this is exactly the type of performance you would expect to see

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,722
全国大学生无伴奏合唱锦标赛(ICCA)上所期望看到的
at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,931
我说得对不对 盖尔?
Am I right, Gail?

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,016
约翰 你说得太对了 对得不能再对了
John, you're so right, everything else seems wrong.

5
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,228
这帮来自巴顿大学的刺儿头小子们总能震撼评委
Boy, these Barden University Treblemakers always thrill the judges.

6
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,856
这屋子里的女士们真是兴奋得不得了
And the ladies in the room cannot get enough.

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,065
没错 约翰
So true, John.

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,819
也只有像男人一样唱歌的男孩才能让女人感觉如少女一般了
Nothing makes a woman feel more like a girl than a man who sings like a boy.

9
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:40,975
克洛伊 你看看你 简直一团糟 你一点都不尽心 实在是太靠不住了
Chloe, look at you. You're a mess. You're unfocused. You're unreliable.

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,104
嘴里的气味难闻死了 跟往常一样
And your breath smells like egg. Like, all the time.

11
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,442
真不敢相信我毕业后要把贝拉合唱团交给你们两个脓包
I can't believe the Bellas are being passed on to you two slut bags after we graduate.

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,444
你的独唱别给我弄砸了
Just don't eff up your solo.

13
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,653
我不会让你失望的
I won't disappoint you.

14
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,697
我爸爸常说 "如果你赢不了的话
My dad always says, "If you're not here to win,

15
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,157
就从科威特滚出去吧"
get the hell out of Kuwait."

16
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,701
你爸爸有没有告诉过让你闭嘴?
Has your dad ever told you to shut up?

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,915
我没事
I'm fine.

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,884
哦! 天啊 好疼啊
Ouch! Boy, that hurt.

19
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,511
多性感的男子劈叉啊
Sexy man-splits.

20
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,596
他的疼痛是我们的收获 盖尔
His pain is our gain, Gail.

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,905
没错 祝你们好运 伙计们!
All right, good luck, guys!

22
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,326
祝上场好运!
Good luck out there!

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,789
说真的 你们这群妞儿真得非常棒... 才怪
Seriously, you girls are awesome... ly horrible.

24
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,167
我恨你们 你们去死吧 女性万岁! 重友轻色的妞儿们!
I hate you. Kill yourselves. Girl power! Sisters before misters!

25
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,131
好了 姑娘们 机不可失 时不再来 加油!
All right, ladies, it's now or never. Hands in!

26
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,217
一 二...
One, two...

27
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,931
现在上场的是 巴顿大学的的贝拉合唱团!
Up now, the Barden Bellas!

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,267
贝拉合唱团今晚开创了历史
Well, the Bellas tonight are making history

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,937
她们是历史上第一支闯入ICCA决赛的女子合唱团
as the first ever all-female group to advance to the ICCA finals.

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,231
没错 约翰 你说为什么女子合唱团
That's right, John. Now, why do you think it's taken so long

31
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,526
要花那么长时间才能站在这个舞台上呢?
for an all-lady group to break through that a cappella glass ceiling?

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,779
盖尔 通常来说 女性很难发出低音
Well, Gail, the women, typically, cannot hit the low notes,

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,407
低音能为编排增色不少 从而能震撼评委
which really round out an arrangement, thrill the judges,

34
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,367
而在比赛中 这点恰恰是女性所欠缺的
and that can really hurt them in competition.

35
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,245
女的根本就不擅长无伴奏合唱 就跟她们不擅长当医生一样
Women are about as good at a cappella as they are at being doctors.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,752
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

37
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,784
是我感觉错了呢 还是我们刚刚真的左转到了瞌睡村?
Is it me or did we just take a left turn into Snoozeville?

38
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,787
是啊 而且我们还停在了未批准使用的地方
Yeah, and we parked in a lot where they do not validate.

39
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,715
- 不!  - 天啊...
- No!  - Holy...

40
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,717
这也太夸张了吧!
This is a surprise!

41
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,261
这事儿从没发生过! 现在 也只有这样你们
This has never happened! Now, this is how you bring some excitement

42
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,598
才能给无伴奏合唱大赛增加亮点了
to the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

43
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,100
她吃了一星期的饭这下可全没了
She had a week's worth of lunch and lost it.

44
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,936
怎么没了 不都在地上呢
Well, she didn't lose it. We know exactly where it is.

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,479
- 前三排全是啊  - 太 太不可思议了...
- It's all over the third row.  - No, no...

46
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:41,479

我自己来 谢谢
I got it. Thanks.

50
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,857
嗨! 欢迎来到巴顿大学 哪个宿舍楼?
Hi there! Welcome to Barden University. What dorm?

51
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,734
好像是贝克楼
Baker Hall, I think.

52
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,361
好的 那你顺着这条路一直走下去
Okay. So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna go down this way,

53
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,447
然后右拐 穿过双开门...
you're gonna take a right and you go through those double doors...

54
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,751
你的校园地图
Your campus map.

55
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,670
你的备用防狼口哨
And your official BU rape whistle.

56
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,380
没事的话千万别瞎吹
Don't blow it unless it's actually happening.

57
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,292
嘿
Hey.

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,254
你一定是金凯米 我是贝卡
You must be Kimmy Jin. I'm Beca.

59
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,841
不会说英语?
No English?

60
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,344
还是会说英语?
Yes English?

61
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,348
跟我说下你的英语是坏是好就行了
Just tell me where you're at with English.

62
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,523
他来了 我是本基 你一定是杰西吧
There he is. I'm Benji. You must be Jesse.

63
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,484
你在开玩笑吧 喔!
And you must be kidding. Wow!

64
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,363
把宿舍弄成这样可能有点过了
Looking at it now, I can see that it's a bit much.

65
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,739
我可以摘下来的
I can take it down.

66
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,450
不 别摘 我的意思是 我只是需要适应一小下
No, no way. I mean, it took a second for my eyes to adjust,

67
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,576
不过我可以接受
but I can roll with this.

68
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,620
其实 我只是想让你知道 我绝对不是个呆子
Look, just so you know, I'm not a total nerd.

69
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,374
我还很擅长近距离魔术
I also happen to be super into close-up magic.

70
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,586
老兄 真了不起!
Dude, that's awesome!

71
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,630
这小家伙藏在那里多久了?
How long was that little guy in there?

72
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,756
几天吧
Several days.

73
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,355
嘿 我是校警 把你们的冷酒器都藏好了
Hey, this is campus police. Hide your wine coolers.

74
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,569
不过是... 你老爹开个玩笑而已
Just... it's your old man making a funny.

75
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,654
注意 克里斯・洛克要登场了
Chris Rock, everybody.

76
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,906
嘿 你一定是贝卡的室友
Hey, you must be Beca's roommate.

77
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,617
我是米切尔博士 贝卡的爸爸
I'm Dr. Mitchell, Beca's dad.

78
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,078
我在这儿教比较文学
I teach Comparative Literature here.

79
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,002
你什么时候到这儿的? 你怎么过来的?
So, when did you get here? How did you get here?

80
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,297
打车来的 不想麻烦你和希拉
Took a cab. Didn't wanna inconvenience you and Sheila.

81
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,423
那个变态后妈怎么样了?
How is the stepmonster?

82
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,261
她很好 很谢谢你问候她 她去拉斯维加斯参加一个会议去了...
She is fine, thank you for asking. She's actually in Vegas at a conference...

83
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,598
不 老爸 我不是关心她 我只是想说 "变态后妈"
No, Dad, I don't actually care. I just wanted to say "stepmonster."

84
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,352
你们没到校园里玩一玩吗?
So, have you guys been out on the quad yet?

85
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,063
春天的时候 所有的学生都在草地上学习呢
In the springtime, all the students study on the grass.

86
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,481
我不想在草地上学习 老爸
I don't wanna study on the grass, Dad.

87
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,984
我要搬去洛杉矶 在唱片公司找份工作
I need to move to LA and get a job at a record label

88
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,402
然后自己养活自己
and start paying my dues.

89
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,196
又来了 你要知道 贝卡
Here we go again. You know, Beca,

90
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,115
你不能把DJ当工作 它不过是个爱好
DJing is not a profession, it's a hobby.

91
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,577
除非你是里克・蒂斯或者是其他什么很了不起的人
Unless you're Rick Dees or someone awesome.

92
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,705
不是这样... 我...
That's not... I...

93
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,875
我想做音乐 我想创作音乐 爸爸
I wanna produce music. I wanna make music, Dad.

94
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,669
但是你要先上完大学再说
But you're going to get a college education first.

95
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,631
再加一句 免费的 就这么定了
For free, I might add. End of story.

96
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,009
我要去游园会了
I'm going to the Activities Fair.

97
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:16,805
我也去 我要和我超级好的朋友金凯米一起去游园会了
Me, too. I'm going to the Activities Fair with my super-good friend, Kimmy Jin.

98
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,820
留下名字 留下电话 加入正义兄弟会
Taking names, taking numbers. Join our righteous frat.

99
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,990
不为朋友两肋插刀不算好兄弟
If you ain't pledging Sigma Beta, you ain't worth no crap.

100
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,827
- 那句话是双重否定  - 是多重否定
- That's a double negative.  - That's a lot of negatives.

101
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,331
跟我来 学校里只有一个社团是值得参加的
Follow me. There's only one group on this campus worth joining.

102
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,210
只要还在这个学校 这就是男生的终极幻想
As far as Barden goes, that's what being a man's all about.
100 

103
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,432
刺儿头小子合唱团
The Treblemakers.

104
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,560
他们是无伴奏合唱的摇滚明星 是巴顿的救星
The rock stars of a cappella, the messiahs of Barden.

105
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:08,023
跟你说 他们不收运动员 兄弟会的人 或者很酷的人
Well, you know, not including athletes, frat guys, or actual cool people.

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,943
一群有组织的呆子唱歌 不错嘛
Organized nerd singing. This is great.

107
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,779
是的 就是这个意思 你唱歌怎么样?
Yeah, it makes so much sense. How's your voice?

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,494
哦 不错啊
Oh, nice.

109
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,874
我要不惜一切代价打垮这群怪人
I will stop at nothing to take those ding-a-lings down.

110
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,670
嘿 巴布 你今年想要试音吗? 我们要招人了
Hey, Barb. You gonna audition this year? We have openings.

111
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,463
现在你们的前途都被你吐没了
Now that you've puked your way to the bottom,

112
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,923
你才想起我?
you might actually consider me?

113
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,634
我三次试音确都没有被录取
I auditioned for you three times and never got in

114
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,220
就因为你说我的胸部像熏肠
because you said my boobs look like baloney.

115
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,309
大家都知道了 贝拉合唱团已经成了无伴奏合唱团的笑柄
The word's out. Bellas is the laughing stock of a cappella.

116
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,604
祝你们今年试音好运 傻逼们
Good luck auditioning this year. Douche-b's.

117
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,275
哦 天呐 这实在太滑稽了
Oh, my God. This is a travesty.

118
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,361
天啊 我们要是连香肠胸巴布都拉不到 那我们就拉不到任何人了
God, if we can't even recruit Baloney Barb, then we can't get anybody.

119
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,905
别小题大做好吗? 嗨 你想不想...
Just take the dramatics down a notch, okay? Hi, do you wanna...

120
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,657
就是你让我们陷入窘境的
Well, you're the one who got us into this hot mess.

121
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,700
我们会好起来的
We'll be fine.

122
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,493
我保证我们能找到
I am confident that we will find

123
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,371
八个身材巨好
eight super-hot girls with bikini-ready bodies

124
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,416
和音完美 音准绝佳的女孩 好吧?
who can harmonize and have perfect pitch. Okay?

125
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,419
嗨 你想不想成为我们的一员...
Hi, would you like to be a member of...

126
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,341
继续发传单 我们得坚持我们的传统
Just keep flyering. We have tradition to uphold.

127
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,509

well, then, you can quit college.

257
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,259
而且我会帮你搬去洛杉矶
And I will help you move to LA.

258
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,511
- 你说真的吗?  - 是的 认真的
- Seriously?  - Yes, seriously.

259
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,179
但是我必须要看到你的行动 贝卡
But I really need to see it, Beca.

260
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,183
这是大学 好好享受吧
This is college. Join in.

261
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,056
- 你会唱歌!  - 天啊!
- You can sing!  - Dude!

262
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,517
- 你能唱多高?  - 我什么?
- How high does your belt go?  - My what?

263
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,020
- 哦 我的天!  - 你必须去贝拉合唱团试音
- Oh, my God!  - You have to audition for the Bellas.

264
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,814
在你把帘子拉上之前我都听不进你讲的任何话
I can't concentrate on anything you're saying until you cover your junk.

265
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,399
你就考虑一下吧
Just consider it.

266
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,402
有一次我们为王子唱和声
One time, we sang backup for Prince.

267
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,155
他的屁股是那么的小 就好像 我一只手就能握住
His butt is so tiny that I can hold it with, like, one hand.

268
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,657
喔! 哦!
Oops! Oh!

269
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,452
你不是来真的吧 我裸着呢
Seriously. I am nude.

270
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,828
你刚刚在唱《钛合金》 对不对?
You were singing Titanium, right?

271
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,791
- 你知道大卫・库塔?  - 我是不是喜欢摇滚乐? 当然
- You know David Guetta?  - Have I been living under a rock? Yeah.

272
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,960
这歌是我的最爱
That song is my jam.

273
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,587
我女性血液（月经血）
My lady-jam.

274
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,047
真不错
That's nice.

275
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,674
是的 那歌真的给了我力量
It is. That song really builds.

276
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,261
- 好吧  - 你可以唱给我听吗?
- Gross.  - Can you sing it for me?

277
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,055
不行 出去!
Dude, no. Get out!

278
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,142
不是为了那个原因 你不唱的话我就不出去 你自己看...
Not for that reason. I'm not leaving here till you sing. So...

279
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:01,569
哦 是的 我对我的身材很自信
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty confident about all this.

280
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,530
你身材确实不错
You should be.

281
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,365
哦!
Oh!

282
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,579
我还得洗澡
Still need to shower.

283
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,499
你声音很不错
You have a lovely voice.

284
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,418
谢谢
Thanks.

285
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,589
哦
Oh.

286
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,259
试音时见哦!
Yeah. See you at auditions!

287
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,012
关于试音 你们每个人要唱十六个小节的
For your audition, each of you will be singing sixteen bars

288
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,389
凯利・克拉克森的"既然你已离开"
of Kelly Clarkson's Since You've Been Gone.

289
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,851
如果有乐团喜欢你 他们会直接联系你的
If a group likes you, they will contact you directly.

290
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,104
我的乐盲伙伴贾斯丁会收集你们的信息
My tone-deaf sidekick Justin here will be collecting your information.

291
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,523
如果我能用正常人的方式 唱哪怕就那么一小点儿
If I could sing a lick, in any human way possible,

292
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,817
我也会唱 但是我真的不行
I would, but I can't.

293
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,903
- 而且我因此每天都痛恨着自己!  - 我知道
- And I hate myself every day because of it!  - I know.

294
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,907
不过如果你觉得这只是什么高中的学校俱乐部
But if you think this is just some high school club,

295
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,911
觉得你可以自顾自的唱唱跳跳来解决社会问题
where you can sing and dance your way through any big social issue,

296
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,080
或是懵懂的性冲动
or confused sexuality,

297
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,291
那你来错地方了
you have come to the wrong place.

298
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,335
这地方不接受以上任何一种人
There is none of that here.

299
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,879
那个是高中
That's high school.

300
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,798
这玩意儿才是真正的生活!
This shit is real life!

301
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:08,386
现在 别光说不做了 开唱吧 都给我秀出来
Now, don't just bring it, sing it. And let's do this.

302
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,979
嘿 贝拉合唱团 还记不记的你在大联盟比赛时吐得情景?
Hey, Bellas, remember when you tried to play in the big leagues and you choked?

303
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,231
大家都要吸取那个教训
That should really be a lesson to everyone.

304
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,068
如果你每天都唱那无聊的 女里女气的垃圾歌
If you sing the same boring, girly shit every year,

305
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,320
你还会吐的 吐得到处都是
you will blow chunks. All over the place.

306
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,072
满地都是呕吐物
Vomit everywhere.

307
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,656
我的伙伴
My fellow a-ca-people.

308
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,745
我们不会让任何自大的 傲慢的混球
We will not let egotistical, big-headed, garbage dirtballs,

309
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,998
来挡我们的道 不管你是谁
whoever you may be, get in our way.

310
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,333
我保证
I promise you,

311
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,462
我们会重回锦标赛并且完成我们去年表演的歌曲
we will return to the ICCAs and finish what we started last year.

312
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,841
这是第一个选手 祝你好运
And here's the first one up. Good luck.

313
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,302
准备好就可以开始了 老兄

Thank you.

328
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,908
现场表演让我有点紧张
Performing live gives me such a rush.

329
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,457
搞定
Crushed it.

330
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,963

387
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,322
- 是啊 我都被你看光光了...  - 是啊
- Yeah. Well, you saw me naked, so...  - Yeah.

388
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:29,911
哼哼 妹子们 成群结队 准备看好戏了
Yeah. Yeah, ladies. Gather around. Ready for a show.

389
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,663
- 来吧 小妞们 排排站  - 来吧
- Come on, baby bubble, wait in line. Yep. - Yeah.

390
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,665
- 你们就爱看这个  - 我知道你们爱看
- You want some of this.  - I know you do.

391
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,543
- 很好  - 邦博尔和唐纳德
- Nice.  - Bumper and Donald.

392
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,714
粉墨登场
Getting it.

393
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,967
我们一共十来个人
You know, so there's like 10 of us.

394
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,012
也就是说 我们中间很可能有一个拉拉
That means that one of us is probably a lesbian.

395
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,598
是吗? 你觉得是哪个?
You think? Which one do you think it is?

396
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,892
我打赌是那个黑妞
My money's on Black Beauty.

397
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,685
要是我今晚喝多了
So, when I drink too much tonight,

398
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,064
我喝吐时你能帮我挽起头发吗?
can I count on you to hold my hair back if I puke?

399
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,233
啊
Ah.

400
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,734
别告诉她是我说的
Don't tell her I said that.

401
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,446
好了 我要去拿点儿喝的 来点儿麦啤补充活力
All right. I'm gonna go get a drink. This ginger needs her jiggle juice.

402
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,574
- 回见  - 悠着点儿
- See you later.  - Make good choices.

403
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,370
我为这个发型想出了一个新名字
I thought of a new name for this hairstyle.

404
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,830
叫正统犹太教马尾
It's called the Orthodox Jew ponytail.

405
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,915
是吗?
Yeah?

406
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,084
- 因为前面比较正常...  - 对哦
- 'Cause it's very reserved at the front...  - I see that.

407
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,795
- 但后面很夸张  - 我注意到两鬓留长的头发了
- But party in the back.  - I see these happening here.

408
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,724
关键问题是
Here's the real question.

409
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,059
跟谁上床更容易?
Who would be easier to sleep with?

410
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,852
美国队长还是大白鲨?
Captain America or a great white shark?

411
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,396
- 大白鲨 我可不会...  - 嘿
- Great white shark. I wouldn't...  - Hey.

412
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,730
你们两个浑球在聊什么呢?
What are you turd burgers talking about?

413
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,108
穿衣打扮吗?
Dressing for comfort?

414
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,862
你是我见过的最恶心的人了
You are probably the grossest human being I've ever seen.
 411

415
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,490
你也不过就是个潘
Well, you're no panty-dropper yourself.

416
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:54,662
我有种跟你深情一吻的冲动
So I have a feeling that we should kiss.

417
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,207
这种冲动是好事还是坏事呢?
And is that feeling a good feeling or an incorrect feeling?

418
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,835
有时候我会有尝试冰毒的冲动
Well, I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth,

419
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,963
- 但随后一想 "还是算了吧"  - 是啊
- but then I think, "Hmm. Better not."  - Yeah.

420
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,975
# 我无法用言语表达 但我可以... #
# I don't know the words, but I can... #

421
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,643
谢谢
Thank you.

422
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,605
太爽了
This is awesome.

423
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,523
确实不同凡响
It's definitely something.

424
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,484
我们就是校园之王!
We are the kings of campus!

425
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,179
哇 贝拉老成员真漂亮!
Man, the old Bellas was hot!

426
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,139
是啊 她们身材真棒
Yeah, they kept it tight.

427
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,726
好了 女高音站前面 女低音站后面
Okay. Sopranos in the front and altos in the back.

428
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,647
大家都看到了 科瑞没来
As you can see, Kori is not here.

429
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,857
因为她昨晚跟刺儿头小子搞上了
Last night she was Treble-boned.

430
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,901
她被逐出了贝拉团队
She has been disinvited from the Bellas.

431
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,069
入会誓言是认真的啊?
That oath was serious?

432
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,987
南方小鸡(美国德州乡村音乐组合)可不是闹着玩的
Dixie Chicks serious.

433
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,282
你可以跟任何人胡搞 就是刺儿头小子不行
You can fool around with whoever you want to, just not a Treble.

434
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,577
这就难办了 他们可都是少女杀手啊
That's not gonna be easy. He's a hunter.

435
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,496
你这么快被他们迷住了?
You call it a dude?

436
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,165
斯蒂西 刺儿头小子很鄙视我们
Stacie, the Trebles don't respect us,

437
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,875
如果让他们"插"进来的话
and if we let them penetrate us,

438
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,710
他们就会从我们这里吸取能量
we are giving them our power.

439
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,129
用"插"这个词不太好吧
Not a good enough reason to use the word "penetrate."

440
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:31,801
那么 有人要坦白吗?
So, does anyone here have anything to confess?

441
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,559
那是个意外 我...
It was an accident. I...

442
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,936
交出你的丝巾 然后走人
Turn in your scarf and go.

443
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,702
婊子
Slut.

444
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,121
把椅子带走
Take your chair.

445
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,468
有这个必要吗?
Was that necessary?

446
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,304
这是一场战争 贝卡
This is war, Beca,

447
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,891
我的职责是保证我的士兵们做好准备背水一战
and it is my job to make sure that my soldiers are prepped at go time

448
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,061
我会挑出三首好歌并精心编排做到尽善尽美
with three kick-ass songs sung and choreographed to perfection.

449
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,355
离地区分赛只剩四个月了
And there are only four months until regionals.

450
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,524
如果你们谁对我的管理贝拉的方式有意见
So, if you have a problem with the way that I run the Bellas,

451
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,192
那么就...
then you should just...

452
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,030
别太大压力 奥布里 放轻松
Don't stress, Aubrey. Relax.

453
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,158
我们可不想去年的事再次发生
We don't want a repeat of what happened last year.

454
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,162
去年发生了什么事?
What happened last year?

455
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,747
你说什么?
What are you saying?

456
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,332
去年发生了什么事?
What happened last year?

457
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,212
你们想看去年的现场表演吗?
And do you guys wanna see a dead body?

458
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,766
点开"某男吐在了猫身上"
Click on "Guy Pukes on Cat."

459
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,642
够了!这事过去了
Enough! It happened. It's over.

460
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,272
我们每天都要排练至少两个小时 一周七天皆是如此
We will practice every day for at least two hours, seven days a week.

461
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,774
而且你们要增加有氧锻炼
And I trust you will add your own cardio.

462
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,444
- 有氧锻炼?  - 不要 有氧运动别算上我
- Why cardio?  - Yeah, no, don't put me down for cardio.

463
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,070
好了 我们继续
Okay, moving on.

464
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,240
这是一张清单 列出了我们翻唱过的所有歌曲
This is a list of all of the songs that we have ever performed.

465
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,952
请注意 我们只翻唱由女歌手唱红的曲目
And you will notice that we only do songs made famous by women.

466
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,370
一首本世纪的歌都没有
There's nothing from this century on here.

467
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,581
因为我们绝不偏离传统路线
Because we don't stray from tradition.

468
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,838
好了 这是我们夺冠计划
Now, this is how we will become champions.

469
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,066
贝拉的成功要素

470
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:34,966
麦克风使用技能

471
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:35,966
曲目精选集

472
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,766
交往对象禁止刺儿头小子

473
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,566
最终胜利!

474
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,566
加油 姐妹们! 跑起来!
Come on, girls! Let's go!

475
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,485
快快快! 抬起腿来!
Go, go, go! Pick up your knees!

476
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,737
快点儿 快点儿! 一二一二一二!
Faster, faster! One, two, one, two, one, two!

477
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,282
抬高腿 抬高腿! 跑起来! 加油
Knees up, knees up! Go, go! Go! Let's get it.

478
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,286
克洛伊 好样的 艾米!
Yes, Chloe. Nice. Amy!

479
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,414
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

480
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,291
我在练横向跑步
I'm doing horizontal running.

481
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,668
横向跑步?
Horizontal running?

482
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,096
停
No.

483
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,474
不行
No, no.

484
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,395
不要这样
No.

485
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,006
我知道... 我会做
I know... I can do it.

486
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,727
五 六 七 八
Five, six, seven, eight.

487
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,441
好了 到此结束
Okay, I'm calling it.

488
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,986
谢天谢地 三个小时前我就说过想上厕所了
Thank God. I asked to go to the bathroom three hours ago.

489
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,323
没听到 我一个字都没听到
Nothing. I hear nothing.

490
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,577
嘿 奥布里 我们刚刚排练的是那段录像里的舞蹈吗?
Hey, Aubrey. Did we just learn the same choreography from that video?

491
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,622
好了 别忘了拿好你们的演出日程表
Okay. Don't forget to pick up your performance schedules.

492
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,584
我们下周有个演出 没错 就是下周
We have a gig next week. That's right. Next week.

493
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,462
听着 是SBT兄弟会的年度秋季联谊会
You guys, it's the Sigma Beta Theta's Annual Fall Mixer.

494
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,006
好了 伸出手 姐妹们
Okay. Hands in, Bellas.

495
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,385
伸出手 阿卡妞儿们!
Hands in, a-ca-bitches!

496
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,096
数到三唱"啊"...
Sing "ah" on three...

497
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,181
啊!
Ah!

498
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:52,603
不不不 是数到三才唱 胖艾米
No, no, no. It's actually on three, Fat Amy.

499
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,687
啊
Ah.

500
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,482
好了 数到三哦
All right. On three.

501
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,108
一 二...
One, two...

502
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,157
好吧 我们下次排练的第一件事就是搞定这个
Okay, we will work on that first thing next time.

503
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,368
- 好了 散会  - 谢谢 再见
- Okay, guys. - Thank you. Goodbye.

504
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,786
她的手跟男人手似的
She has man hands.

505
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,496
贝卡 跟你说个事?
Beca, a word?

506
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,373
怎么了?
What's up?

507
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,377
秋季联谊会演出时你得把耳朵上那些乱七八糟的玩意给摘了
You know you'll have to take those ear monstrosities out for the Fall Mixer.

508
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,920
其实你很讨厌我对吧?
You really don't like me, do you?

509
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,464
- 我不喜欢你的态度  - 你又不了解我
- I don't like your attitude.  - You don't even know me.

510
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
我知道你对杰西有意思
I know you have a toner for Jesse.

511
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,009
什么?
A what?

512
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,636
有意思
A toner.

513
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,639
你被他迷住了 迎新会那晚我看见了 那会让你分心
A musical boner. I saw it at Hood Night. It's distracting.

514
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,559
那没什么大不了 你又不是我的老板 所以...
Yeah, that's not a thing and you're not the boss of me. So...

515
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,311
你可是发过誓的
You took an oath.

516
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,022
今天那个誓言已经害你少了两个成员
That oath cost you two girls already today.

517
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,899
我相信现在是你需要我 而不是我需要你
I'm pretty sure you need me more than I need you.

518
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,571
从你的裤子上的反应来看 我就知道你对他有意思
I can see your toner through those jeans.

519
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,991
那是我的老二
That's my dick.

520
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,953
你没事吧?
Everything okay?

521
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,081
我们最好能好好备战SBT的联谊会演出
We better have our shit together for SBT.

522
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,002
我不担心 我觉得我们肯定会很出色的
I'm not worried. I think we're gonna be a-ca-awesome.

523
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,236
这表演把我的啤酒都给糟蹋了
This makes my beer taste bad.

524
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,702
我看不下去了
I'm gonna stop this.

525
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,623
喂 喂 停住 停下来 
Whoa, whoa. Just stop. Stop.

526
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,670
对不起 豪伊 我知道我们没准备好
I am so sorry, Howie. I know we're not performance ready.

527
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:45,632
我要的是惊艳的贝拉 而不是这样不入流的乌合之众
I wanted the hot Bellas, not this barnyard explosion.

528
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,219
- 我不会为这个出钱的 走吧  - 天呐
- I'm not paying for this. Let's go. Come on.  - God.

529
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,805
我希望你们每个人都记住现在的感受
Well, I hope you all remember the way you feel right now,

530
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,016
下次就不会再想重蹈覆辙了
so you will never wanna feel this way again.

531
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,686
克洛伊 你的嗓子一点儿都不像克里斯蒂娜・阿奎莱拉(美国流行女歌手)
Chloe, your voice didn't sound Aguilerian at all.

532
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,731
克洛伊 说真的 你出什么毛病了?
Chloe, for serious, what is wrong with you?

533
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,191
我有了结节
I have nodes.

534
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,736
- 什么? 天呐  - 我今天早上诊断出来的
- What? Oh, my God.  - I found out this morning.

535
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,613
结节是什么?
What are nodes?

536
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,198
声带囊肿
Vocal nodules.

537
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,326
是由于用嗓过度 声带摩擦过多
The rubbing together of your vocal cords at above-average rates

538
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,078
没有适当的休息而形成的
without proper lubrication.

539
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,330
它们长气管上 是梦想杀手
They sit on your windpipe and they crush your dreams.

540
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,333
那岂不是很疼吗? 那你为什么还要演出?
Isn't that painful? Why would you keep performing?

541
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,418
因为我喜欢唱歌
Because I love to sing.

542
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,088
没错 就像我的妇科医生嘱咐我一个半月之内不能有性生活
Yeah, it's like when my lady doctor told me not to have sex for six weeks,

543
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,380
我可没管那么多
and I did it anyway.

544
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,133
你真的应该听医生的话
You should really listen to your doctor.

545
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,303
好在诊断得早
The key is early diagnosis.

546
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,223
我有结节 但我还活着
I am living with nodes.

547
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,600
我是不会被打倒的
But I am a survivor.

548
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,395
我不得不唱低音了 因为我音域受到了限制
I just have to pull back. Because I am limited.

549
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,565
因为我有结节
Because I have nodes.

550
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,526
克洛伊 这真是太糟糕了
Chloe, this is horrible.

551
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,444
还好不是长疱疹了
Well, at least it's not herpes.

552
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,532
还是你也得了疱疹?
Or do you have that as well?

553
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:20,853
嗯?
Hmm?

554
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,618
- 杰西?  - 嗯
- Jesse?  - Yeah.

555
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,328
我饿了 你能不能...
I'm starving, so could you...

556
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,746
你想让我给你买午饭?
You want me to get you lunch?

557
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,874
你最好别再吃汉堡包了
You should probably lay off the burgers.

558
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,959
你再吃啤酒肚就出来了
You're not gonna be 22 forever, you know.

559
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,588
我觉得我还行吧
Yeah, I think I'm good.

560
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,756
他很棒 你很棒
He's good. You're good.

561
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,843
咱们走着瞧好了
And the chess match continues.

562
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,516
对了 这是我新做的混音
Hey, this is my new mix,

563
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,602
想放点儿什么音乐的话可以...
so if there's anything you wanted to play...

564
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,353
好的 有空我会放的
Yeah, okay, I'll put it on the pile.

565
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,980
好的
Okay.

566
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,070
你好吗 怪咖?
What's up, weirdo?

567
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,285
- 你要干嘛?  - 尽管我很喜欢
- What's this?  - As much as I love

568
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,579
跟你一起整理CD... 真的
spending time with you stacking CDs... and I do.

569
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,831
真的很喜欢 喜欢得要命
I love it, like, more than life.

570
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,917
我觉得我们还可以做些别的好玩的事
I figured we could do some other fun things

571
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,877
不然就无聊得要死了 对吧?
that don't make us wanna kill ourselves, right?

572
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,504
- 对的  - 所以 我带了些电影过来
- Yeah.  - So, brought some movies.

573
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,719
有"大白鲨" "外星人" "早餐俱乐部" "星球大战" "洛奇"
Jaws, E.T., The Breakfast Club, Star Wars and Rocky.

574
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,597
都是最佳配乐 原声带超棒的电影
Best scored and soundtracked movies of all time.

575
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,975
这是我长大后想做的事 我想为电影配乐
That's what I wanna do when I grow up. I wanna score movies.

576
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,936
令人感动流泪 让人震撼惊叹
Bring people to tears, you know. Blow their minds.

577
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,647
我觉得只有音乐才能做到
I feel like only music can do that.

578
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,065
是啊
Yeah.

579
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,691
你的女朋友肯定被你迷得神魂颠倒
You must really sweep your girlfriend off her feet.

580
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,109
我没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

581
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,361
- 什么?  - 没有
- What?  - No.

582
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,738
可你都买了袋装果汁还推荐看"洛奇" 啊
You have juice pouches and Rocky.

583
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,282
好吧 你想先看哪个?
Okay, so what do you wanna watch first?

584
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,492
我们能做点儿别的吗?
Wanna do something else?

585
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,245
我们可以体验父母离婚的感觉
We could relive my parents' divorce.

586
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,663
或者一起去看妇科医生
Or visit a gynecologist.

587
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,873
怎么 你不喜欢看电影吗?
What, do you not like movies or something?

588
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,542
什么电影都不爱看吗? 你怎么...
Like, any movies? You don't...

589
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,129
你到底是怎么了? 你怎么能不喜欢看电影呢?
What the hell is wrong with you? How do you not like movies?

590
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,007
不喜欢看电影就像不喜欢小狗一样
Not liking movies is like not liking puppies.

591
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,551
电影是不错 我只是觉得看电影很无聊 从来没坚持到结局
They're fine. I just get bored and never make it to the end.

592
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,929
结局是最精彩的部分
The endings are the best part.

593
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,890
我都能猜到结局是怎样的 比如 有情人终成眷属
They're predictable. Like, the guy gets the girl,

594
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:25,644
小孩看到了去世的人 达斯・维达是卢克的爸爸("星球大战"中主要角色)
and that kid sees dead people and Darth Vader is Luke's father.

595
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,439
哦 是吗 你只是随便猜测历史上最大制作电影的悬疑结局?
Okay, right, so you just happened to guess the biggest cinematic reveal in history?

596
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,109
"维达"在德语里意思是父亲
"Vader" in German means father.

597
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,695
他名字的字面意思是"达斯・父亲"
His name is literally "Darth Father".

598
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,365
那么 你懂德语
So, you know German.

599
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,326
现在我明白你为什么不喜欢好玩的东西了
Well, now I know why you don't like fun things.

600
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,495
你需要接受一次电影大扫盲
You know, you need a movie education.

601
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,914
你得被电影化 我来给你扫盲
You need a movie-cation. And I'm gonna give it to you.

602
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,834
得了吧 没完没了的贝拉排练就够我受的了
Yeah, in between Bella rehearsals, which are always.

603
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,836
你们准备好参加歌曲接龙了吗?
Are you guys getting ready for the riff-off?

604
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,714

What the hell is a riff-off?

605
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,135
嗨起来!

606
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,516
欢迎来到歌曲接龙!
Welcome to the riff-off!

607
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,729
有谁准备好来一曲了吗?
Who's ready to get vocal?

608
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,566
获胜者将会得到超棒的奖品
The winners get the greatest prize of all.

609
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,650
我要打败你
I'm taking you down.

610
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,267
- 好把戏合唱团(加州摇滚乐团)用过的麦克风...  - 我不在乎
- The microphone used by Hoobastank...  - I don't care.

611
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,155
他们曾在在施内演艺中心演唱会上用过这只麦克风
when they rocked out at the Schnee Performing Arts Center.

612
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,742

712
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,346
在大家睡觉之前

713
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,097
我要你们列下自己做过的所有错事
I need you to make a list of everything you did wrong.

714
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,266
我要煮了那个椰菜娃娃
I'm gonna melt that Cabbage Patch Kid.

715
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,977
嘿 大伙 我们刚才很棒 不是吗?
Hey, guys, what we just did was great, right?

716
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,188
别得意了 贝卡 我们还是输了
Calm your pits, Beca. We still lost.

717
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,149
没错 但那是即兴的 很了不起
Yeah, but it was spontaneous. It was awesome.

718
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,192
我们真的听了...
We were actually listening to...

719
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,652
好了 大家 伸出手
Okay, everybody, hands in.

720
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,236
我数后"啊"
"Ah" on my count.

721
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,322
- 数到三还是数完三?  - 数到三
- On three or after three?  - On three.

722
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,990
- 数完三  - 一 二 三
- After three.  - One, two, three.

723
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,075
我们不是这么做的
That's not how we do it.

724
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,243
哦! 我们怎么连这都搞不清呢?
Oh! Why can't we figure this out?

725
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,833
所以 我就找到和弦行进相同的歌曲
So, I just find songs that have the same chord progressions

726
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,752
然后把它们合在一起做了个小调
and create a track that blends them together.

727
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,296
嗯 这是新的低音线
So, like, this is the new bass line,

728
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,591
而这是配和的强拍
and this is matching up downbeats.

729
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,428
哦 我说话太大声了
Oh, I'm talking really loud.

730
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,764
歌是我唱的
That's me singing.

731
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,193
很不错
This is really good.

732
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,320
现在是我大喊大叫了 是吧?
Now I'm the one yelling, right?

733
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
太棒了 贝卡
That is amazing, Beca.

734
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,826
谢谢
Thanks.

735
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,037
话说 我把这个带来了
So, I brought this over,

736
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:44,165
因为我想看你把电影结尾看完
because I wanna watch you watch the end of this movie.

737
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,043
然后我也死而无憾了
And then I can die a hero.

738
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,594
你还真的从不把自己当外人 是吗?
You have a habit of making yourself at home, did you know that?

739
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,804
没错
Yeah.

740
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,642
嗯...
Hmm...

741
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,980
好吧
Okay.

742
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,817
早餐俱乐部 1985年的电影

743
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,153
史上最棒的电影结局
Greatest ending to any movie ever.

744
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,531
这歌让"头脑简单乐团"在美国走红
This song launched Simple Minds in the US.

745
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,117
本来是让比利 爱多尔演唱的 但他拒绝了
Could have been a Billy Idol song, but he turned it down.

746
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,535
白痴
Idiot.

747
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,039
很好的归纳了电影 非常的优美哀伤
Perfectly sums up the movie. It's equally beautiful and sad.

748
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,418
很迷人啊
That is fascinating.

749
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,669
没错吧?
Right?

750
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,131
告诉我 贾德・尼尔森早餐吃的什么?
Tell me, what does Judd Nelson eat for breakfast?

751
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,843
哦 这个 像所有被误解的反叛者一样 他以虚伪为食
Oh, well, like all misunderstood rebels, he feeds on hypocrisy.

752
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,969
没错
Sure.

753
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,222
还有黑咖啡来提神
And black coffee to help with his morning dumps.

754
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,600
你真傻
You're an idiot.

755
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,769
是真的 我肚子里全是趣闻
It's true. I'm full of fun facts.

756
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,937
是不是有趣 你应该让别人来说
You should let other people tell you they're fun.

757
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,022
和一个运动员

和一个罪犯
And a criminal.

761
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,946
这回答了你的问题了吗?
Does that answer your question?

762
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,617
你诚挚的 早餐俱乐部

764
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,291
抱歉

那么... 抱歉 借过
So... Excuse me. Excuse me.

770
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,426
你们说要多做有氧运动 我应该当回事的
I should have taken that cardio tip more seriously.

771
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,678
你做了多少有氧运动?
How much have you done?

772
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,054
你看也看出来了
You just saw it.

773
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,265
克洛伊 你必须唱好最后那个音
Chloe, you gotta be able to hit that last note.

774
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,058
我不行 那不可能的

775
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,935
而这是因为我的 我的小结

777
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,106
好吧 如果你唱不了 那就得找其他人独唱
Well, if you can't do it, then someone else needs to solo.

778
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,733
我觉得贝卡可以替我独唱
I think Beca should take my solo.

779
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,069
是的 贝卡会很棒
Yeah, Beca would be excellent.

780
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,865
但是 或许还有其他人也一样棒
But also, someone else might be equally as excellent.

781
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,535
- 没错  - 而她们可能很害羞
- It's true.  - And they might be shy

782
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,037
不好意思站出来说她想独唱
and not wanna come forward and say they wanted a solo.

783
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,541
这样啊 既然贝卡不想独唱 那么...
Well, Beca doesn't want a solo, so...

784
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,042
如果可以让我
I would be happy to do it

785
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,794
选首新歌做些调整 我很乐意独唱
if I got to pick a new song and do an arrangement.

786
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,713
我们这儿可不是那么安排的
Well, that's not how we run things here.

787
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,799
奥布里 或许贝卡说得有道理 或许我们该尝试新东西
Aubrey, maybe Beca has a point. Maybe we could try something new.

788
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,967
什么?
A-ca-scuse me?

789
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,763
你可以唱"舞力无限" 不要再让我听到类似的话
You can sing Turn the Beat Around and that's the last I wanna hear of this.

790
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,517
那首歌很乏味 我们靠它不会赢的
That song is tired. We're not gonna win with it.

791
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,185
如果我们从不同流派找选取歌曲
If we pull samples from different genres

792
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,520
把它们重新混音 我们可以做出...
and layer them together, we could make some...

793
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,648
够了 显然你没懂什么意思 那我就说给你听
Okay, let me explain something to you because you still don't seem to get it.

794
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,319
我们的目标是进入决赛 而那三首歌会让我们进入
Our goal is to get back to the finals and these songs will get us there.

795
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,948
所以 抱歉我不想听一个叛逆女孩荒谬的自由节拍理论
So, excuse me if I don't take advice from some alt-girl with her mad lib beats,

796
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,909
因为她从没有参加过比赛
because she's never even been in competition.

797
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,285
听清楚了吗?
Have I made myself clear?

798
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,662
非常清楚 我不独唱了
Crystal. I won't solo.

799
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,372
好吧
Fine.

800
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,708
- 胖艾米  - 是 长官?
- Fat Amy?  - Yes, sir?

801
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,084
你来独唱
You'll solo.

802
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,631
耶! 棒
Yes! Yes.

803
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:24,631
地区赛当天

804
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,403
女士们 先生们 欢迎大家
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

805
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:46,491
2012东南地区地区赛正式开幕
The 2012 southeastern regional competition has officially begun.

806
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,701
是的 我是盖尔・艾伯纳西・马凯德
Yes, I'm Gail Abernathy McCadd,

807
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,245
我右边的同事是无伴奏演唱者约翰・史密斯
and to my right is fellow a cappella alum John Smith

808
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,165
这是在卡罗莱纳大学进行现场直播
and we are live from Carolina University.

809
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,501
这是无伴奏合唱比赛的新赛季
It's a new season for a cappella.

810
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,504
所有单靠嘴巴创作音乐的年轻人
The regionals begin the long road to Lincoln Center

811
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,465
都希望有朝一日在林肯中心功成名就
where all of these youngsters hope to one day win a trophy

812
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,550
漫漫长路从地区赛开始
by making music with their mouths.

813
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,899
用袜子木偶合唱? 天才啊
A cappella out of sock puppets? Genius.

814
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,276
没错 看那个戴白袜子的黑人
Yeah, look at the black one with the white sock.

815
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,486
真是效果显著啊
It's making a statement.

816
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,239
这没有技术含量 学习他们只会让你们更糟
There's no craft there. Watching them will make you worse.

817
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,907
至少他们与众不同
At least they're different.

818
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,162
袜偶贝拉合唱团 再一次证明了
And the Sockappellas, once again proving

819
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,958
他们从高中后就没有起色了
that it doesn't get better for everyone after high school.

820
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,930
我们鼓掌吗?
Do we clap?

821
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,098
不 不鼓掌 从不
No, we don't. Never.

822
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,770
伸出手
Hands in.

823
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,858
记住 数到三"啊"
Remember, "ah" on three.

824
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,526
一 二...
One, two...

825
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,902
慢着 你之前说...
Wait, you said we'd...

826
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,196
抱歉
I'm sorry.

827
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,115
没事 会没事的 没事
It's okay, it's gonna be okay. Okay.

828
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,075
让我们欢迎巴顿贝拉合唱团!
Let's give it up for the Barden Bellas!

829
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,205
哇哦
Wow.

830
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:22,628
这可不是我们熟知的面容娇嫩又性感的贝拉阵容啊
This does not look like the fresh-faced nubile Bellas that we have come to know.

831
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,174
是我的问题还是那些裙子真的过时了?
Is it me or are those skirts just not working anymore?

832
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,925
你越说越离谱啊 约翰
You're walking the line, John.

833
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:31,554
很惊喜看到贝拉组内有了混搭
It's a nice surprise to see the Bellas mixing it up.

834
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,016
非常新鲜 但是不太入眼啊
It's refreshing, yet displeasing to the eye.

835
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,941
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

836
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,245
巴顿贝拉合唱团带来的
The Barden Bellas bringing back

837
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,082
正是去年决赛时演唱的曲目
the same song they sang at last year's finals.

838
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,251
所有目光都会聚焦在大四的奥布里 柏森身上
And all eyes will be on senior Aubrey Posen.

839
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,253
她随时可能喷吐出些饼干
She could toss some cookies at any moment.

840
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,446
她顺利完成了 观众们 没有饼干喷出
And she makes it through, folks. No cookie toss.

841
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,975
约翰 看来巴顿贝拉合唱团近期是不会有什么新的编排了
John, a change of pace could not come soon enough here for the Barden Bellas.

842
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,769
这个赛季没有开个好头啊
This is not a great way to start their season.

843
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,150
没错 这首歌听得观众耳朵都长茧子了
Yeah, this number is like an elephant dart to the public's face.

844
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,118
哦 耶!
Oh, yeah!

845
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,493
好
Yes.

846
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,794
真棒 胖艾米
Yeah, Fat Amy.

847
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,421
嘣!
Boo!

848
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,591
巴顿贝拉合唱团可以因这首歌名留史册了 约翰
The Barden Bellas went deep into the archive for that song, John.

849
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,927
我还记得和我的合唱团一起唱这首歌呢
I remember singing it with my own a cappella group.

850
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,470
是什么合唱团啊 盖尔?
And what group was that, Gail?

851
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,763
吟游诗人合唱团 约翰
The Minstrel Cycles, John.

852
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,098
呃 名字真难听啊
Well, that's an unfortunate name.

853
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,477
谢谢 非常精彩
Thank you. Really incredible.

854
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,438
巴顿贝拉合唱团 谢谢
The Barden Bellas. Thank you.

855
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,443
非常棒
That was great.

856
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,569
太惊艳了
Amazing.

857
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,572
我说 巴顿大学真是不一般啊
You know, there must be something in the water over there at Barden University,

858
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,157
因为下一个组合同样来自巴顿大学
'cause this next group is also from Barden.

859
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:43,037
女士们先生们 巴顿大学的刺儿头小子合唱团
Ladies and gentlemen, the Barden University Treblemakers.

860
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:47,083
又来了 巴顿刺儿头小子合唱团 他们已经在去林肯中心的路上了 哈?
Here we go, the Barden Treblemakers. They're on the trail for Lincoln Center, huh?

861
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,210
绝对的 一直都是 盖尔
Absolutely, they always are, Gail.

862
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,088
我的最爱 也是大家的最爱
My favorite, and everyone's favorite.

863
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,424
我的备注上说他们的负责人邦博尔・艾伦
Now it says here in my notes that their front man Bumper Allen

864
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:59,095
最近发布了他自己的运动凉鞋系列啊
has recently released his own line of sports sandals.

865
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,014
嘘!
Shh!

866
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,460
天哪 合唱团的坏男孩们真是变得更坏了
Boy, the bad boys of a cappella have just gotten badder.

867
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,670
哇呜! 说得没错 约翰
Whoo! That's right, John.

868
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,798
为此我得去市里做做美容了
I'm gonna have to excuse myself to freshen up the downtown.

869
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,049
我能帮忙吗?
Can I help?

870
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,329
女士们先生们 我们期待已久的时刻到了
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for.

871
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,749

哦 不错 不错
Oh, nice. Nice.

879
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,186
嘿 哼!
Hey, ugh!

880
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,356
而今晚地区赛的冠军
And the winner of tonight's regional competition,

881
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,649
女士们先生们 正是卫冕冠军
defending their crown, ladies and gentlemen,

882
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,235
巴顿大学的刺儿头小子合唱团!
the Barden University Treblemakers!

883
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,737
干得不错 刺儿头小子
Way to go, Trebles.

884
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,617
爽! 赞!
Yes! Yes!

885
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,454
就是这样!
That's right!

886
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,078
我想在胸上签名 没错! 我想签...
I'm willing to sign breasts. Yes! I'm willing to sign...

887
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,998
哦 看看是谁啊 老家伙们
Oh, look who it is. Old dudes.

888
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,834
找点事做吧
Get a life.

889
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,710
像音爆一样
Sonic boom.

890
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,421
虽然我们已经毕业几年了
Just 'cause we graduated a few years ago,

891
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,382
但并不意味着我们不能重现舌尖上的魔法 好吗?
doesn't mean we can't still get off performing our oral magic, all right?

892
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,466
舌尖上的魔法?
Oral magic?

893
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,468
哦 哦 伙计 伙计
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy.

894
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:45,928
你是想干我认为你要干的事吗?
Are you looking for what I think you're looking for?

895
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,346
没错 打架? 你是想打架吗?
Yeah, a fight? You looking for a fight?

896
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,140
拜托 帮忙 说你们是想打架的
Please, please. Please say you're looking for a fight.

897
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,101
拜托说你们是想打架
Please, please say you're looking for a fight.

898
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,437
没错! 我来打
Yes! I will fight.

899
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,689
我本来是会跟他打的
I would fight him,

900
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,860
但是跳舞的时候我拉伤了四肢
but I tore a quad within the midst of the dance...

901
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,195
- 嘿 甘地 嘿 你  - 我们到底要不要打?
- Hey, Gandhi. Hey, you.  - Are we doing this or what?

902
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
- 打我  - 什么?
- Hit me.  - What?

903
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,489
让我们开战吧!
Let's get it on!

904
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,617
别啊
Mmm-mmm.

905
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,328
我曾经同时斗过鳄鱼和野狗
I've wrestled crocodiles and dingoes simultaneously.

906
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,621
- 过来!  - 你为什么想让我打你?
- Come here!  - Why do you want me to hit you?

907
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:13,747
我不想动手
I don't wanna do that.

908
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,125
我需要一些感觉 尽力打我吧
I need to feel something. Hit me as hard as you can.

909
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,919
重重地打 拿着这个 拿着 用这个打我
Hit me hard. Take this. Take this. I want you to hit me with it.

910
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,046
我就过去一下... 过去看看他们
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna check on them.

911
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,341
海怪被释放出来了 领教胖艾米的力量吧!
The kraken has been unleashed. Feel the Fat Amy force!

912
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,137
嘿
Hey.

913
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,890
哦 天哪 哦 上帝
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.

914
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,641
哦!
Oh!

915
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:33,934
那感觉真奇妙!
That's fantastic!

916
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,728
- 艾米 别 艾米!  - 感受强大的力量吧
- Amy, don't. Amy!  - Feel the fat power.

917
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,189
胖艾米! 踢我的蛋蛋
Fat Amy! Kick me in the balls!

918
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,691
艾米!
Amy!

919
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,652
快把这个利器给我 我要插进他屁股里!
Give me the sharp weapon, I wanna put it up his butt!

920
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,571
哦! 不要手软啊
Ooh! Cherry on top.

921
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,453
你从哪边跑?
Which way are you running?

922
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,246
- 这边 这边  - 好
- This way. This way.  - All right.

923
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,956
干得漂亮
Beautiful.

924
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,416
艾米!
Amy!

925
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,751
直线逃跑
Vertical running.

926
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,503
我要直线逃跑
I'm vertical running.

927
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,964
嘿 "百万宝贝"里的希拉里斯万克
Hey, Hilary Swank from Million Dollar Baby.

928
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:07,301
嘿 你只说"嘿 百万宝贝"就行了
Hey, you know you just have to say, "Hey, Million Dollar Baby."

929
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,137
没必要指明是哪个女演员
You don't have to reference the specific actress.

930
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,389
该死的 监狱改变了你
Damn. Prison changed you.

931
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,683
谢谢你把我保释出来
Thanks for bailing me out.

932
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:15,768
保释你的不是我
Well, I didn't.

933
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,603
你叫了我爸爸?
You called my dad?

934
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,772
我知道你不想 但是他们把你铐上了哎 贝卡
I know, I know, but they were putting you in handcuffs, Bec.

935
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,940
看起来很严重
It looked pretty serious.

936
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,525
这也不表示你可以告诉我爸爸
That doesn't mean you call my dad.

937
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,735
那我还能叫谁呢? 好了 你为什么要冲我喊啊?
Who else was I gonna call? Okay, why are you yelling at me?

938
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,903
就我一个人留下来等你
I'm the only one here.

939
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,905
我又没让你留下来
I didn't ask you to be.

940
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,823
我只是想帮你
I was just trying to help you.

941
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,243
我不需要你的帮助 你又不是我男朋友
I don't need your help, you're not my boyfriend.

942
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,161
明白了
Got it.

943
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,080
- 爸爸 这没什么  - 是吗 这很严重
- Dad, it's not a big deal.  - Yeah, it's a big deal.

944
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,706
我半夜接到电话
I get a call in the middle of the night

945
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,834
说我女儿因为毁坏公物被捕了
saying my daughter's been arrested for destruction of property.

946
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,629
这是误会 我在保护我的朋友
It was a misunderstanding and I was protecting my friends.

947
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,298
我在让自己融入环境 创造回忆
I was putting myself out there. Making memories.

948
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,885
如果你以为这样的闹剧过后 我还会供你去洛杉矶
If you think I'm paying for you to go to L.A. after a stunt like this,

949
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,428
你就错了 上车
I'm not. Get in the car.

950
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,556
你难道都不听我解释吗?
You're not even gonna hear what I have to say about this?

951
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,391
不 今晚不听 上车吧
No, not tonight. Just get in.

952
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,654
嘿!
Hey!

953
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,407
监狱怎么样啊?
What up, Shawshank?

954
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,783
给自己找个马子了吗?
Did you get yourself a bitch?

955
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,159
他们用水管喷你了吗?
Did they spray you with a hose?

956
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,662
我在县监狱被喷过
I did a turn at County.

957
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,206
你们在等我?
You guys waited up for me?

958
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,666
我们当然要等你了
Of course we waited up for you.

959
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,920
她们在这儿好几个小时了 非常不方便 贝卡
They've been here for hours. It's a real inconvenience, Beca.

960
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,591
贝卡 很高兴你在这儿
Beca, I'm glad you're here.

961
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,302
我要开一次紧急贝拉组会
I'm calling an emergency Bella meeting.

962
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,511
不是吧
No.

963
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,555
- 首先...  - 好吧
- First up...  - Yes.

964
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,266
我们的记分表显示袜偶贝拉合唱团差点就赢我们了
Our score sheet revealed that the Sockappellas almost beat us.

965
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,936
还有胖艾米 比赛时就按照彩排来 不要随意发挥 好吗?
And Fat Amy, you need to do it exactly how we rehearsed it, okay?

966
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,021
没有惊喜
No surprises.

967
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,315
我们应该冒冒险 这样还不够好
We should be taking risks. It's not enough to be good,

968
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,108
我们需要释放自己 与众不同
we need to put ourselves out there, be different.

969
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,111
贝卡说得对 刺儿头小子从不唱一样的歌
Beca's right. The Trebles never sing the same song twice.

970
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,447
观众喜欢刺儿头小子 他们在忍受我们
The audience love the Trebles, they tolerate us.

971
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,617
我们可以让合唱团改头换面 如果我们...
We could change the face of a cappella if we...

972
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,869
哦 天哪 这听起来太怪异了 我这是怎么了?
Oh, my God, that sounded so queerballs. What's happening to me?

973
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,956
让我给你看我一直在筹备的改编
Let me show you this arrangement I've been working on.

974
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,791
我不知道你还喜欢这个
I didn't know you were into this stuff.

975
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,917
嗯
Yeah.

976
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,089
好了 我有决定权 而我说我们要专注练习计划好的歌单
Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say that we focus on the set list as planned.

977
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,676
从现在起 没有时间再浪费在爱好
From now on, there will be no more wasting time with work

978
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:16,305
学校 男朋友 或者同伴上了
or school or boyfriends or partners.

979
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,474
抱歉 辛西娅・罗丝
Sorry, Cynthia Rose.

980
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,852
但是奥布里 这个真的很酷 我是说...
But Aubrey, this stuff is pretty cool. I mean...

981
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,104
好了 明天彩排 八点整
Okay. Rehearsal tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. sharp.

982
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,701
嘿!
Hey!

983
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,414
这是我的作品! 你现在在放我的歌曲!
This is my track! You're playing my song right now!

984
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,209
真是太了不起了! 你喜欢吗?
That is awesome! You like it?

985
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:48,128
你放在广播上了! 太惊奇了!
You put it on the radio! That is amazing!

986
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,172
让人受不了的节奏
It's a sick beat.

987
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,300
没错 我一直觉得她的节奏挺让人受不了的
Yeah, I always thought her beats were pretty sick.

988
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:56,387
嘿 贝卡 听着 春假的时候 我想你来值夜班
Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I want you to take the night shift.

989
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,513
放你的音乐
Play your music.

990
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,601
这首歌 车库摇滚DJ的版本非常出色 但是你的呢? 更好
The DJ at the Garage does a brilliant version of this, but yours? It's better.

991
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,186
是的 没错
Yeah, it is.

992
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,439
我今晚要听她的 我觉得你应该... 你也应该来
I'm gonna listen to her tonight. I think you should... you should come with.

993
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,066
我有事情
I have a thing.

994
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,193
空姐训练?
Flight attendant training?

995
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,114
是巴顿贝拉合唱团 我今晚有半决赛
It's Barden Bellas. I have the semi-finals tonight.

996
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,201
真的? 我无法想象你会无伴奏合唱
Really? I did not have you pegged as an a cappella girl.

997
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,203
那是因为你没有我了解贝卡
That's 'cause you don't know Becky like I do.

998
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,705
晚上见
See you tonight.

999
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,474
没事 你们群妞儿别担心 我来处理
Okay, don't you flat-butts worry, I got this.

1000
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,309
我只要加下油就行了
I'm just gonna pump and dump.

1001
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,520
我不管你说什么
I don't care what you say.

1002
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,523
西斯科的现场 我所看过的最好的表演
Sisqo live, best performance ever, I've ever seen.

1003
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,400
"皮带歌"不是他唯一的成功作
"Thong Song" isn't his only hit. Yeah.

1004
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,155
不是吗? 这是认真的
All right? That's serious.

1005
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,364
哟 邦博尔 那不是胖艾米吗?
Yo, Bump, is that Fat Amy?

1006
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,075
唐纳德 减速! 慢点!
Donald, slow down! Slow down!

1007
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,910
耶! 很好!
Yeah! All right!

1008
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,038
嘿 艾米? 搞破坏咯!
Hey, Amy? Sabotage!

1009
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,546
我被击中了
I've been shot.

1010
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,217
我刚被击中了! 救命啊
I've just been shot! Help me.

1011
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,677
胖艾米!
Fat Amy!

1012
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,096
他们击中了艾米!
They shot Amy!

1013
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,015
有我呢 有我呢
I've got you. I've got you.

1014
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:28,270
别 不用 我在说话 我还能说话... 我坐起来了
No, no, no. I'm talking, I'm talking... I'm sitting up.

1015
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,189
- 好了 没事了  - 不需要这样
- All right. Cool.  - There's no need for that.

1016
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,065
不用人工呼吸
No mouth to mouth.

1017
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,694
哦 靠 邦博尔冲我扔了一个超大的玉米煎饼
Oh, shit. Bumper threw a big-ass burrito at me.

1018
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,741
我要杀了他 我发誓 我要把他打成奶油蛋糕
I'm gonna kill him, I swear. I'm gonna finish him like a cheesecake.

1019
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,726
你这里还有一点东西
You've got yourself a little something there.

1020
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,395
别管了 它能一直点燃我的恨意
Just leave it. It fuels my hate fire.

1021
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,520
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

1022
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,969
那是... 是...
It's a... It's...

1023
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,347
哦
Oh.

1024
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,141
搞什么?
What the hell?

1025
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:33,645
呃... 那真是很酷 实际上 我想我们没油了
Um... It's pretty cool, actually. I think we're just running out of gas.

1026
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,939
不 不可能 你刚刚才加满的
No, that can't be. You just filled the tank.

1027
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,816
是的 我加了
Yeah, I did.

1028
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,822
但是 或许我没加 因为我被飞来的墨西哥快餐打中了
And, yet, maybe I didn't, because I got hit by flying Mexican food.

1029
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,787
我们没油了
And we're out.

1030
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,956
说什么?
A-ca-scuse me?

1031
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,708
不是吧
A-ca-believe it.

1032
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,169
伙计 我们该怎么办?
Man, what are we gonna do?

1033
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,337
也许 我们可以打电话给...
Maybe we could call...

1034
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,632
克洛伊 提都别提 你怎么敢?
No, don't even say it, Chloe. How dare you?

1035
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,843
别啊 这想法其实挺好的 我有邦博尔的号码
Oh, no, actually that is a really good idea. I've got Bumper's number.

1036
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,262
你为什么会有邦博尔的号码?
Why do you have Bumper's number?

1037
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,650
贝拉队员们
So, Bellas,

1038
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:24,363
多无聊的雌性团体 你们准备好今晚被我们打败了吗?
what boring, estrogen-filled set have you prepared for us this evening?

1039
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,323
什么?
Excuse me?

1040
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,451
不过你们这群家伙到时会输得很惨
But you guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard

1041
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,161
再也抬不起头来
your man boobs are gonna concave.

1042
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,249
还有9英里
Nine miles, guys.

1043
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,886
相当不错啊
That's pretty good.

1044
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,390
我放火时会觉得开心
I set fires to feel joy.

1045
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,059
真可爱
That's adorable.

1046
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,873
贝拉 5分钟后上场
Five minutes, Bellas.

1047
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,834
- 他哪儿来的?  - 嘘!
- Where did he come from?  - Shh!

1048
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:22,587
完了 我们不可能打败脚注合唱团和刺儿头小子的
It's over. There's no way we can beat the Footnotes and the Trebles.

1049
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,202
哇! 这个小个子真能唱
Whoo! That little peanut can sing.

1050
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,581
真的不错 不过 盖尔 在我听来 他好像还没发育完全
He really can. It sounds to me, though, Gail, like his boys haven't dropped yet,

1051
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,874
你懂我意思的
if you know what I mean.

1052
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,502
如果你指他的下体 我懂 约翰 真的懂
If you mean his testicles, then I do, John. I do. I really do.

1053
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,962
过来 过来
A-ca-huddle, now.

1054
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,716
只有前两名能进入决赛 我们必须要打败他们其中一个
The top two teams go to the finals, so we just have to beat one of them.

1055
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,471
只要我们完完全全按照排练的表演 就能成功 好吗? 完完全全
And if we do it exactly how we rehearsed it, we will get there, okay? Exactly.

1056
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:16,558
伸出手
Hands in.

1057
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,352
数到三时 还是数完三之后?
On three or after three?

1058
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,146
算了 上吧
Screw it. Let's just do it.

1059
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,815
掌声有请出巴顿贝拉合唱团!
Put your hands together for the Barden Bellas!

1060
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,027
好的 贝拉要出场了
Okay, the Bellas are coming out.

1061
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,490
本次大赛中的第二步...
Another step in this competition and...

1062
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,743
一 二 三 四...
One, two, three, four...

1063
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,539
又来了
Here we go again.

1064
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,541
这个曲目编排 她们似乎想要一路坚持到底了
Looks like they're sticking with what they know.

1065
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,924
她们今晚在台上有点紧张啊
A little tension on the stage tonight.

1066
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,384
不过有了些进攻性
Claws are out.

1067
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,138
这只是大学生间友好的娱乐而已
This is just friendly collegiate fun.

1068
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,099
比赛十分激烈 但我们在此也享受到了美好时光
It's a tough competition, but we're all here to have a good time.

1069
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,519
没错 约翰 不过一个错误就能困扰你一辈子
That's right, John. But a mistake can haunt you for the rest of your life

1070
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,687
还能影响到你的后辈
and affect your children.

1071
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,196
到底怎么回事 贝卡? 你是想毁了我们吗?
What the hell, Beca? Were you trying to screw us up?

1072
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,531
你当真吗?
Are you serious?

1073
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,783
简单申明 这并不是贝卡的独唱秀
Newsflash. This isn't the Beca show.

1074
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,327
好吧 很抱歉搅乱了你的演出
Okay, I'm sorry that I messed you up,

1075
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,289
但你可能没注意到吧 我们演唱的时候 大家都快睡着了
but in case you hadn't noticed, everybody pretty much dozed off during our set.

1076
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,000
不用你来决定我们该唱什么 什么时候该唱
It's not your job to decide what we do and when we do it.

1077
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:09,254
你怎么不问问其他组员对你的即兴表演有什么感想?
Why don't you ask the rest of the group how they felt about your little improvisation?

1078
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,383
艾米?
Amy?

1079
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:19,181
很棒 但的确让我们有点小惊讶
It was cool. But it did take us a little bit by surprise.

1080
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,057
是非常惊讶
Yeah, a lot by surprise.

1081
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,851
一点点
A little.

1082
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,021
- 我早告诉过你 她不适合阿卡贝拉  - 奥布里 别说了
- I told you she wasn't a Bella.  - Aubrey, don't.

1083
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,356
不用 没事的 你不用假装
No, that's okay. You don't have to pretend

1084
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,317
自己在这组里有发言权 好吗?
you're allowed to have a say in the group, right?

1085
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,028
你的态度真恶劣 我实在是看不惯你
Your attitude sucks. You're a grade-A pain in my ass,

1086
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,362
我就知道你跟杰西有一腿
and I know you're hooking up with Jesse.

1087
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,781
奥布里 冷静 我发誓 我们可是清白得很
Whoa. Whoa. Aubrey, calm down. We're not hooking up, I swear.

1088
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,702
天啊! 太棒了! 就知道这时你肯定会出现
Jesus Christ! That's perfect. Of course you're here right now.

1089
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,080
我不需要你的帮忙 好吗? 你能靠边站吗?
I don't need your help, okay? Can you back off?

1090
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,499
刺儿头小子 该上场了
Trebles. Time to bring the pain.

1091
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,629
如果这就是我努力的结局...
If this is what I get for trying...

1092
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,925
贝卡? 贝卡 等等
Beca? Beca, wait.

1093
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,348
奥布里 其实表演效果也很好
Aubrey, it actually went really well.

1094
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,724
够了 克洛伊!
Chloe, stop!

1095
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,559
抱歉 噢 天啊 好吧
Excuse me. Oh, my God. Okay.

1096
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,563
贝卡? 贝卡 等等
Beca? Beca, wait.

1097
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:19,563
我的孩子是JFK高中的荣誉学生

1098
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,955
刺儿头小子合唱团今晚拔得头筹
And the Treblemakers seal the deal tonight.

1099
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,625
很不幸 巴顿的另一支合唱团 贝拉合唱团 不幸出局
Unfortunately, Barden's other group, the Bellas, do not advance,

1100
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:33,505
毕业班的奥布里・柏森失去了一洗去年呕吐门的机会
and senior Aubrey Posen loses her chance to redeem herself from last year's Pukegate.

1101
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:43,723
春假快乐
Happy spring break.

1102
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,392
谢谢
Thanks.

1103
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:14,898
用最简单的词 用最方便的定义
In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.

1104
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:19,027
但我们才发现 我们分别是一个书呆子
But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain.

1105
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,695
和一个运动员
And an athlete.

1106
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,655
一个神经病
And a basket case.

1107
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,907
一个公主
A princess.

1108
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,617
和一个罪犯
And a criminal.

1109
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,036
这回答了你的问题了吗?
Does that answer your question?

1110
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:31,581
你诚挚的 早餐俱乐部
Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.

1111
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,637
噢 天啊
Oh, my God.

1112
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,807
好了
Okay.

1113
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:02,570
我们是全国大学生无伴奏演唱协会的
We are from the Collegiate A Cappella Association.

1114
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:06,324
我们注意到 你并不是大学生
It has come to our attention that you are not in college.

1115
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,410
这位是你母亲吗?
Is this your mother?

1116
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,297
我是奥布里・柏森
This is Aubrey Posen.

1117
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,178
是 谢谢你 先生
Yes, thank you, sir.

1118
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,474
很期待在林肯中心再次与您会面
I look forward to seeing you again at Lincoln Center.

1119
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,978
耶!
Yes!

1120
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,076
奥布里?
Aubrey?

1121
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,756
我全跟了 各位
I'm all in, bitches.

1122
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:21,524
好了 上帝终于垂青我们了 又给了我们一次机会
Okay. The a-ca-gods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance.

1123
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:22,817
太好了!
Shalom!

1124
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:23,985
我短信通知贝卡了
I texted Beca.

1125
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,278
你怎么了?
You did what?

1126
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,404
有她在 我们更强
She makes us better.

1127
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,490
克洛伊 你不该有这种想法的
That's not an opinion for you to have, Chloe.

1128
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,158
为什么? 因为你不是这样想的?
Why? Because it's not yours?

1129
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,826
你要知道 你也不是永远都对
You're not always right, you know.

1130
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,661
没有她 我们也一样能赢
We will win without her.

1131
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,425
杰西 我知道你在里面 我闻到爆米花味了
Jesse, I know you're in there. I can smell popcorn.

1132
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,595
杰西 拜托 开门吧
Jesse, come on. Open up.

1133
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,732
嘿 我给你打了电话 还发了好多信息
Hey. I tried to call you. I left you a bunch of messages.

1134
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,275
嗯 我收到了
Yeah, I got them.

1135
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,653
很抱歉之前和你吵架
I'm sorry that we fought.

1136
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,322
我当时太生气了 反应过度了 我只是...
I was mad and I overreacted and I'm just...

1137
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,615
奥布里让我有些情绪失控
Aubrey makes me crazy.

1138
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:11,908
真的吗?
Seriously?

1139
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,286
你以为我是因为你对我吼 所以才生气的?
You think I'm mad because you yelled at me?

1140
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,247
不 我知道...
No, I know...

1141
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,750
你根本不知道 你以为自己知道 但你不知道
No, you don't. You think you know, but you don't.

1142
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,005
只要有人想关心你 你就拒他们于千里之外 为什么?
You push away anyone who could possibly care about you. Why is that?

1143
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,925
我不知道
I don't know.

1144
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,971
那你最好去搞清楚 因为我已经受够了...
Well, you better figure it out because I'm done with...

1145
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,265
管这算什么关系呢
whatever this is.

1146
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,808
- 杰西...  - 我受够了
- Jesse...  - I'm done.

1147
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,493
女人啊
Women.

1148
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,078
是啊
Yeah.

1149
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,582
好了 停
Okay, stop.

1150
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,333
我们这是怎么了?
What is happening to us?

1151
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,420
克洛伊 你的声音听起来好像是一天抽三包烟似的
Chloe, you sound like you smoke three packs a day.

1152
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,964
斯蒂西 你的舞蹈方面落后太多了
Stacie, you are so behind on choreography.

1153
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:11,759
还有杰西卡和艾什莉 你们好像有一年没训练过了
And Jessica and Ashley, it is like you haven't been here all year long.

1154
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:12,885
奥布里 说真的吗?
Aubrey, really?

1155
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,262
我们一直在这里训练
We've literally been here the whole time.

1156
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,348
奥布里让我们休息一下吧
Aubrey, please, just give us a break.

1157
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,601
人不到齐 感觉好像都变了
It's kind of not the same without everyone here.

1158
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,019
我们需要贝卡
We need Beca.

1159
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,062
如果奥布里少管一些 也许会好些
Maybe if Aubrey loosened the reins a little bit.

1160
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,355
好了 闭嘴 克洛伊!
Okay, shut it, Chloe!

1161
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,192
抱歉 我太粗鲁了
Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude.

1162
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,571
克洛伊 你能不要再用屁股想问题了吗? 脑子不在那里
Chloe, could you please get your head out of your ass? It's not a hat.

1163
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,576
真尴尬
A-ca-awkward.

1164
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,620
再来一次
Again.

1165
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:46,711
我自己才最惊讶 但我真的很喜欢那些女孩
No one was more surprised than me, but I really liked those girls.

1166
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,922
你觉得只要退出就可以了吗?
And you thought quitting was the answer?

1167
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,050
真的吗? 你好意思这么说我?
Seriously? You can say that to me?

1168
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,427
拜托 贝卡 这样说可不公平
Oh, come on, Bec, that's so unfair.

1169
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,306
听着 你妈妈和我 我们就是不适合了
Look, your mom and I, we didn't work.

1170
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,476
但我一直努力想缓和我们之间的关系
But I tried so hard to make things right between us.

1171
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,645
而你 你只是一味地疏远我
But you, you just shut me out.

1172
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,981
对 我对所有人都疏远 不是针对你
Yeah, well, I shut everybody out. Don't take it personally.

1173
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,191
只是这样更容易
It's just easier.

1174
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,735
这样也真的会很孤单
It's also really lonely.

1175
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,409
我该怎么办?
What do I do?

1176
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,745
那就看你自己了
Well, that's up to you.

1177
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,334
刺儿头小子们 听着!
Trebles, listen up!

1178
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,545
如果是贝拉进入决赛的消息 那我们已经知道了
If this is about the Bellas getting into the finals, we already know.

1179
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,297
我才不关心那群蠢女人
I don't give a crap about those dumb bitches.

1180
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:34,342
因为我要去开创音乐事业了
Because I'm being brought up to the musical big leagues.

1181
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,426
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1182
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:39,263
约翰梅尔透过助理 亲自请我
John Mayer just asked me, personally, through an assistant,

1183
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:42,141
给他的新唱片做伴唱
to sing backup on his new CD.

1184
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,729
我过几个小时 就要出发去洛杉矶了 所以现在得走了
I leave for Los Angeles in a few hours, so I gotta get going.

1185
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:49,023
但是邦博尔 ICCA比赛怎么办? 这周末啊
But Bumper, what about the ICCAs? They're this weekend.

1186
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:54,487
抱歉啦 伙计们 这种玩意我都赢腻了 我要走喽
Hmm. Sorry, buddies, but I won that shit like 100 times, so I'm out of here.

1187
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,365
我要去买个无领皮夹克 或者买个飞行眼镜
Got a collarless leather jacket to buy. Maybe some aviators.

1188
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,075
还有耳环 算不清啦
I might get an earring, I don't know.

1189
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:02,370
洛杉矶啊 真兴奋啊 我的人生啊!
It's Los Angeles. This is exciting stuff. My life rules!

1190
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,998
- 邦博尔是个混蛋 好吧 我就是骂出来了  - 嗯
- Bumper's a jerk. All right, I said it.  - Yeah.

1191
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:08,126
- 不过我们得找人来代替这个混蛋了  - 嗯
- Well, he's a jerk that we need to replace.  - Yeah.

1192
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,877
尽快
Pronto dente.

1193
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,963
你知道吗 他自己假装粉丝给自己写信
You know he writes his own fan mail.

1194
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,929
机会来了 你想要 就是你的了
Spot opened up, and it's yours if you want it.

1195
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:23,558
只有一个条件 保证你不会表现得怪异
Just one condition. Promise me you won't get all weird.

1196
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:27,019
我们只是一个歌唱团体 好吗?
We're just a group of guys singing a bunch of covers of songs, okay?

1197
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,939
你要是表现得怪异 他们绝对不会让你待下去
If you get weird, they will definitely not let you stay.

1198
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,568
好 只是我不知道怎么算是怪异
Deal. Although I don't know what you mean by weird.

1199
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,279
明白了
Got it.

1200
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,615
我在这儿支持了你这么多年 而你却这样对我...
I have been there for you for so many years, and all you do is treat me like...

1201
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,493
好了 闭嘴! 各位!
All right, no, okay, just shut up! Everyone!

1202
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,372
拜托 我当时加入 是因为我想和一群很酷的女孩在一起
Come on, I joined this group so I could hang out with a bunch of really cool chicks.

1203
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,583
当然了 还因为我真的厌烦了我所有的男朋友
And also 'cause I was really sick of all my boyfriends

1204
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,835
我需要逃离那一切
and I need to get away from that.

1205
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,880
但这儿现在真的太糟了
But this is some serious horseshit.

1206
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:57,675
什么味道? 到处都臭臭的
What's that smell? Stinks everywhere.

1207
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,303
我不想再像老贝拉组员一样了
I don't wanna be like the old Bellas.

1208
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,722
是 我喜欢我们现在的样子
Yeah, I wanna be how we are now.

1209
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,475
我也是
Me, too.

1210
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,976
我们应该听听贝卡的意见
We should have listened to Beca.

1211
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,770
所以是我的错了?
Oh, so it's my fault?

1212
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:09,854
我可没这么说
That's not what I'm saying.

1213
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,148
不 你们都是这样想的 不是吗?
No, no, no, that's what you're all thinking, isn't it?

1214
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:16,152
认为我是笨蛋 认为我眼中只有胜利
That I'm the jerk. I am the girl obsessed with winning.

1215
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,614
奥布里 你控制欲太强了 那样会毁了我们
Aubrey, you're too controlling and it's gonna ruin all of us.

1216
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,825
是吗 我要想失控 我也可以失控
You know what, I can lose control if I want to.

1217
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:26,954
我也可以不管不顾 这次我不会抑制了
I can let go. This time I'm not gonna choke it down.

1218
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:28,331
嗯?
Hmm?

1219
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,218
来啊 继续啊! 这才哪到哪啊!
Come on, bring it! You can do better than that!

1220
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,594
你就这样了吗?
That's all you got?

1221
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,096
够了! 够了!
Enough! Enough!

1222
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,477
我们本来可以夺冠的!
We could have been champions!

1223
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,648
给我音笛 你个混蛋!
Give me the pitch pipe, you bitch!

1224
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:55,691
给我!
Give it to me!

1225
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,779
给我! 把它给我!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1226
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:00,905
别想!
Never!

1227
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,490
我来保护你 保护你
I'll protect you. I'll protect you.

1228
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,908
手给我拿开!
Hands off the goodies!

1229
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,591
滚开 你们这群混蛋!
Move, you bitches!

1230
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,808
各位!
Guys!

1231
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,769
大家停手! 这是在干吗?
Guys, stop! What is going on?

1232
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,155
没事 没事 这只是贝拉排演
Nothing. Nothing. This is a Bellas rehearsal.

1233
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,575
我知道 我只是
I know. I just

1234
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,120
想要说 我很抱歉
wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1235
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,374
我之前的行为真的很不对
What I did was a really dick move

1236
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,878
我不应该在没有问过大家的情况下 就即兴发挥
and I shouldn't have changed the set without asking you guys.

1237
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,462
我当然也不该负气离开
And I definitely shouldn't have left.

1238
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,383
让大家失望了 我真的很抱歉
I let you guys down and I'm really sorry.

1239
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,387
还有...
And...

1240
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,434
奥布里 如果你还接纳我 我想要回来
Aubrey, if you would have me, I want back in.

1241
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,792
奥布里
Aubrey.

1242
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:47,887
等等
Wait.

1243
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,764
谢谢 不然就尴尬了
Thank you. That would have been embarrassing.

1244
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,477
贝卡 我知道我对你一直很苛刻 对吧?
Beca, I know that I've been hard on you, okay?

1245
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,106
我知道 我对这儿的所有人都很苛刻
I know that I have been hard on everyone here.

1246
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,069
但都是我父亲教出来的
But I am my father's daughter.

1247
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:09,784
他总是说 "如果起初你就没有成功
And he always said, "If at first you don't succeed,

1248
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,704
那就收拾铺盖走人吧"
pack your bags."

1249
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,293
天啊 真是疯了
Jesus. That's really crazy.

1250
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,965
我懂 我父亲也经常说我
I get it. Mine gets on me, too.

1251
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,883
虽不是这种话 但也...
Not like that, but...

1252
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,553
我想我们只是对彼此不够真正了解
I guess we don't really know that much about each other.

1253
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,848
应该说 大多数吧
About most of you, really.

1254
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:37,144
我先来坦白一下 你们都不知道的我的事
Well, I'll confess something that none of you know about me.

1255
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,189
我跟很多人上床
I have a lot of sex.

1256
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,565
斯蒂西 我们都知道的
Yeah, we know, Stacie.

1257
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,026
因为我刚告诉了你
Only 'cause I just told you.

1258
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,236
这个方法很好
This is a good idea.

1259
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,447
这事不怎么好 不过这个方法很不错
That was a pretty bad example, but this is a good idea.

1260
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:52,827
我们不如就坐成一圈
Why don't we all go around the room,

1261
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:57,748
然后跟大家说说 别人所不了解的自己
and we can all say something about ourselves that nobody else knows.

1262
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,543
我也些事情要说
Okay, I got something.

1263
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,713
跟各位承认这事很不容易
This is hard for me to admit to you guys.

1264
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:07,550
我想大家都知道是什么事了 坦诚说吧
I think we all know where this is going. Let's be honest.

1265
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:13,806
这两年 我一直沉迷于
Well, for the last two years, I've had a serious

1266
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:15,725
赌博
gambling problem.

1267
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,268
- 什么?  - 什么?
- What?  - What?

1268
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,520
自从我跟我女朋友分手之后就开始了
It started when I broke up with my girlfriend.

1269
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,605
噢! 就是这事了
Whoomp! There it is.

1270
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,944
我还爱你
I still love you.

1271
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:33,451
还有谁吗?
Anyone else?

1272
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,414
我在子宫里的时候 吃掉了自己的胞姐
I ate my twin in the womb.

1273
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:41,417
什么?
What?

1274
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:45,796
好了
Okay.

1275
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:48,883
胖艾米?
Fat Amy?

1276
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,093
我哪还有什么秘密
I'm an open book.

1277
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,721
我的意思是 大家不都已经叫我胖艾米了嘛
I mean, for God's sake, you guys all call me Fat Amy.

1278
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:59,935
我想如果我不是百分百诚实 就不算真的在活着
See, I guess I'm just not really living if I'm not being 100 % honest.

1279
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,524
其实我的真名叫胖帕特丽夏
And my real name is Fat Patricia.

1280
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:08,069
什么?
What?

1281
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:13,199
好了 我以前一直都没什么
Okay. I've never been one of those girls

1282
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,828
女性朋友 但我现在有了
who had a lot of friends who were girls. And I do now.

1283
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,165
这样感觉真好
And that's pretty cool.

1284
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,754
这就是我啦 下一个吧
So, that's me. Someone else please go.

1285
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,007
好吧
Okay.

1286
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:38,432
春假时 我做了一个勇敢的决定 切除我的声带小结
Over spring break, I made the courageous decision to remove my nodes.

1287
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:44,939
我知道 医生说 我也许永远不能再唱
I know. The doctor said that I can't sing above a G-sharp,

1288
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,274
升G调以上的音了
maybe ever.

1289
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:51,028
我当时以为这个赛季结束了
I thought the season was over.

1290
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,201
没事 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

1291
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,540
贝卡 我们该怎么办?
Beca, what do we do?

1292
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,592
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1293
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:15,511
那就别在这儿唱了
Maybe not here.

1294
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,431
好了 我们开始混音吧
All right. Let's remix this business.

1295
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:25,020
奥布里 能为我们选首歌吗?
Aubrey, would you pick a song for us, please?

1296
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:27,606
布鲁诺・马尔斯的"皆应是你"
Bruno Mars, Just The Way You Are.

1297
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:32,444
好的 克洛伊 你可以起个头吗?
Okay. Chloe, are you okay to take the lead?

1298
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,571
好
Yeah.

1299
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,343
伸出手
Hands in.

1300
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,432
一 二...
One, two...

1301
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,435
什么声音?
What was that?

1302
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,187
不知道 我从未发出过这个音
I don't know, I've never made that sound before.

1303
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,107
不过你现在医治过的声带 可以唱低音了
Yo, but with your messed up vocal cords, you could hit the bass notes.

1304
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,192
你知道这代表什么吗?
Do you know what that means?

1305
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:36,485
莉莉 怎么了?
Yes, Lilly?

1306
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,696
我想这样我有技巧可以帮到大家
I think I have something that can help us out.

1307
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:42,032
亲爱的 不需要你大声喊的
Excuse me, bitch, you don't need to shout.

1308
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,159
可别说大话啊
Okay, don't get mouthy.

1309

林肯中心今晚蓬荜生辉 正是因为有了这群
Lincoln Center is proud to welcome back all of these young hopefuls tonight

1312
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:12,813

- if you can just shut your eyes. - I'm doing it.

1315
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,371
闭上眼睛 忘掉什么规则
Shut your eyes and get rid of all the a-ca-politics,

1316
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:33,834
只要记住 在纽约城的林肯中心
then you can remember that being at Lincoln Center, in the Big Apple,

1317
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,589
在这个历史悠久的舞台上演唱 是每个无伴奏演唱者的梦想
and singing on this storied stage is the dream of every a cappella singer.

1318
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,382
你说对了 约翰
You said it, John.

01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,930
非常棒 今晚很难有其他队伍超越他们了
Absolutely tight. It's gonna be very hard to beat that tonight.

1330
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:17,891
其他队伍也有他们精心准备的作品 约翰
Every other group has their work cut out for them, John.

1331

I'm glad it's not us anymore, Gail. Those days are over, thank goodness.

1332
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,232
特别是他们不要我们回去后
Especially since they wouldn't have us back.

1333
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,735
好了 表演如何?

巴顿大学的刺儿头小子合唱团

你们是最棒的
Yeah, you guys are the best.

1337
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:38,996
虽然你们有些人特别瘦 不过我相信 你们都有一颗胖胖的心
Even though some of you are pretty thin, I think that you all have fat hearts,

1338
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:42,124
那就足够了
and that's what matters.

1339
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,501
我们加油吧 好吗?
Okay, let's just smash this. Okay?

噢 天啊 看到了吗?
Oh, my goodness gracious. Will you look at this?

1342
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:58,557
贝拉的制服竟然不见了 她们有了新的面貌
Gone are those Bella uniforms and this is a whole new look for them,

1343
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,309
真是正点 正点 正点
and it is hot, hot, hot.

1344
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,894
约翰 她们让我都想变男人了

1349
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:27,576
约翰 我想我们刚刚见证了一段无伴奏合唱的历史
I think we have just seen some a cappella history being made, John.

1350
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:31,538
而且是来自一个全女生的团体啊 盖尔 我从未预见到这种情况
And from an all-female group, Gail. I could never have called this one.

1351
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,249
当然了 你内心一直厌恶女生
Never. Well, you are a misogynist at heart,

1352
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,376
你也自然不可能料想到这群女孩会赢
so there's no way you would have bet on these girls to win.

1353
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,460
确实啊
Absolutely.

1354
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,133
是不是很不可思议? 哇!
Weren't they incredible? Wow!

1355

女士们先生们 让我们再次为巴顿贝拉鼓掌!
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up again for the Barden Bellas!

1356
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,895
早告诉过你 结尾才是最精彩的
Told you. Endings are the best part.

1357
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,146
你真是个怪胎
You're such a weirdo.

1358
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,500
6个月后

1359
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,620
听着 无伴奏演唱评委
Listen up, a-ca-ballers.

1360
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:16,207
我曾被军队拒绝 曾被强行装进"爱探险的朵拉"背包里
I have been rejected by the Army, shoved into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

1361
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:19,753
曾被推进女生的更衣室 当时除了吊裤带 什么都没穿
and pushed into the girls' locker room wearing nothing but suspenders.

1362
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,756
不过没关系 我还在我爱的这个世界
But no matter. I am in the world that I love.

1363
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:25,133
我带着我的助理 贾斯汀...
And with the assistance of my boy, Justin...

1364
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,259
君主陛下
My liege.

1365
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:27,552
我宣布今年的面试开始
I launch this year's auditions.

1366
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,847
拍肚子
Belly roll.

1367
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:36,728
最新一届的ICCA冠军将选择这首面试曲目
The most recent ICCA national champion winners get to pick the audition song.

1368
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:46,112
好了 怪胎们 那就唱...
All right, nerds. Let's go with...
