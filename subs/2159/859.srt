1
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:13,722
《 透 明 人 》


2
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,150
òhey have this All Bird TV. You seen it?

3
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,070
No. - Sure, it's All Bird TV.

4
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,950
I'm giving them a plug.

5
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,950
It's all birds. I watch it with the cat, the cat, fixated by it.

6
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,513
“不稳定”
Damn it!

7
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,781
妈的！


8
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,723
该死
Damn it.

9
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,975
“你该工作”


10
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,669
“稳定”


11
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,538
我真是个天才
I am a goddamn genius.

12
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,822
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

13
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,791
赛巴斯辛，你知道现在几点吗？
Sebastian, do you have any idea what time it is?

14
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,105
天才从不浪费时间睡觉
Da Vinci never slept. Said it was a waste of time.

15
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,837
那是谁？
Who's that?

16
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,204
不关你的事
Not your business.

17
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,071
不再是了
Not anymore.

18
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,242
琳达…
Linda...

19
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,351
…我找到还原配方了
... I cracked the reversión.

20
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,047
你找到了？
You cracked it?

21
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,313
你看
Look at this.

22
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,190
注意看
Watch.

23
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,422
“稳定”


24
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:13,332
过了11个月，你就突然开窍了？ 怎么会？
Eleven months and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How?

25
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,436
老套，咖啡加点心
The usual. Coffee and Twinkies.

26
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,404
我恨你
I hate you.

27
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,807
你能找麦特一起去实验室吗？ 我要伊莎贝拉准备好活体实验
Can you find Matt and get to the lab? I want Isabelle for a live test.

28
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,706
我想能找到他
I think I can find him.

29
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,043
你何时会到？
When will you be in?

30
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,719
嗯，瑞典现在该是白天
Well, it should be daylight in Sweden now.

31
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:34,052
我该通知诺贝尔委员会 请他们准备好我们的奖
So I should call the Nobel committee and tell them to get our prize ready.

32
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,929
等会见了
I'll see you in a few.

33
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:44,925
麦特
Matt.

34
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,599
赛巴斯辛来电，我们得去实验室
Sebastian called. We gotta get to the lab.

35
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,705
急什么？
What's the rush?

36
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,034
他发现还原配方了
He cracked reversión.

37
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,470
别开玩笑了
You're kidding.

38
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,509
- 何时的事？ - 当我们睡觉时
When? - While we were sleeping.

39
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,615
我载你去吧？
You want a ride?

40
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,812
也许我们该各自开车去
Maybe we should take our own cars.

41
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,884
我不想再偷偷摸摸的了，琳
I'm tired of this sneaking around, Lin.

42
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,117
你总得告诉他的
You're gonna have to tell him eventually.

43
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,862
我会的，总有一天
I will, eventually.

44
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,997
我是在等待时机
I'm just waiting for the right time.

45
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,760
对赛巴斯辛而言 时机永远都不对
With Sebastian, there's never gonna be a right time.

46
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,254
但你注定死亡


47
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,956
因为我天生注定要飞


48
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,146
早安，凯恩博士
Morning, Dr. Caine. - Morning.

49
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,513
- 祝你顺心 - 谢谢
Have a nice day, sir. - Thank you.

50
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,133
- 早安 - 早安，艾德
Good morning, sir. - Morning, Ed.

51
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,743
你们今天很早，有特别的事吗？
Your team's in early today. Something special?

52
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,470
抱歉，你知道规定的
Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.

53
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,351
“扫瞄中”


54
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,984
- 授权码 - 凯恩，0027
Authorization, please. - Caine, 0027.

55
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,489
确认
Confirmed.

56
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,420
Hi.

57
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,094
伊莎贝拉
Isabelle.

58
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,748
别这样，伊莎贝拉
Come on, Isabelle.

59
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,286
冷静点，宝贝
Calm down, baby.

60
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,361
乖孩子
Good girl.

61
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,972
不会有事的
It's okay.

62
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,303
我不会伤害你
I'm not gonna hurt you.

63
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,846
别动
Hold still.

64
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,764
是伊莎贝拉？
Isabelle?

65
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,001
她最近变得更有侵略性了
She's more aggressive these days.

66
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,770
所以才要用镇静剂 我去抓她
That's what tranquillizers are for. L'll get her.

67
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,213
她隐形太久了 那开始影响她的大脑
She's been gone too long. It's starting to affect her brain.

68
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,978
- 去料理伤口吧 - 我会的
You take care of that bite. - L'll manage.

69
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,650
Hey.

70
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,321
我赌十元能先逮到她
Ten bucks says I nail her first.

71
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,892
成交
You're on.

72
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,500
Isabelle?

73
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,872
爸爸帮你准备了个惊喜
Got a surprise for you.

74
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,129
你没射中
You missed.

75
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,357
也许是因为我不用午餐时练习
Maybe because I don't spend my lunch hours practicing.

76
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,697
你欠我十元
You owe me ten.

77
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,202
记帐
Put it on my tab.

78
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,807
搞不好改天我真的会要你清帐
You know, someday I may actually make you pay up.

79
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,646
莎拉很愤怒，你最好友善点
Sarah's on the warpath, so you play nice.

80
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,948
- 这根本是乱搞，赛巴斯辛 - 你也早安
This is bullshit, Sebastian. - And good morning to you too.

81
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,949
把大猩猩搬上桌吧
Get the monkey on the table.

82
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,663
你怎能对伊莎贝拉注射 未经试验的配方液？
How can you justify injecting Isabelle with the serum without even testing it?

83
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,159
这样省时
Because it'll save time.

84
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,128
那你负责收拾善后
Then you can mop up afterwards.

85
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,632
你以为我想害死伊莎贝拉？
You think I'm trying to kill Isabelle?

86
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,965
- 害死？根本是溶解她 - 实验室准备好了
Kill? More like liquefy. - Lab's prepped.

87
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:25,266
异议收到且即刻被驳回
Well, your objections are duly noted and summarily overruled.

88
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,945
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

89
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,239
为什么当你说“是的，长官”时 听来像是“去你的”
How come when you say, 'Yes, sir,' it sounds like 'Fuck you'?

90
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,977
练习就行
Practice.

91
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,151
你怎么说服我雇用她的？
How'd you convince me to hire her?

92
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,288
你说你要全美最棒的兽医
You wanted the best vet in the U.S.

93
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,859
- 她过度关心动物 - 所以她才棒啊
She cares more about the animals. - And maybe that's why she's so good.

94
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,698
你的约会对象长什么德性？
So this guy you're seeing, what's he like?

95
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,631
他跟你完全不一样
He's everything you're not.

96
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,303
他一定很无聊
He must be dull.

97
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,822
- 40秒内开始 - 好
Ready in 40. - Okay.

98
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,728
生命迹象？
Vitals?

99
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:18,694
全部正常
All normal.

100
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,389
过于滥用“正常”这二字了吧
Using the word 'normal' loosely, of course.

101
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,727
- 紧急医疗组待命 - 技术组，情况如何？
Emergency medical, standing by. - Tech, status?

102
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,336
我是上帝
This is God.

103
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,064
你扰乱了万物的秩序…
You are disturbing the natural order of things...

104
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,573
…将永世受到严厉的惩罚
... and will be severely punished for all eternity.

105
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,472
上帝说话了
God has spoken.

106
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,074
我要告诉你多少次，法兰克…
How many times must I tell you, Frank...

107
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,140
…你不是上帝
...you're not God.

108
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,045
我才是
I am.

109
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,384
抱歉，老大，我忘了
Sorry, chief. Forgot.

110
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,324
准备开始了吗？
You guys ready to roll yet?

111
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,651
好了
Yes.

112
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,924
那些狗屎医学博士好像都不用等
Like those sorry-ass M.D. S have ever had to wait for us.

113
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,061
告诉皇上我两小时前就好了
Tell His Highness Mary was hot two hours ago.

114
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,063
好，我会呈报
Yeah, l'll tell him that.

115
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,597
- 准备好了，老大 - 开始录影
Ready up here, chief. - Roll and record.

116
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,736
开始录了
Rolling.

117
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:06,075
实验对象：伊莎贝拉二号 隐形状态，已达126小时
Subject, Isabelle Two. Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.

118
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,246
第四级程序…
Testing D-phase protocol...

119
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,147
…凯氏辐射蛋白125号
...Serial Irradiated Protein Caine 125.

120
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,586
不用你的名字，也许会成功
Stop naming them after yourself, you'd have better luck.

121
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,827
谢了，肯博士，你观察真敏锐
Thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen observation.

122
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,520
我会记在备忘录上
L'll include it in my memoirs.

123
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,255
我也会记你一笔
L'll make sure to put you in mine.

124
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,401
你们认真点好吗？
Would you guys be serious, please?

125
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,635
- 她熬得过来吗？ - 不知道，我只是在这工作
You think she'll make it? - I don't know, I just work here.

126
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,901
量子值已测定
Quantum signatures are calibrated.

127
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,274
莎拉，找出血管
Okay, Sarah, get us a vein.

128
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,511
喷雾
Spray.

129
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,049
血管找到了
Vein's prepped.

130
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,994
很好
All right.

131
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,290
无用的解药来了
Here goes nothing.

132
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,158
措词不当，马修，这是我的特权
Bad form, Matthew. The honor is mine.

133
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,020
Okay.

134
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,981
注射时间在早上8点47分…
Injection occurred at 0847.

135
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,601
心跳加快了
Elevated heartbeat.

136
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,272
- 情况还稳定 - 确认
We're still in the green. - Confirmed.

137
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,440
生物电流与量子状态指示器 很稳定
Bioelectric energy and quantum shift indicators are stable.

138
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,049
有细胞反应
We're getting cellular reaction.

139
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,200
有用，真的有用
It's working. It's actually working.

140
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,967
当然，别太自大
Of course it is. - Don't get cocky.

141
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,316
心跳上升，她吓到了，没事的
Heart rate's up. She's scared. It's okay.

142
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,045
实验对象几乎是立刻起反应 程序进行快速
Subject began manifesting immediately. Protocol's acting quickly.

143
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,722
“生物电流量警示”


144
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,059
该死，血压过低，脉搏过高
Goddamn it, blood pressure crashing. Pulse high.

145
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,428
她的心脏
It's her heart.

146
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,235
心律不整，脑波频率过高
I got erratic heartbeat and brain activity.

147
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,070
- 她心跳要停止了 - 电击器！
She's going into cardiac arrest. - Defib!

148
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,073
准备强心针
Prep an intracardiac.

149
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,578
- 没动静，她不行了 - 不，她不会，电击她！
Flatline. We're losing her. - No, we're not. Hit her!

150
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,082
站开   ！
Clear!

151
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,782
- 再来 - 站开
Again. - Clear.

152
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,359
- 再来！ - 站开
Again! - Clear.

153
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,733
- 快啊 - 再来！
Come on. - Again!

154
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,227
站开！
Clear!

155
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,801
该死！强心针
Fuck! Intracardiac.

156
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,033
等等！有动静了
Wait! No, we got something.

157
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,613
还是不稳定…
Still erratic...

158
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,644
…稳定下来了
...and stabilizing.

159
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,484
天啊
Oh, man.

160
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:21,456
脑波频率回复正常 量子值稳定
Brain activity returning to normal. Quantum signatures are stable.

161
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,103
欢迎回来，伊莎贝拉
Welcome back, Isabelle.

162
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,930
Yeah. Yeah!

163
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,407
好耶！
Yeah, baby!

164
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,113
- 我们成功了 - 干的好
We did it. - Good work, everyone.

165
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,373
好耶！就是这样干的
Yeah! That's the way it's done, man.

166
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,881
她还好吗？
So how's she doing, doc?

167
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,220
我想她不会有事的
Well, I think she's gonna be okay.

168
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,662
- 来吧，进去 - 来，伊莎贝拉
Come on. Right in there. - Come on, Isabelle.

169
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,357
去啊，好女孩
Go ahead. Good girl.

170
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,161
看她多温驯
Look how peaceful she is.

171
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,365
真像什么事都没发生过似的
It seems like nothing happened to her.

172
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:06,907
星期一安排活体解剖 检查她的神经系统
Schedule a vivisection for Monday. I wanna check her neuropathways.

173
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,046
才救回她就要剖开她的大脑？
You just brought her back and you're gonna slice up her brain?

174
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,149
我又不是开动物园的！
I'm not running a goddamn zoo!

175
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,052
- 你真是个卑劣的混蛋 - 快跟她说你是开玩笑的
You're a fucking unethical bastard. - Tell her you're kidding.

176
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,483
- 对吧？ - 对
Right? - Right.

177
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,556
我这个星期还不会剖开她
I won't cut her for another week.

178
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,355
别太过份了
Don't be such an asshole.

179
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,994
我们终于有东西值得庆祝了
We finally have something to celebrate.

180
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,530
- 酷，我饿了，走吧 - 我也是
Cool. I'm hungry, let's go. - Me too.

181
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,733
我们真该把你剖了
We should cut you up.

182
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,008
各位女士，先生们，请注意
Ladies and gentlemen, a moment of your time, please.

183
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,198
要来了
Here it comes.

184
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,504
敬最顶尖的研究团队
To the finest research team I have ever known.

185
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,009
干杯
Cheers.

186
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,717
接著发生爆炸，后来她说：
There was a big explosión, and afterward she said:

187
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:58,362
“如果你这么聪明 为何你还在念二年级？”
'If you're so smart, how come you're still in the second grade?'

188
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,361
- 她眉毛多久才长回来？ - 一个月
She grew her eyebrows back? - In a month.

189
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,728
- 你被留校察看了多久？ - 一个月
How long were you suspended? - A month.

190
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,444
我以为你走了
Hey, I thought you'd gone.

191
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,451
我没地方可去
There's nowhere to go.

192
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,924
我错过了什么？
Did I miss something?

193
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,628
你不是该快乐吗？
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

194
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:37,494
还原是最后的突破了 感觉像是个终点的开始
Reversión was the last breakthrough. Feels like the beginning of the end.

195
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,805
不对，我们得到了丰富的资料
That's not true. We've got a lifetime of data.

196
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,169
麦特这种人有耐性解读资料 但你知道我…
Matt has the patience to crunch the numbers, but you know me...

197
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,107
…我需要浮华世界
...I need this grandeur and the spectacle.

198
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,011
我无法想像自己做琐事
I can't concern myself with the details.

199
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,518
我知道，我是其中一个
Yeah, I know. I was one of them.

200
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,192
我以为我们在一起很棒
I thought we were great together.

201
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,120
你是很棒
You were great.

202
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,562
我只是陪衬你而已
I was just standing next to you.

203
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:13,763
拜托，我们有过快乐时光啊
Come on. We had some good times.

204
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,004
是啊，我们有过一些快乐时光
Yeah, we had some good times.

205
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,273
你有想回到过去吗？
Have you ever wanted to turn the clock back?

206
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,443
回去再试一次？
Go back and try again?

207
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,653
我想那种时光旅行并不存在
L'd say that kind of time travel doesn't exist.

208
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,683
也许我们该发明它
Well, maybe we should invent it.

209
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,405
或者不用
Or not.

210
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,246
那是什么感觉？
What's it like?

211
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,623
四年前，委员会给我…
Four years ago, this committee gave me...

212
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,903
…一个很有挑战性的任务…
...a very specific and challenging task...

213
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,800
…要将人同步量子化…
...to phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync...

214
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,974
…变为隐形状态…
...with the visible universe...

215
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,607
…再将他无后遗症的安全还原
...and return him safely with no aftereffects.

216
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,537
我们发现要让动物隐形简单
We found that sending them to never-never land was easy.

217
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,580
还原他们才是最难的
It's the getting them back that's hard.

218
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,126
DNA链会衰退？
Primary DNA strands decaying on you?

219
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,460
细胞链也不稳定
Along with cellular bond instability.

220
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,633
这些问题怎么解决？
How have you solved the problem?

221
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,063
我没解决
I haven't.

222
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,733
但很接近了
But we're close.

223
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,506
我们还需要些时间
We just need more time.

224
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,353
从你大一走进教室那一刻起…
Ever since you walked in my class your freshman year...

225
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,326
…我就知道你与众不同
...I knew you were different.

226
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,592
这些年，你的表现更令人激赏
Over the years, your genius has been most impressive.

227
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,598
谢谢，克拉玛博士
Thank you, Dr. Kramer.

228
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,263
先别谢我
Well, don't thank me yet.

229
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,474
本委员会给了你很特别的自由空间
This committee has given you remarkable leeway.

230
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:10,307
我们忍耐了你的怪僻 以及让你保有隐私权的需要
We've tolerated your eccentricities, as well as your need for privacy.

231
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:14,815
而我向你保证 我们的耐性已耗尽
And I assure you, our patience is running out.

232
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,386
如果你不能尽快提出成果…
If we don't get results and get them soon...

233
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,654
…你就再也不能让我激赏了
...your genius will cease to impress me.

234
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,025
如果你无法成功…
And if you can't make it work...

235
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,762
…我也会找到另一个 赛巴斯辛来完成
...l'll find another Sebastian Caine who can.

236
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,201
- 到底怎么回事？ - 你最好有好理由
What just happened in there? - This better be good.

237
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,235
- 我还不想让他们知道 - 你还不想？
I wasn't ready for them to know. - You weren't ready?

238
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,235
想不想不是问题 你有了结果就该跟他们报告
Being ready's not it. You have results, you report them.

239
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,137
- 我能解释吗？ - 你欺骗了五角大厦！
Can I explain? - You just lied to the Pentagon!

240
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,402
一旦他们知道我们成功了…
Once they know we've completed it...

241
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,343
…有什么可以阻止 他们接手整个计划？
...what's to stop them from taking over the project?

242
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,245
- 为什么他们要这么做？ - 因为他们不需要我们了
Why would they? - Because they won't need us.

243
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,319
但这是他们的计划啊 总有一天会发生的
But it's their project. It's gonna happen sometime.

244
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,423
那也许是他们的计划 但这是我的梦想，我的远景
It may be their project, but it's my dream, my visión.

245
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:57,219
- 你在建议什么？ - 直接进行第三阶段实验
What are you proposing? - That we go to Phase Three ourselves.

246
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,088
第三阶段实验？你疯了？
Phase Three? Are you nuts?

247
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,764
你不能直接做人体实验 要依循法令和程序
You can't jump into human testing. There's rules, procedures.

248
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,929
循规蹈矩不能创造历史 把握机会才能
You don't make history with rules. You make it by seizing the moment.

249
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,838
你想做第一个，就是这样
You wanna be the first one. That's what this is about.

250
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,814
这不是为我，是为了我们 我们说过要改变世界
This is not about me, it's about us. We said we would change the worid.

251
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,849
机会就在眼前
Now is our chance.

252
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,480
我们会赢得诺贝尔奖的.
And we'll get the Nobel Prize.

253
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,320
来吧，伙计.
Come on, buddy.

254
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,160
你知道，要是有人发现我们欺骗了他们...
You know, if somebody finds out that we bypassed advisory review...

255
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,790
- 我们就丢饭碗了. - 但如果我们成功了,没人会在乎.
...we're never gonna work again. - But if it works, no one'll care.

256
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:02,260
你怎么得到第三阶段实验许可？
How did you get clearance for Phase Three?

257
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:05,260
- 我自愿，他们批准了 - 不可能
I volunteered. They approved. - No way.

258
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,034
你开玩笑
You're kidding.

259
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:11,534
你自愿？你疯了？
You volunteered? Are you insane?

260
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:17,740
沙克就在自己身上试验疫苗 他也疯了？
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine on himself. Was he insane?

261
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:19,915
是的，我相信他是
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

262
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:21,981
妈的
Shit.

263
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:27,312
过去四周来，我们成功的 还原七只猿猴
In the past four weeks, we have brought back seven primates.

264
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:31,257
- 我想结果很清楚 - 只有你自己相信吧？
The results speak for themselves. - Or do you wanna believe that?

265
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,124
莎拉，我以为你应该很高兴 我们不会再拿动物实验
Sarah, I thought you'd be happy. We are giving the animals a break.

266
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:44,063
进度太快是不对的科学态度 不管谁是那只实验猪
Moving this fast is bad science, no matter who the guinea pig is.

267
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,777
- 我不相信委员会会批准 - 我觉得很酷
I can't believe they approved this. - I think it's fucking cool.

268
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,170
你当然是啦
You would.

269
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:53,415
如果要走下一步 这就是合理的步骤
If we're to move forward, this is the next logical step.

270
00:26:55,584 --> 00:27:00,487
我隐形三天后再还原
L'll stay shifted for three days and then we'll perform a quantum reversión.

271
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,621
好耶
Fuck, yes.

272
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,848
我能信赖你们吗？
Can I count on your best work?

273
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:09,987
很好
Good.

274
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,638
我们怎会让他说服我们的？
How did we let him talk us into this?

275
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,011
待会再谈好吗？
Can we talk about it later?

276
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:26,272
我正想跟你做爱
I'm trying to make love to you.

277
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:29,248
我们这是拿职业生涯去冒险
We're risking our professional lives here.

278
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,112
是的，麦特，我知道
Yes, Matt, I realize.

279
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:35,054
那我们为何会同意？
Then why did we agree to it?

280
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,230
因为我们是笨蛋
Because we're suckers.

281
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,400
因为当你到达地图的边缘时...
And because sometimes when you get to the edge of the map...

282
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,570
很想继续航行看看前面到底是什么
...you have to keep sailing to see what's out there.

283
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:53,058
也许我们都知道赛巴斯辛能成功
And maybe because we both know that Sebastian can pull it off.

284
00:27:56,602 --> 00:28:00,766
- 问你另一个问题 - 是关于谁要在上面吗？
Let me ask another question. - Is it about who's gonna be on top?

285
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,043
你想念跟他在一起吗？
Ever miss being with him?

286
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:11,876
你干嘛问这个？
Why do you ask that?

287
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:14,312
因为他的标准太高
Because he sets the bar pretty high.

288
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:18,446
跟你说个秘密
Let me tell you a little secret.

289
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:24,158
赛巴斯辛的想法比他本人…
The concept of Sebastian is much more appealing...

290
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:26,455
…更吸引人
...than Sebastian himself.

291
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,320
而你...
Whereas you...

292
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,950
你系统...
You're methodical...

293
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,750
...精确...
...precise...

294
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,040
...十分小心.
...and very, very thorough.

295
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,840
还有...
And besides...

296
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
...和你做舒服多了.
...you fit better.

297
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:55,495
我们准备好了
We're ready for you.

298
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,276
回头见了
See you later.

299
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,980
- 现在改变主意还来得及 - 我以为我该是最紧张的
It's not too late to stop. - I thought I was the nervous one.

300
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:12,280
- 我们还有很多需要克服的 - 听过超人和女超人故事吗？
We have a lot riding on this. Hear about Superman and Wonder Woman?

301
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:14,581
- 正经一点吧 - 这故事超好笑
Stop clowning around. - It's a good one.

302
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:16,951
超人有天飞过市中心
Superman is flying over Metropolis.

303
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,457
他很饥渴，找遍每个屋顶
He's horny and checking out the rooftops.

304
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:24,099
他看到女超人在 正义联盟屋顶做日光浴
He sees Wonder Woman sunning on the roof of the Justice League.

305
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,964
她裸身躺著，双脚大张 这不是等人上吗？
She's lying there buck-naked, spread- eagle, wanting to be fucked, right?

306
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:30,695
超人就对他自己说：
Superman says to himself:

307
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:33,271
“我一定要上她”
'I gotta get myself some Wonder pussy.'

308
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:37,377
他想他能飞下去来个闪电攻击…
Then he realizes that he could fly down, do a little fast pumping...

309
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:40,582
…在她察觉之前就闪人 因为他是超人
...and be gone before she knew, since he's Superman.

310
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,717
他比子弹还快
Faster than a speeding bullet.

311
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:46,614
超人冲下去，给她闪电一发 而她连他都没看清楚
He swoops down, he fucks her so quick, she doesn't even see him.

312
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:51,351
女超人坐起来说 “搞什么鬼啊？”
Wonder Woman sits up, says, 'What the fuck was that?'

313
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,319
隐形人就说： 我不知道…
And the Invisible Man says, 'I don't know...

314
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:57,556
…不过我的屁眼痛毙了
...but my asshole is killing me.'

315
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:02,669
好笑吧？拜托，很好笑的
That's funny, right? Come on, guys. That's funny.

316
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:23,258
小姐们，拜托，这是科学
Ladies, please. This is science.

317
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,026
开始静脉注射
Starting IV drip.

318
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:38,602
- 你感觉如何？ - 有点紧张
Okay, how are you feeling? - I'm a little tense.

319
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:42,242
脉搏88，血压140/95 有点高
Pulse 88. BP 140l95. It's a bit elevated.

320
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,106
不知为何
I wonder why.

321
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:46,306
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

322
00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:48,181
确定
Positive.

323
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,383
- 上面好了吗？ - 好了
We ready up in heaven? - Ready.

324
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,278
开始录影
Mary's rolling.

325
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:57,617
希望这不是部惊悚片，开始
I just hope we're not making a snuff film. Rolling.

326
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,388
要是这样，我要他的保时捷
If it is, I got dibs on his Porsche.

327
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:02,689
珍妮丝，你怎能这样说？
Janice, how can you say that?

328
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,123
抱歉
Sorry.

329
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,326
保时捷是我的
Porsche is mine.

330
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:10,270
实验对象：男性 38岁，重166磅
Subject male, age 38, weight 166 pounds.

331
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,241
配方液已辐射处理
Serum's irradiated.

332
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,970
- 这最好能成 - 一定会成
This better work. - It will.

333
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:21,682
- 是吗？ - 想打赌吗？
Oh, yeah? - You wanna bet on it?

334
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,409
我要是赢了，也拿不到赌金 所以算了
If I win, you won't be around to pay off, so, no.

335
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:25,743
准备好了？
Are you ready?

336
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:29,723
我自己来 要是出错，你不用负责
L'll do it. So if anything goes wrong, you can't be blamed.

337
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:33,452
好吧
All right.

338
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,628
有遗言吗？
Any last words?

339
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:43,065
要是我死了，假装我说过睿智的话
Yeah. If I die, pretend I said something deep and clever.

340
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:14,102
注射时间18点23分
Injection administered at 1823.

341
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:19,638
- 有何感觉？ - 还没有
Are you feeling anything? - Nothing so far.

342
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:25,342
- 生命迹象稳定 - 没有变化
Vitals are stable. - Nothing's happening.

343
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:28,142
人类DNA可能要等久一点
Human DNA structure may take more time.

344
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:29,943
- 你检试过，对吗？ - 是的
You pulsed it right? - Yes.

345
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,780
重新检验辐射程序 不可能没反应
Recheck the radiation. It can't be non-reactive.

346
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,549
生物电流活动正常
No change in bioelectric activity.

347
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:36,959
该死！
Goddamn it!

348
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,688
- 我再将程序重覆一次，好吗？ - 等等
L'll repeat the protocol, okay? - Wait.

349
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:45,492
我有感觉了
I'm starting to feel something.

350
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:49,127
我的手…
It's my arm. It's...

351
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,235
它变热了
It's getting warm.

352
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:56,069
开始有刺痛感
Okay, it's starting to tingle.

353
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,581
刺痛转移到背部
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.

354
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,148
开始了
Here we go.

355
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:21,002
妈的！好痛
Shit! It hurts.

356
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:23,505
我快被扯碎了
It's tearing me.

357
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:27,564
心跳剧增，脉搏110
Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 110. 130.

358
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,914
天啊，没想到这么痛
Christ, didn't think it would hurt so much.

359
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,444
法兰科，数据！
Frank, readouts!

360
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:41,747
脑波活动剧烈 他濒临崩溃
Brain waves are spiking. He's on the verge of a seizure.

361
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:48,925
脉搏165-170 血压180/110
Pulse is 165, 170. Blood pressure 180 over 110.

362
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:51,122
赛巴斯辛，你听得见吗？
Sebastian, can you hear me? Sebastian?

363
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,635
- 他心脏会炸开！ - 电击器准备！
His heart'll blow out! - Standby paddles!

364
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,206
来了
Coming in.

365
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:09,111
读数显示，他快要隐形了
Subcellular quantum. He's shifting.

366
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,477
生物电流读数危险
Bioelectric in the red.

367
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,713
等等
Wait.

368
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:15,556
他隐形了
He's going.

369
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,157
脉搏180
Pulse is 180.

370

371
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:42,480
天啊
Holy shit.

372
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:52,288
脉搏下降170，160，150
Pulse is dropping. 170, 160, 150.

373
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:16,049
18点26分到达隐形状态
Bio-quantum phase-shift occurred at 1826.

374
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,644
他还好吧？
Is he okay?

375
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:22,290
他受刺激过度，昏过去了
Yeah, he's in bioelectric shock. Passed out from the trauma.

376
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:23,856
生命迹象回复正常？
Vitals returning to normal?

377
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,823
脉搏110，下降中 血压130/75
Pulse 110, dropping. Blood pressure's 130l75.

有东西跟后代子孙说了
Something to tell the grandkids.

380
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,307
脉搏稳定在85
Pulse steady at 85.

381
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:47,574
你成功了，你是第一个
You did it. You're the first.

382
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:25,176
没事
It's okay. It's okay.

383
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,582
你睡着了
You nodded off.

384
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:31,891
- 他的呼吸声有催眠作用 - 是的
His breathing's hypnotic. - Yeah.

385
00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:34,723
过了多久了？
How long has it been?

386
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:36,758
17小时
Seventeen hours.

387
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:40,898
我们所获得的资料 足供两辈子来研究
And we already have enough data for two lifetimes of research.

388
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,861
欢迎来到美丽新世界，琳
It's a brave new worid, Lin.

389
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:50,538
我一直看著那个洞 心想他是否真的在那里
I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there.

390
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,406
- 你看到了吗？ - 你听得见吗？
Did you see that? - Sebastian, can you hear me?

391
00:36:54,783 --> 00:36:58,617
天啊！灯光！快把灯关掉！
Christ! The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights!

392
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,824
我无法闭上眼睛
I can't close my eyes.

393
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:06,618
你可以，但你眼皮变透明了
You can, but your eyelids are transparent.

394
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:11,232
真怪 我感觉没变，但我却不在了
It's weird. I feel the same, but I'm not here.

395
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,659
你在的
You're here.

396
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:25,773
我在这里
Sebastian? - I'm right here.

397
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,939
- 哪里？ - 镜子前面
Where? - At the mirror.

398
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:30,413
看我自己
Looking at myself.

399
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:36,523
或者，不是看我自己
Or, rather, not looking at myself.

400
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:42,688
他情况如何？
Hey, how's he doing?

401
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,698
你为何不问赛巴斯辛？
Why don't you ask Sebastian?

402
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:49,001
- 你有何感觉？ - 就各方面而言，还不算太坏
How do you feel? - Oh, not too bad, considering.

403
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:55,223
不知道他在哪里
Just wanna set the mood.

404
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,978
灯光的关系，他眼皮是透明的
It's the light. His eyelids are transparent.

405
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,275
变成鬼是什么样子？
So, what's it like being a ghost?

406
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,700
鬼是死的,我是活的.
Ghosts are dead. I'm very much alive.

407
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,280
得了,别发神经.
Come on, don't be a dick.

408
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,530
对不起,我本性使然.
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

409
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,200
好,我感觉我们像是在玩马可波罗游戏.
Okay, now I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

410
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,540
我想知道他现在在哪?
I wonder where he is now.

411
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:21,360
看来实验并未改变你的个性
Well, I see the procedure's not changed your personality.

412
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:25,371
- 他刚掠过我身边 - 别担心，我来找他
He just brushed by me. - No worries, I'm on it.

413
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,534
- 看到什么没有？ - 他在哪？
Do you see anything? - Where is he?

414
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,211
看到他了？
You got him?

415
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,180
Sebastian?

416
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:36,806
找到了，老大
Got you, chief.

417
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,449
你们真是无趣
You guys have no sense of fun.

418
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,782
我的天啊
Shit. Oh, my God.

419
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,020
我安排随时有人值班待命 以备你有任何需要
L've arranged for one of us to be here 24l7, if you need anything.

420
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:51,288
在你隐形期间，全员戒备 一有状况，我们会在--
The team's gonna be on alpha-call alert, so we can be here within...

421
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:55,525
半小时内到，我知道 那程序是我写的，记得吗？
Thirty minutes. I know. I wrote the procedure, remember?

422
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:59,797
我只是想让你安心 热感应监视摄影机已架好
I was reassuring you. There's a thermal camera for observation.

423
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,304
- 她就喜欢这样，对吧？ - 什么？
She likes this, doesn't she? - What?

424
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,068
- 主导一切 - 是啊，她爱死了
Being in charge. - Oh, yeah. She loves it.

425
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,903
也该是换人发号施令的时候了
It's about time the shoe was on the other foot.

426
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,176
请记住
Well, just remember.

427
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,545
这还是我的计划
It's still my project.

428
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,792
- 你确定你要值大夜？ - 我反正也没社交生活
You okay taking the late shift? - It's not like I have a social life.

429
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,767
我知道，工作狂就是这样
I know. The workaholic's curse.

430
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:32,699
卡特6点会来换班
Carter's gonna be in by 6 to spell you.

431
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,067
我8点到，有事就通知我
I'm here at 8. Call me if you need to.

432
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,168
我不会有事，回去休息吧
L'll be fine. Get some sleep.

433
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:39,209
- 好，拜 - 拜
Okay. Bye. - Bye.

434
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,190
Sarah?

435
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:46,169
你醒着吗？
Are you awake?

436
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,188
赛巴斯辛？
Sebastian?

437
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,397
你在这里吗？
Are you in here?

438
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,309
我知道你在
I know you're in here.

439
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,270
我再看监视器的时候,他回到床上了.
Then when I checked the monitor again, he's back in the bed.

440
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,360
当我问他昨晚做什么了 他说他只是去喝咖啡来.
When I ask him where he'd been, he said he's getting coffee.

441
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,110
- 那你怎么打电话找我? - 因为我不确定,我现在都不确定
Why didn't you call me? - Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

442
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,200
我想,我也可能在做梦 但我还是要告诉你们
I mean, I could have been dreaming. I just thought I should tell someone.

443
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,990
那你打算怎么做?
What do you wanna do?

444
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,330
我不知道,我不相信他会做那种下流事
I don't know. I have a tough time believing he'd be that crude.

445
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,500
我觉得我好傻.
I feel so stupid.

446
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,920
那我们为什么不去找他谈? 看他怎么说...
Why don't I talk to him? L'll see what he says...

447
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,130
不,别.
No, don't.

448
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,550
要知道,可能不是真的. 我不该提这个.
You know, it's probably nothing. I shouldn't have mentioned it.

449
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:38,238
- 第一晚情况如何？ - 睡不着
So how was your first night? - Restless.

450
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:40,743
闭不上眼睛很难睡着
Hard to sleep without closing your eyes.

451
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:42,006
你都做些什么？
What'd you do?

452
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:45,242
起来几次，到处走走
Got up a couple of times. Walked around.

453
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:47,682
莎拉说你昨晚不在房间里
Sarah mentioned you weren't in your room.

454
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:49,411
我是去倒杯咖啡喝
I got a cup of coffee.

455
00:42:49,723 --> 00:42:53,386
以后也许你能通知值班者 你去哪里…
In the future, you'll wanna tell the on-call where you're going...

456
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,620
…以免你出了什么事
...just in case something happens to you.

457
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:58,922
感谢你关心，这不是什么问题
I'm touched by your concern, but it's not a problem.

458
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:01,201
希望别造成问题
We don't want it to become one.

459
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:04,203
一切正常
Everything's normal.

460
00:43:05,906 --> 00:43:07,771
把这些拿掉吧
All right, let's get these off.

461
00:43:11,311 --> 00:43:12,573
你还好吧？
You okay?

462
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,102
很好，怎么了？
Yeah. Why?

463
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:16,613
你似乎有点紧张
You seem a little nervous.

464
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,913
不，我很好
No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:26,920
你在看我吗？
Are you looking at me?

466
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:29,055
没有
No.

467
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:31,121
为什么？
Why?

468
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:34,956
没什么
No reason.

469
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:48,105
- 那个客人怎样？ - 这砘镎疑衔遥他说：
What was the clientele like? - This guy comes up to me and says:

470
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:52,081
“我喜欢女人跟喜欢咖啡一样” 现在还有人说这种台词？
'I like my women like my coffee.' People still use that line?

471
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:55,153
- 也许他是说你又冷又苦 - 自以为很好笑
Maybe he meant cold and bitter. - Very funny.

472
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:58,118
我要去上厕所，别让卡特偷吃
I gotta take a leak. Keep Carter away from my food.

473
00:43:58,325 --> 00:44:01,192
- 我尽量，但我不保证 - 好
L'll try, but I can't promise. - All right.

474
00:44:41,168 --> 00:44:43,227
一开始很怪，但后来就好了
It'd be freaky, but it'd settle down.

475
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,065
如果你是隐形人，你会怎么做？
No, what would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?

476
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,835
这整件事都让我反感 我没戴热视镜就不敢上厕所
It gives me the creeps. I can't take a piss without wearing my thermals.

477
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,980
- 好像每个人都想看 - 我怎么知道？
Like anyone wants to see that. - How do I know?

478
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:58,375
你是问我们还是赛巴斯辛的做法？
Are you asking what we'd do or what Sebastian would do?

479
00:44:58,652 --> 00:44:59,482
有何不同？
The difference?

480
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,211
赛巴斯辛的本性和别人的不同
There's human nature, then there's Sebastian.

481
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:04,423
他老爱说他是上帝
He's always joking that he's God.

482
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:07,489
想想他要是能为所欲为的话
Imagine what he'd do if left to his own devices.

483
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:08,888
真可怕的想法
Scary thought.

484
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:11,428
- 还好，一切都快结束了 - 感谢上帝
Thankfully, it's almost over. - Hallelujah.

485
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:14,828
这只是开始，你认为赛巴斯辛坏？
It's just beginning. You think Sebastian's bad?

486
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:17,935
假使是军队用上这技术会如何？
Lmagine if the military gets their hands on this.

487
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,867
最好是我们的军队用就好
Better our military than someone else's.

488
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:09,556
赛巴斯辛，该死
Sebastian, goddamn it.

489
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,390
你根本不知道这有多好玩 你真该试试
You have no idea how much fun this is. You should try it.

490
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:17,021
我会有机会的
I'm sure l'll have my chance.

491
00:46:22,436 --> 00:46:24,495
放轻松
Hey, relax.

492
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:29,004
这是我最后一晚 我想我们可以来个实验
It's my last night, so I thought we'd try one more experiment.

493
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:35,438
猜猜看这是什么？
Can you guess what this is?

494
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:37,010
什么？
What?

495
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:44,017
感觉如何？
How did it feel?

496
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:47,425
有点太熟悉了
A little too familiar.

497
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,958
想知道跟隐形人做爱的感觉吗？
Wanna know what it's like to make love to an invisible man?

498
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:00,701
- 它就像以前一样 - 什么意思？
It'd just be like old times. - What do you mean?

499
00:47:00,974 --> 00:47:02,566
老是感觉不到你的存在
You were never there.

500
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,044
我现在就在这里
Well, I'm here now.

501
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:08,306
我们曾经谈过，记得吗？
We talked about this once, remember?

502
00:47:08,682 --> 00:47:09,808
谈什么？
What?

503
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:12,483
你想知道有何不同
You wondered if you'd know the difference.

504
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:16,317
赛巴斯辛，我知道有何不同
Sebastian, I do know the difference.

505
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:20,554
不是我看不到，是我感觉不到
It's not what I don't see. It's what I don't feel.

506
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:23,986
休息吧
Get some rest.

507
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:25,889
明天是个大日子
Got a big day tomorrow.

508
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:35,403
实验目标：凯恩博士

513
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:51,385
- 你准备好了吗？ - 还没完全
Are you ready? - Not really.

514
00:47:53,226 --> 00:47:55,091
我才正开始享受呢
I was starting to enjoy myself.

515
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,060
真可惜
Well, tough.

516
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:01,694
一分钟后见
We'll see you in a minute, my friend.

517
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:06,595
注射时间早上9点28分
Injection occurred at 0928.

518
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:19,517
你有什么感觉？
What are you feeling?

519
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,384
情况不对
Something's not right.

520
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:31,119
心跳增高，法兰克
Heartbeat elevated. Frank.

521
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:32,921
隐形读数不规则
Shift indicators are erratic.

522
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:36,534
- 生物电流量跳动 - 检查辐射量，电击器
Bioelectric's jumping. - Check radiation. Crash cart.

523
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:39,800
怎么回事？
What?

524
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:41,597
发生什么事？
What's happening?

525
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:44,038
我无法呼吸
I can't breathe.

526
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:47,077
- 检查气管 - 他停止呼吸了，快插管
Check his airway. - His lungs are seized. Intubate.

527
00:48:50,817 --> 00:48:52,045
卡特！

528
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:57,483
快插管！
Tube him!

529
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,190
Sebastian.

530
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,279
- 他正要进入转换阶段 - 把他搬上台
He's going into phase-shift. - Get him on the table.

531
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:22,137
没讯号了
We lost our signals.

532
00:49:22,983 --> 00:49:25,110
该死！
Goddamn!

533
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:28,679
- 准备静脉注射 - 我在弄
Get me an IV of AG-7. - I'm on it.

534
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:34,482
没有脉搏
No pulse.

535
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:36,853

00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,602
- 我不准你死 - 量到脉搏了
Don't you fucking die on me. - I'm getting a pulse.

539
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:57,775
- 赛巴斯辛，你听得见吗？ - 我想他休克了
Sebastian, can you hear me? - He's going into shock.

540
00:50:04,224 --> 00:50:05,714
天啊
Jesus.

541
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,000
Hi.

542
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:14,467
我想我们失败了
So I guess it didn't work.

543
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:15,965
对
No.

544
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:20,033
你看来很担心，一定很糟糕
You look worried. Must've been bad.

545
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:23,938
你差点死掉
You almost died.

546
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:26,572
置之于死地而后生嘛
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger.

547
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,817
是啊，然后我们的前途完了 要怎么跟克拉玛说呢？
Yeah, and ends our careers. What are we gonna tell Kramer?

548
00:50:32,752 --> 00:50:34,219
不用说
Nothing.

549
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:36,588
他还不需要知道
He doesn't need to know yet.

550
00:50:37,557 --> 00:50:41,391
- 不能继续骗其他人了 - 我们别无选择
We can't keep lying to the others. - We don't have a choice.

551
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,289
要是我继续像这样…
If I'm gonna be stuck like this for a while...

552
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:46,658
…我们就得做些调整
...we'll have to make a few adjustments.

553
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:52,830
好了
Done.

554
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:57,565
- 打开 - 这儿
Open. - Here.

555
00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:23,899
好，抬头
Okay, lift.

556
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:27,172
卡特，拿风扇来
Carter, get the fan.

557
00:51:41,488 --> 00:51:43,149
好，别动
Okay, don't move.

558
00:51:55,802 --> 00:51:56,632
别动
Don't move.

559
00:52:02,442 --> 00:52:04,137
谢谢，这样好多了
Thanks. That's better.

560
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,440
拿去
Here you go.

561
00:52:09,683 --> 00:52:12,618
- 这算是一大改进 - 你看来很像人了
It's an improvement. - You'd almost pass for human.

562
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:16,118
- 他以前就不像 - 至少你们可以跟一张脸说话了
He couldn't before. - You have a face you can talk to now.

563
00:52:16,423 --> 00:52:18,914
也可以在普通灯光下工作
We can all work in normal light again.

564
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:23,289
让我们看看我们是否无法 找出问题的症结
Let's see if we can't try to figure out what went wrong.

565
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:25,930
而且在他开始咬人以前
Before he starts biting people too.

566
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,694
“不稳定”


567
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:34,106
- 该死！ - 什么？
Goddamn it! - What?

568
00:52:34,374 --> 00:52:35,705
又无法凝聚
I lost cohesión again.

569
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:38,444
- 快完成了吗？ - 不
Are you any closer? - No.

570
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:41,673
我就是找不出B和C
You know, I can't figure out the B and C of it.

571
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:43,342
B和C？
The B and C?

572
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:49,187
小学五年级老师跟我说 天才能从A就到D…
My 5th grade teacher told me that genius is getting from A to D...

573
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:51,789
…不需要经过B和C
...without having to go through B and C.

574
00:52:52,158 --> 00:52:53,785
赛巴斯辛就行
Sebastian can do that.

575
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:57,555
但我就需要找到B和C
But me, I gotta have the B and C.

576
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,367
等等，赛巴斯辛，就快好了
Hold on, Sebastian. We're almost there.

577
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:07,033
快点，快让开！
Come on, guys. Out of the way!

578
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:21,745
我无法再撑下去了
I can't take much more testing.

579
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:23,250
我了解这有多不好过
I know how hard it is.

580
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,720
鬼扯，你什么都不了解
Bullshit. You don't know anything.

581
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:27,755
我们都不好过
This isn't easy for any of us.

582
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:31,191
去你的，麦特！你才好过呢
Fuck you, Matt! It is easy for you.

583
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:34,629
我应该只有隐形三天
I was to be in phase-shift for three days.

584
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:37,063
已经十天了，知道吗？！
It's been 10 fucking days, all right?!

585
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:41,534
十天的组织实验 辐射实验和那些鬼针头！
Ten days of tissue tests, radiation tests and your fucking needles!

586
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:45,401
我再也受不了了
I can't fucking take it anymore.

587
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:48,112
- 我是说--  - 去你的！
What I meant was... - Fuck what you meant!

588
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:49,707
你别想--
And don't ever...

589
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,214
你别想跟我说你有多不好受
Don't ever tell me how hard you have it.

590
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,280
好了,赛巴斯辛, 你累了需要休息.
Come on, Sebastian, you're tired and you need to rest.

591
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,320
我不愿在这里再熬一晚上.
I can't believe I gotta spend another night in this place.

592
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,660
我们正在尽全力解决.
We're trying to do everything we can.

593
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,790
是,但还不够.
Yeah, that's not enough.

594
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,560
辣妹来了
There she is.

595
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:03,659
我要吸吮你的乳头
L'd suck the tits right off of you.

596
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,763
凯恩博士，有事吗？
Hey. Dr. Caine, what's going on?

597
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,370
我是来告诉你，我要出去一下
Just stopped by to let you know I'm going out for a while.

598
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:13,604
等等，出去？ 等一等，凯恩博士
Wait. Going out? Hold it a second. Dr. Caine.

599
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,430
Sebastian.

600
00:55:16,845 --> 00:55:18,005
凯恩博士
Dr. Caine.

601
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:19,612
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

602
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:21,873
我再不出去就要发疯了
If I don't get out, l'll go nuts.

603
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:24,517
- 但你不可以离开这建筑 - 为什么？
You can't leave the compound. - Why not?

604
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,448
- 这是规定 - 那是我规定的，我刚改了
It's the rule. - It's my rule, I just changed it.

605
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,022
- 授权码 - 凯恩0027
Authorization. - Caine 0027.

606
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,453
- 确认 - 你不能就这样更改规定
Confirmed. - You can't just change it.

607
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:36,062
我不能在这垃圾堆呆一辈子！
I'm not gonna spend my life in this godforsaken dump!

608
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,960
我要出去！几小时就回来！
I'm going out! Be back in a couple of hours!

609
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,863
该死！
Oh, shit!

610
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:52,204
- 喂？ - 我是卡特，出乱子了
Hello? - It's Carter. We got a problem.

611
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:12,360
- 你好吗？艾德 - 嗨，博士
How's it going, Ed? - Hey, doc.

612
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:17,438
- 好久不见了 - 你知道我就是这样
I haven't seen you in a while. - You know how it is sometimes.

613
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:18,638
忙著工作
Work, work, work.

614
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:22,333
我已经开始担心 你的车子都没动过
I was beginning to worry because your car hadn't moved.

615
00:56:22,611 --> 00:56:24,602
谢了，艾德
Thanks a lot, Ed.

616
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,347
但一切都很好
But everything's cool.

617
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:08,056
你看、你看
Hey, look. Look.

618
00:57:08,257 --> 00:57:11,590
- 你看他 - 他好怪
Look at that. - Man, he's weird.

619
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:14,695
- 天啊 - 妈咪！妈咪！
Oh, my God. - Mommy! Mommy!

620
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,262
- 妈咪！妈咪！ - 怎么了？
Mommy! Mommy! - What?

621
00:57:18,267 --> 00:57:19,495
- 怎么了？ - 你看，有鬼
What? - Look, it's a ghost.

622
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:23,101
- 别傻了 - 妈，真的是鬼
Don't be ridiculous. - Mom, it's a ghost.

623
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:27,803
实验室见，我去他家看看
L'll meet you at the lab. L'll go by his place just in case.

624
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:29,235
实验室见
L'll see you there.

625
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:31,143
他可能在这里
He could be here.

626
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:34,672
可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere.

627
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,500
妈的
Shit.

628
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,477
想都别想
Don't even think about it.

629
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:53,751
谁会知道呢？
Who's gonna know?

630
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:58,750
赛巴斯辛?
Sebastian?

631
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,130
赛巴斯辛?
Sebastian?

632
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:07,986
该死


633
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,980
Oh, shit.

634
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:42,285
麦特，是我，他回来过
Matt, it's me. He was here.

635
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:44,825
不，他把头套拿掉了
No, he took his mask off.

636
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,591
他一定在外面 我不知道他去哪了
He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went.

637
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,665
我要回实验室了
I'm coming back to the lab.

638
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,703
怎么找？怎么去找？ 我根本看不见他
How? How am I supposed to do that? I can't fucking see him.

639
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,717
你说你要我们对他开枪？ 我参一脚
You say you want us to shoot him? I'm in.

640
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:43,547
他是凯恩博士，不是猴子 我们反应过度了吧？
It's not a monkey, it's Dr. Caine. Aren't we overreacting here?

641
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:47,087
我才不管，他对外面有危险性
I don't give a rat's ass if we are. Out there, he's at risk.

642
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:51,056
要是他被人发现，计划就完了
If someone finds out what he is, the whole program is destroyed.

643
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:54,824
别紧张，没有人会发现的
Jeez, relax. Nobody's gonna find out.

644
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,058
- 我还可以射他吗？ - 你去哪了？
Can I still shoot him? - Where have you been?

645
01:03:57,569 --> 01:03:58,627
我跟卡特说了
I told Carter.

646
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:02,430
我快疯了，我回家拿点东西
I was getting stir-crazy. I went home to pick up stuff.

647
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,902
鬼扯
Bullshit.

648
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:05,376
我去过你家
I went to your apartment.

649
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:08,045
你不只是拿点东西
You did more than 'pick up stuff.'

650
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:11,875
- 你在说些什么？ - 你怎能这样？
What are you talking about? - You, of all people. How could you?

651
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:13,949
你在我家看到了什么？
What did you see in my apartment?

652
01:04:14,186 --> 01:04:16,051
你的脸、衣服
I saw your face, your clothes.

653
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:19,246
你为何要到外面去？
Sebastian, in public. Why'd you have to go out in public?

654
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:23,690
我还是计划领导人 我有决定权
I'm still project leader. It's my decisión to make.

655
01:04:24,196 --> 01:04:27,427
没错，你有决定权
You're right. It's your decisión.

656
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:31,967
但你要是再离开，我发誓 我一定直接报告委员会
But if you leave again, I swear l'll go straight to the committee.

657
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:35,236
拿你的生涯冒险？
Throw your career away?

658
01:04:35,874 --> 01:04:37,398
不像吧
Not likely.

659
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:40,135
试试看吧
Try me.

660
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,747
就这样？
So that's it, huh?

661
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:52,055
我成了真正的白老鼠
I'm officially a fucking lab rat.

662
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:54,589
你自愿的，你早知到后果
You volunteered. You knew the consequences.

663
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:59,089
下回清点存货时 弄个转轮给我跑吧
Next time you do inventory, get me an exercise wheel.

664
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:00,764
是，当然
Yeah, sure.

665
01:05:02,267 --> 01:05:04,326
大家收拾好，回家吧
Let's pack it up and go home.

666
01:05:05,137 --> 01:05:08,595
- 转轮？他真的想要？ - 你想呢？
Exercise wheel? Was he serious? - What do you think?

667
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:13,444
委员会知道我们在做什么吧？
The committee knows what we've done, don't they?

668
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:18,747
- 该死，琳！ - 把他还原就没关系了
Shit, Lin! - Won't matter if we can get him back.

669
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,613
- 我不相信你那么做！ - 你有否认的权利，因你不知道
I can't believe you did that! - You have deniability, you didn't know.

670
01:05:23,522 --> 01:05:26,753
我只求你别背叛我们
All I ask is please, please don't fuck us.

671
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:35,262
- 她会说出去吗？ - 不，她涉入太深了
Think she'll say anything? - No, she's in too far.

672
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,263
- 我不担心她 - 赛巴斯辛
She doesn't worry me. - Sebastian.

673
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:41,963
他比动物们隐形的更久 那可能影响他的神智
He's been gone longer than the animals. It might affect his mind.

674
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:43,766
万一他神智已经起变化了呢？
What if it already has?

675
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:48,339
别动
Hold still.

676
01:05:53,318 --> 01:05:54,307
很好
Good.

677
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:58,982
- 那是什么感觉？ - 什么意思？
So, what was it like? - What do you mean?

678
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:03,490
- 你到外面世界去的时候 - 我只是到处走走而已
When you were out in the worid. - I just walked around. You know.

679
01:06:03,695 --> 01:06:06,687
你只是到处走走而已 拜托，还有别的吧？
You just walked around. Come on, there's more, right?

680
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:08,362
比方说呢？
Like what?

681
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:10,893
要是我…
Man, if it was me...

682
01:06:11,203 --> 01:06:14,001
…我会开人的玩笑、恶作剧
...l'd be fucking with people, whispering in ears.

683
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:17,503
到内衣店逛，我会为所欲为
L'd be hanging out at Victoria's Secret. L'd be the king.

684
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:23,006
太孩子气了吧？
Childish, don't you think?

685
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:24,539
不
No.

686
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:28,852
那时很晚，我又没出去多久
Well, it was late. I wasn't out for very long.

687
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:30,881
你有去找人吗？
Did you see anybody?

688
01:06:31,223 --> 01:06:33,088
有一个女孩
There was this one girl.

689
01:06:34,726 --> 01:06:36,694
- 你没戏弄她？ - 没有
Did you mess with her? - No.

690
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:42,223
也许我有点吓到她了
Well, maybe I scared her a little. - Yeah?

691
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:44,233
那感觉如何？
How'd that feel?

692
01:06:45,337 --> 01:06:46,736
我喜欢
I liked it.

693
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:50,640
真不错
Nice.

694
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:14,655
琳，记得B和C吗？ 我想我找到了
Hello. - Lin. Remember the B and C? I think I found it.

695
01:08:16,027 --> 01:08:19,292
目前最佳达成百分之55还原
55 percent reversión. That's the best we've gotten yet.

696
01:08:19,497 --> 01:08:24,332
蛋白质结构没进展 重点是辐射量的掌握
Protein structure was a dead end. Key was to manipulate radiation signature.

697
01:08:24,536 --> 01:08:27,664
百分之75、80
75 percent. 80 percent.

698
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:29,940
- 快
82. - Come on.

699
01:08:30,442 --> 01:08:31,670
成功了
We've got it.

700
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:32,934
不，变慢了
No, it's slowing.

701
01:08:33,144 --> 01:08:35,112
- 乐观点 - 是变慢了
Be an optimist. - It's slowing down.

702
01:08:35,347 --> 01:08:38,441
88、百分之92
88. 92 percent.

703
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,485
百分之93
93 percent.

704
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,511
百分之94
94 percent.

705
01:08:45,557 --> 01:08:47,218
百分之95
95 percent.

706
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:52,360
- 不！ - 该死！
No! - Shit!

707
01:08:53,498 --> 01:08:58,401
- 细胞链溃决 - 还原程度只达百分之95
Cellular bonds are collapsing. - Full quantum cascade at 95 percent.

708
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,235
了不起的突破
Some breakthrough.

709
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:03,830
要是我现此接受试验 那我早就挂了
If I were on a table right now, l'd be a steaming pile of flesh.

710
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:05,206
别引诱我
Don't tempt me.

711
01:09:05,377 --> 01:09:06,844
很接近了，这很重要
We're closer, which counts.

712
01:09:07,045 --> 01:09:10,139
接近！他刚以量子能量换取稳定？
Closer! He just traded quantum energy for stability!

713
01:09:10,382 --> 01:09:11,679
- 太可笑了 - 拜托
It's ludicrous. - Come on.

714
01:09:11,883 --> 01:09:14,943
- 你火大是因为你没想到 - 是吗，麦特？
You're pissed you didn't think of it. - Really?

715
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:18,350
百分之95？浪费我的时间！
95 percent? That's not even worth my time! For Christ sake.

716
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:21,089
混蛋
Asshole.

717
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,780
至少我们有希望了.
At least now we have some hope.

718
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,750
什么?
What?

719
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:41,563
你这白痴，你是怎么回事？
You're a fucking moron. What is your problem?

720
01:09:41,904 --> 01:09:45,135
麦特有发现，他需要你帮忙
Matt is onto something and he could use your help.

721
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:49,400
是啊，他有发现
Yeah, he's onto something, all right.

722
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:52,911
他多年来只会跟我屁股后分食
He's on my coattails. He's been riding them for years.

723
01:09:53,116 --> 01:09:56,552
少自大了，他拼命要帮你
Get off your fucking pedestal. He's trying like hell to fix you.

724
01:09:57,754 --> 01:09:58,618
是杀我吧
Or kill me.

725
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:02,281
知道最糟糕的是什么吗？
And you know what the sad part is?

726
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:05,617
我有才能，却无法运用
I have this gift and I can't even use it.

727
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:08,289
现在成了才能了
So now it's a gift.

728
01:10:08,498 --> 01:10:10,125
没错，就是才能
Damn right it's a gift.

729
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:14,793
如果你不短视 你就该让我出去探索它的
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd let me out of this cage to explore it.

730
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:20,238
如果你不那么的短视 你该跟我们一起救你自己
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd be with us trying to save your life.

731
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:23,612
救我？
My life?

732
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:25,810
我身陷牢笼
I have no fucking life.

733
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:27,582
我是个囚犯
I'm a prisoner.

734
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:32,553
- 不，你不是囚犯 - 是吗？
No, you're not a prisoner. - Oh, yeah?

735
01:10:33,156 --> 01:10:36,057
你在今晚离开时，会这么想吗？
Is that what you think when you leave here at night?

736
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:38,920
你就是当我身陷这个牢笼…
Is that how you alleviate your guilt...

737
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:44,031
…你却在家跟你男友上床…
...when I'm stuck in this shithole and you're at home...

738
01:10:44,267 --> 01:10:46,292
…来减轻罪恶感的吗？
...fucking your boyfriend?

739
01:10:50,006 --> 01:10:51,871
你最烦恼什么？
What bothers you most?

740
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:54,601
你身陷牢笼…
That you don't have a life...

741
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,841
…而我没有？
...or that I do?

742
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:38,646
法兰克，我要去实验室
Frank, I'm coming down to the lab.

743
01:11:39,088 --> 01:11:40,521
你不睡吗？
Don't you sleep?

744
01:11:40,723 --> 01:11:44,523
- 天才从不睡觉 - 好，需要我就叫一声
Da Vinci never slept. - Okay. I'm here if you need me.

745
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:40,238
我认识维金尼欧


746
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:43,418
我认识维金尼欧


747
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:45,778
不，不，不
No, no, no, no.

748
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,320
Hello.

749
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:34,065
混球…
Motherfucker...

750
01:13:34,837 --> 01:13:38,102
再晚一点，我就自己先玩了
If you were any later, I would have started without you.

751
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:53,385
天啊！
Jesus!

752
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:06,961
我没看到有人
I don't see anything.

753
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:16,005
喂？
Hello?

754
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:17,805
没有
No.

755
01:14:18,014 --> 01:14:19,504
没有，他在
No, he's here.

756
01:14:19,815 --> 01:14:22,306
我确定，我正看著他
Yes, I'm sure. I'm staring at him.

757
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:24,180
有事吗？
Is something wrong?

758
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:28,180
- 要我叫醒他吗？ - 不了，我只是问问
You want me to wake him? - No, I was just checking.

759
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:34,620
她以为她是谁？
Who the fuck does she think she is?

760
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,560
我不够好？不够好？
I'm not good enough for her? I'm not good enough?

761
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:40,165
就让他们俩看我有多行
L'll show them both how good I am.

762
01:14:40,403 --> 01:14:41,734
安静！
Quiet!

763
01:14:44,306 --> 01:14:45,933
安静！
Quiet!

764
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,172
想跟我玩吗，婊子？
You wanna fuck with me, bitch?

765
01:14:48,377 --> 01:14:51,107
知道玩弄我的下场吗？！
You know what happens when you fuck with me?!

766
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:05,988
别担心，没人会伤害你的
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna hurt you. No one.

767
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,090
- 你今天看上去气色很好 - 是的.
My, you're looking spry this morning. - Oh, yeah.

768
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,600
没有比只看别人睡觉...
There's nothing more stimulating than staying up...

769
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,100
...自己不睡更刺激的了.
...watching someone else sleep.

770
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:27,310
早上好,甘.
Good morning, gang.

771
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,770
早上好.
Good morning.

772
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,940
你好,马吉,早上好,吉里斯.
Hi, Maggie. Good morning, giris.

773
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:49,620
赛巴斯辛...
Sebastian...

774
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,040
...你醒了?
...you awake?

775
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,090
现在醒了.
I am now.

776
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,010
昨晚注意到什么动静了吗?
Notice anything unusual last night?

777
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,680
没有,怎么了?
Nope, nothing at all. Why?

778
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,640
富兰克林3号,他死了.
Franklin 3, he's dead.

779
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,640
怎样?
So?

780
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,600
所以我想你可能会听到什么.
So I thought maybe you heard something.

781
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,110
- 我在睡觉. - 整晚?
I was asleep. - Yeah, all night?

782
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,440
你是在怀疑我还是..?
Are you accusing me of something?

783
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,200
不是,只是这不正常,不是么?, 一条狗无缘死去?
No, it just doesn't make sense, does it, a dog dying just like that?

784
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,120
听着,我知道你对它们有感情, 莎拉.动物都会死亡的.
Look, I know how you feel about them, Sarah, but animals do die.

785
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:30,000
这是无法改变的事实.
It's simply a fact of life.

786
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,800
这是昨晚的.
That's all night.

787
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:47,430
- 这样他从来没离开过屋子? - 我想是的.
So he never left the room? - Yeah, I guess.

788
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,640
我不知道 他为什么要杀死一条狗呢?
I don't know. Why would he kill a dog, right?

789
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,670
什么人?
Hello?

790
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,510
赛巴斯辛?
Sebastian?

791
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,980
赛巴斯辛, 这并不好玩.
Sebastian, this is not funny.

792
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,940
- 你在这里干什么? - 他呢?
What are you doing here? - Where is he?

793
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,940
他在睡觉,怎么了?
He's asleep, why?

794
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,440
我马上就来.
L'll be right back.

795
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,910
赛巴斯辛?
Sebastian?

796
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,610
马特,启动阿尔法呼叫. 我要求所有人都来
Matt, activate alpha call. I want everyone in here now.

797
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,290
- 加班? - 挣钱不容易啊.
Working late? - That's what they pay us for.

798
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:34,388
真聪明 一直让它重覆播放相同影像
It's really pretty clever. All it does is loop the same image.

799
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:36,125
怎么办？把他抓起来？
What do we do now? Go after him?

800
01:19:36,502 --> 01:19:38,766
不，我们向委员会报告
No. We're going to the committee.

801
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:41,064
我们该跟他谈谈吧？
Shouldn't we wait and talk to him?

802
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:43,605
他空手杀了一只狗
He killed a dog with his bare hands.

803
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:46,243
- 你亲眼看到了？ - 他每晚都出去…
You were there? - He went out every night...

804
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:49,575
…完全忽视他自己 和我们的安全
...with absolute disregard for his safety and ours.

805
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:52,215
- 他做了什么？ - 我不想知道
What's he done? - I don't wanna think about it.

806
01:19:52,418 --> 01:19:55,319
- 情况多严重？ - 你们没有误导委员会
Are we in trouble? - You didn't mislead the committee.

807
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:57,514
我们会负全责
We'll take responsibility.

808
01:19:57,857 --> 01:20:00,553
- 他回来，我们该怎么办？ - 什么都不用做
What do we do when he comes back? - Nothing.

809
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,828
等委员会派守卫来
The committee will bring security.

810
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:04,827
我们明早向你们简报
We'll brief you tomorrow morning.

811
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,800
- 许可. - 麦凯 1-德尔他-835.
Authorization, please. - McKay 1-Delta-835.

812
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,810
- 你确信你要这么做? - 这是正确的.
You sure about this? - It's the right thing to do.

813
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,400
从吉文 赛巴斯辛的过去看, 他的行径并不让我惊讶.
Given Sebastian's history, this behavior doesn't surprise me.

814
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:29,900
你应说点什么.
You should've said something.

815
01:20:30,109 --> 01:20:33,772
我信任你们，以为你们能处理
I had a lot of faith in you, thinking you'd take care of this.

816
01:20:34,047 --> 01:20:36,208
我知道，我们这么做错了
I know what we did was wrong.

817
01:20:36,449 --> 01:20:41,011
错了，不足以形容此事的严重
Wrong doesn't even begin to describe it.

818
01:20:41,554 --> 01:20:43,249
先别谈这个
Let's leave it here.

819
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:50,194
我现在通知凯瑟将军紧急开会
L'll call General Caster and convene the committee.

820
01:20:50,363 --> 01:20:52,729
回实验室吧，赛巴斯辛由我们处理
You go back to the lab. We'll handle him.

821
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:54,456
我们还能做些什么？
Is there anything we can do?

822
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:57,565
准备打包回家吧
You might think about clearing out your offices.

823
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:02,032
付了那么大的代价 我们很抱歉
For what it's worth, we're both very sorry.

824
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:04,606
现在道歉有点迟了
A little late for apologies.

825
01:21:08,147 --> 01:21:09,307
霍华？
Howard?

826
01:21:10,049 --> 01:21:11,414
怎么回事？
What was that about?

827
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:14,386
- 工作上出了点事 - 多严重？
Just a screwup at work. - How bad?

828
01:21:14,587 --> 01:21:16,578
得叫醒几个将军了
Bad enough to wake a few generals.

829
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,670
老板好
Hi, boss.

830
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,640
Martha!

831
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:31,715
救命！
Help!

832
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,490
Martha!

833
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:37,690
救命！救命！
Howard? - Help! Help!

834
01:23:05,286 --> 01:23:06,344
霍华！
Howard!

835
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:32,970
- 干嘛这么紧张？ - 你吓到我了
Why so jumpy? - You just surprised me.

836
01:23:33,381 --> 01:23:35,372
不跟我道早安？
No 'good morning' for me today?

837
01:23:35,817 --> 01:23:37,444
你不爱我了
You don't love me anymore.

838
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:40,644
- 只是有点赶 - 没关系
Just in a hurry. - Well, that's okay.

839
01:23:41,322 --> 01:23:43,483
今天将会很忙的
It's gonna be a busy day.

840
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:52,197
他何时回来的？
When did he get back?

841
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:55,632
凌晨3点 整晚就一直在实验室晃
Three a.m. He's been wandering around the lab ever since.

842
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,159
克拉玛来电了吗？
Kramer called yet?

843
01:23:57,472 --> 01:24:00,168
也许他还在跟委员会开会
He's probably still meeting with the committee.

844
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:03,839
也该有消息了，我打给他
We should have heard something. I'm calling.

845
01:24:06,848 --> 01:24:08,748
喂，克拉玛博士在吗？
Hello, is Dr. Kramer there?

846
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:10,611
什么？
What?

847
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,420
天啊
Oh, my God.

848
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:19,827
- 怎么了？ - 他死了
What's wrong? - He's dead.

849
01:24:20,027 --> 01:24:22,996
- 什么？ - 他昨晚溺毙在游泳池
What? - He drowned in his pool last night.

850
01:24:29,003 --> 01:24:30,868
请接凯瑟将军
General Caster, please.

851
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,730
Hello. Hello?

852
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,243
电话没声音
There's no dial tone.

853
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:44,181
- 这里也不能打外线 - 最好上去通知警卫
There's no outside line here either. - We'd better alert security.

854
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:51,123
- 授权码 - 麦凯1D835
Authorization, please. - McKay 1-Delta-835.

855

授权码无效，拒绝请求
Authorization invalid. Request denied.

856
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:58,654
这倒新鲜，麦凯1D835
That's a first. McKay 1-Delta-835.

857
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,032

858

试试我的
Let me try mine.

859
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:06,706
坎辛顿2R159
Kensington 2-Romeo-159.

860
01:25:06,908 --> 01:25:09,900
授权码无效，拒绝请求
Authorization invalid. Request denied.

861
01:25:14,015 --> 01:25:15,573
出状况了
We've got a problem.

862
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:20,345
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

863
01:25:20,555 --> 01:25:25,390
- 要多久才会有人来找我们？ - 有可能要好几天
When will they start looking for us? - It could take a couple of days.

864
01:25:25,593 --> 01:25:28,858
- 你能侵入安全系统吗？ - 早进去了
Can you hack into the system? - Already in.

865
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:34,557
- 真烂的系统 - 是因为他太棒了
Some security system. - It's just he's extraordinary.

866
01:25:34,936 --> 01:25:37,370
看来有人比我更棒
Someone's more extraordinary than me.

867
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:40,403
- 怎么了？ - 系统没问题
What is it? - The system's fine.

868
01:25:40,608 --> 01:25:44,840
我们的密码被更动了 只有一个没动
Our access codes have been removed. There's only one left.

869
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:46,842
“凯恩赛巴斯辛”


870
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:52,476
- 我们被困住了？ - 我们去抓他
So we're trapped? - We'll get him.

871
01:25:52,687 --> 01:25:54,052
给我一支
Let me have one.

872
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,750
Sebastian?

873
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:24,951
他不在这里
He's not in here.

874
01:26:27,488 --> 01:26:30,889
赛巴斯辛，一切都结束了 告诉我们你在哪里？
Okay, Sebastian, fun's over. Tell us where you are.

875
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:34,616
抱歉，琳达，我不能让你逮捕我
Sorry, Linda, but I can't let you turn me in.

876
01:26:36,497 --> 01:26:38,089
赛巴斯辛，你在哪里？
Sebastian, where are you?

877
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:40,430
你不知道这种感觉
You have no idea what it's like.

878
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:44,968
这种力量、自由，我放不掉
The power of it, the freedom. I can't let that go.

879
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:50,137
不管你怎么做 电话、电梯…
Whatever you're planning, the phones, the elevator...

880
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:53,639
…都不会有用，他们知道你了
...it's not gonna work. They know about you.

881
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:55,009
不，他们不知道
No, they don't.

882
01:26:55,516 --> 01:26:57,814
克拉玛没来得及说就挂了
Kramer died before he could tell a soul.

883
01:26:58,352 --> 01:26:59,819
我很确定
I saw to that.

884
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:00,919
天啊
Jesus.

885
01:27:01,522 --> 01:27:06,050
- 你知道你说了什么吗？ - 一切真是太棒了…
You realize what you're saying? - It's amazing what you can do...

886
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,823
…当你来无影去无踪时
... when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore.

887
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:12,758
- 赛巴斯辛 - 再见了，琳达
Sebastian. - Goodbye, Linda.

888
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,020
Sebastian!

889
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,333
该死！
Shit!

890
01:27:18,606 --> 01:27:19,971
珍妮丝呢？
Where's Janice?

891
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:22,365
她本来跟在后面的
She was right behind us.

892
01:27:22,643 --> 01:27:24,201
糟糕
Oh, fuck.

893
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:27,446
该死，天啊！
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!

894
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,540
Janice? Janice!

895
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,380
Janice?

896
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,188
在里面
In there.

897
01:27:47,201 --> 01:27:49,499
- 镇静镖 - 是赛巴斯辛吗？
Darts. - Is it Sebastian?

898
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:59,774
天啊
Oh, my God.

899
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:00,903
该死！
Shit!

900
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:02,715
天啊
Oh, my God.

901
01:28:05,186 --> 01:28:06,483
她本来在后面
She was right behind us.

902
01:28:06,754 --> 01:28:09,154
他怎么能这么做？
How could he do this?

903
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:12,024
他疯了，真的疯了
He snapped. He fucking snapped.

904
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:13,821
更糟
It's worse.

905
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:16,695
- 他计划好的 - 你说什么？
He's thought this through. - What?

906
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:18,990
他知道我们要逮捕他
He knew we were gonna turn him in.

907
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,166
他知道他的生涯完了…
He knew that his career would be over and his only way out...

908
01:28:23,404 --> 01:28:27,534
…唯一的办法 就是别让人知道他做了什么
...is to make sure no one knows what he is or what he's done.

909
01:28:27,842 --> 01:28:31,243
- 那他得封我们的口 - 真该死！
Which means he'll get rid of us. - Goddamn you!

910
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,738
- 你本可以阻止一切的！ - 冷静点
You could've stopped this! - Back off.

911
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:36,041
- 你害惨了我们！ - 闭嘴！
You risked our lives! - Shut up!

912
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,343
别叫她闭嘴！她说的对！
Don't tell her to shut up! She's right!

913
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:42,055
我才不管她对不对！ 我也不管这是谁的错！
I don't care if she's right! I don't care whose fault this is!

914
01:28:42,423 --> 01:28:44,857
我只想知道现在该怎么办？
I just wanna know, what do we do now?

915
01:28:46,927 --> 01:28:48,895
法兰克，你能回复密码吗？
Frank, can you restore the codes?

916
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:53,024
- 我尽力 - 我们不能坐以待毙
L'll try. - We can't afford to sit here and wait.

917
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:56,430
没错，我们要去逮住他
We are not gonna wait. We are gonna take him down.

918
01:28:57,405 --> 01:28:58,872
你用过它吗？
Ever use this thing before?

919
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,234
一开始我们想用它来逮隐形鼠
We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping.

920
01:29:02,443 --> 01:29:04,240
老鼠太小找不到
Too small for thermal scans.

921
01:29:04,745 --> 01:29:07,373
- 接好了 - 开动了
Connecting. - Powering up.

922
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:09,946
启动移动侦测器
Activating motion detectors.

923
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:11,942
有动静了
We've got movement.

924
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,050
- 六号通道 - 他在那里
Corridor six. - There he is.

925
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:18,823
好了
Got it.

926
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:21,526
- 测试 - 测试
Check. - Check.

927
01:29:21,896 --> 01:29:24,160
- 麦特，小心点 - 帮我们留意四周
Matt, be careful. - Just watch our backs.

928
01:29:24,398 --> 01:29:26,059
- 准备好了？ - 走吧
Ready? - Let's do it.

929
01:29:34,341 --> 01:29:36,639
下个走廊左转
Take a left at the next corridor.

930
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:38,937
我们能在八号走廊包抄他吗？
Could we trap him in corridor eight?

931
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,638
- 如果他方向不变的话 - 我到五号走廊
lf he keeps heading that way. - I'm on five.

932
01:29:52,293 --> 01:29:54,318
- 有进展吗？ - 我想我们可以爬出去
Anything? - I think we can climb out.

933
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:56,925
电梯通道里有梯子
There's a ladder in the elevator shaft.

934
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:00,529
糟糕，我找不到他了
Shit, I lost him.

935
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:02,866
- 我找不到他了 - 他停止移动了
I lost him. - He stopped moving.

936
01:30:05,473 --> 01:30:06,303
是我、是我
It's me. It's me.

937
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:10,438
- 找到什么了吗？ - 没有
You have anything? - No, nothing.

938
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:12,201
他怎么闪掉我们的？
How did he get by us?

939
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:13,813
不可能
He couldn't have.

940
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,610
Sebastian!

941
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:18,683
那里，管子后面
There. Behind the pipes.

942
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:22,884
凯恩博士？
Dr. Caine?

943
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:26,192
- 听的到我吗？ - 我去逮他
Can you hear me? - I'm taking him down.

944
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:29,025
掩护我
Cover me.

945
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:30,461
好了
Covered.

946
01:30:44,912 --> 01:30:48,404
只是个排气口 只是个该死的排气口
It's just a vent. It's just a goddamn vent.

947
01:30:54,755 --> 01:30:56,552
放开他！快放开他！
Let him go! Let him fucking go!

948
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,401
麦特，怎么了？
Matt, what's happening?

949
01:31:12,072 --> 01:31:13,903
卡特受伤了！很严重！
Carter's down! He's hurt bad!

950
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:15,105
快离开
Get out of there.

Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what the fuck she sees in a loser like you!
