00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,826
你们听过 极限旅游吗?
Have you heard of extreme tourism?

128
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:24,787
怎么说呢,没听过 没有
Somehow, I haven't, no.

129
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,120
你们知道我们要去哪了 对吧?
You guys see where this is going, right?

130
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,820
我们要去莫斯科 跟我们说过的一样
We're going to Moscow, as we talked about.

131
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,764
克里斯?可以让我说完吗?
Chris? Can I please finish?

132
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,187
总之 那是一个叫皮里亚特的小镇 就在车诺比的旁边
So, there's this place called Pripyat. It's a town right next to Chernobyl.

133
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,921
尤里,我们的极限导游将很高兴的带我们到那里
Uri, who is very excited to take us there, is an extreme tour guide.

134
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:41,127
他会向我们展示这个一夜之间被废弃的城市
He's gonna show us this city that was abandoned overnight.

135
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,827
正确地来说 他们没有时间做任何的处置
Literally. They had no time to take anything.

136
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:47,627
工厂，学校，商店，住宅， 公寓，一切都还是存在的
Factories, schools, stores, homes, apartments, everything's still there.

137
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,554
想想看你能在那里拍到什么照片, 阿曼达?
Imagine the photo shoot you can have there, Amanda?

138
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:53,889
是的, 但是...那些辐射线什么的呢?
Yeah, but, radiation levels or something.

139
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,688
- 这可能有点危险 对吧? - 我们只在那待一天而已
- It's probably pretty dangerous, right? - We're only gonna be there for a day.

140
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,893
不过几个小时,看看那些很酷的东西 然后我们就闪了
A few hours, see some cool shit and then we split.

141
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:01,656
- 我们要怎么去? - 尤里会搞定
- How are we gonna get there? - Uri's gonna take us.

142
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:03,089
- 他有一台面包车 - 面包车?
- He's got a van. - A van?

143
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,489
- 对 - 他有一台面包车?
- Yeah. - He has A van?

144
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,728
他有一台面包车!
He has a van!

145
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,393
好吧...
Okay...

146
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,158
除了你只大致提到的面包车的状况之外...
Aside from the sketchy van situation...

147
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,399
如果你保证 这是个安全的旅游...
and if you promise that this tour is safe...

148
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,322
我想这可能是挺酷的
I think it could be kinda cool.

149
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:16,956
- 这就是我说的 - 你是在开玩笑吧
- That's what I'm talking about. - You're kidding.

150
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:20,122
不是啦 我是说他也许是对的
No. I mean-I don't know. He's right.

151
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,490
我们都到了欧洲,我们何不...
We're in Europe, we might as well...

152
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,890
尽我们所能的 多看看这里的不同东西
see as much as we possibly can while we're here.

153
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:24,868
我不知道
I don't know.

154
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,524
-告诉我你不想见见尤里. -我不想见到尤里.
- Tell me you don't want to meet Uri. - I don't want to meet Uri.

155
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:28,824
你怎么能这么说? 你根本都没见过他
How can you say that? You haven't even met him yet.

156
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,757
好吧, 我们拍些照片,走走逛逛, 然后回到原本的行程
Okay, we'll take some pictures, explore a bit, and then we'll be on our way.

157
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,134
一如原本的计画 对吧?
Just as planned. Right?

158
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,091
我不太喜欢你跟他一鼻孔出气
I don't like that he's rubbing off on you.

159
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,924
他只能从他自己鼻孔出气
He's definitely not rubbing off.

160
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:39,591
你真是让人难以置信,你知道吗?
You're incredible, you know that?

161
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,967
好吧,就让我们举手表决吧,好吗?
All right, let's just settle this by a show of hands, please?

162
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,234
谁要跟保罗来去车诺比?
Who's coming with Paul to Chernobyl?

163
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:51,825
- 帅! - 你是跟我开玩笑, 对吧?
- Yeah! - You're kidding me, right?

164
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,132
你们真是太软弱了
You guys are so weak.

165
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:57,767
太好了,小朋友们!欢迎来到尤里的极限旅游团  让我们上吧!
All right, kids! Welcome to Uri's Extreme Travel. Let's do it.

166

167
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,502
尤里!

168
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,595
还好吗, 老兄?
What's up, buddy?

169
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,562

- Come in! Welcome, welcome. - All right, man! The gang is all here.

171
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,559
- 这是我老弟 克里斯. - 你好吗?
- This is my little brother Chris. - How You doing?

172
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:14,526
他的女友娜塔莉. 这是可爱的阿曼达.
His girlfriend Natalie. The lovely Amanda.

173
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,393
-各位,这是尤里. - 嗨
- Guys, this is Uri. - Hi.

174
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,394
哈
Hello.

175
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:19,826
总之,我告诉他们我们今天要做点小小冒险...
So, I was telling them about our little adventure today...

176
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,737
但是克里斯是个乖乖牌,跟平常一样
and Chris got parental, as usual.

177
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,727
所以我想要你能给他一点安全感...
So I figured you'd give him a little peace of mind...

178
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:24,932
在他尿湿裤子之前...
before he pisses his pants.

179
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:28,170
- 你会, 嗯, 紧张吗? - 不 我不会 我并不紧张
- You're feeling, uh, nervous? - No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

180
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:31,564
你这里是一家很棒的店 这里很...嗯...专业 
It's a nice shop you got here, it's very, uh, professional.

181
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,533
谢谢你 那是我最在意的事
Thank you. It's all mine.

182
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,632
- 这是你的店? - 是啊,挺不赖
- It's all yours, huh? - Yeah, very nice.

183
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:39,294
- 是的,这是我的店 - 嗯, 你是...退役军人?
- Yes, it's all mine. - Well, what are you, ex-military?

184
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:40,961
对,特种部队
Yes, Special Forces.

185
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:42,960
那重要吗? 就算他是个该死的魔术师又如何,兄弟?
What does it matter if he's a fuckin' magician, dude?

186
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,462
我只是随便问个该死的问题罢了
I'm just asking a fucking question.

187
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,594
好吧 尤里,我们今天的计画是什么? 我们要做些什么?
Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today? What are we doing?

188
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:49,835
好的,这是一个很好的团体旅游行程
Well, this is a very well organized tour.

189
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,494
我为特别有冒险精神的游客设计好 有一段时间了...
I've been taking special adventurous tourists for a while now...

190
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:57,562
所以你会体验到非常... 你会怎么说?
so you should feel very, how do you say?

191
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,905
- 特别? - 特别! 我喜欢这个词
- Special? - Special, I like that.

192
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:05,697
好了, 试着想想有一座没有人的城市 完全是属于你的
Okay, so imagine, you have big city and no one's there. All to yourself.

193
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,530
这样安全吗?
Is it safe?

194
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,940
当然安全 这可不是我第一次带团 娜塔莉卡
Of course it's safe. This is not my first rodeo, Natalika.

195
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,703
-不好意思我们迟到了! -我们到了
- So sorry we're late! - We're here.

196
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,129
嘿, 你们也是要去特殊旅游团的 对吧?
Hey, you guys are for the special tour, yeah?

197
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,506
是啊!
Yeah!

198
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,696
我是麦可,这是我的维京人柔依.
I'm Michael, this is my Viking Zoe.

199
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:22,896
你好吗?我是克里斯 很高兴认识你
How you doing? Chris. Nice to meet.

200
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,731
你好吗?我是保罗. 很高兴认识你, 老兄
What's up, man? I'm Paul. Nice to meet you, buddy.

201
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,431
- 好吧, 我们出发! - 出发啦

203
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:28,864
漂亮
Sweet.

204
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,597
- 我们没害你们等太久吧? - 不会 你们别担心
- We didn't keep you waiting? - No. You guys are fine.

205
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,531
柔依,不是跟你说了!跟着大队走!
Zoe, I told you! Go with the flow!

206
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,806
那么,告诉我吧, 维京人是怎么回事?
So, tell me, what's up with the whole Viking thing?

207
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,130
他老是这样叫我 我是挪威来的,所以...
He calls me that all the time. I'm from Norway, so...

208
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:41,439
而他呢 是我的澳洲冲浪好手
And he's my Australian surfer dude.

209
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,169
好啦, 让我们摇滚吧!
All right, let's rock and roll!

210
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,471
来啦
Yes.

211
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,169
耶, 兄弟们!这是在开玩笑吗?
Yeah, buddy! Are you kidding?

212
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:52,572
我们要坐这个去?
That's what we're riding in?

213
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:56,176
- 也有可能是... 用滚的过去 - 把背包放后面
- Might as well just... roll with it. - Put your bags in the back.

214
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:00,999
第一次去那?
First time there?

215
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,366
皮里亚特?对啊 你们呢?
Pripyat? Yeah. How about you guys?

216
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:07,438
是啊 有个家伙说去那看看是很神奇的
Yes. Someone said that it's pretty fantastic.

217
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,965
- 你们俩是来甜心月? - "甜心月" '?
- You two sweethearts moonin'? - "Moonin" '?

218
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,634
你是说?- 蜜月
Are we what?- Honeymooning.

219
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,666
是啊, 完全正确 我们是来度蜜月的
Yeah, actually, we are honeymooning.

220
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,067
我们只能"勉强"算是朋友
We're just friends. Barely.

221
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:16,808
你真不可爱
You're cute.

222
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,337
- 你们呢? - 喔, 我们相爱一辈子了
- Are you guys? - Oh, yeah, we're timeless.

223
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,200
一个月
A month.

224
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,600
你们才在一起一个月? 上帝保佑
You guys have only been together a month? God bless.

225
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,238
那两个跟结了婚没两样
These two are practically married.

226
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,671
- 出发 - 收到!
- We go. - Shotgun!

227
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,206
谢谢你
Thank you.

228
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,777
有人饿了吗?  我这有牛肉干
Anybody gets hungry, I have beef jerky.

229
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,336
皮里亚特从这过去只要两小时 而车诺比就在那附近
Pripyat is two hours from here, and Chernobyl is not far from there.

230
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,568
一定很好玩!
Good time!

231
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,768
车诺比到底是发生了什么?
What exactly happened in Chernobyl?

232
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,009
一个失败的系统测试造成了车诺比事件
The Chernobyl disaster was a result of failed systems tests.

233
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,568
那导致了能量暴增
It caused sudden power surge.

234
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,547
然后4号反应炉变成了空气
And reactor number four became one with the air.

235
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:02,270
- 变成空气? - 蒸发掉了
- One with the air? - Vaporized.

236
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,407
它爆炸了
It exploded.

237
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:09,815
不好意思, 那是说什么?
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

238
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,345
尘归尘土归土了
Nature has reclaimed its rightful home.

239
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,409
我们到了
Here we are.

240
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,810
欢迎来到皮里亚特.
Welcome to Pripyat.

241
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:40,441
照相吧
Photo.

242
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,475
我们现在要进入禁区
We're now entering exclusion zone.

243
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,780
待在这里多久时间内是安全的?
How long is it safe to be here?

244
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,481
这里很安全的 我们只会在皮里亚特待两个钟头
It's very safe. We'll only be in Pripyat for two hours.

245
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:56,473
这是哪里? 看起来像是个检查哨?
What is this place? Is it like a checkpoint?

246
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:57,780
看起来是
Looks like it.

247
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,485
为什么一个废弃的城市还要设检查哨?
Why would there be a checkpoint at an abandoned town?

248
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,278
游客
Tourists.

249
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,744
好吧...
Okay...

250
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,606
- 我去跟他们说说 - 你们觉得如何?
- Let me do the talking. - Well, you think?

251
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:12,279
- 把相机放下 - 喔, 知道了
- Put your cameras away. - Yeah, got it.

252
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,881
你看那边那家伙
Look at this guy over there.

253
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,010
- 那些家伙 - 嗯 那些家伙看起来很认真啊
- That guy's... s. - Yeah. These guys look pretty serious.

254
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,545
我不知道他们在说什么 不过我看那家伙是说不行
I don't know what they're saying, but this guy is saying no.

255
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,082
看这家伙
Look at this guy.

256
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,412
你看到底是怎么了?
What do you think is going on?

257
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,483
真恐怖!
It's scary!

258
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:35,086
天啊, 你看那家伙 有够魁武的
God, look at that guy. He's huge.

259
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:43,750
- 谢啦,宝贝 - 你在干嘛
- Thanks, baby. - Come on, you.

260
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,875
把自己藏起来 不让他看到 如何?
Hide me so he doesn't see me. How's that?

261
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:53,046
- 你在享受犯罪的快感吗? - 我是这样的人吗?
- You have a criminal soul? - Do I look like one of them?

262
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:07,421
今天正好不能让我们过去 有些东西在维修
He is not letting us in today. There's maintenance going on.

263
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,219
维修? 我记得你说那城市都荒废了
Maintenance work? I thought you said this place was abandoned.

264
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:14,320
的确很奇怪
It is unusual.

265
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,044
一般来说,他们会先告诉我啊...
Usually, they let me know in advance...

266
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,886
除非是真的有什么事发生
if something like this is going to happen.

267
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,250
等等, 我记得你说你会搞定的
Wait, I thought you said everything was gonna be taken care of.

268
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:26,288
- 我们可是已经付了钱了,老兄 - 我知道 我知道
- We paid for this tour, bro. - I know, I know.

269
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,354
不用担心
Don't worry.

270
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,710
还有别条路能进皮里亚特.
There's more than one way into Pripyat.

271
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:33,054
那就走吧
Make it happen.

272
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:46,384
真是挺奇怪的,我连一只鸟或是任何生物都没看到
It's so bizarre, I don't see any birds or anything.

273
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,556
这就是尤里专属的特别入口
This must be Uri's special entrance.

274
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:57,657
保罗, 这看起来真他妈的随便
Paul, this looks fuckin' sketchy, man.

275
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:02,224
别再装小孬孬了 我们都已经到了, 享受一下吧, 好吗?
Stop being a pussy. We came all this way, enjoy yourself, all right?

276
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,053
那是叫做明智
It's called being sensible.

277
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:16,081
这样不好吧 朋友们
This is not right, you guys.

278
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:18,081
我们搞不好最后会进乌克兰的监狱
We're gonna end up in a Ukrainian jail or something.

279
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,256
来吧, 别忘了这是个冒险
Come on, just think of it as an adventure.

280
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,058
没问题的
It's okay.

281
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:26,581
- 这真是太棒了 - 你真的这么想?
- This is the awesomest. - Really?

282
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:37,883
好了, 没问题啦 皮里亚特今天是我们的了
Okay, no problem. Today we have Pripyat to ourselves.

283
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:42,425
- 漂亮 - 太好了
- Sweet. - All right.

284
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,325
我们走吧
Here we go.

285
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,294
我没想到这里还有湖
I was not expecting a lake out here.

286
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,891
皮里亚特到了
And there is Pripyat.

287
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,658
工人们都是从这里到车诺比去工作
Home to the workers and families of Chernobyl.

288
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,096
真是不可思议
It's incredible.

289
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:34,118
抓好! 接下来会有一点颠簸
Hold on! This is going to be a little bumpy.

290
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,324
一点颠簸
A little bumpy.

291
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:38,131
喔, 你不如干脆...
Oh, you're not gonna...

292
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,661
让我们"下"去用走的!
And down we go!

293
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,256
或"上"!
And up!

294
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,893
喔 我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

295
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,730
安全带原来就是为了这种事设计的?
When are you putting seat belts in this thing?

296
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:01,264
- 耶稣 - 还有呕吐袋
- Jesus. - Or barf-bags.

297
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,559
真是太夸张了
It's ridiculous.

298
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:10,093
Ok  现在呢,我要给你们看看水里面的某种东西
Okay. Now, I want to show you something in water.

299
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,497
他要我们看看水里面的某种东西
He wants to show us something in water.

300
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,154
谢啦
Thank you.

301
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,861
你先请 你先请
After you. After you.

302
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,888
- 保持在我身后 - 说的好像我们要干嘛似的
- Stay close behind me. - Like we're gonna go anywhere.

303
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,264
- 保罗? - 嗯?
- Paul? - Yeah?

304
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:32,525
我想麻烦你 如果看到水里有东西在动 赶快告诉我 Ok?
I want you to tell me if you see something moving in water. Okay?

305
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:34,293
Ok...
Okay...

306
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,358
别把鞋子弄湿了
You don't want to get your booties wet.

307
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,890
手给我! 手给我!
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

308
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,630
你没事吧? 你没事吧, 伙计?
You okay? You okay, mate?

309
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,091
搞笑啊, 混蛋
Funny, bugger.

310
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,090
- 你他妈的耍我? - 他真他妈的搞笑
- Are you fucking kidding me? - He's a fucking comedian.

311
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,256
- 这是个玩笑 - 玩笑 你玩蛋啦
- It's jerky. - Jerky, you jerk.

312
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,490
嘿,大伙, 能走了吗, 拜托?
Hey, GUYS, can we go, please?

313
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,367
- 他妈的骗到我了! - 对 他也骗到我了
- Fucking got me! - Yeah. He got me, too.

314
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:13,761
喔,该死!
Oh, shit!

315
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,435
那是个玩笑
It was a joke.

316
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,627
不好意思
Sorry about that.

317
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,624
这边有好看的
Come have look at this.

318
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:21,796
不会是另一个玩笑吧?
Is this another joke?

319
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,236
不 不是 来这吧
No. No, come.

320
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,468
哇哩咧
Holy cow.

321
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,226
- 别靠太近 - 为什么? 应该是死的
- Don't get too close. - Why? It's dead.

322
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,261
- 好恶心 - 它脸上长了锯齿
- It's disgusting. - Look at the chompers on him.

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,432
那是什么东西?
What is that thing?

324
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,263
摸摸看,伙计
Touch it, mate.

325
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,796
现在谁才是小孬孬, 啊?
Who's the pussy now, huh?

326
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,164
- 能走了吗? 这真的好恶心 - 别动它
- Can we go? This is disgusting. - Keep it up.

327
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,560
走吧? 这真的好恶
Can we go? That's disgusting.

328
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:54,437
- 真是超威的 - 继续走吧
- That's awesome. - And moving on.

329
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:57,433
看到那牙齿了吗? 超酷的,对吧?
See its teeth? It's cool, huh?

330
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,128
喔, 我的天!
Oh, my God!

331
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,904
- 你刚刚那个玩笑有押韵喔, 尤里? - 当然
- Did you just make a rhyme, Uri? - Yes.

332
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,995
开个小玩笑
Make small joke.

333
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:23,528
- 免除烦恼 - 这就是尤里.
- Not to worry. - Here is Uri.

334
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,894
那么, 尤里,这地方被遗弃多久了?
So, Uri, how long has this place been abandoned?

335
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,128
有25年了 直到最近辐射剂量下降了
It's been 25 years. Only recently have radiation levels gone down.

336
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,596
这真是疯狂 这真是该死的毛骨悚然
Man, this is crazy. It's creepy as fuck.

337
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:40,229
我们得回到主要道路上 那是唯一一条离开皮里亚特的路
We are back on main road. It's only way in and out of Pripyat.

338
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,572
嗯, 除了你的快速通关道,是吗?
Yeah, except for your shortcut, right?

339
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:49,065
在车诺比工作的家庭都住在这里
This is where the families Chernobyl lived.

340
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,863
- 懂吗? - 嗯
- See? - Yeah.

341
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,796
- 他们都集中在这 - 是啊 非常可怜
- These were all full at one point. - Yes. Very sad.

342
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:01,071
有5万多人被迫离开
Fifty thousand people, families, just left.

343
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,875
Ok, 坐好 有点颠簸,有点颠簸
Okay, hold on. Little bump, little bump.

344
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,398
- 摩天轮 - 好了
- The Ferris. - All right.

345
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,468
- 我爱死这里的东西了 - 我们到了
- I used to love those things. - We're here.

346
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,941
还想着回家吗,克里斯?
Still want to go home, Chris?

347
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,332
我很高兴我们来了这里 谢谢了
I'm happy we're here. Thanks.

348
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,072
- 你太客气了 - 我们走吧 友爱两兄弟
- You're welcome. - There we go. Brotherly love.

349
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,467
大伙 看这!
Guys, look at this.

350
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,341
哇
Ah, man.

351
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,400
Ok, 各位
Okay, everyone.

352
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,073
别离开我太远 就会很安全的
Stay near me and you'll be safe.

353
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,301
我带着盖格计数器
I have Geiger counter.

354
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,934
那能让我们知道哪里的辐射剂量太高
It will let us know if the radiation levels are high.

355
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:00,571
那太好了
That's good.

356
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,177
这里没问题
Levels are good.

357
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:09,834
你们能想像这里曾经充满着孩子?在这里...玩耍着?
Can you guys imagine this like, full with kids? Like...playing?

358
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,972
- 说实话 这真的很令人悲伤 - 他们根本不知道
- It's really sad, actually. - They had no idea.

359
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:18,875
我是说 这根本让人难以置信
I mean, this is just unbelievable.

360
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,472
我从没见过像这样的事
I have never seen anything like this.

361
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,607
这就像他们正准备过狂欢节或什么的
It's like they were getting ready for a carnival or something.

362
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:32,537
他们正在准备 "五月节", 那是一个欢庆春天到来的节日
They were preparing for "May Day", the celebration of Spring.

363
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:34,681
可惜永远没得过了
Never happened.

364
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,803
Ok, 走吧 往这里
Okay, let's go. This way.

365
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,009
可以帮我们照张相吗? 尤里, 可以吗?帮我们照张相
Can we get a photo? Uri, you want to take it? A photo.

366
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,881
- 嘿,大伙? - 好啊 快来照相
- Hey, guys? - All right. Quick photo.

367
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,071
和新朋友一起
And new friends.

368
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,578
Ok...
Okay...

369
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,347
好了
Good.

370
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,614
真有美国风
It's so American.

371
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,720
走在这里, 感觉好像...
In a way, it's like...

372
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,449
他们还生活在这里,但是却...
There was life, and it just...

373
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:57,852
嘿, 你听到了什么吗?
Hey, you hear that?

374
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,084
什么都没有
Silence.

375
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,348
这里真的完全被自然接管了
It's like nature really has taken over.

376
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,814
最后一项了
One last thing.

377
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:29,314
- 要进去吗? - 是的
- Are we going in? - Yes.

378
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:35,317
那是什么,宝贝? 哇, 柔依. 嘿, 宝贝,没事的
What is it, babe? Whoa, Zoe. Hey, babe, it's okay.

379
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,182
它们通常不会那么接近城镇  可能是快饿死了
They usually don't come so close to town. Must have been starving.

380
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:42,724
可惜还是来错地方
I reckon he's right.

381
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,590
进来吧
Come in.

382
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,147
好恶心
That's disgusting.

383
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:52,353
这就是VIP入口的礼遇
That's the VIP entrance. Treatment.

384
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:54,781
可怜的家伙...
Poor guy...

385
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,692
会有其他的动物在这吗?
Are there any other animals here?

386
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:59,659
不太可能 尤其是在白天
Unlikely. Especially during the day.

387
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:01,887
除了你
Just you.

388
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,586
停下来
Stop it.

389
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:34,556
这里是数以千计被废弃的公寓的其中一间
Here's one of a thousand apartments that were abandoned.

390
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:37,952
酷
Cool.

391
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,350
这些人们只有不到五分钟的时间...
The people were not even given five minutes...

392
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:45,329
收拾他们的个人财产
to collect their personal possessions.

393
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,383
你可别拿这里的东西 都是受到污染的
You can't take that. It's contaminated.

394
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:53,250
我只是看看...不要好像抓到现行犯一样看我
I was just look... Spot the convict. Cheers, man.

395
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:54,593
它真的有被污染
It's contaminated.

396
00:24:56,552 --> 00:25:01,087
有一段时间, 常有人来到这里 把这里给洗劫一空
For a while, people came here and they looted through these buildings.

397
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,430
他们把这些东西卖进黑市
They took these things, sold them on black market.

398
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,550
买下那些东西的人都病了...
People who bought them got sick...

399
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,189
却还是不知道他们是被辐射污染了
not knowing they were contaminated by radiation.

400
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:10,791
抱歉, 我真的只是...
Sorry, I was just...

401
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,088
来吧, 来看看这个
Come, let's have a look.

402
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:17,052
那我们待在这还呼吸什么的,没关系吗?
But it's okay to be here and breathe?

403
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:18,087
是的 没关系
Yes, yes.

404
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:22,158
我们在这里的时间不足以受到污染
We're not here long enough to get exposure.

405
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,952
车诺比的4号反应炉 当灾害发生的时候
Chernobyl Reactor Number Four. Where the disaster happened.

406
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:31,320
- 这可真是够近了 - 你呢 你有进去过吗?
- That's pretty close. - Have you, you been inside?

407
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:35,186
没有 你得有防辐射服才能进去
No. You can only go inside with radiation suit.

408
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,323
而且只能防护很短的时间
Only for short period of time.

409
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,193
来 拍张照吧

- 拍张甜蜜 罗曼蒂克的照片? - 好了 好了
- Take a nice, romantic photo? - All right, all right.

411
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,394
嘿,我不是叫你过去...
Hey, I wasn't gonna...

412
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,400
- 嗯 他来了 - 这可以贴在冰箱上
- Yeah, he was. - This is going on the fridge.

413
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:52,488
这是一个比喻 顺便说一下 伙计们
That's a metaphor here, by the way, guys.

414
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:53,720
别告诉我
Do tell.

415
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:56,529
- 这真是太美了 - 我们的爱是爆炸式增长
- That's beautiful. - Our love is just exploding.

416
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,395
喔,天啊
Oh, God.

417
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,021
这是辐射威胁之下唯一的好事
The one good thing about the radiation...

418
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:03,090
我想你终于长出了一只老二
is that I'll probably finally grow a penis.

419
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,329
你们可真搞笑
These guys are funny.

420
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,830
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

421
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:10,662
- 来个最佳一吻吧? - 什么?
- Can you beat that kiss? - What?

422
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,491
我们该走了
We should go now.

423
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:38,435
这里很快就会天黑了, 我们得快点回到面包车上
It's going to get dark soon, we should get back to van before then.

424
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,662
那他妈的是什么?
Fuck was that?

425
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:46,034
是喔,新把戏吗
Right, it's gonna be a trick.

426
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:08,904
等着
Stay.

427
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:31,803
那他妈是啥?

走 走
Go, go.

437
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:11,565
黑熊或是他妈的棕熊吧? 喔, 天啊!
Black bear or it's a fucking brown bear? Oh, Jesus!

438
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,762
- 熊在那里做什么? -我们可以他妈的先离开这再说吗?
- What is a bear doing here? - Can we just get the fuck out of here?

439
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:18,365
- 哎呀 - 小心一点
- Jeez. - Watch out for that.

- Thanks for that. - Yeah. Don't mention it.

444
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:34,430
我说过这会让人兴奋的,难道不是吗?
Told you it'd be exciting, didn't I?

445
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,964
是啊,兴奋到可能会死...
Yeah, almost getting mauled to death...

446
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,636
而且还是被只从地狱来的辐射熊干掉? 真他妈令人兴奋
by a radioactive bear from hell? It's pretty exciting.

447
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,404
其他人能有这样的故事吗?
Anybody else have a story like this?

448

- 好笑吗 - 你没事吧?

照片...这家伙
A photo. This guy.

00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,100
天啊
Jesus.

452
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,501
熊! 熊,熊!我瞎掰的
Bear! Bear, bear! I'm kidding.

453
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:56,508
你这坏蛋
That's bad.

454
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,934
那么, 尤里, 其他动物们, 都在树林里,啊?
So, Uri, all the animals, they stay in the woods, huh?

455
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,965
这很不寻常
It's very unusual.

456
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,332
我已经做了五年 从来没有见过这样的事
I've been doing this for five years. I've never seen anything like this.

457
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,565
可真让人沮丧, 是吧?
It's kind of chilly out here, huh?

458
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,067
有过狗, 有过狼 但是熊...很奇怪
A dog, a wolf. But a bear, very odd.

459
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:16,541
- 但很过瘾 对吧? - 那倒是 伙计
- It was exciting, right? - Yeah, mate.

460
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,878
被熊袭击我就不另外收费了
No extra charge for bear attack.

461
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,299
向皮里亚特说再见吧
Say goodbye to Pripyat.

462

- It was a blast. - It's been a pleasure.

468
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,071
开个暖气吧 老兄
Turn the heater on, buddy.

469
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:39,807
油门
Pump it.

470
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:42,210
给它多点油
Give it some gas.

471
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:45,436
- 怎么了,还有油吧? - 有啊 油箱还有一半
- What's up, is there gas in there? - Yes. Half a tank.

472
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,374
那怎么发不动 伙计?
Is it the starter, mate?

473
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,443
以前发生过吗?
Has this happened before?

474
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,310
我猜这里应该没有Triple A修车场吧?
I don't suppose you guys have Triple A out here?

475
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,079
你手机有信号吗?
Do you have reception?

476
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:04,069
一整天都没信号,各位 服务区域应该没涵盖这里
I haven't had reception all day, guys. There's no kind of reception out here.

477
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,377
看 看
Look, look.

478
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,913
你们他妈的在干嘛,伙计?
What the fuck could've done that, mate?

479
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,977
这他妈的是被咬断的
That's fucking been chewed on.

480
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:15,505
- 等等 发生了什么事? - 到底怎么了?
- Wait, what's happening? - What's going on?

481
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:17,936
- 车子的线路挂了 - 被咬断了
- The wires have been destroyed. - Chewed on.

482
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:20,069
咬断是什么意思? 什么,被什么咬断? 动物吗?
What do you mean chewed on? What, by what? An animal?

483
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:21,707
什么样的动物会吃汽车零件?
What kind of animal chews on car parts?

484
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:24,370
你确定真的只有我们在这里吗?
Are you sure we're out here alone?

485
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:26,971
是啊 你也听到早上那些士兵说了,这里是禁区
Yes. You heard the soldiers this morning, this place is off-limits.

486
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,244
这里只有我们
We are here alone.

487
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:31,876
这他妈怎么回事, 麦可?
What the fuck is it, Michael?

488
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:34,804
火心塞的引线被咬断了...
That's the spark-plug leads, been chewed on...

489
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:37,044
- 你能找人来修吗? - 被浣熊 老鼠 或是其他动物弄的?
- Can you call someone? - By a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.

490
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,338
但是怎么会有动物在这里?
But how would an animal get in here?

491
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,403
从车子下面 经过引擎
Under the car. Through the engine.

492
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,609
- 从车底? - 是啊 是啊

493
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:53,037
他正在问附近有没能协助发生突发事故的人...
He said there aren't any around here and all of a sudden...

494
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,016
我不懂
I don't know.

495
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:56,915
各位!能先静静让他能... 我们正试着要  要...
Guys! Let's just shut up and let him- We're trying to-to...

496
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,343
他妈的
Fuck me.

497
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,151
尤里?
Uri?

498
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,214
有什么计画吗 ?
What's the plan, mate?

499
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,785
嘿 大个子? 有什么计画吗?
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?

500
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:00,253
我好饿, 感觉快死了
I'm so hungry, I could die.

501
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:12,920
哇啦,这下可好
Well, this is great.

502
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,321
把关于这个该死的旅游的一切都交给你 先生
Gotta hand it to you. Some fucking tour, mister.

503
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,687
- 这可不是我的错 - 哦，真的吗？不是你的错吗？
- This is not my fault. - Oh, really? Not your fault?

504
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,711
因为根据我的记忆 你就是那个带我们来这的人
Cause last time I checked, you were the one that drove us out here.

505
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,310
如果不是有你的话 我们根本不会在这里
Well, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here either.

506
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,977
喔 我真是不应该帮你们找乐子
Oh, I'm sorry to try and show you guys some fun...

507
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,081
-而且还是当你们自己跑来找我时候 -喔 是啊 真是有趣极了
- while you're out here visiting me. - Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.

508

嘿,克里斯. 没事的,你知道吗?
Hey, Chris. All right, you know what?

509
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,621
放轻松点
Relax.

510
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,682
- 我们都没事 - 我们他妈的困在这咧
- We're fine. - We're fucking stranded out here.

511
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,512
所以别叫我放轻松
And don't tell me to relax.

512
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:40,978
我向天发誓...
I swear to God...

513
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,645
这是我最后一次听从你那些该死的蠢点子
this is the last time I listen to one of your dumb fuckin' ideas.

514
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:45,345
嘿,你知道吗,克里斯?  你就光在这废话对我们也没啥帮助
Hey, you know what, Chris? Your fucking whining isn't helping right now.

515
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,687
-他有生气的权利 -好了 大家别吵  嘿 尤里
- He's got every right to be pissed. - Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.

516
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,979
有人会知道我们在这吧,是吗?
Someone has to know we're out here, right?

517
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:52,152
我是一人公司
I work alone.

518

我们现在还有些甚么选项?
What are our options right now?

521
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,012
我们可以留在车里

522
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,346
- 在这里安全吗? - 是的 这里是安全的

523
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:09,053
我们关上窗 锁上门
We close windows, lock doors.

Ok, ok, 大伙

00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:49,358
- 有其他人在这里吗? - 那是不可能的
- Are there people here? - It's impossible.

536
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,725
这声音听起来像是小婴儿
It sounds like a baby.

537
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:02,349
- 到底是什么? - 那不是婴儿
- What is that? - It's not a baby.

538
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:04,124
那那个他妈的是什么, 尤里?

00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,194
- 你要跟他一起去吗? - 放轻松 兄弟

- Chris, I'm coming with you. - No, I don't want you to come with me.

550

Just sit in the car and think of another way...

551
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:44,354
能让你他妈的成熟一点
you can fuck this up even further.

552
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,556
我向天发誓, 保罗,当你的兄弟真的是有够倒楣的
I swear to God, Paul, it's a fucking hazard having you as a brother.

618
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:40,801

我只想他妈的快点离开这里
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

620

我修不好 对不起 对不起 这些线路都腐烂了
I can't fix it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, the, the leads have rotted.

621
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:52,009
我是说, 如果我们能找到一些新的线路 那就能发动车子了 只是...
I mean, if we could get some new leads, we could roll-start it, but...

622
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:01,308
我是不是他妈的见过这个 试试看吧
I ain't fuckin' seen this before. Try it.

623
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,370
尤里, 这里是保罗. 听得到我吗?

00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:05,678
-有别只对讲机吗? -嗯
- That the other walkie? - Yeah.

625
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,909
尤里, 你还在吗? 听得到我吗?
Uri, are you there? Can you hear me?

626
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:12,841
拜托
Come on.

627
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:17,104
- 好吧 我去找他 - 你根本不熟悉这里
- All right, I'm gonna go look for him. - You don't know your way around.

628
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,604
但是他熟 他能带我们离开这里
But he does. He can help us get out of here.

629
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:20,174
要是那些狗又回来了呢?
And what if the dogs come back?

630
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:22,274
尤里说那些狗只有晚上会出来
Uri said the dogs come out at night.

631
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,272
所以你们乖乖留在面包车上 而且把门关紧
So just stay in the van and keep the door shut.

632
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:25,341
我跟你去
I'll go with you.

00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:26,782
不行 你不能去
No, you will not.

634
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,272
尤里可是个大块头 也许要两个人才能把他弄回来
Uri is a big fellow and it might take two of us to carry him back.

635
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,683
是啊,可如果他挂了呢?
Yeah, what if he's dead?

636
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,938
别那么说 尤里她妈的知道怎么离开这里
Don't say that. Uri knows how to get the fuck outta here.

637
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:37,139
我们可以顺便找新的电线...
We might find new leads...

638
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,311
你也看到有东西袭击了车子  他说，还有什么其他的东西在这里
You saw what attacked the car. He says that there's other things out here.

639
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:43,878

00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,548
你待在车里, 把门关好  我们会回来接你
You stay in the car, you keep the door shut. We'll be back for you.

644
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,515
你会没事的 伙计 我们很快回来
You'll be all right, mate. We'll be back.

645
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,573
- 跟他们一起待着 帮帮他们 - 麦可,这真是太蠢了
- Stay with them. Help them. - Michael, this is stupid.

646
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,848
- 你为什么要去? - 我很快回来
- Why would you do that? - I'll be back.

647
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:11,642
你知道多少关于尤里的事?
How well you know Uri?

648
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:14,483
不多 你呢?
Not well. You?

649
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:16,081
一样
Same, same.

650
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,514
你想他还在这里吗?
You think he's still here?

651
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:23,913
天亮了 他可以离开了
It's been overnight. He could be gone.

652
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:25,451
是啊 我知道
Yeah, I know.

653
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,778
你在想什么?
What are you thinking?

654
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:33,379
我在想攻击克里斯的那些狗
I think Chris got attacked by dogs.

655
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:36,850
狗应该不会造成那样的伤口
Dogs didn't do that.

656
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,309
也许是熊呢? 我的意思是 我们昨天的确是见到一只熊在公寓里面跑
Maybe a bear? I mean, we saw a bear run by us at the apartment yesterday.

657
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:44,110
- 他是说还有别的东西 - 是的，它可能是一只熊
- He said there was something else. - Yeah, and it could be a bear.

658
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:46,809
他说的应该是，有很多狗 天很黑，他被吓坏了
He said there was a lot of dogs. It was dark, he was in shock.

659
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,344
要再试试对讲机吗?
Try the walkie-talkie, will you?

660
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:52,848
嘿, 尤里, 有听到吗? 这里是保罗.
Hey, Uri, are you there? It's Paul.

661
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:58,749
- 走这边看看 - 尤里, 可以听到我吗?
- Lets go around here. - Uri, can you hear me?

662
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:01,379
不要分开太远而且眼睛睁大小心点 好吗?
Just stay close and keep your eyes open, all right?

663
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,781
我不是很相信他说的动物不会在白天出没
I don't believe him when he said that animals don't come out during the day.

664
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,648
我也不知道还有甚么能相信了
I don't know what to believe.

665
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,678
操
Fuck.

666
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,378
这就是昨晚他来的地方了吧?
This is where he went off last night, right?

667
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,983
试着找找有没他的人影 然后回面包车去
Let's just try and figure out how we get back to the van.

668
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,621
好点子 伙计
Good idea, mate.

669
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,213
再试试对讲机
Check your walkie-talkie again.

670
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:23,355
嘿, 尤里, 这里是保罗. 听的到我吗,老兄?
Hey, Uri, this is Paul. Can you hear me, buddy?

671
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,757
- 怎么? - 再来一次 再来一次
- What? - Do it again, do it again, do it again.

672
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,755
尤里, 是你吗...
Uri, do you come...

673
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:32,652
- 你听得到我吗? - 嗯
- Did You hear that? - Yeah.

674
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,386
该死的
Holy shit.

675
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:41,015
甚么该死的抓了他
Something fucking got him.

676
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,522
Ok, 我没走 我们得去看看
Okay, let's go. We need to go.

677
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:46,285
不 我们不去 伙计
No, we can't, mate.

678
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,986
我们得去看看他是不是还活着
We have to see if he's alive.

679
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:01,021
尤里?
Uri?

680
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:24,651
尤里?
Uri?

681
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:38,527
尤里?
Uri?

682
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,525
这里还好
It's okay.

683
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:23,485
这里有好多血
There's too much blood.

684
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:25,828
- 这样他不可能还活着 - 我知道 我知道
- There's no way that he's still alive. - I know, I know.

685
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:30,219
我们得理智一点 要知道走回头路也没用
We need to be smart about this. We're not going back there.

686
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,322
没错 我要再下去看看 别忘了 他至少还有枪
We are. I'm gonna go. Besides, he's got the gun.

687
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,723
他说的对
He's right.

688
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:41,625
往下走吧
Let's do it.

689
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,395
尤里?
Uri?

690
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,257
尤里?
Uri?

691
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:30,701
尤里!
Uri!

692
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:32,926
喔 操!
Oh, fuck!

693
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:35,331
操他妈的!
Holy shit!

694
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:37,400
看!
Look!

695
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:42,056
检查他的口袋里面
Gotta check his pockets.

696
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:44,399
- 操! 枪跑哪去了? - 喔 该死
- Shit! Where's the gun? - Oh, shit.

697
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,231
我找到弹夹了
Wait. I've got the clip.

698
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:01,400
把那个该死的门锁起来!
Lock the fucking door!

699
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:02,899
喔, 那他妈是什么?
Oh, what the fuck is that?

700
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:05,470
- 操你妈! - 枪 枪 枪!
- Holy shit! - Gun, gun, gun!

701
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,336
- 妈的，有没有子弹！ - 就在这里！
- Fuck, there's no bullets! - Right here!

702
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,742
好了,我弄好了! 我动手!
All right, I got it! I'll do it!

703
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:13,900
快走!
Go!

704
00:48:19,934 --> 00:48:21,036
喔 该死!
Oh, shit!

705
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,604
那个给我!
Forget it!

706
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:53,439
干你娘咧!
Motherfucker!

707
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:12,202
快点他妈的下车 我们得他妈的快点离开
Get the fuck outta. We're getting the fuck outta here.

708
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:14,268
- 你什么意思? 你们去了哪? - 到底怎么了?
- What do you mean? Where we going? - What's going on?

709
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,969
- 我们得快点走 - 尤里呢? 你们找到他了吗?
- We gotta go. - Where's Uri? Did you find him?

710
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,901
- 是啊,我们看到了他的下场 - 什么?
- Yeah, what's left of him. - What?

711
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:19,968
他的意思是 尤里挂了
What he said, man. Uri's dead.

712
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:21,969
- 我们得快点走 不能留在这里 - 他没法走路
- We better go, we can't stay here. - He cannot walk.

713
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:23,236
我们真的不能留在这
We can't stay here.

714
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:25,269
- 我们没有选择的余地 帮帮我吧 - 他是对的
- I don't have a choice. Help me. - He's right.

715
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:27,339
- 什么? 宝贝 不! - 来吧 我来帮你
- What? Babe, no! - Come on, I'll help you.

716
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:29,836
- 啊 操 - 慢一点

721
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:43,107
- 放回去 放回去 - 小心 小心
- Put it back up, put it back up. - Easy, easy.

722
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:45,270
- 怎么了? - 没办法了, 我们得带着他
- What's going on? - All right, we gotta carry him.

723
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:47,337
- 别他妈耍蠢了 - 我们不能把你丢在这!
- Don't be fucking stupid. - We're not gonna leave you here!

724
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:50,145
你带着我的话得花两倍时间才走得掉!
It'll take three of you to carry me and twice as long!

725
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:52,071
好 我留在这里陪你
Fine. I'm staying here with him.

726
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,405
- 我不会离开他的! - 好, 那我也不离开!
- I'm not leaving him! - Well, I'm not leaving him either!

727
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:55,008
你们有没有人在听我说话?
Would you listen to me?

728
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,946
你住在这里 你是唯一一个能跟这里人沟通的人
You live here. You're the only one that speaks the language.

729
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,077
去求援然后带他们回来啊
Go get help and bring it back.

730
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,477
我们会待在车理
We're staying in the van.

731
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:09,948
好吧
All right.

732
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,972
- 拿着这个 - 我们很快回来 来吧 柔依.

733
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:14,306
打开频道一
Stay on channel one.

734
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:17,238
如果你们有什么需要， 或是发生了什么 赶快通知我们
If you guys need anything, if anything happens, you call us.

735
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:20,139
有13英哩的路 我们现在出发 如果够快的话...
It's 13 miles. We're gonna leave now. If we hurry...

736
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,084
- 天黑之前我们就能回来了 - 如果你们回不来?
- we'll be back before it's dark. - What if you're not back?

737
00:50:22,308 --> 00:50:23,580
拿着这个
Take it.

738
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:26,276
- 你会用吗? - 嗯 我想没问题
- You know how to use that? - Yeah, I think so.

739
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:28,180
好 我们走吧
All right, let's go.

740
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:30,115
- 保罗,等等 - 我们很快回来 伙计
- Paul, wait. - We'll be back, mate.

743
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:34,984
我会回来接你的
I'm gonna get you home.

744
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:37,777
我们会在你会用之前回来的
We'll be back before you know it.

745
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:43,044
没事的 宝贝 没事的
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

746
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,740
快走, 保罗 事情怎么会变成这样
Way to go, Paul. Fucked things up this time.

747
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:50,174
Ok,别想这么多 听着, 那对现况没有帮助
Okay, don't think like that. Come on, that's not helping anyone.

748
00:50:50,176 --> 00:50:52,075
我他妈的弄砸了他整个生活
I've been doing this his whole fucking life.

749
00:50:52,076 --> 00:50:54,053
我老是害他惹上麻烦 他都只是默默承受
I always get him into shit. He always pays for it.

750
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:57,174
尽管是这样 你还是他的哥哥啊
Well, despite all that, you're his big brother.

751
00:50:57,176 --> 00:51:00,278
现在他要能离开这里 就只能指望你了 Ok?
So right now he's counting on you to get him out of this. Okay?

752
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:03,114
等等 等等!
Wait, wait!

753
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:11,213
该死的
Holy shit.

754
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:16,143
- 来吧 - 我们得找路绕过去
- Come on. - We got to find a way around.

755
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:17,954
- 麦可? - 安静
- Michael? - Stay quiet.

756
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:20,748
- 我们得绕过去 - 喔 天啊 Ok 快 快 快
- We'll loop around. - Oh, God. Okay, go. Go, go-go.

757
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,820
柔依, 柔依! 快来
Zoe, Zoe! Come on.

758
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:43,244
该死的
Shit. Guys.

759
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:44,882
辐射越来越强
The radiation's getting worse.

760
00:51:45,746 --> 00:51:46,984
我们走
Let's go.

761
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:54,990
那是什么?看
What is that? Look.

762
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,912
好极了
Holly shit.

763
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:12,981
- 会有能开的吗? - 不可能 宝贝 电池一定都没电了
- Will any of them start? - No, babe, the batteries would be dead.

764
00:52:13,114 --> 00:52:15,284
但是也许我们能找到一些电线 检查这些车 来吧!
We might be able to find some cables, though. Check the cars. Let's go!

765
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,047
操
Oh, fuck.

766
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:20,688
这里! 这里!
Wait! Wait!

767
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:24,056
天啊! 这是什么?
Jesus! What the fuck?

768
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:26,446
- 甚么人会对巴士扫射? - 我不知道 宝贝
- Who would shoot at a bus? - I don't know, babe.

769
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:27,550
军队?
The guards?

770
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,389
这些是射出孔
These are exit holes.

771
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,455
这些不是射击巴士的 而是从巴士射出去的
Whatever was shooting was shooting from the inside out.

772
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:35,754
- 我们专心找电线 可以吗? - 是
- Can we just find these cables, please? - Yeah.

773
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:42,751
保罗?
Paul?

774
00:52:45,982 --> 00:52:47,047
保罗?
Paul?

775
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:48,048
保罗?
Paul?

776
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,520
阿曼达, 里面全是弹壳
Amanda, there's shells everywhere.

777
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:13,060
也许能在这找到枪
Maybe there's a gun in here.

778

Okay, wait, no. No. Come on, let's get back to Michael and Zoe.

780

如果后面有什么呢?
What if something's back there?

781
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:43,989
他妈的
Goddamn it.

782
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,519
什么都没有
Nothing.

783
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:03,457
喔 该死!
Oh, shit!

784
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:08,154

这还能用
It works.

790
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:30,160
这好像是卫兵的制服
That's a piece of a guard uniform.

791
00:54:30,889 --> 00:54:32,025
喔 让我们出去吧
Oh, let's get out of here.

792
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:33,264
走吧
Let's go.

793
00:54:37,556 --> 00:54:38,692
怎么了?
What?

794
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:43,090
- 和我们那台一样的吗? - 喔 对!

- Will it work? Do you think it'll work? - I think so.

796
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,724

00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,403

嗯, 我没事,伙计 我只想快点离开这里
Yeah, I'm all right, mate. I just want to get us out of here.

838
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:14,096
克里斯现在都应该到了莫斯科了
Chris should be in Moscow right now.

839
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,096
是啊, 但是他没有
Exactly, but he's not.

840
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,075
告诉我 你知道些什么 让我们弄清楚到底发生了什么
So tell me what you know so we can figure out what is going on.

841
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,598
我知道的只不过是都市传说
Just urban legend, man.

842
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:22,338
他们说这里并不是真的被废弃了
They say this place isn't really abandoned.

843
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:25,097
很明显的 辐射线并没有能够杀死一切
Well, obviously, the radiation hasn't killed everything.

844
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:27,129
- 我才不相信这些狗屁 - 为什么你不相信呢?
- I don't believe any of that shit. - Why not can't you believe it?

845
00:57:27,132 --> 00:57:28,264
这里都已经废弃这么多年了...
There's so much that's been going on...

846
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:29,902
却还是要派卫兵拦路挡人
there's people gotta be out here doing this shit.

847
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:32,503
- 想想看! - 这里一定有着什么鬼东西 他是对的
- Think about it! - There has to be something. He's right.

848
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:34,564
- 我是说 想想吧 - 克里斯
- I mean, think about it. - Chris.

849
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:37,667
尤里 那东西把他弄到厨房里 那是要作什么?
Uri. That thing in the kitchen. What was that?

850
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,365
而且我发誓 我那天拍的照片里 有拍到甚么怪东西
And I swear there was something in a photo I took the other day.

851
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:42,165
我一开始没在意那是什么 但是...
I didn't think anything of it at the time, but...

852
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,397
- 你看? 有照片 - 那只是阴影吧...
- See? The photo. - It was a shadow...

853
00:57:44,399 --> 00:57:47,240
如果甚么也没发生的话 那当然是不算甚么
It didn't make sense at the time, nothing had happened then.

854
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:49,741
听着 听着 ok?
Listen. Listen, okay?

855
00:57:58,134 --> 00:57:59,702
- 柔依, 过来 - 走吧, 我们走!
- Zoe, come on. - Come on, let's go!

856
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,465
怎么了? 我们走错地方了吗
What? This is where we were.

857
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:08,900
- 他们把车发动了吗? - 而他们没通知我们?
- Did they get it started? - And they wouldn't call us?

858
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:11,310
- 娜塔莉? - 等等, 看! 在那里
- Natalie? - Wait, look! Over here.

859
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:16,566
什么? 那是车上的吗?
What? Is that from the van?

860
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:17,633
喔 我的天
Oh, my God.

861
00:58:17,635 --> 00:58:19,203
搞什么鬼?
What the fuck?

862
00:58:24,236 --> 00:58:26,167
哇 操 哇 操
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

870
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:54,836
我不知道 这是克里斯.

- 我真的很爱你 - 我知道
- I love you so much. - I know.

874
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:11,276
我只是希望你知道
I just need you to know that.

875
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:14,071
我原本要等到莫斯科之后, 可是...
I was gonna wait 'til Moscow, but...

876
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:15,737
不 宝贝 等到了莫斯科再说
No, babe, wait till Moscow.

877
