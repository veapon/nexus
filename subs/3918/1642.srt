1
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,180
This is Berk.

2
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,510
It's 12 days North of hopeless and a few degrees South of freezing to death.

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,740
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,920
My village. In a word: sturdy.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,880
It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new.

6
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,740
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets.

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,100
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,210
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.

9
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,270
We have...

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,640
Dragons.

11
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,300
Most people would leave, but not us.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,520
We're Vikings.

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,950
We stubbornness issues.

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,410
My name is Hiccup.

15
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,020
Great name, I know. But it's not the worst.

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,240
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off Gnomes and Trolls.

17
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,170
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,320
'Morning.

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,320
What are you doing here? Get inside!

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,160
Get back inside!

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,610
Hiccup! What is he doing out again... What are you doing out? Get inside!

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,320
That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe.

23
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,910
They say that when he was a baby he popped a Dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

24
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,900
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,840
What have we got?

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,090
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks... Oh, and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,480
Any Night Furys?

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,000
- None so far.  - Good.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,830
Light the torches!

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,010
Oh, nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Who? Me? Nah, come on... I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,830
They wouldn't know what to do with all... this.

33
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,770
The meathead with the attitude and interchangeable hands, is Gobber.

35
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,230
I have been his apprentice ever since I was little.

36
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,320
Well, littler

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,860
We move to the moor defenses. We'll counterattack with the catapults.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,710
See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Fire!

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,150
Oh, and that's Fishlegs

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,060
Snotlout

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,930
The twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,280
And...

44
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,900
Astrid.

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
Aww, their job is so much cooler.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,970
Oh, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark!

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,940
Oh, you have made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,170
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better.

49
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,750
I might even get a date.

50
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,370
You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe.

51
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,030
You can't even throw one of these.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,310
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

53
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,580
See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,020
But it... it's a mild calibration issue.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,250
Hiccup, if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons

56
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,750
you need to stop all....

57
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,220
this.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,140
But you just pointed to all of me.

59
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes, that's it.

60
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,240
Stop being all of you.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,970
- Oh...  - Oh, yes.

62
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,150
You sir, are playing a dangerous game...

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,380
keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

64
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,120
- There will be consequences!  - I take my chances.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,380
Sword, sharpened, now!

66
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,670
One day I'll get out there.

67
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,370
Because killing a dragon is everything around here.

68
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,110
A Nadderhead is sure to get me at least noticed.

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,400
Gronckles are tough.

70
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,730
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.

71
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,370
A Zippleback: ...

72
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,180
exotic, two heads, twice the status.

73
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,640
They found the sheep!

74
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,880
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

75
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,610
Hurry up!

76
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,010
Fire!

77
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,430
And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare.

78
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,470
Only the best Vikings go after those.

79
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,180
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,100
Reload!

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,270
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,460
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,780
We call it the...

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,800
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

85
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,020
Jump!

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,640
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and...

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,500
never misses.

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,590
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,570
That's why I'm going to be the first.

90
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,060
Mind the fort, Hiccup. They need me out there.

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,490
Stay! Put!

92
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,960
There.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,190
You know what I mean.

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,000
- Hiccup, what are you doing?  - Come back here!

95
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,330
Yeah, I know, Be right back!

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,620
Mind yourself!

97
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,230
The devils still have some juice in them.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,660
Come on.

99
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,310
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

100
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,160
Oh! I hit it? Yes, I hit it!

101
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,300
Did anybody see that?

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,640
Except for you.

103
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,750
- Do not let them escape!  - Right!

104
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,160
You're all out.

105
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,330
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...

106
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,600
Sorry, Dad.

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,910
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

108
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,360
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

109
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,270
I mean, I really actually hit...

110
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,730
You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot.

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,440
It went down just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there before...

112
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,960
Stop!

113
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,260
Just, stop!

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,570
Every time you step outside disaster falls.

115
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,830
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

116
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,450
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!

117
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,450
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't you think?

118
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,780
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

119
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,920
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

120
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,860
I, I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just...

121
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,290
kill it. You know, it's who I am, Dad.

122
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,810
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup, but a dragon killer is not one of them.

123
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,130
Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there.

124
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,640
I have his mess to clean up.

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,020
Quite the performance.

126
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,830
I've never seen any one mess up that badly. That helped!

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,810
Thank you. Thank you. I was trying.

128
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,760
- I really did hit one.  - Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,850
- He never listens.  - Well, it runs in the family.

130
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,790
And when he does, it's always with this disappointed scowl

131
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,160
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,360
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,090
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,920
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

135
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,090
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,930
It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,320
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,440
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.

139
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,310
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,270
Either we face them or they'll finish us.

141
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,050
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,590
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

143
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,390
They'll find another home.

144
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,270
One more search, before the ice sets in.

145
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,220
Those ships never come back.

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,200
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

147
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,800
Now who's with me?

148
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,310
Alright... Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,970
I'll pack my undies.

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,900
No, I need you to stay, and train some new recruits.

151
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,610
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy Hiccup can cover the store.

152
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,920
Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...

153
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,660
What could possibly go wrong?

154
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,760
Oh, what am I going to do with him, Gobber?

155
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,350
Put him in training with the others.

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,490
- No, I'm serious.  - So am I.

157
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,750
He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.

158
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,610
- Oh, you don't know that.  - I do know that.

159
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,380
- No£¬ you don't  - No, actually, I do.

160
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,360
- No, you don't.  - Listen, you know what he's like.

161
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,150
From the time he could crawl he's been... different.

162
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,680
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.

163
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,850
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for Trolls!

164
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,520
Trolls exist! They steal your socks.

165
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,350
But only the left ones. What's with that?

166
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,500
- When I was a boy...  - Oh, here we go.

167
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,510
My father told me to bang my head against a rock, and I did it.

168
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,210
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.

169
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,220
And you know what happened?

170
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,400
- You got a headache.  - That rock split in two.

171
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,270
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

172
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,880
He could crush mountains, level forests,

173
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,340
tame seas!

174
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,030
Even as a boy I knew what I was, what I had to become...

175
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,860
Hiccup is not that boy.

176
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,880
You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him.

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,610
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is you won't always be around to protect him.

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,620
He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now.

179
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,680
Oh, the Gods hate me.

180
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,620
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

181
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,750
No, not me! I managed to lose an entire dragon.

182
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,220
Ow!

183
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,210
Oh, wow? I... I did it? Oh, I did it!

184
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,060
This fixes everything. Yes!

185
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,660
I have brought down this mighty beast!

186
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,030
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

187
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father.

188
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,110
I'm a Viking.

189
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,410
I'm a Viking!

190
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,840
I did this.

191
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,440
Hiccup.

192
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,420
Dad? Uh...

193
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,650
- I have to talk to you, Dad.  - I need to speak with you too, son.

194
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,660
- I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.  - I don't want to fight dragons.

195
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,240
- What?  - What?

196
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,700
- Uh, you go first.  - No, no, you go first.

197
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,230
All right. You got your wish.

198
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,380
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

199
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,180
Oh man, I should have gone first.

200
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:52,010
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know, we have a surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but...

201
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,670
do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home repair Vikings...

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,260
- You'll need this.  - I don't want to fight dragons.

203
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,990
- Oh come on, yes you do.  - Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

204
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,780
But you will kill dragons.

205
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,660
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

206
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,050
- It's time, Hiccup.  - Can you not hear me?

207
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,660
This is serious, son.

208
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,610
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.

209
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Which means: You walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us.

210
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,160
- No more of... this.  - You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,930
- Deal?  - This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

212
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,950
Deal?

213
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,390
Deal.

214
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,830
Good.

215
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,330
Train hard.

216
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,780
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,700
And I'll be here, maybe.

218
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,610
Welcome to dragon training.

219
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,940
No turning back.

220
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,670
I hope I get some serious burns.

221
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.

222
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,810
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

223
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,450
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

224
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,410
Oh, great, who let him in?

225
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,470
Lets get started. The recruit who does best,

226
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,870
will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.

227
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,700
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or...?

228
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,990
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?

229
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,250
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak, That will make you a less of a target.

230
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,700
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead.

231
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,450
Behind these doors are just a few of the

232
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,070
many species you will learn to fight.

233
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,310
- The Deadly Nadder.  - Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

234
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,550
- The Hideous Zippleback.  - 11 Stealth times two.

235
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,860
- The Monstrous Nightmare.  - Fire Power: 15.

236
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,200
- The Terrible Terror.  - Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

237
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,900
Can you stop that!

238
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,430
- And the Gronckle.  - Jaw Strength: 8.

239
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,890
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

240
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,020
I believe in learning on the job.

241
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,960
Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead.

242
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,780
Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?

243
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,390
- A doctor?  - + 5 Speed?

244
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,350
- A shield?  - Shield. Go.

245
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield.

246
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,370
If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,630
Take the shield.

248
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,810
- Get your hands off my shield.  - There's like a million shields.

249
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,220
Take that one. It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

250
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,620
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

251
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,630
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

252
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,620
- What?  - What?

253
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,560
Those shields are good for another thing. Noise.

254
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,970
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

255
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,000
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

256
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,050
How many does a Gronckle have?

257
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,500
- Five?  - No, six.

258
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,490
Right, six. Thats one for each of you.

259
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,100
Fishlegs, out.

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,570
Hiccup, get in there!

261
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,120
So anyway, I moved into my parent's basement?

262
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,450
You should come by sometimes to work out, You look like you work out.

263
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,410
Snotlout, your done.

264
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,880
- So I guess it's just you and me.  - Nope, just you.

265
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,190
One shot left.

266
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,480
Hiccup!

267
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,010
And that's 6. Go back to bed you overgrown sausage.

268
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,660
You'll get another chance. Don't you worry.

269
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,570
Remember, a dragon will always...

270
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,750
always go for the kill.

271
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,520
So why didn't you?

272
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,360
Well this was stupid.

273
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,230
Why don't you just fly away?

274
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,320
Alright, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?

275
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,760
I mistimed my sommersault dive. It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble.

276
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,080
- Yeah, we noticed.  - No, no you were great. That was so Astrid.

277
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,580
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves. Where did Hiccup go wrong?

278
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,250
- Uh, he showed up?  - He didn't get eaten.

279
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,260
He's never where he should be.

280
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,880
Thank you, Astrid. You need to live and breathe this stuff.

281
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,280
The Dragon Manual... Everything we know about every dragon we know of.

282
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,840
No attacks tonight. Hurry up.

283
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,410
- Wait? You mean read?  - While we're still alive?

284
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,610
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?

285
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,380
Oh, I've read it like 7 times.

286
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,090
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face

287
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,480
and there's this other one that buries itself for like a week...

288
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah, sounds great. There was a chance I was going to read that.

289
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,670
But now...

290
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,780
You guys read, I'll go kill something.

291
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,490
Hey!

292
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,070
- So I guess we'll share?  - Read it.

293
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,300
All mine then? Wow. So, okay. I'll see you uh... tomorrow.

294
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,690
Dragon Classifications

295
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,280
Strike Class, Fear Class, Mystery Class.

296
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,490
Thunder Drum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

297
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,270
When startled, the Thunder Drum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range.

298
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,710
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

299
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,380
Timberjack: This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.

300
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,980
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

301
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,090
Skulldren: Sprays scalding water on its victim. Extremely dangerous...

302
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,730
Changeling: Even newly hatch dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

303
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,730
Gronckle, Zippleback, The Skrill,

304
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,450
Boneknapper, Whispering Death.

305
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,000
Burns its victims. Buries its victims. Chokes its victims.

306
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,890
Turns victims inside out.

307
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,680
Extremely dangerous... Extremely dangerous...

308
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,040
Kill on sight... Kill on sight... Kill on sight...

309
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,380
Night Fury: Speed unknown. Size unknown.

310
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,320
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.

311
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,530
Never engage this dragon.

312
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,460
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.

313
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,000
I can almost smell them. They're close.

314
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,560
Steady.

315
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,810
- Take us in.  - Hard to port.

316
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,750
The Hell Hounds gate.

317
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,730
Hard to port.

318
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,750
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice, the book had nothing on Night Furys.

319
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:43,080
Is there like another book? or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet?

320
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,300
Focus Hiccup! You're not even trying.

321
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,980
Today is all about attack!

322
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,870
Nadder's are quick and light on their feet. You be quicker and lighter.

323
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,630
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods.

324
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has one.

325
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,980
Find it. Hide in it, and strike.

326
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,450
- Do you ever bathe?  - You don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.

327
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,970
How about I give you one?

328
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,360
Blind spot, yes. Death spot, not-so-much.

329
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,080
Hey, hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?

330
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,050
No one's ever met one, and lived to tell the tale. Now, get in there!

331
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,370
I know, I know but hypothetically...

332
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,460
Watch out, babe, I'll take care of this.

333
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,090
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

334
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,590
What do you want me to do? Block out the sun?

335
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,920
I can do that. I don't have time right now.

336
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,850
- Has anyone ever seen one napping?  - Hiccup!

337
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,890
Hiccup!

338
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,650
- Love on the battlefield.  - She could do better.

339
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,520
L... Let me... why don't you...

340
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,130
Ow! Ow! Ow!

341
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,940
Well done, Astrid.

342
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,440
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

343
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,460
Our parent's war is about to become ours. Figure out which side your on.

344
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,660
Huh? Toothless.

345
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,470
I could of sworn you have...

346
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,780
teeth.

347
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,240
Uh, uh... no, no... no...

348
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,030
I... I don't have anymore.

349
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,770
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

350
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,130
And I saw the look in his face. I was delicious.

351
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,190
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month

352
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,320
before another one of them took my leg.

353
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,130
Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon?

354
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,940
Like, if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from the inside

355
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,260
by crushing his heart or something.

356
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,380
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

357
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,410
I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

358
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,920
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon I fight... with my face!

359
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,040
No. It's the wings and the tails you really want.

360
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,680
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

361
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,490
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

362
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,250
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

363
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,780
Alright, I'm off to bed.

364
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,650
You should be too. Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

365
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,650
Slowly but surely, making our way up to Monstruous Nightmare.

366
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:13,680
- But who'll win the honor of killing it?  - It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

367
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,960
- Your mom let you get a tattoo?  - It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark.

368
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,720
Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before.

369
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,010
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me to the left side until now.

370
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,740
Hey, Toothless. I brought breakfast.

371
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,750
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

372
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,940
Okay, that's disgusting.

373
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:21,470
I got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.

374
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,590
No, no, no, no... no... Okay.

375
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,830
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

376
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:41,280
That's it. That's the good stuff. Aah, don't you mind me.

377
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,220
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

378
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,940
It's okay...

379
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,810
Okay, okay...

380
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Okay, that's not too bad. It works.

381
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,840
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

382
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,940
Oh my... It's working!

383
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes, yes, I did it.

384
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,290
Today, is about teamwork.

385
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,230
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.

386
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,280
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.

387
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,640
One head breathes gas. The other head lights it.

388
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,500
Your job is to know which is which.

389
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,200
Razor-sharp serrated teeth, and injects venom for predigestion.

390
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,610
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims.

391
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,200
Will you please stop that?!

392
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,570
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...

393
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,620
There!

394
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,930
Hey, it's us, idiots!

395
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,280
Your butts are getting bigger we thought you were a dragon.

396
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,670
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragon-ass fig...

397
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,150
Wait...

398
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,220
Oh! Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

399
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,490
Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now.

400
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,770
Oh! Wrong head.

401
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,760
Fishlegs!

402
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,770
Now Hiccup!

403
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,790
Aww, come on...

404
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,630
Hiccup!

405
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,550
Back, back, back!

406
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,340
Now don't you make me tell you again!

407
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,540
Yes, that's right. Back into your cage!

408
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,660
Now think about what you've done.

409
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,750
Okay, sooo, were we done?

410
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,500
'Cause I have some things I need to uh... Yep, I'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,010
Hey!

412
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,180
- What was that?  - How did you do that?

413
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,750
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead.

414
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,030
I'll catch up with you.

415
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,410
Meet the Terrible Terror.

416
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,950
Ha! It's like the size of my...

417
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,610
Oooh! Get it off!

418
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,820
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

419
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,000
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

420
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,600
What?

421
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,120
Ooh, great.

422
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,030
Hiccup.

423
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,940
Hiccup? Are you in there?

424
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,840
Astrid, hey. Hi, Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid

425
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,310
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.

426
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,890
Well, weirder.

427
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,520
Well, I trust you found the nest at least?

428
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,980
Not even close.

429
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,660
Excellent.

430
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
I hope you had a little more success than me.

431
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,400
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with...

432
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,700
then, yes.

433
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,450
Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved.

434
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,610
Out with the old, and in with the new, right?

435
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,060
No one will miss that old nuisance.

436
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,510
The village is throwing a party to celebrate.

437
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,680
He's gone?

438
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,060
Um, yeah, most afternoons, but who can blame him?

439
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,180
I mean, the life of a celebrity is very rough.

440
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,780
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.

441
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,110
- Hiccup?  - Who would have thought it, eh?

442
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,650
He has this way with the beasts.

443
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,820
Okay there, bud, were gonna take this nice and slow.

444
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,230
Here we go. Here we go. Position three, no, four.

445
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,000
Alright, it's go time. It's go time.

446
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,330
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

447
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,500
Yes, it works!

448
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,700
Sorry!

449
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,550
That's my fault.

450
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,010
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four, uh, three.

451
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,400
Yeah! Go baby!

452
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,190
Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my...

453
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,940
cheat sheet!

454
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,990
Stop!

455
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,340
No!

456
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,340
Oh, Gosh! Oh, God!

457
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,790
Oh no!

458
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,100
Alright. Okay. You gotta kinda angle yourself!

459
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,460
Okay. No, no, no... Come back down towards me.

460
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,820
Come back down... Oww!

461
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,130
Yeah!

462
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,060
Come on...

463
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,550
Uh, no thanks. I'm good.

464
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,470
Not so fire-proof on the inside, are you?

465
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,030
Here you go.

466
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,430
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.

467
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,460
Dad, you're back!

468
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,390
Gobber's not here, so...

469
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,550
I know.

470
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,090
I came looking for you.

471
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,430
- You did?  - You've been keeping secrets.

472
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,180
I have?

473
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,290
Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

474
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,230
I... I don't know what you...

475
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,010
Nothing happens on this island, without me hearing about it.

476
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,050
Oh?

477
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:46,860
So, lets talk... about that dragon

478
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,920
Oh Gods...

479
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,890
Dad, I'm so sorry. I...

480
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:54,440
I was going to tell you, I just didn't know how to uh...

481
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,750
- You... you're not upset?  - What? I was hoping for this!

482
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,020
- Ah, you were?  - And believe me...

483
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,500
It only gets better. Just wait till you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time...

484
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,170
and mount your first Gronckle head on a spear.

485
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,270
What feeling! You really had me going there, son.

486
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:21,570
All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen.

487
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,300
Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you.

488
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,630
And all the while you were holding out on me.

489
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,430
Oh, Thor almighty!

490
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,570
With you doing so well in the ring...

491
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,290
we finally have something to talk about.

492
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,340
I uh, I brought you something...

493
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,230
to keep you safe in the ring.

494
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,580
Wow, thanks.

495
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,810
Your mother would wanted you to have it.

496
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,150
It's half of her breast plate.

497
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,140
Matching set. Keeps her... Keeps her close, you know.

498
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,760
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.

499
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,060
You've held your end of the deal.

500
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,970
I should really get to bed.

501
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,620
- Yes, good, okay, good talk.  - Yeah...

502
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,850
I'll see you back at the house. Great. Thanks for stopping by and...

503
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,030
- the uh... breast hat.  - I hope you like the, umm... the hat.

504
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,220
Well, good night.

505
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,500
Stay out of my way. I'm winning this thing!

506
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,660
Good. Please. By all means.

507
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,010
This time! This time for sure!

508
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:25,630
No! No, son-of-a half troll, rat-eating munch bucket...!

509
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,960
Wait! Wait.

510
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,130
So... later.

511
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,670
- Oh, oh! Not so fast!  - I'm kinda late for...

512
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,140
What! Late for what, exactly?

513
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,490
Okay, quiet down. The Elder has decided.

514
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,410
Boy, you've done it! You've done it, Hiccup!

515
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,630
You get to kill the dragon!

516
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,990
That's my boy!

517
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,290
Yeah! Yes, I can't wait. I am so...

518
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,500
leaving. We're Leaving.

519
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,700
Let's pack up.

520
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,730
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.

521
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,410
Forever.

522
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,120
Awww, man.

523
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,420
What the...? Uh, w... what are you doing here?

524
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,590
I want to know what's going on.

525
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,640
No one just get as good as you do.

526
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,750
Especially... you.

527
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,610
- Start talking.  - I... I...

528
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,610
Are you training with someone?

529
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,830
Training? I didn't...

530
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,740
It better not involve this.

531
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,090
I know, this looks really bad but you see, this is...

532
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,560
You're right. You're right. You're right. I... I'm through with the lies.

533
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,100
I've been making... outfits!

534
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,050
So, you got me. It's time everyone knew.

535
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,450
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

536
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,690
Oww. Why would you do that?

537
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,420
That's for the lies!

538
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,760
And that's... for everything else!

539
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,880
Oh man.

540
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,040
Get down!

541
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,250
Run! Run!

542
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:10,370
No! No! It's okay. It's okay. She's a friend.

543
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,800
You just scared him.

544
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,190
I scared him?

545
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,680
Who is him?

546
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,210
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

547
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,540
Dut, da da... We're dead.

548
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,330
Woah, woah woah. Where do you think your going?

549
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,110
Oh, great Odin! Don't. Oh, this is...

550
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,600
Hiccup, get me down from here!

551
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,790
You have to give me a chance to explain.

552
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,900
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

553
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,870
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

554
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,940
Please, Astrid.

555
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,510
Now get me down!

556
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,370
Toothless, down. Gently.

557
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,540
See, nothing to be afraid of.

558
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,110
Toothless?

559
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,130
What is wrong with you? Bad dragon!

560
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,190
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

561
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,360
Oh, no!

562
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,920
Toothless, what are you doing? We need her to like us!

563
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,510
And now he's spinning!

564
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,090
Thank you for nothing you useless reptile!

565
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,290
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry. Just get me off of this thing.

566
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,860
Alright, I admit it. This is pretty cool.

567
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:03,000
It's amazing. He's amazing.

568
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,210
So what now?

569
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,090
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

570
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,100
You know your gonna have to kill a...

571
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,030
kill a dragon...

572
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,400
Don't remind me.

573
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,670
Toothless, what happening?

574
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,360
Whoa, what is it?

575
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,570
Get down!

576
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,780
- What's going on?  - I don't know.

577
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,550
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.

578
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,910
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

579
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,570
What does that make us?

580
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,690
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

581
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,740
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.

582
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,630
They're not eating any of it.

583
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,380
What... was that?

584
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,470
Alright, bud, we gotta get out of here. Now!

585
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,420
No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.

586
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,960
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

587
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,920
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

588
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,090
No, no.

589
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,160
No. Not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

590
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,720
Astrid, we have to think this through, carefully.

591
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,760
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragon's nest.

592
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,790
The thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here.

593
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,650
And you want to keep it secret?

594
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:12,000
To protect your pet, dragon? Are you serious?

595
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,650
Yes.

596
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,220
Okay. Then what do we do?

597
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,250
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

598
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,280
Okay...

599
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,000
That's for kidnapping me.

600
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,660
That's for... everything else.

601
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,450
What are you looking at?

602
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,080
Well, I can show my face in public again.

603
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,130
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks

604
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,630
Hiccup will go from... well being... uh... Hiccup,

605
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,990
to placing first in dragon training.

606
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,570
Well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

607
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,090
And you know it.

608
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,420
But, here we are.

609
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,020
And no ones more surprised or more proud than I am.

610
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,170
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

611
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,230
Today he becomes one of us!

612
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,010
Be careful with that dragon.

613
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,840
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

614
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,450
What are you going to do?

615
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,040
Put an end to this.

616
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,740
I have to try.

617
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:01,710
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.

618
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:05,910
I will, just promise me it won't go wrong.

619
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,130
It's time, Hiccup.

620
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,140
Knock 'em dead.

621
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,710
I'd have gone for the hammer.

622
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,000
I'm ready.

623
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,110
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

624
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,450
What is he doing?

625
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,640
It's okay, it's okay.

626
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,280
I'm not one of them.

627
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,680
What's he thinking?

628
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,870
Stop the fight!

629
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,680
No! I need you all to see this.

630
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,400
They're not what we think they are.

631
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,510
We don't have to kill them.

632
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,290
I said stop the fight!

633
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,140
Out of my way!

634
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,160
Hiccup!

635
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,390
Hiccup!

636
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,810
This way!

637
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,940
Night Fury!

638
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,200
Alright, Toothless. Go! Get out of here.

639
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,960
Go, go!

640
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,330
No, dad! Dad, he won't hurt you!

641
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,560
Toothless, stop!

642
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,180
No. No!

643
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,490
Get him!

644
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,390
No, no, please. Just don't hurt him

645
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,730
Please. Don't hurt him

646
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,360
Put it with the others.

647
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,110
I should have known.

648
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,890
I should have seen the signs.

649
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,640
- Dad?  - We had a deal!

650
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,710
I know! We did, but that was before I... Oh, it's all so messed up.

651
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,170
So everything in that ring... A trick? A lie?

652
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,110
I screwed up. I should have told you before now.

653
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,510
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

654
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,570
The dragon? That's what you're worried about?

655
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,650
Not the people you almost killed?

656
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,840
He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.

657
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,370
They've killed hundreds of us!

658
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:24,740
And we've killed thousands of them. They defend themselves, that's all.

659
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,670
They raid us because they have to.

660
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:31,750
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.

661
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:35,870
There's something else on their island, dad. It's a dragon-like...

662
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,460
Their island? So, you've been to the nest?

663
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,560
- Did I say nest?  - How did you find it?

664
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,540
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.

665
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,060
No, no, dad, no please. It's not what you think.

666
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,360
You don't know what your up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen.

667
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,890
Dad, please, I promise you. You can't win this one!

668
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,070
Dad, no!

669
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,500
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me!

670
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,160
You've thrown your lot in with them.

671
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,440
You're not a Viking.

672
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,970
You're not my son!

673
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,270
Ready the ships!

674
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,550
Set sail!

675
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,800
We head for Hell Hounds gate.

676
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,710
Lead us home, devil.

677
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,920
It's a mess. You must feel horrible.

678
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:00,040
You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.

679
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,160
Thank you for summing that up.

680
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,050
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon, when I found him the woods?

681
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,720
Would've been better for everyone.

682
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,550
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

683
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,610
So, why didn't you?

684
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,910
Why didn't you?

685
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,970
I don't know. I couldn't.

686
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,480
- That's not an answer.  - Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

687
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,220
Because I want to remember what you say, right now.

688
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,650
Ah, for the love of... I was coward, I was weak.

689
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,580
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

690
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,900
You said wouldn't that time?

691
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,930
Whatever, I wouldn't!

692
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:42,130
300 years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

693
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,470
First to ride one though.

694
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,010
So?

695
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:58,090
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.

696
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,670
I looked at him and I saw myself.

697
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,800
I bet he's really frightened now.

698
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,140
What are you gonna do about it?

699
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:13,370
Probably something stupid.

700
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,640
Good, but you've already done that.

701
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:18,860
Then something crazy!

702
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,920
That's more like it.

703
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,040
Sound your positions! Stay within earshot.

704
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:41,390
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men just now and well, you know...

705
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,150
some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here?

706
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,590
Not me of course. I know you are always the man with the plan.

707
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,060
But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all...

708
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,310
and what it might be?

709
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,130
Find the nest and take it.

710
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,780
Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fallback. Nice and simple.

711
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,610
Step aside.

712
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,790
Head to port.

713
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:36,120
If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

714
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,400
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.

715
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,360
It's me.

716
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,760
- I love this plan!  - I didn't...

717
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,630
You're crazy. I like that.

718
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,100
So, what is the plan?

719
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,020
That's not very encouraging.

720
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,850
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

721
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:22,140
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

722
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,990
We're here.

723
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:13,960
Wait, what are you... ?!

724
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,670
It's okay... It's okay.

725
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,180
Where are you going?

726
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:33,060
You're gonna need something to help you hold on.

727
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:46,330
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is gonna break loose.

728
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:49,050
In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.

729
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,590
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

730
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,080
Is that it?

731
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,370
We've done it!

732
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,440
This isn't over!

733
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,930
Form your ranks. Pull together!

734
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,050
Get clear!

735
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,700
Beards of Thor...! What is that?

736
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,680
Odin, help us!

737
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,570
- Catapults!  - Fire!

738
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,610
- Get to the ships!  - No, nooo!

739
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,560
- Not that one...  - I was a fool.

740
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,790
Lead the men to the far side of the island.

741
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,160
Gobber, go with the men.

742
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,210
I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy.

743
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,490
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing something to hunt for.

744
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:27,310
Then I can double that time.

745
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,970
- Here!  - Oh, no. Here!

746
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,650
- Fight me!  - No, me!

747
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,620
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

748
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,400
Move, Fishlegs!

749
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:02,380
Look at us! We're on dragons! We're on dragons! All of us!

750
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:11,200
Every bit the bull-headed stubborn Viking you ever were.

751
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,600
- Fishlegs, break it down!  - Okay.

752
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:18,720
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

753
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:22,190
Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.

754
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,270
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise. Keep it confused.

755
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,300
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

756
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,790
- That's my specialty!  - Since when?

757
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:33,670
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

758
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,560
Just do what I told you. I'll be back as soon as I can.

759
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,980
Don't worry! We got it covered!

760
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,230
Yeah!

761
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,340
- Fool!  - Butto!

762
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,700
Bye, ya Grendel!

763
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:00,330
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

764
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,100
There!

765
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,160
Go help the others!

766
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,700
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

767
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,710
- It's working!  - Yeah, it's working!

768
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:37,350
I've lost power on the Gronckle! Snotlout, do something!

769
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:40,680
I'm okay!

770
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,980
Less okay.

771
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:49,550
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy? You got something in your eye?

772
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,430
Yeah, you're the Viking!

773
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:02,300
Woah!

774
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,410
Dad?

775
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,680
You got it, buddy!

776
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,540
Hiccup!

777
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,050
I'm sorry...

778
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:03,580
for... for everything.

779
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,520
Yeah... me too.

780
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,140
You don't have to go up there.

781
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,260
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard...

782
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,010
I'm proud to call you my son.

783
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,380
Thanks, Dad.

784
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,140
He's up!

785
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,280
Get Snotlout outta there!

786
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,600
- I'm on it!  - I'm on it first!

787
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,820
Hey, let me drive!

788
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,850
- Don't push me!  - I'll push your teeth out!

789
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,240
You know, I can't believe that worked.

790
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,940
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

791
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:04,820
Did you get her?

792
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,330
Go!

793
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,120
This thing has wings. Okay, let's see if it can use them!

794
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,950
You think that did it?

795
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,860
Well, he can fly.

796
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,200
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear! Come on, bud!

797
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,940
Here it comes!

798
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,120
Watch out!

799
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,960
Okay, time's up. Let's see if this works.

800
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,950
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

801
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,440
Stay with me, buddy. We're good. Just a little bit longer.

802
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,570
Hold, Toothless. Now!

803
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:15,960
No... No!

804
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,980
Hiccup! Hiccup!

805
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,860
Son!

806
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:42,590
Hiccup!

807
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,360
Oh son!

808
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,610
I did this.

809
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:42,940
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

810
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,800
Hiccup!

811
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:59,940
He's alive! You brought him back alive!

812
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,890
Thank you... for saving my son.

813
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,960
Well, you know, most of him.

814
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,420
Hey, Toothless.

815
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,470
Happy to see you too, buddy.

816
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:51,700
Aawww, what... uh... I'm... in my house

817
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,820
You're in my house.

818
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,290
Does my dad know you're here?

819
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,400
Uh, what, oh, okay... okay.

820
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:04,160
Toothless, no. Toothless! Aw, come on.

821
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,840
Okay. Thanks, bud.

822
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,760
Toothless, stay here.

823
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:01,260
C'mon guys. Get ready! Hold on tight. Here we go!

824
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,060
What?

825
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:16,020
I knew it. I'm dead.

826
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,020
No, but you give it your best shot.

827
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,010
So, what do you think?

828
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,670
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

829
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,110
Hiccup!

830
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:31,350
It turns out, all we needed was a little more of... this.

831
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,600
You just gestured to all of me?

832
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,000
Well, most of you. That bit's my handiwork.

833
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:41,510
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in. You think that'll do?

834
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,880
I might make a few tweaks.

835
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:47,580
That's... for scaring me.

836
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,080
What... what, is it always going to be this way? Because...

837
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,560
I could get used to it.

838
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,420
Welcome home.

839
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,870
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

840
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,680
You ready?

841
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:18,970
This is Berk...

842
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:23,690
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.

843
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,200
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.

844
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:33,490
The people that grow here are even more so.

845
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,980
The only upsides are the pets.

846
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,970
While other places have ponies or parrots...

847
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,090
We have...

848
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,000
Dragons.
