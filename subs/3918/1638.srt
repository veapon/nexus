1
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,187
这里是博克岛
This is Berk

2
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,512
有像北极那样12天绝望的严寒 也有南极酷冷的垂死之感
It's 12 days North of hopeless and a few degrees South of freezing to death.

3
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,746
岛就坐落在"悲剧子午线"上
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,926
这就是我的家乡 简而言之: 一成不变
My village. In a word: sturdy. 

5
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:54,884
现在这里是第七代人了 但是房子都还很新
It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. 

6
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:59,745
我们打渔 打猎 还可以欣赏迷人的夕阳
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. 

7
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,107
唯一的问题是害虫
The only problems are the pests. 

8
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:06,214
一般来说 害虫都是老鼠或是蚊子
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. 

9
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,272
但我们的是 
We have...

10
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:13,642
龙
Dragons.

11
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:17,308
大多数人选择离开 但是不是我们
Most people would leave, but not us.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,526
我们是维京人
We're Vikings. 

13
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,958
我们拥有顽强
We stubbornness issues.

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,414
我叫Hiccup
My name is Hiccup. 

15
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,027
我知道不是什么伟大的名字 但是也不是最糟的
Great name, I know. But it's not the worst. 

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,242
父母们相信一个难听的名字可以驱赶地精和恶魔
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off Gnomes and Trolls. 

17
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:34,170
好像我们维京勇士的壮举还不如一个名字
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. 

18
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,323
早
'Morning.

19
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,324
你在这里做什么? 进去!
What are you doing here? Get inside!

20
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:43,163
快回去!
Get back inside!

21
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:50,610
Hiccup! 你又出来干什么  你出来干什么? 回去!
Hiccup! What is he doing out again... What are you doing out? Get inside!

22
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:54,323
这是大块头Stoick 部落的首领
That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe. 

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:58,912
他们说他还是婴儿的时候 他就能把龙头从它的脖子上扭下来
They say that when he was a baby he popped a Dragon's head clean off its shoulders. 

24
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,909
我相信吗? 当然信
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

25
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,847
有哪些龙?
What have we got?

26
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:06,094
Gronckles Nadders Zipplebacks  哦 还有凶魇群龙
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks... Oh, and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,489
有没有夜煞?
Any Night Furys?

28
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,002
现在还没有   很好
None so far.   Good.

29
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,837
点燃火炬!
Light the torches!

30
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:22,012
哦 很高兴你也来参加这样的晚会 我还以为你被抓走了
Oh, nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.

31
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:27,009
谁? 我? 得了吧  我肌肉太多 它们不喜欢
Who? Me? Nah, come on... I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,835
它们不知道怎么吃所有的  这些
They wouldn't know what to do with all... this.

33
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,606
好吧 它们需要牙签 是吧?
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:36,772
那个脾气暴躁 还装着义肢的傻瓜叫Gobber
The meathead with the attitude and interchangeable hands, is Gobber. 

35
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,239
我从小做他的学徒
I have been his apprentice ever since I was little. 

36
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,326
嗯 比现在小一点
Well, littler 

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,866
我们去空旷的地方防守 用投射器反攻
We move to the moor defenses. We'll counterattack with the catapults.

38
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,718
看见了吗? 老村落 却有很多很多新房子
See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses. 

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,729
着火了!
Fire!

40
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,154
哦 那是Fishlegs
Oh, and that's Fishlegs 

41
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,065
那是Snotlout
Snotlout 

42
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,931
双胞胎Ruffnut和Tuffnut 
The twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

43
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,284
还有 
And...

44
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,908
是Astrid
Astrid. 

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,407
喔 他们的工作酷多了
Aww, their job is so much cooler.

46
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,977
哦 拜托 放我出去 我要建功!
Oh, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark!

47
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,940
哦 你已经做了很多的贡献了 但是都是错误的
Oh, you have made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.

48
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:28,172
就两分钟 我会杀了一条龙的 我的人生就将从此改变
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better.

49
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,751
我甚至能去约会
I might even get a date.

50
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:32,375
你连榔头都举不起 连斧头都挥不动
You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe.

51
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,037
甚至这其中一个都扔不出
You can't even throw one of these.

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,311
好 好 但是这个可以帮我扔
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

53
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,587
看见了吗 就和我说的一样
See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,025
但是 它  它只要再稍稍校准下
But it... it's a mild calibration issue.

55
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,255
Hiccup 如果你想去和龙战斗
Hiccup, if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons

56
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,759
你必须改变这些 
you need to stop all....

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,226
这些
this.

58
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,140
但是你指的是我的全身
But you just pointed to all of me.

59
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,969
是 就是全身
Yes, that's it.

60
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,249
要脱胎换骨
Stop being all of you.

61
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,975
哦    哦 是
Oh...   Oh, yes.

62
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,154
先生 您这是在玩一个危险的游戏 
You sir, are playing a dangerous game...

63
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:07,384
保持维京人这种原始的特质
keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

64
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,122
后果会很严重!   我会承担的
There will be consequences!   I take my chances.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,380
去磨剑 快走!
Sword, sharpened, now!

66
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,670
总有一天 我会到那里的
One day I'll get out there. 

67
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,371
因为在这里 杀死龙意味着一切
Because killing a dragon is everything around here. 

68
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,117
打倒一条Nadder至少可以让我得到注意
A Nadderhead is sure to get me at least noticed.

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,404
Gronckles很强硬
Gronckles are tough.

70
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,737
打倒一条肯定可以找到一个女朋友
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend. 

71
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,377
一条Zippleback:  
A Zippleback: ...

72
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,186
不太现实 两个头 双倍的难度
exotic, two heads, twice the status. 

73
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:37,646
他们找到羊了!
They found the sheep!

74
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,880
向下面集中火力!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

75
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:40,611
快!
Hurry up!

76
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,010
开火!
Fire!

77
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,434
还有 凶魇
And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare. 

78
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,478
只有最棒的维京人敢挑战它们
Only the best Vikings go after those. 

79
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,184
它们有一个讨人厌的坏习惯 把自己点燃
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire. 

80
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,109
再次填装!
Reload!

81
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,276
我可以应付
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:02,467
但是最让人觊觎的龙 还没有人见到过
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.

83
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:03,781
我们叫它 
We call it the...

84
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:05,801
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

85
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,021
跳!
Jump!

86
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:15,643
它从不偷东西 从不现身 然而 
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and...

87
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,508
从未失手
never misses. 

88
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:21,591
没人杀死过夜煞
No one has ever killed a Night Fury. 

89
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,574
这就是我想成为第一个的原因
That's why I'm going to be the first. 

90
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,064
守住阵地 Hiccup 他们需要我
Mind the fort, Hiccup. They need me out there.

91
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,498
呆着! 别动!
Stay! Put!

92
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,964
就这里
There.

93
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,198
你知道我是什么意思
You know what I mean.

94
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,005
Hiccup 你在干什么?   回来!
Hiccup, what are you doing?   Come back here!

95
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,338
我知道 马上回来!
Yeah, I know, Be right back!

96
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,624
自己小心!
Mind yourself!

97
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,236
那些恶魔还有些能量
The devils still have some juice in them.

98
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:01,669
来吧
Come on.

99
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,314
给我些目标 给我目标
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

100
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:29,166
哦! 我击中了? 是的 我击中了!
Oh! I hit it? Yes, I hit it!

101
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,303
有人看见吗?
Did anybody see that?

102
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,648
除了你
Except for you.

103
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,754
别让它们跑了!   好的!
Do not let them escape!   Right!

104
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,166
你等死吧
You're all out.

105
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,334
哦 还有一件事你要知道 
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...

106
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,603
抱歉 爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

107
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,913
但是我击中了夜煞
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

108
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,368
和上几次不一样 爸爸!
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

109
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,270
我是说 我真的击中了 
I mean, I really actually hit...

110
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,735
你们正在忙 我很漂亮地击中了
You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot.

111
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:45,443
它掉在黑区 快派人过去搜 
It went down just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there before...

112
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:46,968
闭嘴!
Stop!

113
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,260
给我闭嘴!
Just, stop!

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,577
你一出门 灾难就降临
Every time you step outside disaster falls.

115
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,838
你没发现我还有更大的麻烦吗?
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

116
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,458
冬天临近了 我还得喂饱全村人!
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!

117
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,450
看这身材差距 如果都不像你们这么硕大 村子也可以少负担些口粮?
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't you think?

118
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,786
这不是在开玩笑 Hiccup!
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

119
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,923
你就不能老实一点?
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

120
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,862
我控制不住自己 每当我看到龙 就想 
I, I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just...

121
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,291
杀了它 爸爸 这就是我
kill it. You know, it's who I am, Dad.

122
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:21,811
哦 你可以胜任很多职责 但决不是捕龙者 Hiccup
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup, but a dragon killer is not one of them.

123
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:26,136
回到屋子里去 确保他回去
Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there.

124
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,644
我还得收拾他的烂摊子
I have his mess to clean up.

125
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,021
演出结束了
Quite the performance.

126
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,837
好厉害的败家子啊 太帅了!
I've never seen any one mess up that badly. That helped!

127
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,811
谢谢 谢谢 我一直在努力
Thank you. Thank you. I was trying.

128
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:42,761
我真的射中了一条   当然 Hiccup
I really did hit one.   Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,852
他从来不听我说的   哎 每个家庭基本都这样
He never listens.   Well, it runs in the family.

130
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:47,793
就算信了 也满腹牢骚
And when he does, it's always with this disappointed scowl

131
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,161
就好像有人偷吃了他三明治中的肉
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,366
不好意思 女招待 我想你搞错了吧
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:59,090
我要的是壮如牛的男孩 另外还得有勇气和荣誉感
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,920
这个 你给我的分明是火柴棒!
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

135
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:04,095
不 你想错了
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,937
他在乎的不是你的外表 他看重的是你的灵魂
It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,320
谢谢你的总结
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:15,447
关键是别强迫自己做力所不能及的事
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.

139
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,310
我只是想和你们大伙一样
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,273
要么我们赶走那群龙 要么它们消灭我们
Either we face them or they'll finish us. 

141
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,056
想要把龙赶走只有一招
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,593
如果我们找到并摧毁龙巢 它们就会离开
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

143
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,399
它们会去别处定居
They'll find another home.

144
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,279
在水面冻结前 我们再搜寻一次
One more search, before the ice sets in.

145
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,229
以前派出的船都失踪了
Those ships never come back.

146
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,206
我们是维京人 冒险是维京人的天职
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

147
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,806
那么 谁和我一起去?
Now who's with me?

148
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,314
好吧  留下来的人照看Hiccup
Alright... Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

149
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,979
我去收拾行李了
I'll pack my undies.

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,905
不 我需要你留下来训练新手
No, I need you to stay, and train some new recruits.

151
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:09,612
哦 太棒了 是的 我忙时 Hiccup可以来帮忙
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy Hiccup can cover the store.

152
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:13,929
他负责熔铁 磨刀 有很多时间 
Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...

153
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:15,666
会有什么问题呢?
What could possibly go wrong?

154
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,761
我该怎么办呢 Gobber?
Oh, what am I going to do with him, Gobber?

155
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,359
让他和其他人一起训练
Put him in training with the others.

156
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,498
我是认真的   我也是
No, I'm serious.   So am I.

157
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:24,750
在你放出第一条龙之前 他就会被吓死
He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.

158
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:26,611
你不了解   我了解
Oh, you don't know that.   I do know that.

159
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,385
不 你不了解   我了解
No， you don't   No, actually, I do.

160
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,369
不 你不了解   听我说 你知道他是怎样的一个人
No, you don't.   Listen, you know what he's like.

161
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:35,158
从他会爬开始 我就发现他  和别人不一样
From the time he could crawl he's been... different.

162
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:39,682
他从来不听我的话 他宁可盯着看麻雀
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.

163
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:43,851
我带他去捕鱼 他却跑去找  巨魔!
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for Trolls!

164
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,526
真有巨魔! 它们偷了你的袜子 
Trolls exist! They steal your socks.

165
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,351
但它们只偷左脚的 为什么呢?
But only the left ones. What's with that?

166
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,503
我小的时候    哦 又来了
When I was a boy...   Oh, here we go.

167
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:54,511
我父亲让我用头去撞石头 我照做了
My father told me to bang my head against a rock, and I did it.

168
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,216
我觉得这很疯狂 但是我没问他为什么
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.

169
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,221
你猜怎么着了?
And you know what happened?

170
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:01,409
你犯头疼病了   石头裂成了两半
You got a headache.   That rock split in two.

171
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:05,277
这让我体会到一个维京人的潜力 Gobber
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

172
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,885
他能撞碎山脉 夷平森林
He could crush mountains, level forests,

173
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,347
征服大海
tame seas!

174
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,039
在我还是个孩子的时候 我就知道我会变成什么 
Even as a boy I knew what I was, what I had to become...

175
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,866
可是Hiccup却不能
Hiccup is not that boy.

176
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:21,888
你不能阻止他 Stoick 你只应该为他做好准备
You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him.

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,612
我知道这希望渺茫 但是你不能总是保护他
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is you won't always be around to protect him.

178
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:30,622
他迟早会再出去 说不定就是现在
He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now.

179
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,683
哦 上帝不喜欢我
Oh, the Gods hate me.

180
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,626
有些人会弄丢刀子 杯子
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

181
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,757
不 不应该是我啊! 我弄丢了一条龙 
No, not me! I managed to lose an entire dragon.

182
00:11:58,489 --> 00:11:59,227
嗷!
Ow!

183
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:49,212
哦 哇? 这是我  我干的吗? 哦 是我干的!
Oh, wow? I... I did it? Oh, I did it!

184
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:52,064
这玩意儿真是万能的 是的!
This fixes everything. Yes!

185
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,663
我放倒了一头大野兽!
I have brought down this mighty beast!

186
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,031
我要杀了你 可怜的龙
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

187
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:29,086
我会  我会切出你的心脏 交给我爸
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father.

188
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,110
我是维京人
I'm a Viking.

189
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,417
我是维京人!
I'm a Viking!

190
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,844
是我做的
I did this.

191
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,443
Hiccup啊
Hiccup.

192
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,423
爸爸? 呃 
Dad? Uh...

193
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,650
我有话和你说 爸爸   儿子 我也正想和你说些事
I have to talk to you, Dad.   I need to speak with you too, son.

194
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,665
我认为你该学习屠龙了   我不想屠龙
I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.   I don't want to fight dragons.

195
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:36,244
什么?   什么?
What?   What?

196
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,707
你先说   还是你先说吧
Uh, you go first.   No, no, you go first.

197
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:41,230
好吧 你如愿以偿了
All right. You got your wish.

198
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,380
屠龙训练 明早开始
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

199
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,182
哦 早知道我就先说了
Oh man, I should have gone first.

200
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:52,014
呃 我一直在想 你也知道 我们屠龙的人手过剩 但是 
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know, we have a surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but...

201
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:56,670
后勤的人手不够
do we have enough breadmaking Vikings, or small home repair Vikings...

202
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,269
你需要这个   我不想屠龙
You'll need this.   I don't want to fight dragons.

203
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:05,996
哦 来吧 你能行的   换句话说 爸爸 我杀不了龙
Oh come on, yes you do.   Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

204
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,780
但是你会杀死龙的
But you will kill dragons.

205
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,660
不 我很确定 我不会
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

206
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,057
是时候了 Hiccup   你没听我说吗?
It's time, Hiccup.   Can you not hear me?

207
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,667
这事很严肃 儿子
This is serious, son.

208
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:20,616
当你握紧这把战斧 你就肩负起了我们整个维京族
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.

209
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:26,605
也就是说: 你能像我们一样走路 像我们一样讲话 像我们一样思考
Which means: You walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us.

210
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:31,165
不再如此  懦弱   你只是在对我指手画脚
No more of... this.   You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,933
就这么定了?   一直是你在自言自语
Deal?   This conversation is feeling very onesided.

212
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:35,959
就这么定了? 
Deal?

213
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,393
定了
Deal.

214
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:41,836
棒极了 
Good.

215
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,333
好好训练
Train hard.

216
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,786
我会回来的 大概吧
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:51,703
我也会在这里等你 也许
And I'll be here, maybe.

218
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,618
欢迎参加训龙课程
Welcome to dragon training.

219
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,947
没有回头路
No turning back.

220
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:17,670
我真希望我能被烧伤
I hope I get some serious burns.

221
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:21,296
我只希望肩膀或者后背有一些抓伤
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.

222
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,815
是啊 伤疤什么的 很有意思
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

223
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:27,451
是啊 这不是闹着玩的 对吗? 我喜欢疼痛
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

224
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,415
哦 天哪 谁让他进来的?
Oh, great, who let him in?

225
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,478
开始吧 最棒的那个人
Lets get started. The recruit who does best,

226
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:36,876
能得到在全村人面前杀死第一条龙的荣耀!
will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.

227
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,700
Hiccup都已经杀了一条夜煞了 这点小事对他不过是自降身份罢了吧 ?
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or...?

228
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:43,991
我能转到其他的训练班里吗?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?

229
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:48,250
别担心 你又弱又小 被龙当成目标的概率也低
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak, That will make you a less of a target.

230
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:53,708
和你这样的豆芽菜比起来 它们更喜欢一些强壮的维京少年
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Vikinglike teens instead.

231
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,455
在这扇门后面的只是你们以后会遇到的所有龙里
Behind these doors are just a few of the

232
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,075
微不足道的几种
many species you will learn to fight.

233
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,314
致命Nadder  C速度8 防御16
The Deadly Nadder.   Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

234
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,555
丑陋Zippleback   潜行11速翻倍
The Hideous Zippleback.   11 Stealth times two.

235
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,863
凶魇  C火力15
The Monstrous Nightmare.   Fire Power: 15.

236
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,204
恶龙Terror   8攻12毒
The Terrible Terror.   Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

237
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:10,906
给我住嘴!
Can you stop that!

238
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:15,438
还有Gronckle   咬合力8
And the Gronckle.   Jaw Strength: 8.

239
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,899
喂 等一下 你不是应该先教我们吗?
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

240
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:21,024
我一直坚信实践是最好的学习方法
I believe in learning on the job.

241
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,966
今天是龙穴生存日 如果你被火球喷个正着 就会当场毙命
Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead. 

242
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,784
快! 你们最需要的是什么?
Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?

243
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,391
医生?   加速魔药?
A doctor?   + 5 Speed?

244
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,350
盾?   盾牌! 盾牌在那
A shield?   Shield. Go.

245
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,287
你们最重要的装备就是盾牌
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield.

246
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,372
如果只能在剑和盾牌里选一样
If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield.

247
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,636
盾牌会是你唯一的选择
Take the shield.

248
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,810
把你的脏手从我的盾牌上拿开!   那里不是还有一堆吗?
Get your hands off my shield.   There's like a million shields.

249
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,224
拿那一个 这个上面画的是一朵花 女孩子喜欢
Take that one. It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

250
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,623
哦哦 现在倒是又有了点血迹了
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

251
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,631
Tuffnut Ruffnut 出局
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

252
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,629
什么?   什么?
What?   What?

253
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,569
这个盾牌别有用处 噪音
Those shields are good for another thing. Noise.

254
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,973
用武器敲打盾牌发出噪音 让龙无法识别目标
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

255
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,004
所有的龙能发出的火球都是有限的
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

256
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,056
一条Gronckle有几个?
How many does a Gronckle have?

257
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:06,506
5?   不 是6发
Five?   No, six.

258
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,496
没错 六发 你们每个人都刚好分到那么一下
Right, six. Thats one for each of you.

259
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,109
Fishlegs 出局

So anyway, I moved into my parent's basement?

262
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:20,455

记住 一条龙 
Remember, a dragon will always...

270
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,758
只会为杀戮而行动
always go for the kill.

271
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:05,522
那你为什么没有这么做呢?
So why didn't you?

272
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,369
哦 这真是太蠢了
Well this was stupid.

273
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,237
你为什么不飞走呢?

I mistimed my sommersault dive. It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble.

Yeah, we noticed.   No, no you were great. That was so Astrid.

277
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,588
她是对的 你们都应该对自己更加严格 那Hiccup又哪里做错了?
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves. Where did Hiccup go wrong?

278
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:14,255
呃 他就不应该出现   他该让自己被吃掉
Uh, he showed up?   He didn't get eaten.

279
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,269
他从来不呆在该呆的地方
He's never where he should be.

280
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,886
谢谢 Astrid 你们需要把这东西背得滚瓜烂熟

Wait? You mean read?   While we're still alive?

284
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,616
我们明明可以直接把龙杀掉 为什么还要读这鬼东西?
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?

285

Well done, Astrid.

342
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,447
这对你来说又是笑话吗?
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

343
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:38,465
我们马上要接过父母的武器 搞清楚你是哪一边的
Our parent's war is about to become ours. Figure out which side your on.

Huh? Toothless.

345
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:05,475

346
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:08,781
牙
teeth.

347
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,247
呃 不  不  不 
Uh, uh... no, no... no...

348
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:17,031
我  我没有更多的了
I... I don't have anymore.

349
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,776
它一扭 咬下了我的一只手 吞了下去
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

350
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,136
我看到它脸上的表情 一定在说美味极了
And I saw the look in his face. I was delicious.

351
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,196
它一定回去大肆宣传了 因为不到一个月
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month

352
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,327
另一条咬下了我的一条腿
before another one of them took my leg.

353
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,134
你的手在龙的肚子里不会感到奇怪吗?
Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon?

354
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,941
就好比如果你还能控制你的手 你就可以由内攻外
Like, if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from the inside

355
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,262
通过捏爆它的心脏而取胜
by crushing his heart or something.

356
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,381
我此刻真的非常生气 我发誓
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

357
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:41,414
要为你那优雅的手和美丽的腿复仇
I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

358
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:44,921
我要亲眼目睹自己砍下打的每一条龙的  腿!
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon I fight... with my face!

359
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,045
不 要砍下龙的翅膀和尾巴
No. It's the wings and the tails you really want.

360
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:51,683
如果它飞不了了 它也活不久了
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

361
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,493
一条不能飞的龙就是临死的龙
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

362
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:56,256
是   是
Yeah.   Yeah.

363
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,783
好了 我要去睡觉了
Alright, I'm off to bed.

364
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:02,658
你们也早点休息啊 明天还有大玩意儿
You should be too. Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

365
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,656
我们慢慢地逼近凶魇
Slowly but surely, making our way up to Monstruous Nightmare.

366
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:13,681
但是谁能够得到杀死龙的荣耀呢?   一定是我 命中注定的
But who'll win the honor of killing it?   It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

367
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:17,962
你妈妈同意你文身?   这不是文身 这是胎记
Your mom let you get a tattoo?   It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark.

368
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:21,727
好吧 我从出生就和你在一起 但是从没有见到过
Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before. 

369
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:25,019
是的 这是胎记 因为你从不看我的左边
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me to the left side until now. 

370
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,746
嘿 无牙 我拿早饭来了
Hey, Toothless. I brought breakfast.

371
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,750
我希望  我希望你饥肠辘辘了
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

372
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,945
好吧 这确实很恶心
Okay, that's disgusting.

373
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:21,475
我拿来了一些鲑鱼 冰岛鳕鱼 还有鳗鱼
I got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.

374
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:28,598
不 不 不 不  不  好吧
No, no, no, no... no... Okay.

375
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,833
是 我也不喜欢鳗鱼
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

376
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:41,282
就是这样 这可是好东西 别管我
That's it. That's the good stuff. Aah, don't you mind me.

377
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,224
我马上回来 忙我自己的事情
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

378
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,946
没事的 
It's okay...

379
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,811
好的 好的 
Okay, okay...

380
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,164
好 这不糟糕 起作用了
Okay, that's not too bad. It works.

381
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:35,848
不 不 不 不 不 !
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

382
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,941
哦天哪  成功了!
Oh my... It's working!

383
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:56,809
是的 是的 我做到了
Yes, yes, I did it.

384

One head breathes gas. The other head lights it.

388
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,508

我是说 名人的生活也不简单
I mean, the life of a celebrity is very rough.

473
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,295
你觉得你可以藏多久呢?
Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

474
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:35,236

leaving. We're Leaving.

519
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:04,708
我们收拾东西吧
Let's pack up.

520
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:07,735
貌似你和我要一起度个假
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.

521
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,417
没有尽头的假期
Forever.

522
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:14,125
啊 老兄啊
Awww, man.

523
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,423
什么啊 ? 啊 你  在这干什么呢?
What the...? Uh, w... what are you doing here?

524
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:21,595
我想知道事情的真相
I want to know what's going on.

525
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:24,644
没有人可以做的跟你一样好
No one just get as good as you do.

526
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:26,752
特别是  你
Especially... you.

527
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,617
快说   我  我
Start talking.   I... I...

528
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:29,610
是不是有人跟你一起训练?
Are you training with someone?

529
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:30,832
训练? 我没有 
Training? I didn't...

530
00:51:31,063 --> 00:51:32,743
最好没有
It better not involve this.

531
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:36,094
我知道 这看上去很不厚道 但你看 这是 
I know, this looks really bad but you see, this is...

532
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:42,562
你说对了 你说对了 说对了 我  我再也不想扯谎了
You're right. You're right. You're right. I... I'm through with the lies.

533
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:45,107
我一直在做  装备!
I've been making... outfits!

534
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:48,055
所以 被你发现了 现在大家也该知道了
So, you got me. It's time everyone knew.

535
00:51:48,163 --> 00:51:50,454
把我拖回去吧 来吧 来啊
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

536
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:52,696
啊 你为什么这样?
Oww. Why would you do that?

537
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,423
这是骗子的下场!
That's for the lies!

538
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,760
而这  是关于其他事情的了断!
And that's... for everything else!

539
00:51:57,899 --> 00:51:58,884
噢 老兄
Oh man.

540
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:01,049
趴下!
Get down!

541
00:52:02,772 --> 00:52:04,259
快跑! 快跑!
Run! Run!

542
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:10,377
不! 不! 没事 不要紧 她是一个朋友
No! No! It's okay. It's okay. She's a friend.

543
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,807
你刚刚吓到它了
You just scared him.

544
00:52:13,827 --> 00:52:15,199
我吓到它了?
I scared him?

545
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:18,689
它是谁?
Who is him?

546
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,215
Astrid 这是无牙 无牙 这是Astrid
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

547
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,548
哒哒哒  我们死定了
Dut, da da... We're dead.

548
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,333
哇啊 哇啊 哇啊 你要去哪里?
Woah, woah woah. Where do you think your going?

549
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:43,113
噢 主神啊! 不要啊 噢 这 
Oh, great Odin! Don't. Oh, this is...

550
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,608
Hiccup 让我下去!
Hiccup, get me down from here!

551
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:58,794
我必须给我一个解释的机会
You have to give me a chance to explain.

552
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,901
你说什么我都不会听的!
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

553
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:04,877
那我不说话 让我演示给你看
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

554
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:07,944
拜托了 Astrid
Please, Astrid.

555
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,511
快放我下来!
Now get me down!

556
00:53:25,684 --> 00:53:28,373
无牙 轻轻地飞下去
Toothless, down. Gently.

557
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,544
看见了吧 没什么可怕的
See, nothing to be afraid of.

558
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:37,116
无牙?
Toothless?

559
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,131
你怎么了? 你这个恶龙!
What is wrong with you? Bad dragon!

560
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:44,198
它 呃 它一般情况是不会这样的
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

561
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,363
噢 不!
Oh, no!

562
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:52,925
无牙 你要干什么? 我得讨她喜欢!
Toothless, what are you doing? We need her to like us!

563
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,513
你还打转转!
And now he's spinning!

564
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:02,097
太感谢你了 你这没用的爬行动物! 
Thank you for nothing you useless reptile!

565
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:08,297
好了 我很抱歉 抱歉 只要把我放下去就好了
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry. Just get me off of this thing.

566
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:57,865
好吧 我承认 这实在是太酷了
Alright, I admit it. This is pretty cool.

567
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:03,007
太神奇了 它太了不起了
It's amazing. He's amazing.

568
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:07,217
然后呢?
So what now?

569
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:11,093
Hiccup 下周就是你的最终考核了!
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

570
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,105
你知道 你必须得杀死一条 
You know your gonna have to kill a...

571
00:56:14,216 --> 00:56:15,033
杀死一条龙 
kill a dragon...

572
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,401
不用你提醒
Don't remind me.

573
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,673
无牙 怎么了?
Toothless, what happening?

574
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:23,362
哇哦 是什么?
Whoa, what is it?

575
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:27,575
趴下!
Get down!

576
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,782
怎么回事?   我不知道
What's going on?   I don't know.

577
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,555
无牙 你得把我们从这带出去 伙计
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.

578
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,912
它们貌似在搬运猎物
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

579
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:57,570
难不成我们也成猎物了?
What does that make us?

580
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:43,694
我爸爸是不可能找到这里的
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

581
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:03,745
噢 真是令人欣慰 原来我们的粮食都倾倒在这里了
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.

582
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:06,636
它们自己没有吃掉
They're not eating any of it.

583
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:23,386
那是什  什么?
What... was that?

584
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,479
好了 伙计 我们现在必须离开这里了 快!
Alright, bud, we gotta get out of here. Now!

585
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:46,427
不 不 完全是讲得通的 这就像一个巨大的蜂巢
No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.

586
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,960
它们就是劳工 而那就是它们的女王
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

587
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,928
它控制着它们 我们现在去找你爸爸
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

588
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:53,095
不 不
No, no.

589
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:57,169
不 现在还不行 他们会杀了无牙的
No. Not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

590
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,724
Astrid 我们得仔细想清楚
Astrid, we have to think this through, carefully.

591
00:59:00,681 --> 00:59:03,762
Hiccup 我刚刚发现了一个龙穴
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragon's nest.

592
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:06,793
这可是我们维京人定居此地以来一直寻求的
The thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here.

593
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:08,657
而你却想保守秘密?
And you want to keep it secret?

594
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:12,003
为了保护你的宠物龙? 你说真的吗?
To protect your pet, dragon? Are you serious?

595
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:15,658
是的
Yes.

596
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,226
好吧 那我们该怎么做呢?
Okay. Then what do we do?

597
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,250
给我一晚上的时间 我会想出办法的
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

598
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:31,287
好的 
Okay...

599
00:59:32,506 --> 00:59:34,000
这是绑架我的惩罚
That's for kidnapping me.

600
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,667
这是  其他所有事情的报答
That's for... everything else.

601
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,450
你在看什么?
What are you looking at?

602
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,081
嗯 我再次抛头露面了
Well, I can show my face in public again.

603
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:08,135
如果在几周前 有人告诉我
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks

604
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,638
Hiccup会从一个  呃 成为一个Hiccup
Hiccup will go from... well being... uh... Hiccup,

605
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:18,991
并在训练中勇争第一
to placing first in dragon training.

606
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,579
嗯 以免他疯言疯语 我会把他绑在桅杆上 然后将他遣送出境
Well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

607
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:26,097
而你们也知道
And you know it.

608
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:29,428
但是 现在
But, here we are.

609
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:35,027
没人能比我更惊讶或者更自豪
And no ones more surprised or more proud than I am.

610
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:39,178
今天 我的儿子成为了一名真正的维京勇士!
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

611
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:43,231
今天他成为了我们中的一员!
Today he becomes one of us!

612
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:49,018
当心那条龙
Be careful with that dragon.

613
01:00:49,054 --> 01:00:50,843
并不是龙让我担忧
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

614
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:52,455
你打算怎么办?
What are you going to do?

615
01:00:52,601 --> 01:00:54,045
平息这一切
Put an end to this.

616
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:55,747
我得试一试
I have to try.

617
01:00:56,314 --> 01:01:01,719
Astrid 如果我遭逢不测 千万别让他们找到无牙
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.

618
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,911
我会的 你得向我保证你会平平安安的
I will, just promise me it won't go wrong.

619
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,138
时间到了 Hiccup
It's time, Hiccup.

620
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:10,143
放倒它们
Knock 'em dead.

621
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:35,711
我会选铁锤
I'd have gone for the hammer.

622
01:01:39,593 --> 01:01:41,005
我准备好了
I'm ready.

623
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:08,116
加油 Hiccup 给它点颜色看看!
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

624
01:02:11,904 --> 01:02:13,453
他在干什么?
What is he doing?

625
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:18,646
没关系 没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

626
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:28,280
我并非他们那类人
I'm not one of them.

627
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:34,684
他在想什么?
What's he thinking?

628
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:35,877
停止打斗!
Stop the fight!

629
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:38,688
不! 我需要大家来见证
No! I need you all to see this.

630
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,400
它们并非我们想的那样
They're not what we think they are.

631
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:44,519
我们不必杀死它们
We don't have to kill them.

632
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,296
我说了 停止打斗!
I said stop the fight!

633
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,145
让开 别挡道!
Out of my way!

634
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:58,166
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

635
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,396
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

636
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,813
这边!
This way!

637
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:49,946
夜煞!
Night Fury!

638
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,203
好了 无牙 快走! 离开这
Alright, Toothless. Go! Get out of here.

639
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:13,961
走 快走!
Go, go!

640
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:16,333
不 爸爸! 爸爸 它不会伤害你们的!
No, dad! Dad, he won't hurt you!

641
01:04:21,229 --> 01:04:22,566
无牙 停下!
Toothless, stop!

642
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,186
不 不!
No. No!

643
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:31,496
捉住它!
Get him!

644
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:36,397
不不 求求你们 别伤害它
No, no, please. Just don't hurt him

645
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:38,730
拜托 别伤害它
Please. Don't hurt him

646
01:04:45,525 --> 01:04:47,366
和其他的关到一起
Put it with the others.

647
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:51,118
我早该明白
I should have known.

648
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,890
我早该注意到这些迹象
I should have seen the signs.

649
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,647
爸爸?   我们达成了协议!
Dad?   We had a deal!

650
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:58,719
我知道! 我们说好了 但是那是在我  哦 全都被搞得一团糟
I know! We did, but that was before I... Oh, it's all so messed up.

651
01:04:58,848 --> 01:05:02,178
那么斗兽场上的一切  是一场骗局? 一个谎言?
So everything in that ring... A trick? A lie?

652
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:05,117
我搞砸了 之前我就该告诉你
I screwed up. I should have told you before now.

653
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:10,515
都是我的错 冲我发火吧 但是求求你 就是不要伤害无牙
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

654
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:13,578
那条龙? 那就是你担心的?
The dragon? That's what you're worried about?

655
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,658
而不是几乎被你杀害的人?
Not the people you almost killed?

656
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,840
它只是在保护我! 它并不危险
He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.

657
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:20,375
它们已经杀了我们几百号人!
They've killed hundreds of us!

658
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:24,745
我们也杀了它们数以千计的同类 它们是自卫 仅此而已
And we've killed thousands of them. They defend themselves, that's all.

659
01:05:25,753 --> 01:05:27,678
它们袭击我们也是万不得已 
They raid us because they have to.

660
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,752
如果它们没带回足够的食物 自己就会被吃掉
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.

661
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:35,872
它们的岛上还有别的生物 是一种像龙的
There's something else on their island, dad. It's a dragonlike...

662
01:05:36,244 --> 01:05:39,460
它们的岛? 所以说 你去过它们的巢穴?
Their island? So, you've been to the nest?

663
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:41,567
我说了巢穴吗?   你怎么找到的?
Did I say nest?   How did you find it?

664
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:46,540
不不 不是我 是无牙找到的 只有龙才找得到那个岛
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.

665
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:51,066
不不 爸 不要 求求你 那里不是你想的那样
No, no, dad, no please. It's not what you think.

666
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:54,360
你不知道你会面临什么 那是你前所未见的
You don't know what your up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen.

667
01:05:54,944 --> 01:05:57,890
爸爸 求求你 我向你保证 你不可能获胜!
Dad, please, I promise you. You can't win this one!

668
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,074
爸爸 不!
Dad, no!

669
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,506
这辈子 你就不能听我一次吗! 
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me!

670
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,165
你已经成为它们中的一份子
You've thrown your lot in with them.

671
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:11,440
你不是一名维京勇士
You're not a Viking.

672
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:14,976
你不是我儿子!
You're not my son!

673
01:06:18,682 --> 01:06:20,277
备船!
Ready the ships!

674
01:07:15,255 --> 01:07:16,556
启航!
Set sail!

675
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:18,804
向地狱犬之门前进
We head for Hell Hounds gate.

676
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:29,718
带我们归巢吧 恶魔
Lead us home, devil.

677
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:54,925
真是一团糟 你肯定感到恐惧
It's a mess. You must feel horrible.

678
01:07:55,511 --> 01:08:00,047
你已经失去了一切 你的父亲 族人和最好的朋友
You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.

679
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,166
谢谢你的总结
Thank you for summing that up.

680
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,057
为什么当我在树林里发现那条龙时 没有杀了它呢?
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon, when I found him the woods?

681
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,725
那样可能对大伙更好
Would've been better for everyone.

682
01:08:09,874 --> 01:08:11,551
嗯 其他人可能会这么做
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

683
01:08:12,992 --> 01:08:14,617
那么 为什么你不这样做?
So, why didn't you?

684
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:18,911
为什么不这样做?
Why didn't you?

685
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:21,976
我不知道 我做不到
I don't know. I couldn't.

686
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,489
这不算回答   为什么突然间 这对你这么重要?
That's not an answer.   Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

687
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,227
因为我想记住你说的话 快说
Because I want to remember what you say, right now.

688
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,651
啊 因为是爱  我是个懦夫 我很软弱
Ah, for the love of... I was coward, I was weak.

689
01:08:33,043 --> 01:08:34,588
我不愿去杀龙!
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

690
01:08:34,654 --> 01:08:35,900
你刚刚说 你不愿意杀龙?
You said wouldn't that time?

691
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:37,935
无论如何 我不愿意!
Whatever, I wouldn't!

692
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:42,138
300年了 我是第一个不愿杀龙的维京人
300 years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

693
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:48,470
却是第一个骑龙的
First to ride one though.

694
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,017
所以?
So?

695
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:58,098
我不愿杀它 因为它看起来和我一样受到了惊吓
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.

696
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,674
我看见它 就像看到了自己
I looked at him and I saw myself.

697
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,809
我确信它现在很恐惧
I bet he's really frightened now.

698
01:09:07,514 --> 01:09:09,141
那你打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do about it?

699
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:13,378
可能会做些蠢事
Probably something stupid.

700
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:15,647
很好 但是你已经做了
Good, but you've already done that.

701
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,866
那么做些疯狂的事吧!
Then something crazy!

702
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:21,920
这才像话
That's more like it.

703
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:34,043
测量船距! 保持在听力范围之内
Sound your positions! Stay within earshot.

704
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:41,390
听着 Stoick 我刚刚偷听到有人 嗯 你明白 
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men just now and well, you know...

705
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:44,151
有人好奇 我们这次来这的目的是什么?
some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here?

706
01:09:44,262 --> 01:09:47,594
当然不是我 你知道你一向是个有计划的人
Not me of course. I know you are always the man with the plan.

707
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,069
但是有些人 不是我 想知道实际上是否有个计划 
But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all...

708
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,314
还有 计划大致是什么?
and what it might be?

709
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,132
找到它们的巢穴 并摧毁它
Find the nest and take it.

710
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,784
当然 让它们四处逃窜 老一辈维京勇士没有取胜 应该是小菜一碟吧
Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fallback. Nice and simple.

711
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,610
让开
Step aside.

712
01:10:24,102 --> 01:10:25,797
向左转舵
Head to port.

713
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:36,126
如果你打算被吃掉 我更愿意去陪着Gronckle
If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

714
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:41,401
如果你明智地选择 从世界上最致命的武器那寻求帮助
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.

715
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:42,362
那就是我
It's me.

716
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:44,761
我爱这个计划!   我不
I love this plan!   I didn't...

717
01:10:44,817 --> 01:10:47,634
你太疯狂了 我喜欢
You're crazy. I like that.

718
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:51,109
那么 有什么计划?
So, what is the plan?

719
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:03,021
形势不妙啊
That's not very encouraging.

720
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:06,859
哦 我很好奇它要去哪
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

721
01:11:19,631 --> 01:11:22,146
保持警惕 准备武器
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

722
01:11:38,676 --> 01:11:39,990
我们到了
We're here.

723
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:13,963
等等 你要干  ?!
Wait, what are you... ?!

724
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:17,678
没问题  没问题
It's okay... It's okay.

725
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,183
你去哪?
Where are you going?

726
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:33,069
你还需要点东西 帮助你继续下去
You're gonna need something to help you hold on.

727
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:46,334
当我们砸开这座山时 所有畜生都会倾巢而出
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is gonna break loose.

728
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:49,057
那会吓得尿裤子 好在我多带了几条
In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.

729
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,599
无论结局如何 一切将在今天结束
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

730
01:13:48,273 --> 01:13:50,087
就这样?
Is that it?

731
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:56,379
我们成功了!
We've done it!

732
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:05,447
还没完!
This isn't over!

733
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:07,931
整队 团结一致!
Form your ranks. Pull together!

734
01:14:21,627 --> 01:14:23,054
撤退!
Get clear!

735
01:14:33,044 --> 01:14:35,705
这是雷神托尔的胡须吗 ! 那是什么?
Beards of Thor...! What is that?

736
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,688
主神奥汀(托尔之父) 救救我们吧!
Odin, help us!

737
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:48,578
弹弩!   发射!
Catapults!   Fire!

738
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:59,616
上船!   不 不!
Get to the ships!   No, nooo!

739
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,568
不是那艘    我傻了
Not that one...   I was a fool.

740
01:15:14,654 --> 01:15:16,790
带大伙去岛屿的另一侧
Lead the men to the far side of the island.

741
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,167
Gobber 和大家一起走
Gobber, go with the men.

742
01:15:18,228 --> 01:15:21,219
我想我决定留下来 以防你想做什么疯狂的事
I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy.

743
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:24,497
如果我让那东西有目标可寻 那么还能争取到一些时间
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing something to hunt for.

744
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,310
那我可以让时间翻倍
Then I can double that time.

745
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,978
到这来!   哦 不 到这来!
Here!   Oh, no. Here!

746
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:46,652
来打我啊!   不 打我!
Fight me!   No, me!

747
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:55,620
Ruff Tuff 小心你们的后面!
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

748
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:57,409
前进 Fishlegs!
Move, Fishlegs!

749
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:02,388
看我们! 我们骑着龙! 我们骑着龙! 我们所有人!
Look at us! We're on dragons! We're on dragons! All of us!

750
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:11,203
每个维京勇士都是固执顽强的 就像你一样
Every bit the bullheaded stubborn Viking you ever were.

751
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:14,607
Fishlegs 说明详情!   好的
Fishlegs, break it down!   Okay.

752
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:18,725
颅骨和尾部覆有厚重铠甲 有助于猛击和压碎物体 要闪避这两处
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

753
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:22,192
小眼睛和大鼻孔 它主要依靠听觉和嗅觉
Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.

754
01:16:22,218 --> 01:16:26,274
好的 Lout Legs 飞至它的盲区 制造噪音给它混淆试听
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise. Keep it confused.

755
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:29,304
Ruff Tuff 查明它是否有射击次数限制 并激怒它
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

756
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:31,799
这是我的拿手好戏!   什么时候开始?
That's my specialty!   Since when?

757
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:33,678
大家都知道 我最让人恼火 看
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

758
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:37,560
就照我说的去做 我会尽快回来
Just do what I told you. I'll be back as soon as I can.

759
01:16:38,378 --> 01:16:39,984
别担心 我们为你做掩护!
Don't worry! We got it covered!

760
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:41,236
好!
Yeah!

761
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:50,345
傻子!   蠢货!
Fool!   Butto!

762
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:51,704
再见 白痴!
Bye, ya Grendel!

763
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:00,335
呃 这东西没有盲区!
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

764
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:04,101
那里!
There!

765
01:17:13,026 --> 01:17:14,166
去帮其他人!
Go help the others!

766
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:16,706
好的 等等 等等
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

767
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:23,714
起作用了!   嗯 奏效了!
It's working!   Yeah, it's working!

768
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:37,358
我已经没法控制Gronckle了! Snotlout 看你的了!
I've lost power on the Gronckle! Snotlout, do something!

769
01:17:39,773 --> 01:17:40,680
我没事!
I'm okay!

770
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:42,982
勉强没事
Less okay.

771
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,555
我不能错失良机! 怎么样 伙计? 觉得眼睛里有东西?
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy? You got something in your eye?

772
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:55,439
是的 你是维京勇士!
Yeah, you're the Viking!

773
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:02,303
呜啊!
Woah!

774
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:34,417
爸爸?
Dad?

775
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:54,681
你成功了 伙计!
You got it, buddy!

776
01:18:56,743 --> 01:18:57,541
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

777
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:01,056
对不起 
I'm sorry...

778
01:19:02,398 --> 01:19:03,583
我为  为所有事道歉
for... for everything.

779
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:05,523
嗯  我也是
Yeah... me too.

780
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,148
你不必到那去
You don't have to go up there.

781
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:11,260
我们是维京勇士 这是渗入进骨子里的冒险精神 
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard...

782
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,016
你是我儿子 我为你骄傲 
I'm proud to call you my son.

783
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:18,388
谢谢 爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

784
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:25,140

嘿 让我骑!
Hey, let me drive!

788
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:36,855
别推我!   我拔光你的牙!
Don't push me!   I'll push your teeth out!

789
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,243
你知道吗 我无法相信这成功了
You know, I can't believe that worked.

790
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:52,943
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

791
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:04,821
你抓住她了吗?
Did you get her?

792
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,332
走!
Go!

793
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,121
这家伙有翅膀 好吧 让我们看看它会不会用!
This thing has wings. Okay, let's see if it can use them!

794
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:37,955
你觉得它飞过吗?
You think that did it?

795
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:44,862
嗯 它会飞
Well, he can fly.

796
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,209
好吧 无牙 没时间了! 来吧 伙计!
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear! Come on, bud!

797
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:17,946
它来了!
Here it comes!

798
01:22:09,988 --> 01:22:11,121
当心!
Watch out!

799
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,961
好吧 时间到 看看这样是否有效
Okay, time's up. Let's see if this works.

800
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:20,955
来吧! 这就是你全部的本事吗?
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

801
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:41,442
陪着我 伙计 我们没问题 只要再坚持一会儿
Stay with me, buddy. We're good. Just a little bit longer.

802
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:49,576
坚持住 无牙 小心!
Hold, Toothless. Now!

803
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,968
不  不!
No... No!

804
01:23:32,243 --> 01:23:35,988
Hiccup! Hiccup啊!
Hiccup! Hiccup!

805
01:23:37,776 --> 01:23:38,866

Son!

806
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:42,596
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

807
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:05,367
哦 儿子!
Oh son!

808
01:24:07,274 --> 01:24:08,619
我一手造成的
I did this.

809
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:42,940
对  对不起
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

810
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:49,808
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

811
01:24:56,578 --> 01:24:59,947
他还活着! 你让他重生!
He's alive! You brought him back alive!

812
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:19,895
谢谢你  救了我的儿子
Thank you... for saving my son.

813
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:23,966
呃 你知道 救了他的大部分
Well, you know, most of him.

814
01:25:41,923 --> 01:25:43,422
嘿 无牙

815
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,476
我也很高兴见到你 伙计

你在我家
You're in my house.

818
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:57,296
我爸爸知道你在这吗?
Does my dad know you're here?

819
01:25:57,467 --> 01:25:59,409
嗯 什么 哦 好吧  好吧
Uh, what, oh, okay... okay.

820
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:04,162
无牙 不 无牙! 啊 别这样

822
01:26:55,925 --> 01:26:57,760
无牙 留在这
Toothless, stay here.

823
01:26:58,178 --> 01:27:01,268
大家来吧 准备好! 抓紧 我们走!
C'mon guys. Get ready! Hold on tight. Here we go!

824
01:27:03,866 --> 01:27:05,066
什么?
What?

825
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:16,026
我懂了 我死了
I knew it. I'm dead.

826
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:19,026
不 但是你给了它最棒的一击
No, but you give it your best shot.

827
01:27:19,116 --> 01:27:21,016
那么 你觉得怎么样?
So, what do you think?

828
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:22,672
嘿 看 是Hiccup!
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

829
01:27:24,446 --> 01:27:25,115
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

830
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:31,357
事实证明 我们更需要的是  这样的你
It turns out, all we needed was a little more of... this.

831
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:33,600
你刚指的是我的全部?
You just gestured to all of me?

832
01:27:34,566 --> 01:27:38,005
嗯 你的大部分 那小部分是我的作品
Well, most of you. That bit's my handiwork.

833
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:41,515
加入了一点Hiccup的光芒 你觉得怎么样?
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in. You think that'll do?

834
01:27:41,954 --> 01:27:43,887
我可能需要做几次微调
I might make a few tweaks.

835
01:27:45,296 --> 01:27:47,582
这一下  是因为你吓到我了 
That's... for scaring me.

836
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,084
什么  什么 总要这样吗? 因为 
What... what, is it always going to be this way? Because...

837
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:54,567
我会习惯的
I could get used to it.

838
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:59,423
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

839
01:27:59,663 --> 01:28:01,873
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

840
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,682
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

841
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:18,978
这里是博克岛 
This is Berk...

842
01:28:19,771 --> 01:28:23,694
一年下九个月的雪 另三个月下冰雹
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three. 

843
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,204
任何生长在这的食物都坚硬无味
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. 

844
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:33,496
生长在这的人们更是坚韧不拔
The people that grow here are even more so. 

845
01:28:37,281 --> 01:28:39,982
唯一的好处就是宠物
The only upsides are the pets. 

846
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:45,977
当别的地方饲养小马或者鹦鹉时 
While other places have ponies or parrots...

847
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,099
我们却拥有 
We have...

848
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,003
龙
Dragons.
