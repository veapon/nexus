1
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,187
這堿O博克島
This is Berk

2
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,512
有像北極那樣12天絕望的嚴寒 也有南極酷冷的垂死之感
It's 12 days North of hopeless and a few degrees South of freezing to death.

3
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,746
島就坐落在"悲劇子午線"上
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,926
這就是我的家鄉 簡而言之: 一成不變
My village. In a word: sturdy. 

5
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:54,884
現在這堿O第七代人了 但是房子都還很新
It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. 

6
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:59,745
我們打漁 打獵 還可以欣賞迷人的夕陽
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. 

7
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,107
唯一的問題是害蟲
The only problems are the pests. 

8
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:06,214
一般來說 害蟲都是老鼠或是蚊子
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. 

9
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,272
但我們的是 
We have...

10
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:13,642
龍
Dragons.

11
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:17,308
大多數人選擇離開 但是不是我們
Most people would leave, but not us.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,526
我們是維京人
We're Vikings. 

13
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,958
我們擁有頑強
We stubbornness issues.

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,414
我叫Hiccup
My name is Hiccup. 

15
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,027
我知道不是什麼偉大的名字 但是也不是最糟的
Great name, I know. But it's not the worst. 

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,242
父母們相信一個難聽的名字可以驅趕地精和惡魔
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off Gnomes and Trolls. 

17
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:34,170
好像我們維京勇士的壯舉還不如一個名字
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. 

18
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,323
早
'Morning.

19
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,324
你在這堸竣偵? 進去!
What are you doing here? Get inside!

20
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:43,163
快回去!
Get back inside!

21
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:50,610
Hiccup! 你又出來幹什麼  你出來幹什麼? 回去!
Hiccup! What is he doing out again... What are you doing out? Get inside!

22
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:54,323
這是大塊頭Stoick 部落的首領
That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe. 

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:58,912
他們說他還是嬰兒的時候 他就能把龍頭從它的脖子上扭下來
They say that when he was a baby he popped a Dragon's head clean off its shoulders. 

24
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,909
我相信嗎? 當然信
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

25
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,847
有哪些龍?
What have we got?

26
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:06,094
Gronckles Nadders Zipplebacks  哦 還有兇魘群龍
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks... Oh, and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,489
有沒有夜煞?
Any Night Furys?

28
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,002
現在還沒有   很好
None so far.   Good.

29
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,837
點燃火炬!
Light the torches!

30
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:22,012
哦 很高興你也來參加這樣的晚會 我還以為你被抓走了
Oh, nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.

31
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:27,009
誰? 我? 得了吧  我肌肉太多 它們不喜歡
Who? Me? Nah, come on... I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,835
它們不知道怎麼吃所有的  這些
They wouldn't know what to do with all... this.

33
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,606
好吧 它們需要牙籤 是吧?
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:36,772
那個脾氣暴躁 還裝著義肢的傻瓜叫Gobber
The meathead with the attitude and interchangeable hands, is Gobber. 

35
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,239
我從小做他的學徒
I have been his apprentice ever since I was little. 

36
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,326
嗯 比現在小一點
Well, littler 

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,866
我們去空曠的地方防守 用投射器反攻
We move to the moor defenses. We'll counterattack with the catapults.

38
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,718
看見了嗎? 老村落 卻有很多很多新房子
See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses. 

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,729
著火了!
Fire!

40
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,154
哦 那是Fishlegs
Oh, and that's Fishlegs 

41
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,065
那是Snotlout
Snotlout 

42
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,931
雙胞胎Ruffnut和Tuffnut 
The twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

43
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,284
還有 
And...

44
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,908
是Astrid
Astrid. 

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,407
喔 他們的工作酷多了
Aww, their job is so much cooler.

46
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,977
哦 拜託 放我出去 我要建功!
Oh, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark!

47
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,940
哦 你已經做了很多的貢獻了 但是都是錯誤的
Oh, you have made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.

48
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:28,172
就兩分鐘 我會殺了一條龍的 我的人生就將從此改變
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better.

49
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,751
我甚至能去約會
I might even get a date.

50
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:32,375
你連鎯頭都舉不起 連斧頭都揮不動
You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe.

51
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,037
甚至這其中一個都扔不出
You can't even throw one of these.

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,311
好 好 但是這個可以幫我扔
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

53
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,587
看見了嗎 就和我說的一樣
See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,025
但是 它  它只要再稍稍校準下
But it... it's a mild calibration issue.

55
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,255
Hiccup 如果你想去和龍戰鬥
Hiccup, if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons

56
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,759
你必須改變這些 
you need to stop all....

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,226
這些
this.

58
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,140
但是你指的是我的全身
But you just pointed to all of me.

59
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,969
是 就是全身
Yes, that's it.

60
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,249
要脫胎換骨
Stop being all of you.

61
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,975
哦    哦 是
Oh...   Oh, yes.

62
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,154
先生 您這是在玩一個危險的遊戲 
You sir, are playing a dangerous game...

63
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:07,384
保持維京人這種原始的特質
keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

64
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,122
後果會很嚴重!   我會承擔的
There will be consequences!   I take my chances.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,380
去磨劍 快走!
Sword, sharpened, now!

66
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,670
總有一天 我會到那堛
One day I'll get out there. 

67
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,371
因為在這 殺死龍意味著一切
Because killing a dragon is everything around here. 

68
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,117
打倒一條Nadder至少可以讓我得到注意
A Nadderhead is sure to get me at least noticed.

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,404
Gronckles很強硬
Gronckles are tough.

70
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,737
打倒一條肯定可以找到一個女朋友
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend. 

71
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,377
一條Zippleback:  
A Zippleback: ...

72
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,186
不太現實 兩個頭 雙倍的難度
exotic, two heads, twice the status. 

73
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:37,646
他們找到羊了!
They found the sheep!

74
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,880
向下面集中火力!
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

75
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:40,611
快!
Hurry up!

76
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,010
開火!
Fire!

77
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,434
還有 兇魘
And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare. 

78
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,478
只有最棒的維京人敢挑戰它們
Only the best Vikings go after those. 

79
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,184
它們有一個討人厭的壞習慣 把自己點燃
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire. 

80
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,109
再次填裝!
Reload!

81
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,276
我可以應付
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:02,467
但是最讓人覬覦的龍 還沒有人見到過
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.

83
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:03,781
我們叫它 
We call it the...

84
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:05,801
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

85
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,021
跳!
Jump!

86
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:15,643
它從不偷東西 從不現身 然而 
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and...

87
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,508
從未失手
never misses. 

88
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:21,591
沒人殺死過夜煞
No one has ever killed a Night Fury. 

89
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,574
這就是我想成為第一個的原因
That's why I'm going to be the first. 

90
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,064
守住陣地 Hiccup 他們需要我
Mind the fort, Hiccup. They need me out there.

91
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,498
呆著! 別動!
Stay! Put!

92
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,964
就這
There.

93
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,198
你知道我是什麼意思
You know what I mean.

94
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,005
Hiccup 你在幹什麼?   回來!
Hiccup, what are you doing?   Come back here!

95
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,338
我知道 馬上回來!
Yeah, I know, Be right back!

96
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,624
自己小心!
Mind yourself!

97
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,236
那些惡魔還有些能量
The devils still have some juice in them.

98
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:01,669
來吧
Come on.

99
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,314
給我些目標 給我目標
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

100
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:29,166
哦! 我擊中了? 是的 我擊中了!
Oh! I hit it? Yes, I hit it!

101
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,303
有人看見嗎?
Did anybody see that?

102
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,648
除了你
Except for you.

103
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,754
別讓它們跑了!   好的!
Do not let them escape!   Right!

104
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,166
你等死吧
You're all out.

105
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,334
哦 還有一件事你要知道 
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...

106
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,603
抱歉 爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

107
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,913
但是我擊中了夜煞
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

108
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,368
和上幾次不一樣 爸爸!
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

109
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,270
我是說 我真的擊中了 
I mean, I really actually hit...

110
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,735
你們正在忙 我很漂亮地擊中了
You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot.

111
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:45,443
它掉在黑區 快派人過去搜 
It went down just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there before...

112
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:46,968
閉嘴!
Stop!

113
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,260
給我閉嘴!
Just, stop!

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,577
你一出門 災難就降臨
Every time you step outside disaster falls.

115
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,838
你沒發現我還有更大的麻煩嗎?
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

116
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,458
冬天臨近了 我還得餵飽全村人!
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!

117
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,450
看這身材差距 如果都不像你們這麼碩大 村子也可以少負擔些口糧?
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't you think?

118
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,786
這不是在開玩笑 Hiccup!
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

119
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,923
你就不能老實一點?
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

120
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,862
我控制不住自己 每當我看到龍 就想 
I, I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just...

121
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,291
殺了它 爸爸 這就是我
kill it. You know, it's who I am, Dad.

122
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:21,811
哦 你可以勝任很多職責 但決不是捕龍者 Hiccup
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup, but a dragon killer is not one of them.

123
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:26,136
回到屋子堨h 確保他回去
Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there.

124
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,644
我還得收拾他的爛攤子
I have his mess to clean up.

125
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,021
演出結束了
Quite the performance.

126
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,837
好厲害的敗家子啊 太帥了!
I've never seen any one mess up that badly. That helped!

127
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,811
謝謝 謝謝 我一直在努力
Thank you. Thank you. I was trying.

128
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:42,761
我真的射中了一條   當然 Hiccup
I really did hit one.   Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,852
他從來不聽我說的   哎 每個家庭基本都這樣
He never listens.   Well, it runs in the family.

130
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:47,793
就算信了 也滿腹牢騷
And when he does, it's always with this disappointed scowl

131
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,161
就好像有人偷吃了他三明治中的肉
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,366
不好意思 女招待 我想你搞錯了吧
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:59,090
我要的是壯如牛的男孩 另外還得有勇氣和榮譽感
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,920
這個 你給我的分明是火柴棒!
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

135
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:04,095
不 你想錯了
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,937
他在乎的不是你的外表 他看重的是你的靈魂
It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,320
謝謝你的總結
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:15,447
關鍵是別強迫自己做力所不能及的事
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.

139
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,310
我只是想和你們大夥一樣
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,273
要麼我們趕走那群龍 要麼它們消滅我們
Either we face them or they'll finish us. 

141
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,056
想要把龍趕走只有一招
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,593
如果我們找到並摧毀龍巢 它們就會離開
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

143
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,399
它們會去別處定居
They'll find another home.

144
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,279
在水面凍結前 我們再搜尋一次
One more search, before the ice sets in.

145
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,229
以前派出的船都失蹤了
Those ships never come back.

146
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,206
我們是維京人 冒險是維京人的天職
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

147
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,806
那麼 誰和我一起去?
Now who's with me?

148
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,314
好吧  留下來的人照看Hiccup
Alright... Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

149
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,979
我去收拾行李了
I'll pack my undies.

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,905
不 我需要你留下來訓練新手
No, I need you to stay, and train some new recruits.

151
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:09,612
哦 太棒了 是的 我忙時 Hiccup可以來幫忙
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy Hiccup can cover the store.

152
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:13,929
他負責熔鐵 磨刀 有很多時間 
Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...

153
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:15,666
會有什麼問題呢?
What could possibly go wrong?

154
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,761
我該怎麼辦呢 Gobber?
Oh, what am I going to do with him, Gobber?

155
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,359
讓他和其他人一起訓練
Put him in training with the others.

156
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,498
我是認真的   我也是
No, I'm serious.   So am I.

157
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:24,750
在你放出第一條龍之前 他就會被嚇死
He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.

158
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:26,611
你不瞭解   我瞭解
Oh, you don't know that.   I do know that.

159
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,385
不 你不瞭解   我瞭解
No， you don't   No, actually, I do.

160
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,369
不 你不瞭解   聽我說 你知道他是怎樣的一個人
No, you don't.   Listen, you know what he's like.

161
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:35,158
從他會爬開始 我就發現他  和別人不一樣
From the time he could crawl he's been... different.

162
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:39,682
他從來不聽我的話 他寧可盯著看麻雀
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.

163
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:43,851
我帶他去捕魚 他卻跑去找  巨魔!
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for Trolls!

164
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,526
真有巨魔! 它們偷了你的襪子 
Trolls exist! They steal your socks.

165
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,351
但它們只偷左腳的 為什麼呢?
But only the left ones. What's with that?

166
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,503
我小的時候    哦 又來了
When I was a boy...   Oh, here we go.

167
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:54,511
我父親讓我用頭去撞石頭 我照做了
My father told me to bang my head against a rock, and I did it.

168
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,216
我覺得這很瘋狂 但是我沒問他為什麼
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.

169
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,221
你猜怎麼著了?
And you know what happened?

170
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:01,409
你犯頭疼病了   石頭裂成了兩半
You got a headache.   That rock split in two.

171
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:05,277
這讓我體會到一個維京人的潛力 Gobber
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

172
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,885
他能撞碎山脈 夷平森林
He could crush mountains, level forests,

173
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,347
征服大海
tame seas!

174
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,039
在我還是個孩子的時候 我就知道我會變成什麼 
Even as a boy I knew what I was, what I had to become...

175
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,866
可是Hiccup卻不能
Hiccup is not that boy.

176
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:21,888
你不能阻止他 Stoick 你只應該為他做好準備
You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him.

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,612
我知道這希望渺茫 但是你不能總是保護他
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is you won't always be around to protect him.

178
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:30,622
他遲早會再出去 說不定就是現在
He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now.

179
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,683
哦 上帝不喜歡我
Oh, the Gods hate me.

180
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:53,626
有些人會弄丟刀子 杯子
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

181
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,757
不 不應該是我啊! 我弄丟了一條龍 
No, not me! I managed to lose an entire dragon.

182
00:11:58,489 --> 00:11:59,227
嗷!
Ow!

183
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:49,212
哦 哇? 這是我  我幹的嗎? 哦 是我幹的!
Oh, wow? I... I did it? Oh, I did it!

184
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:52,064
這玩意兒真是萬能的 是的!
This fixes everything. Yes!

185
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,663
我放倒了一頭大野獸!
I have brought down this mighty beast!

186
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,031
我要殺了你 可憐的龍
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

187
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:29,086
我會  我會切出你的心臟 交給我爸
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father.

188
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,110
我是維京人
I'm a Viking.

189
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,417
我是維京人!
I'm a Viking!

190
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,844
是我做的
I did this.

191
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,443
Hiccup啊
Hiccup.

192
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,423
爸爸? 呃 
Dad? Uh...

193
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,650
我有話和你說 爸爸   兒子 我也正想和你說些事
I have to talk to you, Dad.   I need to speak with you too, son.

194
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,665
我認為你該學習屠龍了   我不想屠龍
I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.   I don't want to fight dragons.

195
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:36,244
什麼?   什麼?
What?   What?

196
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,707
你先說   還是你先說吧
Uh, you go first.   No, no, you go first.

197
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:41,230
好吧 你如願以償了
All right. You got your wish.

198
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,380
屠龍訓練 明早開始
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

199
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,182
哦 早知道我就先說了
Oh man, I should have gone first.

200
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:52,014
呃 我一直在想 你也知道 我們屠龍的人手過剩 但是 
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know, we have a surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but...

201
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:56,670
後勤的人手不夠
do we have enough breadmaking Vikings, or small home repair Vikings...

202
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,269
你需要這個   我不想屠龍
You'll need this.   I don't want to fight dragons.

203
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:05,996
哦 來吧 你能行的   換句話說 爸爸 我殺不了龍
Oh come on, yes you do.   Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

204
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,780
但是你會殺死龍的
But you will kill dragons.

205
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,660
不 我很確定 我不會
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

206
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,057
是時候了 Hiccup   你沒聽我說嗎?
It's time, Hiccup.   Can you not hear me?

207
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,667
這事很嚴肅 兒子
This is serious, son.

208
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:20,616
當你握緊這把戰斧 你就肩負起了我們整個維京族
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.

209
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:26,605
也就是說: 你能像我們一樣走路 像我們一樣講話 像我們一樣思考
Which means: You walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us.

210
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:31,165
不再如此  懦弱   你只是在對我指手畫腳
No more of... this.   You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,933
就這麼定了?   一直是你在自言自語
Deal?   This conversation is feeling very onesided.

212
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:35,959
就這麼定了? 
Deal?

213
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,393
定了
Deal.

214
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:41,836
棒極了 
Good.

215
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,333
好好訓練
Train hard.

216
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,786
我會回來的 大概吧
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:51,703
我也會在這媯尼A 也許
And I'll be here, maybe.

218
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,618
歡迎參加訓龍課程
Welcome to dragon training.

219
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,947
沒有回頭路
No turning back.

220
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:17,670
我真希望我能被燒傷
I hope I get some serious burns.

221
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:21,296
我只希望肩膀或者後背有一些抓傷
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.

222
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,815
是啊 傷疤什麼的 很有意思
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

223
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:27,451
是啊 這不是鬧著玩的 對嗎? 我喜歡疼痛
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

224
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,415
哦 天哪 誰讓他進來的?
Oh, great, who let him in?

225
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,478
開始吧 最棒的那個人
Lets get started. The recruit who does best,

226
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:36,876
能得到在全村人面前殺死第一條龍的榮耀!
will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.

227
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,700
Hiccup都已經殺了一條夜煞了 這點小事對他不過是自降身份罷了吧 ?
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or...?

228
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:43,991
我能轉到其他的訓練班媔?
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?

229
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:48,250
別擔心 你又弱又小 被龍當成目標的概率也低
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak, That will make you a less of a target.

230
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:53,708
和你這樣的豆芽菜比起來 它們更喜歡一些強壯的維京少年
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Vikinglike teens instead.

231
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,455
在這扇門後面的只是你們以後會遇到的所有龍
Behind these doors are just a few of the

232
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,075
微不足道的幾種
many species you will learn to fight.

233
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,314
致命Nadder  –速度8 防禦16
The Deadly Nadder.   Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

234
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,555
醜陋Zippleback   潛行11速翻倍
The Hideous Zippleback.   11 Stealth times two.

235
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,863
兇魘  –火力15
The Monstrous Nightmare.   Fire Power: 15.

236
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,204
惡龍Terror   8攻12毒
The Terrible Terror.   Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

237
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:10,906
給我住嘴!
Can you stop that!

238
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:15,438
還有Gronckle   咬合力8
And the Gronckle.   Jaw Strength: 8.

239
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,899
喂 等一下 你不是應該先教我們嗎?
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

240
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:21,024
我一直堅信實踐是最好的學習方法
I believe in learning on the job.

241
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,966
今天是龍穴生存日 如果你被火球噴個正著 就會當場斃命
Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead. 

242
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,784
快! 你們最需要的是什麼?
Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?

243
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,391
醫生?   加速魔藥?
A doctor?   + 5 Speed?

244
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,350
盾?   盾牌! 盾牌在那
A shield?   Shield. Go.

245
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,287
你們最重要的裝備就是盾牌
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield.

246
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,372
如果只能在劍和盾牌媬鴾@樣
If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield.

247
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,636
盾牌會是你唯一的選擇
Take the shield.

248
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,810
把你的髒手從我的盾牌上拿開!   那堣ㄛO還有一堆嗎?
Get your hands off my shield.   There's like a million shields.

249
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,224
拿那一個 這個上面畫的是一朵花 女孩子喜歡
Take that one. It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

250
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,623
哦哦 現在倒是又有了點血跡了
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

251
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,631
Tuffnut Ruffnut 出局
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

252
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,629
什麼?   什麼?
What?   What?

253
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,569
這個盾牌別有用處 噪音
Those shields are good for another thing. Noise.

254
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,973
用武器敲打盾牌發出噪音 讓龍無法識別目標
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

255
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,004
所有的龍能發出的火球都是有限的
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

256
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,056
一條Gronckle有幾個?
How many does a Gronckle have?

257
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:06,506

00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,758
只會為殺戮而行動

271
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:05,522
那你為什麼沒有這麼做呢?
So why didn't you?

272
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,369
哦 這真是太蠢了
Well this was stupid.

273
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,237

Uh, he showed up?   He didn't get eaten.

279
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,269
他從來不呆在該呆的地方
He's never where he should be.

幹得好 Astrid
Well done, Astrid.

342
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,447
這對你來說又是笑話嗎?
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

343
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:38,465
我們馬上要接過父母的武器 搞清楚你是哪一邊的
Our parent's war is about to become ours. Figure out which side your on.

Huh? Toothless.

345
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:05,475
我能肯定你有

346
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:08,781
牙
teeth.

347
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,247
呃 不  不  不 
Uh, uh... no, no... no...

348
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:17,031
我  我沒有更多的了
I... I don't have anymore.

349
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,776
它一扭 咬下了我的一隻手 吞了下去
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

350
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,136
我看到它臉上的表情 一定在說美味極了
And I saw the look in his face. I was delicious.

351
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,196
它一定回去大肆宣傳了 因為不到一個月
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month

352
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,327
另一條咬下了我的一條腿
before another one of them took my leg.

353
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,134
你的手在龍的肚子堣ㄦ|感到奇怪嗎?
Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon?

354
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,941
就好比如果你還能控制你的手 你就可以由內攻外
Like, if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from the inside

355
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,262
通過捏爆它的心臟而取勝
by crushing his heart or something.

356
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,381
我此刻真的非常生氣 我發誓
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

357
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:41,414
要為你那優雅的手和美麗的腿復仇
I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

358
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:44,921
我要親眼目睹自己砍下打的每一條龍的  腿!
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon I fight... with my face!

359
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,045
不 要砍下龍的翅膀和尾巴
No. It's the wings and the tails you really want.

360
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:51,683
如果它飛不了了 它也活不久了
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

361
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,493
一條不能飛的龍就是臨死的龍
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

362
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:56,256
是   是
Yeah.   Yeah.

363
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,783
好了 我要去睡覺了
Alright, I'm off to bed.

364
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:02,658
你們也早點休息啊 明天還有大玩意兒
You should be too. Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

365
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,656
我們慢慢地逼近兇魘
Slowly but surely, making our way up to Monstruous Nightmare.

366
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:13,681
但是誰能夠得到殺死龍的榮耀呢?   一定是我 命中注定的
But who'll win the honor of killing it?   It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

367
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:17,962
你媽媽同意你文身?   這不是文身 這是胎記
Your mom let you get a tattoo?   It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark.

368
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:21,727
好吧 我從出生就和你在一起 但是從沒有見到過
Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before. 

369
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:25,019
是的 這是胎記 因為你從不看我的左邊
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me to the left side until now. 

370
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,746
嘿 無牙 我拿早飯來了
Hey, Toothless. I brought breakfast.

371
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,750
我希望  我希望你飢腸轆轆了
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

372
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,945
好吧 這確實很噁心
Okay, that's disgusting.

373
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:21,475
我拿來了一些鮭魚 冰島鱈魚 還有鰻魚
I got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.

374
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:28,598
不 不 不 不  不  好吧
No, no, no, no... no... Okay.

375
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,833
是 我也不喜歡鰻魚
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

376
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:41,282
就是這樣 這可是好東西 別管我
That's it. That's the good stuff. Aah, don't you mind me.

377
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,224
我馬上回來 忙我自己的事情
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

378
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,946
沒事的 
It's okay...

379
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,811
好的 好的 
Okay, okay...

380
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,164
好 這不糟糕 起作用了

Boy, you've done it! You've done it, Hiccup!

515
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,631
你將殺死那條龍!
You get to kill the dragon!

516
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:57,995
那才是我的兒子!
That's my boy!

517
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:01,298
是啊! 是的 我迫不及待了 我太 
Yeah! Yes, I can't wait. I am so...

518
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,506
走吧 我們要上路了
leaving. We're Leaving.

519
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:04,708
我們收拾東西吧
Let's pack up.

520
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:07,735
貌似你和我要一起度個假
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.

521
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,417
沒有盡頭的假期
Forever.

522
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:14,125
啊 老兄啊
Awww, man.

523
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,423
什麼啊 ? 啊 你  在這幹什麼呢?
What the...? Uh, w... what are you doing here?

524
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:21,595
我想知道事情的真相
I want to know what's going on.

525
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:24,644
沒有人可以做的跟你一樣好
No one just get as good as you do.

526
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:26,752
特別是  你
Especially... you.

527
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,617
快說   我  我
Start talking.   I... I...

528
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:29,610
是不是有人跟你一起訓練?
Are you training with someone?

529
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:30,832
訓練? 我沒有 
Training? I didn't...

530
00:51:31,063 --> 00:51:32,743
最好沒有
It better not involve this.

531
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:36,094
我知道 這看上去很不厚道 但你看 這是 
I know, this looks really bad but you see, this is...

532
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:42,562
你說對了 你說對了 說對了 我  我再也不想扯謊了
You're right. You're right. You're right. I... I'm through with the lies.

533
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:45,107
我一直在做  裝備!
I've been making... outfits!

534
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:48,055
所以 被你發現了 現在大家也該知道了
So, you got me. It's time everyone knew.

535
00:51:48,163 --> 00:51:50,454
把我拖回去吧 來吧 來啊
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

536
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:52,696
啊 你為什麼這樣?
Oww. Why would you do that?

537
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,423
這是騙子的下場!
That's for the lies!

538
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,760
而這  是關於其他事情的了斷!
And that's... for everything else!

539
00:51:57,899 --> 00:51:58,884
噢 老兄
Oh man.

540
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:01,049
趴下!
Get down!

541
00:52:02,772 --> 00:52:04,259
快跑! 快跑!
Run! Run!

542
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:10,377
不! 不! 沒事 不要緊 她是一個朋友
No! No! It's okay. It's okay. She's a friend.

543
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,807
你剛剛嚇到它了
You just scared him.

544
00:52:13,827 --> 00:52:15,199
我嚇到它了?
I scared him?

545
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:18,689
它是誰?
Who is him?

546
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,215
Astrid 這是無牙 無牙 這是Astrid
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

547
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,548
噠噠噠  我們死定了
Dut, da da... We're dead.

548
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,333
哇啊 哇啊 哇啊 你要去哪?
Woah, woah woah. Where do you think your going?

549
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:43,113
噢 主神啊! 不要啊 噢 這 
Oh, great Odin! Don't. Oh, this is...

550
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,608
Hiccup 讓我下去!
Hiccup, get me down from here!

551
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:58,794
我必須給我一個解釋的機會
You have to give me a chance to explain.

552
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,901
你說什麼我都不會聽的!
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

553
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:04,877
那我不說話 讓我演示給你看
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

554
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:07,944
拜託了 Astrid
Please, Astrid.

555
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,511
快放我下來!
Now get me down!

556
00:53:25,684 --> 00:53:28,373
無牙 輕輕地飛下去
Toothless, down. Gently.

557
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,544
看見了吧 沒什麼可怕的
See, nothing to be afraid of.

558
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:37,116
無牙?
Toothless?

559
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,131
你怎麼了? 你這個惡龍!
What is wrong with you? Bad dragon!

560
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:44,198
它 呃 它一般情況是不會這樣的
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

561
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,363
噢 不!
Oh, no!

562
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:52,925
無牙 你要幹什麼? 我得討她喜歡!
Toothless, what are you doing? We need her to like us!

563
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,513
你還打轉轉!
And now he's spinning!

564
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:02,097
太感謝你了 你這沒用的爬行動物! 
Thank you for nothing you useless reptile!

565
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:08,297
好了 我很抱歉 抱歉 只要把我放下去就好了
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry. Just get me off of this thing.

566
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:57,865
好吧 我承認 這實在是太酷了
Alright, I admit it. This is pretty cool.

567
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:03,007
太神奇了 它太了不起了
It's amazing. He's amazing.

568
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:07,217
然後呢?
So what now?

569
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:11,093
Hiccup 下周就是你的最終考核了!
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

570
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,105
你知道 你必須得殺死一條 
You know your gonna have to kill a...

571
00:56:14,216 --> 00:56:15,033
殺死一條龍 
kill a dragon...

572
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,401
不用你提醒
Don't remind me.

573
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,673
無牙 怎麼了?
Toothless, what happening?

574
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:23,362
哇哦 是什麼?
Whoa, what is it?

575
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:27,575
趴下!
Get down!

576
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,782
怎麼回事?   我不知道
What's going on?   I don't know.

577
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,555
無牙 你得把我們從這帶出去 夥計
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.

578
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,912
它們貌似在搬運獵物
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

579
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:57,570
難不成我們也成獵物了?
What does that make us?

580
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:43,694
我爸爸是不可能找到這堛
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

581
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:03,745
噢 真是令人欣慰 原來我們的糧食都傾倒在這堣F
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.

582
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:06,636
它們自己沒有吃掉
They're not eating any of it.

583
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:23,386
那是什  什麼?
What... was that?

584
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,479
好了 夥計 我們現在必須離開這堣F 快!
Alright, bud, we gotta get out of here. Now!

585
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:46,427
不 不 完全是講得通的 這就像一個巨大的蜂巢
No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.

586
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,960
它們就是勞工 而那就是它們的女王
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

587
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,928
它控制著它們 我們現在去找你爸爸
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

588
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:53,095
不 不
No, no.

589
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:57,169
不 現在還不行 他們會殺了無牙的
No. Not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

590
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,724
Astrid 我們得仔細想清楚
Astrid, we have to think this through, carefully.

591
00:59:00,681 --> 00:59:03,762
Hiccup 我剛剛發現了一個龍穴
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragon's nest.

592
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:06,793
這可是我們維京人定居此地以來一直尋求的
The thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here.

593
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:08,657
而你卻想保守秘密?
And you want to keep it secret?

594
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:12,003
為了保護你的寵物龍? 你說真的嗎?
To protect your pet, dragon? Are you serious?

595
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:15,658
是的
Yes.

596
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,226
好吧 那我們該怎麼做呢?
Okay. Then what do we do?

597
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,250
給我一晚上的時間 我會想出辦法的
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

598
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:31,287
好的 
Okay...

599
00:59:32,506 --> 00:59:34,000
這是綁架我的懲罰
That's for kidnapping me.

600
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,667
這是  其他所有事情的報答
That's for... everything else.

601
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,450
你在看什麼?
What are you looking at?

602
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,081
嗯 我再次拋頭露面了
Well, I can show my face in public again.

603
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:08,135
如果在幾周前 有人告訴我
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks

604
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,638
Hiccup會從一個  呃 成為一個Hiccup
Hiccup will go from... well being... uh... Hiccup,

605
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:18,991
並在訓練中勇爭第一
to placing first in dragon training.

606
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,579
嗯 以免他瘋言瘋語 我會把他綁在桅桿上 然後將他遣送出境
Well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

607
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:26,097
而你們也知道
And you know it.

608
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:29,428
但是 現在
But, here we are.

609
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:35,027
沒人能比我更驚訝或者更自豪
And no ones more surprised or more proud than I am.

610
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:39,178
今天 我的兒子成為了一名真正的維京勇士!
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

611
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:43,231
今天他成為了我們中的一員!
Today he becomes one of us!

612
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:49,018
當心那條龍
Be careful with that dragon.

613
01:00:49,054 --> 01:00:50,843
並不是龍讓我擔憂
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

614
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:52,455
你打算怎麼辦?
What are you going to do?

615
01:00:52,601 --> 01:00:54,045
平息這一切
Put an end to this.

616
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:55,747
我得試一試
I have to try.

617
01:00:56,314 --> 01:01:01,719
Astrid 如果我遭逢不測 千萬別讓他們找到無牙
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.

618
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,911
我會的 你得向我保證你會平平安安的
I will, just promise me it won't go wrong.

619
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,138
時間到了 Hiccup
It's time, Hiccup.

620
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:10,143
放倒它們
Knock 'em dead.

621
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:35,711
我會選鐵錘
I'd have gone for the hammer.

622
01:01:39,593 --> 01:01:41,005
我準備好了
I'm ready.

623
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:08,116
加油 Hiccup 給它點顏色看看!
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

624
01:02:11,904 --> 01:02:13,453
他在幹什麼?
What is he doing?

625
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:18,646
沒關係 沒事的
It's okay, it's okay.

626
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:28,280
我並非他們那類人
I'm not one of them.

627
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:34,684
他在想什麼?
What's he thinking?

628
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:35,877
停止打鬥!
Stop the fight!

629
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:38,688
不! 我需要大家來見證
No! I need you all to see this.

630
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,400
它們並非我們想的那樣
They're not what we think they are.

631
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:44,519
我們不必殺死它們
We don't have to kill them.

632
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,296
我說了 停止打鬥!
I said stop the fight!

633
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,145
讓開 別擋道!
Out of my way!

634
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:58,166
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

635
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,396
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

636
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,813
這邊!
This way!

637
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:49,946
夜煞!
Night Fury!

638
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,203
好了 無牙 快走! 離開這
Alright, Toothless. Go! Get out of here.

639
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:13,961
走 快走!
Go, go!

640
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:16,333
不 爸爸! 爸爸 它不會傷害你們的!
No, dad! Dad, he won't hurt you!

641
01:04:21,229 --> 01:04:22,566
無牙 停下!
Toothless, stop!

642
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,186
不 不!
No. No!

643
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:31,496
捉住它!
Get him!

644
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:36,397
不不 求求你們 別傷害它
No, no, please. Just don't hurt him

645
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:38,730
拜託 別傷害它
Please. Don't hurt him

646
01:04:45,525 --> 01:04:47,366
和其他的關到一起
Put it with the others.

647
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:51,118
我早該明白
I should have known.

648
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,890
我早該注意到這些跡象
I should have seen the signs.

649
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,647
爸爸?   我們達成了協議!
Dad?   We had a deal!

650
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:58,719
我知道! 我們說好了 但是那是在我  哦 全都被搞得一團糟
I know! We did, but that was before I... Oh, it's all so messed up.

651
01:04:58,848 --> 01:05:02,178
那麼鬥獸場上的一切  是一場騙局? 一個謊言?
So everything in that ring... A trick? A lie?

652
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:05,117
我搞砸了 之前我就該告訴你
I screwed up. I should have told you before now.

653
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:10,515
都是我的錯 衝我發火吧 但是求求你 就是不要傷害無牙
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

654
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:13,578
那條龍? 那就是你擔心的?
The dragon? That's what you're worried about?

655
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,658
而不是幾乎被你殺害的人?
Not the people you almost killed?

656
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,840
它只是在保護我! 它並不危險
He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.

657
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:20,375
它們已經殺了我們幾百號人!
They've killed hundreds of us!

658
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:24,745
我們也殺了它們數以千計的同類 它們是自衛 僅此而已
And we've killed thousands of them. They defend themselves, that's all.

659
01:05:25,753 --> 01:05:27,678
它們襲擊我們也是萬不得已 
They raid us because they have to.

660
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,752
如果它們沒帶回足夠的食物 自己就會被吃掉
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.

661
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:35,872
它們的島上還有別的生物 是一種像龍的
There's something else on their island, dad. It's a dragonlike...

662
01:05:36,244 --> 01:05:39,460
它們的島? 所以說 你去過它們的巢穴?
Their island? So, you've been to the nest?

663
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:41,567
我說了巢穴嗎?   你怎麼找到的?
Did I say nest?   How did you find it?

664
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:46,540
不不 不是我 是無牙找到的 只有龍才找得到那個島
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.

665
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:51,066
不不 爸 不要 求求你 那堣ㄛO你想的那樣
No, no, dad, no please. It's not what you think.

666
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:54,360
你不知道你會面臨什麼 那是你前所未見的
You don't know what your up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen.

667
01:05:54,944 --> 01:05:57,890
爸爸 求求你 我向你保證 你不可能獲勝!
Dad, please, I promise you. You can't win this one!

668
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,074
爸爸 不!
Dad, no!

669
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,506
這輩子 你就不能聽我一次嗎! 
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me!

670
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,165
你已經成為它們中的一份子
You've thrown your lot in with them.

671
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:11,440
你不是一名維京勇士
You're not a Viking.

672
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:14,976
你不是我兒子!
You're not my son!

673
01:06:18,682 --> 01:06:20,277
備船!
Ready the ships!

674
01:07:15,255 --> 01:07:16,556
啟航!
Set sail!

675
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:18,804
向地獄犬之門前進
We head for Hell Hounds gate.

676
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:29,718
帶我們歸巢吧 惡魔
Lead us home, devil.

677
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:54,925
真是一團糟 你肯定感到恐懼
It's a mess. You must feel horrible.

678
01:07:55,511 --> 01:08:00,047
你已經失去了一切 你的父親 族人和最好的朋友
You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.

679
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,166
謝謝你的總結
Thank you for summing that up.

680
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,057
為什麼當我在樹林媯o現那條龍時 沒有殺了它呢?
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon, when I found him the woods?

681
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,725
那樣可能對大伙更好
Would've been better for everyone.

682
01:08:09,874 --> 01:08:11,551
嗯 其他人可能會這麼做
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

683
01:08:12,992 --> 01:08:14,617
那麼 為什麼你不這樣做?
So, why didn't you?

684
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:18,911
為什麼不這樣做?
Why didn't you?

685
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:21,976
我不知道 我做不到
I don't know. I couldn't.

686
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,489
這不算回答   為什麼突然間 這對你這麼重要?
That's not an answer.   Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

687
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,227
因為我想記住你說的話 快說
Because I want to remember what you say, right now.

688
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,651
啊 因為是愛  我是個懦夫 我很軟弱
Ah, for the love of... I was coward, I was weak.

689
01:08:33,043 --> 01:08:34,588
我不願去殺龍!
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

690
01:08:34,654 --> 01:08:35,900
你剛剛說 你不願意殺龍?
You said wouldn't that time?

691
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:37,935
無論如何 我不願意!
Whatever, I wouldn't!

692
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:42,138
300年了 我是第一個不願殺龍的維京人
300 years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

693
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:48,470
卻是第一個騎龍的
First to ride one though.

694
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,017
所以?
So?

695
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:58,098
我不願殺它 因為它看起來和我一樣受到了驚嚇
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.

696
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,674
我看見它 就像看到了自己
I looked at him and I saw myself.

697
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,809
我確信它現在很恐懼
I bet he's really frightened now.

698
01:09:07,514 --> 01:09:09,141
那你打算怎麼辦?
What are you gonna do about it?

699
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:13,378
可能會做些蠢事
Probably something stupid.

700
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:15,647
很好 但是你已經做了
Good, but you've already done that.

701
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,866
那麼做些瘋狂的事吧!
Then something crazy!

702
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:21,920
這才像話
That's more like it.

703
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:34,043
測量船距! 保持在聽力範圍之內
Sound your positions! Stay within earshot.

704
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:41,390
聽著 Stoick 我剛剛偷聽到有人 嗯 你明白 
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men just now and well, you know...

705
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:44,151
有人好奇 我們這次來這的目的是什麼?
some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here?

706
01:09:44,262 --> 01:09:47,594
當然不是我 你知道你一向是個有計劃的人
Not me of course. I know you are always the man with the plan.

707
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,069
但是有些人 不是我 想知道實際上是否有個計劃 
But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all...

708
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,314
還有 計劃大致是什麼?
and what it might be?

709
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,132
找到它們的巢穴 並摧毀它
Find the nest and take it.

710
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,784
當然 讓它們四處逃竄 老一輩維京勇士沒有取勝 應該是小菜一碟吧
Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fallback. Nice and simple.

711
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,610
讓開
Step aside.

712
01:10:24,102 --> 01:10:25,797
向左轉舵
Head to port.

713
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:36,126
如果你打算被吃掉 我更願意去陪著Gronckle
If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

714
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:41,401
如果你明智地選擇 從世界上最致命的武器那尋求幫助
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.

715
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:42,362
那就是我
It's me.

716
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:44,761
我愛這個計劃!   我不
I love this plan!   I didn't...

717
01:10:44,817 --> 01:10:47,634
你太瘋狂了 我喜歡
You're crazy. I like that.

718
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:51,109
那麼 有什麼計劃?
So, what is the plan?

719
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:03,021
形勢不妙啊
That's not very encouraging.

720
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:06,859
哦 我很好奇它要去哪
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

721
01:11:19,631 --> 01:11:22,146
保持警惕 準備武器
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

722
01:11:38,676 --> 01:11:39,990
我們到了
We're here.

723
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:13,963
等等 你要干  ?!
Wait, what are you... ?!

724
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:17,678
沒問題  沒問題
It's okay... It's okay.

725
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,183
你去哪?
Where are you going?

726
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:33,069
你還需要點東西 幫助你繼續下去
You're gonna need something to help you hold on.

727
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:46,334
當我們砸開這座山時 所有畜生都會傾巢而出
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is gonna break loose.

728
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:49,057
那會嚇得尿褲子 好在我多帶了幾條
In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.

729
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,599
無論結局如何 一切將在今天結束
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

730
01:13:48,273 --> 01:13:50,087
就這樣?
Is that it?

731
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:56,379
我們成功了!
We've done it!

732
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:05,447
還沒完!
This isn't over!

733
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:07,931
整隊 團結一致!
Form your ranks. Pull together!

734
01:14:21,627 --> 01:14:23,054
撤退!
Get clear!

735
01:14:33,044 --> 01:14:35,705
這是雷神托爾的鬍鬚嗎 ! 那是什麼?
Beards of Thor...! What is that?

736
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,688
主神奧汀(托爾之父) 救救我們吧!
Odin, help us!

737
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:48,578
彈弩!   發射!
Catapults!   Fire!

738
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:59,616
上船!   不 不!
Get to the ships!   No, nooo!

739
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,568
不是那艘    我傻了
Not that one...   I was a fool.

740
01:15:14,654 --> 01:15:16,790
帶大伙去島嶼的另一側
Lead the men to the far side of the island.

741
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,167
Gobber 和大家一起走
Gobber, go with the men.

742
01:15:18,228 --> 01:15:21,219
我想我決定留下來 以防你想做什麼瘋狂的事
I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy.

743
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:24,497
如果我讓那東西有目標可尋 那麼還能爭取到一些時間
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing something to hunt for.

744
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,310
那我可以讓時間翻倍
Then I can double that time.

745
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,978
到這來!   哦 不 到這來!
Here!   Oh, no. Here!

746
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:46,652
來打我啊!   不 打我!
Fight me!   No, me!

747
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:55,620
Ruff Tuff 小心你們的後面!
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

748
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:57,409
前進 Fishlegs!
Move, Fishlegs!

749
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:02,388
看我們! 我們騎著龍! 我們騎著龍! 我們所有人!
Look at us! We're on dragons! We're on dragons! All of us!

750
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:11,203
每個維京勇士都是固執頑強的 就像你一樣
Every bit the bullheaded stubborn Viking you ever were.

751
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:14,607
Fishlegs 說明詳情!   好的
Fishlegs, break it down!   Okay.

752
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:18,725
顱骨和尾部覆有厚重鎧甲 有助於猛擊和壓碎物體 要閃避這兩處
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

753
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:22,192
小眼睛和大鼻孔 它主要依靠聽覺和嗅覺
Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.

754
01:16:22,218 --> 01:16:26,274
好的 Lout Legs 飛至它的盲區 製造噪音給它混淆試聽
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise. Keep it confused.

755
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:29,304
Ruff Tuff 查明它是否有射擊次數限制 並激怒它
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

756
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:31,799
這是我的拿手好戲!   什麼時候開始?
That's my specialty!   Since when?

757
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:33,678
大家都知道 我最讓人惱火 看
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

758
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:37,560
就照我說的去做 我會盡快回來
Just do what I told you. I'll be back as soon as I can.

759
01:16:38,378 --> 01:16:39,984
別擔心 我們為你做掩護!
Don't worry! We got it covered!

760
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:41,236
好!
Yeah!

761
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:50,345
傻子!   蠢貨!
Fool!   Butto!

762
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:51,704
再見 白癡!
Bye, ya Grendel!

763
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:00,335
呃 這東西沒有盲區!
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

764
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:04,101
那!
There!

765
01:17:13,026 --> 01:17:14,166
去幫其他人!
Go help the others!

766
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:16,706
好的 等等 等等
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

767
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:23,714
起作用了!   嗯 奏效了!
It's working!   Yeah, it's working!

768
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:37,358
我已經沒法控制Gronckle了! Snotlout 看你的了!
I've lost power on the Gronckle! Snotlout, do something!

769
01:17:39,773 --> 01:17:40,680
我沒事!
I'm okay!

770
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:42,982
勉強沒事
Less okay.

771
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,555
我不能錯失良機! 怎麼樣 夥計? 覺得眼睛埵釭F西?
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy? You got something in your eye?

772
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:55,439
是的 你是維京勇士!
Yeah, you're the Viking!

773
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:02,303
嗚啊!
Woah!

774
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:34,417
爸爸?
Dad?

775
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:54,681
你成功了 夥計!
You got it, buddy!

776
01:18:56,743 --> 01:18:57,541
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

777
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:01,056
對不起

你不必到那去
You don't have to go up there.

781
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:11,260
我們是維京勇士 這是滲入進骨子堛澈_險精神 
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard...

782
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,016
你是我兒子 我為你驕傲 
I'm proud to call you my son.

Don't push me!   I'll push your teeth out!

789
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,243
你知道嗎 我無法相信這成功了
You know, I can't believe that worked.

790
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:52,943
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

791
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:04,821
你抓住她了嗎?
Did you get her?

792
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,332
走!
Go!

793
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,121
這傢伙有翅膀 好吧 讓我們看看它會不會用!
This thing has wings. Okay, let's see if it can use them!

794
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:37,955
你覺得它飛過嗎?
You think that did it?

795
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:44,862
嗯 它會飛
Well, he can fly.

796
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,209
好吧 無牙 沒時間了! 來吧 夥計!
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear! Come on, bud!

797
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:17,946
它來了!
Here it comes!

798
01:22:09,988 --> 01:22:11,121

799
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,961
好吧 時間到 看看這樣是否有效
Okay, time's up. Let's see if this works.

800
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:20,955
來吧! 這就是你全部的本事嗎?
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

801

803
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,968

804
01:23:32,243 --> 01:23:35,988
Hiccup! Hiccup啊!
Hiccup! Hiccup!

805
01:23:37,776 --> 01:23:38,866

我一手造成的
I did this.

809
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:42,940
對  對不起
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

810
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:49,808
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

811
01:24:56,578 --> 01:24:59,947
他還活著! 你讓他重生!
He's alive! You brought him back alive!

812
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:19,895
謝謝你  救了我的兒子
Thank you... for saving my son.

813
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:23,966
呃 你知道 救了他的大部分
Well, you know, most of him.

814
01:25:41,923 --> 01:25:43,422

你在我家
You're in my house.

818
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:57,296
我爸爸知道你在這嗎?
Does my dad know you're here?

819
01:25:57,467 --> 01:25:59,409
嗯 什麼 哦 好吧  好吧
Uh, what, oh, okay... okay.

無牙 留在這
Toothless, stay here.

823
01:26:58,178 --> 01:27:01,268
大家來吧 準備好! 抓緊 我們走!
C'mon guys. Get ready! Hold on tight. Here we go!

824
01:27:03,866 --> 01:27:05,066
什麼?
What?

825
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:16,026
我懂了 我死了
I knew it. I'm dead.

826
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:19,026
不 但是你給了它最棒的一擊
No, but you give it your best shot.

827
01:27:19,116 --> 01:27:21,016
那麼 你覺得怎麼樣?
So, what do you think?

828
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:22,672
嘿 看 是Hiccup!
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

829
01:27:24,446 --> 01:27:25,115
Hiccup啊!
Hiccup!

830
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:31,357
事實證明 我們更需要的是  這樣的你
It turns out, all we needed was a little more of... this.

831
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:33,600
你剛指的是我的全部?
You just gestured to all of me?

832
01:27:34,566 --> 01:27:38,005
嗯 你的大部分 那小部分是我的作品
Well, most of you. That bit's my handiwork.

833
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:41,515
加入了一點Hiccup的光芒 你覺得怎麼樣?
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in. You think that'll do?

834
01:27:41,954 --> 01:27:43,887
我可能需要做幾次微調
I might make a few tweaks.

835
01:27:45,296 --> 01:27:47,582
這一下  是因為你嚇到我了 
That's... for scaring me.

836
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,084
什麼  什麼 總要這樣嗎? 因為 
What... what, is it always going to be this way? Because...

837
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:54,567
我會習慣的
I could get used to it.

838
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:59,423
歡迎回家
Welcome home.

839
01:27:59,663 --> 01:28:01,873
夜煞!   趴下!
Night Fury!   Get down!

840
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,682
你準備好了嗎?
You ready?

841
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:18,978
這堿O博克島 
This is Berk...

842
01:28:19,771 --> 01:28:23,694
一年下九個月的雪 另三個月下冰雹
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three. 

843
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,204
任何生長在這的食物都堅硬無味
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. 

844
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:33,496
生長在這的人們更是堅韌不拔
The people that grow here are even more so. 

845
01:28:37,281 --> 01:28:39,982
唯一的好處就是寵物
The only upsides are the pets. 

846
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:45,977
當別的地方飼養小馬或者鸚鵡時 
While other places have ponies or parrots...

847
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,099
我們卻擁有 
We have...

848
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,003
龍
Dragons.
