- 三个 四个 我不确定 - 你的位置在哪?
- Three, four. I don't know. - Where are you?

392
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,972
- 我在洗手间 - 到隔壁的卧室去
- I'm in the bathroom. - Go to the next bedroom.

393
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,808
躲在床底下 躲好了告诉我
Get under the bed. Tell me when you're there.

394
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:34,654
- 好了 - 接下来非常重要
- I'm here. - Now, the next part is very important.

395
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,827
他们要抓你 金米 精神集中 宝贝 这是关键
They are going to take you. Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

396
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:45,498
你有五秒 也许10秒的时间 时间紧迫
You will have five, maybe ten seconds. Very important seconds.

397
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,167
把电话扔在地上 集中注意力
Leave the phone on the floor. Concentrate.

398
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,421
把你看到的都说出来 发色 瞳色 身高 疤痕等等
Shout out everything you see about them. Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

399
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,965
看到的一切 明白吗?
Anything you see. You understand?

400
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,345
他们来了 我能听见
They're there. I can hear them.

401
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,347
记住 全神贯注
Remember, concentrate.

402
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,279
把电话放近点 我才听得到
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

403
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:45,558
他们走了 我觉得他们...
They're leaving. I think they're...

404
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:54,358
有胡子 六英尺高 右手有月亮和星星的纹身
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

405
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,507
我不知道你们是谁
I don't know who you are.

406
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:20,926
我不知道你们想要什么
I don't know what you want.

407
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:25,055
如果你们要赎金 我可以告诉你们 我没钱
If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have money.

408
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:29,644
但是我还是有些特别的手段的
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills.

409
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,605
都是我在漫长的职业生涯中学到的
Skills I've acquired over a very long career.

410
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:36,651
而这正是像你们这样的人的噩梦
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

411
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:40,571
如果你们放过我女儿 那么这件事到此结束
If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.

412
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:44,617
我不会去找你们 也不会追查你们
I will not look for you. I will not pursue you.

413
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:48,579
如果你们不就此罢手 我会找到你们
But if you don't, I will look for you.

414
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,457
我会找到你们...
I will find you...

415
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,959
...然后杀了你们
...and I will kill you.

416
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,799
祝你好运
Good luck.

417
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,145
萨姆 是我 我需要帮助
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

418
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:17,441
我下载了些东西 帮我分析下 马上
I'm gonna download something. I need it analyzed. Right now.

419
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,819
- 她被抓了 - 什么?
- She's been taken. - What?

420
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:22,321
- 国外的仇人? - 为什么我会有仇人?
- Any enemies overseas? - Why would I have enemies?

421
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,407
你在海外利用多家空壳公司做生意
You do business overseas through multiple shell corporations.

422
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:29,161
你和一伙俄罗斯人的石油生意 越来越糟糕
You were involved in an oil deal with a bunch of Russians that went south.

423
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,164
- 你怎么知道的? - 我不会让我的女儿...
- How do you know that? - I was not gonna let my daughter...

424
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:35,167
...和不知底细的人住一起
...live with someone without knowing everything about them.

425
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:38,504
- 我有不少可靠消息... - 现在不是玩侦探的时候
- I have a few resources... - Now is not the time for dick measuring.

426
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:40,840
- 有人要伤害你? - 就我所知没有
- Anyone looking to hurt you? - Not that I know.

427
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,967
- 哪个房间是金米的? - 发生了什么事?
- Which room's Kim's? - What happened?

428
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:46,637
我接到她的电话 有人在公寓里 她被抓了
I got a call from her. There were people in the apartment. She was taken.

429
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,180
- 哦 天哪 - 哪个房间?
- Oh, God. - Which one?

430
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,974
那间
That one.

431
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,980
我能做点什么?
Is there something I should be doing?

432
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:59,066
你的公司和NetJet航空公司有租约吧
You have a lease agreement with NetJet through your company.

433
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,776
是的
I do.

434
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,153
- 帮我弄架去巴黎的飞机 - 什么时候要?
- Get me a plane to Paris. - For when?

435
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,446
越快越好
An hour ago.

436
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:08,033
- 我要打个电话 你还好吧? - 我没事
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

437
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:20,170
拜托你把她带回来好吗 布莱恩?
Would you please get her back to me, Bryan?

438
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,047
首先我得找到她
First I have to find her.

439
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,971
萨姆 有什么发现?
Sam, what have you got?

440
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:30,389
他们说阿尔巴尼亚语
They're speaking Albanian.

441
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,976
从语音语调来看 他们一定来自卓帕加
Based on their accents and dialects, they must be from Tropoja.

442
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,978
那地方是人渣们的巢穴
The place is ground zero for scummers.

443
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,397
就连俄罗斯人都对这些家伙敬而远之
Even the Russians give these guys a wide berth.

444
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:41,358
跟你讲话的那个叫马科
The one you spoke to, his name is Marko.

445
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,528
我们收到消息...
We have information that a mobster boss...

446
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:46,906
...一个叫马科・霍查的黑道老大 六个月前搬去了巴黎
...by the name of Marko Hoxha moved to Paris about six months ago.

447
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:52,828
如果就是他 那就是条大鱼 另外那个纹身是帮派的标识
If he's the one, he's a big fish. The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.

448
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,915
- 我开了免提还是不止你一个人在听? - 勒诺在这
- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself? - Lenore is here.

449
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:59,334
- 嘿 列尼 - 你好 萨姆
- Hey, Lennie. - Hello, Sam.

450
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:00,920
她也想听 萨姆
She needs to hear it, Sam.

451
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:05,883
那块地方的帮派专门拐卖女人
The specialty of the groups coming out of this area is trafficking in women.

452
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,681
- 继续 - 好的
- Keep going. - Okay.

453
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:16,602
他们之前的惯用伎俩就是向 新兴东欧国家的女人...
Their previous m.o. Was to offer women from emerging East European countries...

454
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:20,856
...像南斯拉夫 罗马尼亚 保加利亚这些国家 提供在西方做女佣和保姆的工作
...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, jobs in the West as maids and nannies.

455
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:25,486
一旦偷渡过来 就让她们染上毒瘾 逼迫她们做妓女
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

456
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:29,865
不过后来他们发现 直接绑架旅游中的年轻女人...
Lately, however, they've decided that it's more economical...

457
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:34,912
...更为经济 这样可以省下交通费
...just to kidnap traveling young women. Saves on transportation costs.

458
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,457
哦 我的小宝贝
Oh, my little baby.

459
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,208
还有什么?
What else?

460
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:42,462
根据这伙人的作案方式 我们的分析显示...
Based on the way these groups operate, our analyst says...

461
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,465
...从她被绑开始你有96个小时的时间
...you have a 96-hour window from the time she was grabbed.

462
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:48,133
- 否则呢? - 再也找不到她
- To what? - To never finding her.

463
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,386
不 不 不
No, no, no.

464
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,222
爸爸!
Daddy!

465
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:57,643
有胡子 六英尺高 右手有月亮和星星的纹身
Mustache. Six feet. Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.

466
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,479
爸...
Da...

467
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,278

00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:16,120
祝你好运
Good luck.

470
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:18,998
祝你好运
Good luck.

471
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,682
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

472
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,603
爸爸 他们抓住了阿曼达
Dad, they got Amanda.

473
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,740
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

474
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,785
爸爸 他们抓住了她
Dad, they got her.

475
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:23,789
他们抓住了她
They took her.

476
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,250
到隔壁的卧室去 躲在床底下
Go to the next bedroom. Get under the bed.

477
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,795
- 躲好了告诉我 - 好了
- Tell me when you're there. - I'm here.

478
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:38,721
精神集中 宝贝 把电话扔在地上
Stay focused, baby. Leave the phone on the floor.

479
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,390
集中注意力 把你看到的都说出来
Concentrate. Shout out everything you see about them.

480
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:45,435
发色 瞳色 身高 疤痕等等 看到的一切 明白吗?
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars. Anything you see. You understand?

481
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,564
他们来了 我能听见 记住 全神贯注
They're there. I can hear them. Remember, concentrate.

482
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,664
他们走了 爸爸!
They're leaving. Daddy!

483
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,834
爸爸!

00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:13,255
有胡子 六英尺高 右手有月亮和星星的纹身

486
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:57,943
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hi.

487
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,779
- 我叫彼得 - 我叫英格丽德
- I'm Peter. - I'm Ingrid.

488
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:01,238
- 度假? - 对

489
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:03,115
- 我也是 - 哇哦

490
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:05,743
这的出租车贵死了 一起搭吧?
Cabs here are so damned expensive. Want to share?

491
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,245
- 好的 为什么不呢? - 太好了
- Sure. Why not? - Great.

492
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,458
- 不好意思 - 嗨
- Excuse me. - Hey.

493
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,295
- 嗨 - 开车
- Hey. - Drive.

494
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,592
- 昨天的那两个美国女孩呢? - 我不知道
- The two American girls from yesterday? - I don't know.

495
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:26,388
下一根肋骨可会插入你的肺 那两个美国女孩 她们在哪?
The next rib drives into your lungs. The two American girls, where are they?

496
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:31,180
- 就像以前一样 - 还有其它办法吗?
- Just like the old days. - Would you have it any other way?

497
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:32,765
你我之间? 没了
Between you and me? No.

498
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,268
不过我做文职后 一切看起来不一样了
But now that I sit behind a desk, the world looks different.

499
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,771
- 你是指很无聊吧 - 我是说不同
- You mean, looks boring. - I mean different.

500
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:43,275
好吧 有点无聊 不过退休了能有趣吗?
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired any more interesting?

501
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,862
不能 直到我女儿昨天在巴黎失踪了
It wasn't. Until my daughter disappeared in Paris yesterday.

502
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:50,950
她和她朋友在机场就被盯上了 阿尔巴尼亚人干的
She and her friend were marked by a spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

503
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:53,453
- 你怎么知道的? - 我退休了 又不是死了
- How do you know this? - I'm retired, not dead.

504
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:56,371
我猜你不会去报警
And I assume you don't want to go to the police.

505
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:59,291
有人告诉我 我有96个小时的时间 而那发生在16个小时前
I was told I have 96 hours. That was 16 hours ago.

506
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,420
- 好吧 首先我们得找到那个盯梢的 - 我找到了 但他死了
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter. - I found him, he's dead.

507
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,217
你找到的时候就已经死了?
You found him that way?

508
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:14,264
布莱恩 你不能这样跑来跑去 把巴黎弄得天翻地覆...
Bryan, you cannot just run around tearing down Paris...

509
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:16,601
如果有必要 我连埃菲尔铁塔都能掀翻
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to.

510
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,436
- 不要忘了你在和谁说话 - 一个朋友
- Don't forget who you talk to. - I'm talking to a friend.

511
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:24,650
没错 但记住 你朋友现在是做文职的
You are. But please remember, your friend has a desk now.

512
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,320
"内部安全局副局长" 印象深刻
"Deputy director, Internal Security." Very impressive.

513
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,490
阿尔巴尼亚人?
The Albanians?

514
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,576
六 七年前他们从东面过来
They showed up from the East, six, seven years ago.

515
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,120
有15 20个的样子 而现在有几百个了
Fifteen, 20 of them. Now there are hundreds.

516
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:38,998
我们甚至都不知道他们究竟有多少人 也不知道他们的危险程度
We don't even know how many. And dangerous.

517
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,876
明白了 哪里可以找到他们?

00:58:07,046 --> 00:58:10,299
别耍人了 再浪费我时间 小心我干掉你
Stop jerking around before I close you down for wasting my time.

648
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:17,515
在这等着
Wait here.

649
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,320
你带着武器?
You have weapon?

650
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:32,947
你手上拿着呢
You're holding it.

651
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,018
黑咖啡 一块糖 谢谢
Black, one sugar, please.

652
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,360
你要什么?
What is it you want?

653
00:59:12,903 --> 00:59:14,530
我是来谈价钱的
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

654
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:17,908
我们和梅肯先生谈过了
We already negotiated the rate with Mr. Macon.

655
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:21,245
梅肯先生调到别的区了
Mr. Macon has moved to another division.

656
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:23,247
我是来重新谈的
I'm here for the renegotiation.

657
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:30,713
觉得我有道理的话 那我接着说了
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable, let me explain ourselves.

658
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:35,760
咖啡不错 我们利用卫星全天24小时监视你们
Nice coffee. We have you under satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

659
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:39,597
你们说的每句话 做的每件事 我们都知道
We hear everything you say, we know everything you do.

660
00:59:39,764 --> 00:59:43,100
你知不知道 光是改变地球上空200米...
Do you have any idea what it costs just to change the angle...

661
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:46,729
...轨道卫星的镜头角度 就要花多少钱?
...of the lens on a satellite orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

662
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:48,481
而且价格还在上涨
And those costs have gone up.

663
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:51,901
我们的费用上涨 随之你们的费用也得上涨 再正常不过了
Our costs go up, your costs go up. It's only logical.

664
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:55,154
另外 你们谁是马科?
By the way, which one of you is Marko?

665
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,114
你问这干嘛?
Why do you want to know?

666
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:58,824
我听说马科是这的老大
I was told Marko is in charge.

667
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,785
我们都是马科
We are all Marko.

668
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:03,412
马科来自卓帕加
Marko from Tropoja.

669
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:04,830
我们都来自卓帕加
We are all from Tropoja.

670
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:10,961
如果你们那么想玩游戏 那么费用上升10%
If that's the game you want to play, the rate just went up 10 percent.

671
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:15,340
不要以为我们是移民就可以敲诈我们 我们懂法律
If you are trying to extort us because we are immigrants, we know the law.

672
01:00:15,758 --> 01:00:18,260
我敲诈你们是因为你们做了违法的事
I'm extorting you because you are breaking the law.

673
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,930
你们喜欢以哪项罪名被捕?
Which charge would you like to be arrested for?

674
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:24,099
贩毒 绑架 卖淫? 随你们挑
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution? Take your pick.

675
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:26,852
你们来到这个国家 利用这个国家...
You come to this country, take advantage of it...

676
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:30,105
...我们宽容并不代表我们懦弱无助
...and think because we are tolerant, we are weak and helpless.

677
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,149
你们的傲慢无礼激怒了我
Your arrogance offends me.

678
01:00:32,357 --> 01:00:34,318
为此 费用提升10%
For that, the rate went up 10 percent.

679
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:38,614
现在 你们要谈正事还是继续玩?
Now, do you want to get down to business or to keep playing?

680
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
- 多少? - 20%
- How much? - Twenty percent.

681
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:45,329
而且我保证一年内不会上涨
And you have my word it'll not go up for a year.

682
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:57,467
用你们的语言如何说"糖"?
How do you say "sugar" in your language?

683
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:13,023
你们做了明智的决定 先生们
You've made a very good investment, gentlemen.

684
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:14,358
一个月后见
See you in a month.

685
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:22,492
一个朋友给我的 是阿尔巴尼亚语 不介意翻一下吧?
A friend gave this to me. It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

686
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:36,506
祝你好运
Good luck.

687
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,048
- 祝你好运 - 祝你好运
- Good luck. - Good luck.

688
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:40,635
- 祝你好运 祝你好运 - 祝你好运
- Good luck. Good luck. - Good luck.

689
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,229
你不记得我了
You don't remember me.

690
01:01:53,022 --> 01:01:55,024
两天前我们通过电话
We spoke on the phone two days ago.

691
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:00,029
我告诉过你我会找到你
I told you I would find you.

692
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:06,095
金米
Kim.

693
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:22,027
阿曼达
Amanda.

694
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,023
醒醒!
Wake up!

695
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:01,316
我要你集中精神
I need you to be focused.

696
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,363
精神集中了吗?
Are you focused yet?

697
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:17,374
这女孩在哪?
Where is this girl?

698
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,710
她在哪?
Where is she?

699
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,076
你知道 我们以前会外包这种事
You know, we used to outsource this kind of thing.

700
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:54,912
但我们发现 我们外包的那些国家...
But what we found was the countries we outsourced to...

701
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,458
...电网都不怎么稳定 典型的第三世界
...had unreliable power grids. Very Third World.

702
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:00,960
你按了开关 却没有电...
You'd turn on a switch, power wouldn't come on...

703
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:05,130
...真是气死人 没办法 就只能拔指甲
...and then tempers would get short. People would resort to pulling fingernails.

704
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,633
在裸露的皮肤上洒酸溶液
Acid drips on bare skin.

705
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:10,260
这些只会造成反效果
The whole exercise would become counterproductive.

706
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:12,096
但在这里 电力很稳定
But here, the power's stable.

707
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:14,599
这里的电流源源不断
Here, there's a nice even flow.

708
01:05:14,765 --> 01:05:18,060
轻按开关 电力就能持续一整天
Here, you can flip a switch and the power stays on all day.

709
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:23,483
她在哪?
Where is she?

710
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:48,382
我可没什么时间可以浪费 卓帕加的马科
Now, I don't have any more time to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

711
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:51,135
回答我 否则这个开关会一直开着...
Give me what I need or this switch'll stay on...

712
01:05:51,301 --> 01:05:54,263
...直到他们付不出电费而关掉
...till they turn power off for lack of payment on the bill.

713
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:56,807
我女儿在哪?
Where is my daughter?

714
01:05:57,349 --> 01:06:00,770
我们不会留着处女 我们会卖了她们
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

715
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,147
她是处女 可以卖一大笔
She was virgin, lot of money.

716
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:05,483
你把我女儿卖了? 你把她卖了?
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

717
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:09,153
卖给谁了?
To who?

718
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,489
我不知道
I don't know.

719
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:15,826
- 什么? - 圣・嘉力
- What? - Saint-Clair.

720
01:06:16,326 --> 01:06:17,327
圣・嘉力
Saint-Clair.

721
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,330
圣・嘉力? 圣・嘉力 是个人 还是个地方?
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair. Is that a person, a place?

722
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:24,960
是个人 帕特里斯・圣・嘉力
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

723
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:26,170
帕特里斯・圣・嘉力
Patrice Saint-Clair.

724
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:28,673
在哪能找到他?
Where can I find him?

725
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:31,509
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know, I don't know.

726
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:35,012
我不知道 我不知道 我不知道
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

727
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,473
求求你! 我真的不知道!
Please! I don't know!

728
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,644
我不知道! 不! 求求你! 求求你
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

729
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,646
求求你
Please.

730
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:45,898
不要 求求你
Not that. Please.

731
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:47,483
我相信你
I believe you.

732
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,572
但我不能放过你
But it's not gonna save you.

733
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,597
看看谁来了
Look who dropped by.

734
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,016
布莱恩 真是意外啊
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

735
01:07:21,225 --> 01:07:22,226
吉恩・克劳德
Jean-Claude.

736
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:24,895
孩子们在等你
The children waited up for you.

737
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:28,398
快带他们去睡觉 我们还能吃顿热乎乎的
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat before everything gets cold.

738
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,067
布莱恩 来帮下忙?
Bryan, will you do the honors?

739
01:07:30,275 --> 01:07:32,194
- 好的 - 我马上来
- Sure. - I'll be just a minute.

740
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:04,894
我正跟布莱恩说 你换了新工作后...
I was just telling Bryan how nice it's been...

741
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,229
...一切变得好多了
...since you left the old job for the new one.

742
01:08:07,396 --> 01:08:10,232
每晚回家吃饭 见到孩子们的时间也多了
Home every night for dinner, get to see the kids more.

743
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:13,443
每晚回家 看着孩子们 一定很幸福
Yeah, must be nice coming home every night, seeing your kids.

744
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:15,738
布莱恩在考虑搬家
Bryan has been thinking about relocating.

745
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:17,615
- 真的? - 是的

746

747
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:22,453
- 要鸡胸还鸡腿? - 鸡腿 谢谢
- White or dark meat? - Dark, please.

748
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,954
有看上的吗?
Find anything interesting?

749
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:27,917
说实话 有啊 在天堂街第十区
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

750
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:31,295
住那的人认识你的一个同事
People there know someone that works in your office.

751
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:33,506
一位梅肯先生 你认识吗?
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

752
01:08:33,673 --> 01:08:35,966
哦 亨利 我都叫他紧张先生
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

753
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:39,804
总是一副会有麻烦的样子 要胡萝卜吗?
Always seems like he's about to have a problem. Carrots?

754
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:41,806
我查到了 吉恩・克劳德
I got to the bottom of it, Jean-Claude.

755
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:43,307
我什么都知道了
I know everything.

756
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:46,310
我希望你没趟进这浑水
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

757
01:08:47,687 --> 01:08:50,523
- 什么浑水? - 现在不该说这些 布莱恩
- What shit? - This is not the time or place, Bryan.

758
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,775
- 你掺合进来了? - 掺合进什么?
- Are you involved? - Involved in what?

759
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:54,944
你们俩在说什么?
What are you two talking about?

760
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:58,698
- 是不是? - 我的薪水是X 我的开支是Y
- Are you? - My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

761
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:00,950
只要能养家...
As long as my family is provided for...

762
01:09:01,116 --> 01:09:03,703
...我不在乎从哪弄钱
...I do not care where the difference comes from.

763
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,788
我就是那样卷进来的
That is my entire involvement.

764
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,957
- 那我的家人呢? - 我告诉你...
- What about my family? - I told you...

765
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:10,543
...只要不惹麻烦 我会帮你的
...I would help as long as it didn't cause trouble.

766
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,044
谁是帕特里斯・圣・嘉力?
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

767
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:15,715
我不知道 我也不关心 我载你去机场
I don't know, I don't care. I am driving you to the airport.

768
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,174
吉恩・克劳德
Jean-Claude.

769
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,344
走吧 晚餐结束了
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

770
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,304
- 我还没吃完 - 不 你吃完了
- I'm not finished yet. - Yes, you are.

771
01:09:22,555 --> 01:09:25,390
- 不! - 不 我还没有
- No! - No, I'm not.

772
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:33,357
那就是你做文职的后果 你忘了些事
That's what happens when you sit behind a desk. You forget things.

773
01:09:33,566 --> 01:09:36,026
就如你都忘了 上了弹的枪拿在手上的重量
Like the weight in the hand of a gun that's loaded.

774
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:39,238
伊莎贝尔!
Isabelle!

775
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:41,866
只是皮肉伤
It's a flesh wound.

776
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:45,703
但你再不说 就会看到你最不想看的...
But if you don't get me what I need, the last thing you'll see...

777
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:47,872
...我会射穿她的脑门
...is the bullet I put between her eyes.

778
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,125
现在 告诉我谁是帕特里斯・圣・嘉力
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

779
