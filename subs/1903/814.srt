1
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,774
从创世之初起
Since the birth of time,

2
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,249
人类就尽力将坏人囚禁
humanity has endeavored to restrain evil men in prisons.

3
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,748
但自从该隐放跑了他的弑兄凶手之后
But since Cain fled the murder of his brother,

4
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,152
不断地有坏人逃离惩戒
evil men have fled the walls of punishment.

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,756
这样看来 即使你是个到处惹是生非 又在逃的混蛋
So, it doesn't matter if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,

6
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,022
也无关紧要 因为你自视优越
because you think you're better than everyone else,

7
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,622
觉得自己可以为所欲为
and somehow entitled to do what you gotta do.

8
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,496
那你就错了
No.

9
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:02,434
因为魔高一尺道高一丈
Because, you see, badass motherfuckers are never fast enough.

10
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,833
最终 他们都会自食其果
In the end, they will all be accounted for.

11
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,796
他妈的! 从哪儿冒出来的
Son of a bitch! Came out of nowhere.

12
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,129
- 她不是说他已经死了吗?  - 你看见他了?
- Didn't she say he was dead?  - You see him?

13
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,299
- 估计我们跟丢他了  - 我发誓她说过他已经死了
- I think we lost him.  - I swear she said he was dead.

14
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:36,737
- 睁大眼睛看着!  - 丫的还没死!
- Keep watching!  - Well, fucking he ain't!

15
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,709
- 开好你的车吧!  - 我他妈不正开着吗!
- Drive the fucking car!  - I'm driving the goddamn car!

16
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,344
看不到他啊
I don't see him.

17
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,710
他都知道 他知道我们对她做过些什么
He knows. He knows what we did to her.

18
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,120
他清楚得很! 他会来找我们报仇的!
He knows! He's gonna make us pay!

19
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,021
- 靠! 靠! 靠!  - 我觉得我们跟丢他了
- Shit! Shit! Shit!  - I think we lost him.

20
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,293
我不会告诉你他们把她带到哪儿去了 绝不
I ain't never telling you where they've taken her. Never.

21
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,256
我知道
I know.

22
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,765
你打断我的腿了 我操!
You took my leg, you fuck!

23
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:20,804
对不起 伙计
I'm sorry, man.

24
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,206
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

25
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,372
- 我不知道 伙计  - 那个小女孩在哪儿?
- I don't know, man.  - Where is the baby girl?

26
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,881
我不知道 伙计
I don't know, man.

27
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:28,913
我不知道
I don't know.

28
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:33,512
在Stillwater! 嘿! 嘿!
Stillwater! Hey! Hey!

29
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:37,753
在Deacon树林里的Stillwater沼泽地!
Okay, Deacon's Tree, man. Stillwater Marsh!

30
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,829
应该是在德州
Texas, I think.

31
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,992
你来晚了 你该知道的 是吧?
You're too late. You gotta know that, right?

32
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,461
月圆之夜 就是她丧命之时
First full moon, she's dead, man.

33
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:50,862
她死后 地狱里的人就会来到该死的地球上
She's dead and hell's gonna walk the motherfucking earth.

34
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,479
地狱里的人已经来到地球上了
Hell already is walking the earth.

35
00:03:56,535 --> 00:04:01,985
你去告诉他 我就来 告诉他我要去把她夺回来
You tell him I'm coming. Tell him I'm coming to get her back.

36
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,472
# 让一切见鬼 让一切见鬼 让一切见鬼去吧 #
# Raise a little hell, raise a little hell. Raise a little hell. #

37
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,614
# 让一切见鬼 让一切见鬼 让一切见鬼去吧 #
# Raise a little hell, raise a little hell. Raise a little hell. #

38
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:48,120
然后 我就告诉他 我说 "Frank 到此为止 我不再供应免费牛奶了
So, I tell him, I says, "Frank, that's it. No more free milk.

39
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,188
你得买下这头奶牛 你个狗娘养的"
You gonna have to buy the cow, you son of a bitch."

40
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:51,957
但你没那么胖吧 Piper
But you are not fat, Piper.

41
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,832
什么? 不是啦 Norma Jean "买下这头奶牛"是让他娶我的意思
What? No, Norma Jean. "Buy the cow." Marry me.

42
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,499
我是让他娶我 否则不和他上床
I'm saying he's gotta marry me. I cut him off.

43
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,509
不和他上床?
You cut him off?

44
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,943
是的 千真万确!
Not just yes, but hell, yes! 

45
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:08,280
不准抓咪咪 不准摸屁屁 我还跟他说
No tits, no ass, and I told him,

46
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,487
"要是再把你的老二往我脸上凑
"If I see that big ol' dick anywhere near my face again,

47
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:13,112
- 我就一口咬断它"  - 你真这么说了?
- I'm gonna bite it in half."  - You said that?

48
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,918
没错 真说了
Yeah, sure did.

49
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,086
哦 天呐 这样多久了?
Oh, my God. How long has it been?

50
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:22,129
哦 两天 但对他那种无性不欢的人来说 像十年之久
Oh, two days. But that's like a decade in horny fucker years.

51
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,756
那他给你买钻戒了吗?
So, he bought you a diamond?

52
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,698
哦 天呐 没 要是Frank有钱给我买钻戒
Oh, God, no. If Frank had money for a diamond,

53
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:29,261
我老早就让他爽翻天了
I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shit hole in rear view.

54
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,399
不过他确实单膝下跪向我求婚了
But he did get down on one knee and ask me to be his bride.

55
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,033
- 不是吧! 哦!  - 是的哦!
- No way! Oh!  - Yes, way!

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,740
亲爱的!
Honey!

57
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,709
够了 够了!
Come on, come on!

58
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,841
你们觉得我付薪水 就是让你们站着闲聊的?
You think I pay you bitches to stand around and yap?

59
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,344
给我回去工作
Get the fuck back to work.

60
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,714
干死你啊 
Sit on it, baby.

61
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,262
嗨 你们好 我叫Piper 要些什么喝的吗?
Hi, guys. I'm Piper. Can I get you something to drink?

62
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,196
我们要这个
We'll take this.

63
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:00,134
"砖房"早餐 里面有10份大薄煎饼 一共是4.99美元
"She's a Brickhouse" breakfast. Ten monster flapjacks for $4.99.

64
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,172
- 加三杯水  - 好的 还要些其它...
- And three waters.  - All right, and what can I get for...

65
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,332
就要这些 薄煎饼就行了 没问题吧
That's it. Just the pancakes, if that's okay.

66
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,007
好的 马上就来
Okay, coming right up.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,143
Lou 一份砖房套餐!
Lou, one Brickhouse!

68
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,413
好啊 帅哥 要喝咖啡吗?
Hello, beautiful. Coffee?

69
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,044
清咖啡 加糖
Black, with sugar.

70
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:24,551
你听说过Stillwater沼泽或者一个叫做Deacon树林的地方吗? 貌似在德州?
Have you ever heard of a Stillwater Marsh or a Deacon's Tree? In Texas, maybe?

71
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,857
Stillwater沼泽 有啊 我听说过
Stillwater Marsh, yeah, I've heard of it,

72
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,759
但它不在德州
but it ain't in Texas.

73
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,657
Stillwater在路易斯安那州
Stillwater is in Louisiana.

74
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,262
是个小镇吗?
Small town?

75
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,495
亲爱的 Stillwater是座监狱
Honey, Stillwater is a prison.

76
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,541
我老爸在那儿待过一阵子 后来那儿就关了
My daddy did some time there before it closed.

77
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:41,500
我去帮你准备咖啡
I'll get you that coffee.

78
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,540
给 松饼和热牛奶
Here's some muffins and warm milk.

79
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,511
- 可我们没点...  - 这些是免费的
- But we didn't order...  - It's on the house.

80
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,981
你不想知道我什么时候下班吗?
So, you gonna ask me what time my shift ends?

81
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,327
今晚是月圆之夜哦
It's a full moon tonight.

82
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,828
每当月圆之夜我就有点儿饥渴
I always feel a little randy with a full moon.

83
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,258
我在月圆的这两天禁欲
Full moon's two days off.

84
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,232
你肯定吗 亲爱的?
You sure about that, sweetie?

85
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,269
非常肯定
Pretty sure.

86
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,205
外面那辆跑车不错 是你的吗?
Now, that's a hell of a ride out there. Is that yours?

87
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,545
那辆道奇吗? 我倒想啊
The Charger? I wish.

88
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,411
是她的吗?
Is it hers?

89
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:22,847
来了 这是你们要的水
All right, here are them waters.

90
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,181
薄煎饼稍后送上
I'll be right back with the flapjacks.

91
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,419
是的 不过如果你想上...
Sure. But if you're looking for a ride...

92
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,664
我跟你说过要加糖的
I told you I wanted sugar.

93
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,711
我们请客? 丫的我们请客?
On the house? On the fucking house?

94
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,776
别紧张 反正我们也准备把那些松饼扔掉了
Relax. We gonna throw them muffins out, anyway.

95
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:59,685
如果他们不付钱的话 那有人就得代劳了
If they're not gonna pay for them, somebody's gonna have to pay the price.

96
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:06,392
死胖子 我告诉过你不准再那样碰我的
I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never touch me like that again.

97
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:09,027
- 放开我的蛋蛋  - 闭嘴
- Let go of my balls.  - Shut up.

98
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:14,125
松饼钱算我的 老娘不干了
Muffins are on me. I quit.

99
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:20,004
在松饼上涂些蜂蜜和黄油 那样会更好吃
Put some honey butter on them muffins. They'll taste an awful lot better that way.

100
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,836
# 留恋我的胸前说你要我 低吟我的名字 一如既往 #
# Sucking on my titties like you wanted me, calling me all the time. #

101
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:53,671
# 就像金发女郎 看看命中注定那个他是否伸手可及 习以为常#
# Like Blondie, check out my Chrissy behind. It's fine all of the time. #

102
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,412
# 认识新的小妞儿你又能做什么 哈 #
# What else is in the teaches of Peaches, huh? #

103
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,743
# 说什么? #
# What? #

104
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:02,046
# 去他妈的伤痛 去他妈的伤痛 #
# Fuck the pain away. Fuck the pain away #

105
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,078
# 去他妈的伤痛 #
# Fuck the pain away #

106
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:07,482
# 去他妈的伤痛 去他妈的伤痛 #
# Fuck the pain away. Fuck the pain away #

107
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:11,257
# 去他妈的伤痛 去他妈的伤痛 #
# Fuck the pain away. Fuck the pain away #

108
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,724
# 去他妈的伤痛 #
# Fuck the pain away #

109
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,764
哦! 操!
Oh! Motherfuck!

110
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,290
现在看来 不算太糟
Now, that's not so bad.

111
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,852
如果你愿意 我可以帮你修
I can fix that if you'd like.

112
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,559
好啊 谢谢
I would. Thank you.

113
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,494
前提是你得捎我一段
If you give me a lift.

114
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,767
我只能把你带到Blackfoot瀑布 那里有车会停
I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls. The truck stop there.

115
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,580
那也感激不尽
I'd be much obliged.

116
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,716
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,050
我得申明一下
Just so you know,

118
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:18,684
我从不载伸手拦车的客人
I don't pick up hitchhikers.

119
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,253
我也没伸手说拦车啊
I didn't have my thumb out.

120
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,903
要帮忙吗?
Need some help there?

121
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,379
你 胖子 过来下
You, fat fuck. Come here.

122
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,352
你叫我什么? 你刚刚叫我什么?
What'd you call me? What did you just call me?

123
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,916
我叫你"胖子" 现在不是说这个的时候
I called you "fat fuck." And we had better leave it at that.

124
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,389
除非你想让我叫你"死胖子"
Unless you'd prefer I call you "dead fat fuck."

125
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:30,895
什么?
What?

126
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:35,129
我在找一个人 40岁左右 身高2米多
I'm looking for someone. Maybe 40 or so, 6'1",

127
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:38,003
看上去不像本地人的样子
probably looked out of place.

128
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,243
啊!
Ah!

129
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:49,841
他之前来过这儿 没带什么行李

Your car? Who's been making the payments,

164
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:26,759

你不想和我在一起了?
You don't wanna be with me?

170
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,174
好吧 我来帮你 让你永远都没男人要 永远没有
Fine. When I'm done, nobody's gonna wanna be with you, ever.

171
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,673

黑暗笼罩着我
It bums through me.

176

179
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:23,342
才能我们获得自由
that will set us all free.

180
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,619
我们才能走出这死亡之谷的阴影
We will walk through the valley of the shadow of death.

396
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,663

00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:23,364
升职加薪 升职加薪
Promotion and pay raise. Promotion and pay raise.

398
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,837
头低下!
Get down!

399
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:38,145
放下枪!
Drop in!

400
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:41,483
- 不!  - 你会后悔的 畜...

401
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:44,125
操! 去死吧你...
Fuck you!  Die, you...

402
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,971
噢 上帝
Oh, my God.

403
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,977
- Milton 你要干什么?  - 我去追他
- Milton, what are you doing?  - I'm going after him.

404
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:07,446

血差不多止住了
Bleeding's almost stopped.

406
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,519
只是擦伤而已
It's just a graze.

407
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,611
Milton 那些警察没事先警告就向我们开枪
Milton, those cops shot at us with no warning.

408
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:51,585
他们不是想抓我们 是想杀了我们
They weren't trying to arrest us, they were trying to kill us.

409
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:54,256
他们想杀了你
They were trying to kill you.

410
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:59,533

411
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,066
- 说 是什么?  - 全中
- Go on, what is it?  - Both.

412
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,036
天呐 我做了些什么?
Jesus, what have I done?

413
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:08,200
你他妈的为什么要把我牵扯进来? Milton 我杀了个警察!
What have you fucking got me in to? Milton, I shot a cop!

414
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:11,944

I'm gonna go to jail! Do you understand that? Fuck!

415
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,012
给我个不爆你头的理由
Give me one good reason I shouldn't shoot you in the face.

416
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,044
我在开车
I'm driving.

417
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,385
你懂我意思的!
You know what I mean!

418
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,319
操!
Fuck!

419
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:27,689
他们带走了她的孩子
They took her baby.

420
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,730
他们带走了她的小女儿
They took her little girl.

421
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:34,868
新闻上报道的那个小女孩?
The little girl on the news?

422
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:38,097
- 大家都在找的小孩?  - 是的
- The little baby everyone's looking for? - Yes.

他们杀了我女儿 带走了她孩子
They killed my daughter. They took her baby.

424
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:49,948
这小女孩是我的全部
That baby girl is all I got.

425
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:54,585
她是我与女儿的唯一关联
She's the last connection to my daughter.

426
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:57,482
我要把她找回来
I am going to get her back.

427
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,462
用猎枪 子弹已经装上了
Shotgun. It's already loaded.

428
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:16,973
把车窗摇下来
Roll it down.

429
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,150
就是现在!
Now!

把另一枝枪准备好
Get the other gun ready.

431
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,326
不 不 不 那支旧的 箱子里那支 把它准备好
No, no, no. The old one. The big one in the case, have it ready.

432
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,978
已经...  
It's...  

433
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:56,709
已经结束了 Milton 停车
It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

434
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,220
- 我可不能那么做!  - 是吗?
- I can't do that!  - Really?

435
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:00,850
你怎么会认为自己还有得选?
What makes you think you have a choice?

436
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,583
首先 因为你很惹人厌
Because you're obnoxious, first,

437
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,953
另外 我还有点事要做
and because I have something I gotta do.

438
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,385
那你本该提前做好的
Well, then you should've done it a long time ago.

439
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,487
我没必要提前做好 是吧?
I didn't have to do it a long time ago, did I?

440
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:13,329
噢 Milton 为了接近你 我可是会杀了你后座上那个漂亮小妞儿的哦
Oh, Milton, I will kill that pretty little woman in the backseat to get to you.

441
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,994
你以为你是Loki?(制造不和与灾难的火神)
You think you're Loki, huh?

442
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:16,901
你以为你是星期六男爵(巫毒教的死神)吗?
You think you're Baron Samedi?

443
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,569
- 我不会让它发生的  - 再重复一遍
- I won't allow that.  - Again,

444
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:22,336
你怎么会认为自己还有得选的?
what makes you think you have a choice?

445
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,475
因为它
This does.

446
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,323
Piper 等等!
Piper, wait!

447
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:32,038
他不是杀你女儿的凶手之一 是吧?
He ain't one of them that killed your daughter, was he?

448
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:34,373
他是另外的人
He's someone else.

449
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,075
有谁不想要你的命吗?
Anyone not trying to kill you?

450
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,247
没有
No.

451
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,115
你那是把什么枪?
What kind of fucking gun is that?

452
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:45,057
和你用的枪一样
The kind you use on guys like that.

453
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:47,594
我得装弹 你来开车
I need to reload. You drive.

454
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:51,927
操蛋
God damn it.

455
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,843
你 你! 你不能待在这儿
You. You! You can't be here.

456
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,712
- Rookie!  - Sarge 这老头子
- Rookie!  - Sarge, this old joke,

457
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,213
他不能在犯罪现场四周走来走去
he can't stomp around the crime scene.

458
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:09,208
队长 很抱歉
Captain, sorry about that.

459
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,410
Sarge 你最好让家这伙立马给我滚蛋
Sarge, you'd better get this guy out of here right now.

460
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,817
队长 他还是新人
Cap, he's green, that's all.

461
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:16,881
他现在就站在证据上面
Standing on evidence is what he's doing.

462
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,454
0.45英寸口径
0.45s.

463
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,158
- 把它们装好贴上标签  - 是 长官
- Bag them and tag them.  - Yes, sir.

464
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,825
- 嘿 把这些包起来  - Sarge.
- Hey, Tag these.  - Sarge.

465
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,160
为什么会有两个科罗拉多州的警察
Why do we have two dead Colorado troopers

466
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:31,364
死在我们伟大的俄克拉荷马州?
within our great state of Oklahoma?

467
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:37,944
这两位先生怎么会与人意见不合 而惨遭杀身之祸呢?
And how did these gentlemen come to be on the wrong end of a disagreement?

468
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:43,440
房间里的住客 John Milton 听说不在死亡名单之列?
The guest in this room, John Milton, I take it he's not among the departed?

469
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:46,043
- 没错 长官  - 队长 找到个活的
- No, sir.  - Cap, we got a live one.

470
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:49,955
设置路障 Sarge 遍布全国 你知道该怎么做
I want roadblocks, Sarge. All over the state. You know the drill.

471
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,227
拿条毯子 再叫个医生过来
Get me a blanket and get a medic in here, too.

472
00:40:57,287 --> 00:40:58,561
你现在好些了吧
You're gonna be okay now.

473
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:00,601
我们在做爱
We was fucking.

474
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,233
他杀了他 就在我们做爱之时!
He killed him while we was fucking!

475
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,234
- 谁干的?  - 不 你不明白
- Who did?  - No, you don't understand.

476
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,503
我从未遇到过这种事 你知道吗?
It's never happened to me before, you know?

477
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,249
你遇到过吗?
Has it ever happened to you?

478
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,649
另外再找个精神科医生过来 
Let's get a shrink in here, too.

479
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,594
伙计
Dude,

480
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:33,998
你觉得车下面会有人吗?
you think there's anybody in there?

481
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,896
恐怕是的
I guess.

482
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:39,837
门还关着在
The doors are still closed.

483
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,951
- 上帝啊...  - 我是上帝的老爹
- Jesus...  - Carpenter.

484
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,111
你听到那些都不算数 他更喜欢短发
And despite what you've heard, prefers short hair.

485
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:58,583
你他妈的差点弄死我 伙计
You almost fucking killed me, man.

486
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,786
没那么严重
Not even close.

487
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:04,160
你73岁前我都不会再见到你
I won't see you again until you're 73.

488
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:07,395
你 我们三个月后见
You, I'll see in three months.

489
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:11,997
嘿 那话什么意思?
Hey, what does that mean?

490
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:15,906
我女儿一毕业就和King混在一起
My daughter got mixed up with King straight out of college.

491
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,502
她认识他? 她认识Jonah King?
She knew him? She knew Jonah King?

492
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:21,208
她认识他 是的 没错 她认识
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.

493
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,647
她的世界就陷入了一片混乱
Her world was in a tailspin,

494
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:27,688
King一直在宣扬静默革命
and King was preaching quiet revolution.

495
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:31,190
过了4个月 她才发觉所谓的"静默"就是
It was four months before she realized "quiet" meant hiding

496
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,624
躲在地下室 斩鸡头 洒鸡血
in a basement, cutting the heads off of chickens.

497
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:35,526
Jonah King会巫术?
Jonah King's into voodoo?

498
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,461
不是巫术 是黑魔法
Not voodoo, satanic magic.

499
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,994
他在为自己的末日决战招兵买马
He was recruiting for his own personal Armageddon.

500
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,232
自然 我女儿想退出
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.

501
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,996
当她告诉他 她要离开时
When she told him she was leaving,

502
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:47,106
他用个轮胎铁圈把她的腿打断了三处
he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron.

503
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,204
天啦
Jesus.

504
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,441
她得到了教训
She learned her lesson,

505
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:54,538
乖乖当了18个月的小追随者 然后一天夜里
was a good little follower for 18 months, then one night,

506
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:58,118
她趁Jonah独自一人时 用五角挂饰
she got Jonah alone and stabbed him in his face

507
00:42:58,207 --> 00:42:59,447
刺伤了他的脸
with a pentagram pendant,

508
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,852
自己就消失在了黑暗中
and vanished into the darkness.

509
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,153
Milton 你女儿在邪教待了两年
Milton, your daughter was in a cult for two years,

510
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,716
你居然对此一无所知?
and you didn't even know about it?

511
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:08,523
我是说 之前你为什么不帮她?
I mean, why didn't you help her before?

512
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,992
我对此毫不知情 直到...
I didn't find out about any of this until...

513
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,391
直到我被监禁之后
Until after I got locked up.

514
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,971
你不上膛了?
You're not gonna reload?

515
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:20,598
总共只能装三枚子弹
Only three bullets to begin.

516
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:23,175
Milton 那是他的面包车
Milton, that's his van.

517
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:24,706
靠边停车
Pull over.

518
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:44,921
待这儿
Stay here.

519
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:58,274
# 每朵花儿都盛放 每只鸟儿都歌唱 #
# Each little flower that opens Each little bird that sings #

520
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:04,644
# 一切明亮又美好 生灵伟大又渺小 #
# All things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small #

521
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:10,917
# 万物聪慧又精彩 都是上帝的功劳 #
# All things wise and wonderful The Lord God made them all #

522
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:13,993
# 一切明亮又美好 #
# All things bright and beautiful #

523
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,726
# 生灵伟大又渺小 #
# All creatures great and small #

524
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:26,131
老兄 换做我是你 决不会这么做
Man, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

525
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,008
放她走 然后把小孩给我
Let her go and give me the child.

526
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,076
否则我让你们全都人头落地
Or I'll blow all your heads off.

527
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:38,150
放下枪 不然我们干掉她
Drop it. Or we will gut her.

528
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:42,052
你自己选 宝贝 不过不管怎样 我们都赢定了
Your choice, sugar. But either way, we win.

529
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,784
这不是闹着玩 伙计
We don't play, boy.

530
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:59,601
Milton 是吧?
Milton, isn't it?

531
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,570
你怎么在这儿?
Why you here?

532
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:05,803
- 为什么你这么小题大作?  - 你知道我为什么来这
- Why you making such a fuss?  - You know why I'm here.

533
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,555
我只知道
All I know about you is

534
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,361
你抛弃了你女儿
you abandoned your daughter.

535
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:27,635
她失望透顶 所以告诉大家你死了
Crushed her so completely, she told everyone you were dead.

536
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:30,297
不 Milton
No, Milton.

537
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:36,570
出于好意 我不能把这孩子给你
I cannot, in good faith, hand over this child to you.

538
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:39,875
那在月圆之夜牺牲她就是可以了吗?
But sacrificing her under the full moon is okay?

539
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:44,077
这孩子受到神难以置信的青睐
This child is unbelievably blessed.

540
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:47,313
看看你周围 世界水深火热
Look around you. World is on fire.

541
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:51,054
人们都在忍受煎熬
People are suffering. 

542
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:53,423
除非爆发革命 不然他们将继续受苦
And they will continue to suffer until change comes.

543
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,427
继续放声大笑吧 孩子
Yeah, go ahead and laugh, boy.

544
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,429
革命即将到来
Change is gonna come.

545
00:45:58,554 --> 00:46:00,397
多亏了你的血统
Thanks to your lineage.

546
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:05,535
这孩子将会开启一扇通往新的
This child will open the door to a new

547
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,232
世界秩序的大门
world order.

548
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:13,372
你这个骗子杀了我女儿 还想跟我宣扬这些狗屁宗教
The charlatan murders my daughter and then feeds me his philosophy.

549
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:19,847
你女儿的死是个意外
Your daughter's death was an accident.

550
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,650
我全都看到了
I saw the whole thing.

551
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:26,457
我看到了四下无人时 你真正的嘴脸
I saw who you are when no one's looking.

552
00:46:26,515 --> 00:46:28,995
我看到那晚你付出的代价
And I saw what that night cost you.

553
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:31,126
Milton 你
Milton,

554
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,462
这是自找难堪啊
you're embarrassing yourself.

555
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,730
你强迫我女儿下跪
You forced my daughter on her knees,

556
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,098
结果她让你付出了代价
and she made you pay for it.

557
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,099
是吧 穿皮夹克的?
Isn't that right, Leather Jacket?

558
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,439
当时你在场
You were there.

559
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,238
这个混蛋让你发誓不告诉别人
Dickless made you swear not to tell anyone.

560
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:50,912
呦 John
Yo, John.

561
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:55,713
把孩子给我
Give me the child.

562
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:00,526
把孩子给我
Give me the child.

563
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,930
我说 把孩子给我
I said, give me the child.

564
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,168
不!
No!

565
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:20,708
后退!
Back off!

566
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:29,282
孩子 对我来说 一边吃着葡萄柚当早餐 一边给你喉咙来一枪
My child, it'd be pretty easy for me to shoot you in the throat,

567
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,689
看你血汨汨地流 那很简单
watch you gurgle, while I eat my morning grapefruit.

568
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,251
但我不想这样 Piper 你...
But I don't think so, Piper. You...

569
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:37,620
你让我感兴趣
You interest me.

570
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,124
我可以杀了你
I could take your life.

571
00:47:40,222 --> 00:47:43,101
我也可以庇佑你
Or I could bestow my blessings upon you.

572
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,807
教你 就像教Milton的女儿那样
Teach you, like I taught Milton's daughter.

573
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,399
你让我想起她 知道吗?
You remind me of her, you know?

574
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:51,711
如此神似
So much spirit.

575
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:54,441
但我毁了她
But I broke her.

576
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,150
而且我很乐意用相同的方式毁了你
And I will so enjoy breaking you the same way.

577
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:02,481
上车走
Let's go for a ride.

578
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,052
走!
Let's go!

579
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,023
不! 不!
No! No!

580
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,125
不! Milton! Milton!
No! Milton! Milton!

581
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:18,102
我他妈的一定会杀了你!
I'll fucking kill you!

582
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:24,838
操! 操! 放开我!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Get off me!

583
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:31,281
不! 不! 他妈的放开我 你他妈个混账!
No! No! Fucking get off me, you motherfucker!

584
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:36,788
这下有乐子了!
This is gonna be fun!

585
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:41,918
- 风骚娘们! 风骚娘们!  - 我们坐车去 骚货
- Feisty bitch! Feisty bitch!  -  We're going for a ride, girl.

586
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:47,090
看见这根腿骨了吗?
You see this here femur bone?

587
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:48,759
是你女儿的
That belonged to your daughter.

588
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:51,033
无论去哪儿 我都随身带着
I keep it with me wherever I go.

589
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:04,012
操! 操! 操! 操蛋放我走!
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking let me go!

590
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:25,164
下次 我会射穿你这张臭嘴
Next time, I'll shoot you in your fucking mouth.

591
00:49:33,102 --> 00:49:35,139
可以走了吗?
Shall we proceed?

592
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:49,563
我们得把他们埋到外面去
We'll bury them out back.

593
00:49:49,618 --> 00:49:51,188
你现在去卡车那儿 把他妈的铲子拿来
Now, get the fucking shovels out of the truck.

594
00:49:51,253 --> 00:49:53,233
不 你他妈的自己拿去吧
No, you go get the fucking shovels.

595
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,032
操!
Fuck!

596
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:58,933
走! 快走! 趴下!
Go! Go! Down!

597
00:50:16,278 --> 00:50:18,121
他怎么还没挂?
How come he ain't dead?

598
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,786
没事 我马上干掉他
It don't matter. He's gonna be.

599
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:37,367
哦 看看
Well, look at this.

600
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:39,269
他还在追
He's still coming.

601
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:41,307
- 谁还在追?  - Milton
- Who's still coming?  - Milton.

602
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:43,543
- Milton  - 想干吗?
- Milton.  - What?

603
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,205
- 乖乖坐着  - 他还活着
- Stay down.  - He's alive.

604
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,984
你可是爆了他的头啊
But you shot him in the face.

605
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:03,792
你们还不懂吗?
Don't you see?

606
00:52:03,852 --> 00:52:05,525
我们正站在命运的十字路口
We stand at a crossroads.

607
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:07,759
你们都没感觉到吗 我们终于可以大展拳脚
Y'all didn't think we could just kick up our heels,

608
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:09,166
改变这世界了 不是吗?
and change the world, did you?

609
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:10,632
嗯
Mmm-mmm.

610
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:31,050
战斗即将来临 神圣的战斗
We got a fight coming. A glorious battle.

611
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,059
他超过去了!
He's coming around!

612
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:38,185
去死吧!
Fuck you!

613
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:13,983
看我不把你弄死 你个小贱人!
I'm going to kill you, you little bitch!

614
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:42,313
我改主意了 Piper
I've changed my mind about you, Piper.

615
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:44,051
你实在是太任性 我都没法教了
You are too willful to be taught.

616
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:50,057
我要杀了你
I am going to kill you,

617
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:52,189
然后慢慢奸尸
and then I'm going to defile your corpse.

618
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,930
从现在开始
Between now and then,

619
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,332
我会让你吃不了兜着走
I'm gonna fuck you up.

620
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:06,610
噢 Piper
Oh, Piper.

621
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,036
倒拔垂柳!
Knock her ass out!

622
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:04,161
你真是太任性了
You're so willful.

623
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,574
叫你任性!
Willful!

624
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,587
安息吧 亲爱的Piper
Goodbye, sweet Piper.

625
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:13,201
他冲着我们来了!
He's coming right at us!

626
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,170
Piper 跳!
Piper!

627
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,437
天啊 Milton 怎么回事?
Jesus, Milton. How?

628
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:53,973
它还在里面
It's still in there.

629
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:57,841
子弹 我能... 我能感觉到
The bullet. I can... I can feel it.

630
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,446
那你怎么会还活着?
How are you still alive?

631
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:05,547
没时间解释了 他们要跑远了
We don't have time for this. They're getting away.

632
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,794
我以为你已经死了
Thought you were dead.

633
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:21,663
这驾照岂止是过期 都能算得上是古董了
This license isn't just expired, it's antique.

634
00:59:21,723 --> 00:59:23,361
她告诉大家 你已经死了
She told everyone you were dead.

635
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:25,596
你在监狱蹲了多久?
How long were you in prison?

636
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,474
还是你根本没进去过?
Were you in prison at all?

637
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:36,410
我的天 Milton 你跟我说过真话吗?
Jesus, Milton, has anything you told me been true?

638
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:41,847
我以前认识个住在这附近的人 你有
I used to know a guy who lived out this way. You have one of those

639
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:43,952
便携式电话吗?
portable phones?

640
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:48,689
手机? 你是说手机是吧 Milton?
A cell phone? You mean a cell phone, Milton?

641
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:51,788
是啊 我有个手机 在我手提包里
Yeah, I got a cell phone. It's in my purse.

642
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:56,127
- 你就想这么糊弄我吗?  - 能就好了
- You just gonna ignore me?  - I'm gonna try.

643
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:59,770
我们得把这车藏起来 我来推 你把方向盘
We have to hide the car. I'll push, you steer.

644
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,805
做梦吧 谁在乎?
Forget about it. Who cares?

645
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:05,708
你在乎 你杀了2个警察
You should. You killed two cops.

646
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:19,187
# 车内气氛 快要燃烧 #
# Here we are burning up in our cars #

647
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:23,328
# 心亦如此 #
# and in our hearts #

648
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:29,666
# 喝你泡的茶 好运如破晓 # 
# With your tea. Lucky states as the day breaks #

649
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,502
# 问道于盲者 #
# The blind are leading the blind #

650
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:50,615
- 今天挺热啊 是吧?  - 救救我
- Scorcher today, huh?  - Help me.

651
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,261
天呐 不好意思
Christ on a cracker. My apologies.

652
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:00,928
那个代表什么?
What's that supposed to mean?

653
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:03,902
那是我们与真主撒旦契约的印记
It's a symbol of our pact with Lord Satan.

654
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:05,700
契约 是吗? 噢!
Pact, huh? Ooh!

655
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,407
可笑 他可从没提到过你
Funny, he's never mentioned you.

656
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:12,907
喔! 真是糟糕啊 来 喝点水吧
Whoa! Those are fucked. Here, have some water.

657
01:01:19,808 --> 01:01:21,481
真是业余
Amateurs.

658
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,316
我会死 是吗?
I'm gonna die, ain't I?

659
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:30,329
- Milton的东西 我拿走了  - 好
- Milton's work, I take it.  - Yeah.

660
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:33,362
狗娘养的 快打死我!
Son of a bitch shot me!

661
01:01:35,023 --> 01:01:36,696
等等 你怎么...
Wait. How did you...

662
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:39,128
你是谁?
Who are you?

663
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,639
我是"会计师"
I'm The Accountant.

664
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:45,072
我很好奇 我一般不会对什么好奇
I'm curious, and I never get curious.

665
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,240
- 你们这些人想从Milton身上得到什么?  - 你谁啊?
- What do you people want with Milton?  - You're the who?

666
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:56,078
这很重要吗? Milton对你们而言 为什么这么重要?
Does it matter? Milton. Why is he important to you?

667
01:01:56,144 --> 01:01:59,785
重要个屁! 是他一直追着我们!
He isn't! He's the one chasing us!

668
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,224
- 为什么?  - 因为...
- Why?  - Because...

669
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:04,025
因为我们所做的 我们所夺走的
Because of what we did. Because of who we took.

670
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:09,096
好吧 我真的很好奇 你们做了什么? 你们又夺走了谁?
Well, color me curious, what did you do? And who did you take?

671
01:02:12,427 --> 01:02:15,271
弄痛你了 就跟我说 Milton
Let me know if I hurt you, Milton.

672
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:17,240
我刚才想把她抢回来的
I tried to get her back.

673
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:19,737
真的
I really did.

674
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:21,143
我知道
I know.

675
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:25,310
去他妈的恶魔崇拜者 他们真他妈让我抓狂
Fucking devil worshippers. They freak me the fuck out.

676
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:29,117
他们不该动用那些力量的 现在却随便动用 快气死我了
Messing with powers they ought not to. Turns my shit white.

677
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:31,054
这些都是虚幻的
None of it's real.

678
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:36,854
Milton 不是的 UFO 大脚野人 还有鬼都是扯淡的
No, Milton. UFOs and bigfoot and ghosts, that's bullshit.

679
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:39,597
恶魔是真的
Devils and demons.

680
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:44,133
一旦你开启了那些门 就由不得你关上了
Once you open those doors, you just can't close them.

681
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,334
你知道的 不是吗?
But you know that, don't you?

682
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,670
- 你不是死了吗  - 噢 这话我们最近听多了
- You're dead.  - Yeah, we've been getting that a lot lately.

683
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:28,679
不 小姑娘
No, toots.

684
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:31,280
我还搬过他的棺材
I carried his coffin.

685
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,342
Webster啊
Webster,

686
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:37,685
你是要继续握着那把.357口径手枪 还是把它拿出来?
are you gonna keep stroking that .357, or you gonna yank it?

687
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,156
那要看情况了
That depends.

688
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:41,790
你怎么会还活着?
How is this possible?

689
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,488
你听说过我的女儿吗?
You heard about my daughter?

690
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:45,893
是的
I did.

691
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:48,628
那你应该知道我为什么回来
Then you know why I'm back.

692
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:39,780
我不太明白...
I don't...

693
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:42,622
麻烦你解释一下 好吗?
Can you explain this, please?

694
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:45,152
他很爱他的女儿
He loved his daughter.

695
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,254
哪个父亲不爱自己的女儿
A lot of daddies love their daughters.

696
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:53,399
但这不能解释这个令人震惊的现实
But it don't explain shattering reality.

697
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:58,438
那家伙太爱自己的女儿了 以至于女儿开始恨他
Well, that one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him.

698
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:00,929
呃 他...
Uh, he was...

699
01:05:02,697 --> 01:05:06,338
他是个非常 非常不称职的丈夫
He was a bad, bad husband.

700
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:09,643
但他却是个好父亲
But he was a good father.

701
01:05:10,538 --> 01:05:14,315
后来 我们入错了伙
And then, we went and got mixed up in the wrong crowd.

702
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:17,448
一旦陷进去 就无法脱身了
And once you are in, there ain't no getting out.

703
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:22,724
所以为了保护她 在她还高中时 他就销声匿迹了
So, to protect her, he vanished while she was still in high school.

704
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:24,595
我也随他一起去了
And I went with him.

705
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:27,664
- 但你逃出来了  - 是的
- But you got out.  - Yeah, I did.

706
01:05:28,156 --> 01:05:32,298
不过那是因为 任务完成的时候 有几个人
But only 'cause he paid a little visit to some fellows

707
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:35,432
想灭了我们 他去见了那些人
who wanted to kill us when the job was done.

708
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,244
他一个人去了 你明白吧 早知道我也该去的
He went alone, you see. I would've gone,

709
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:46,586
但我当时不知道
but I didn't know.

710
01:05:48,743 --> 01:05:50,745
我是该去的
I would've gone.

711
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,404
这火让你回想到地狱了?
That fire making you homesick?

712
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,242
冰啤酒要吗?
Cold beer?

713
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:14,814
火焰并不是最可怕的部分
Fire isn't the worst part.

714
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,043
火焰中的画面才是
It's the video feed.

715
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:22,381
不是你自己所受的苦难
It's not about your suffering,

716
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:24,590
煎熬
your burning.

717
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:29,861
而是你爱的人承受的痛苦 因为
It's about the suffering of those you love because

718
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:32,329
你可以看得
that's all you see

719
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:35,735
一清二楚
in full detail.

720
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:40,802
你只能眼睁睁地看着
And there's nothing you can do to shut it off.

721
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:47,747
我被杀那年女儿才16岁
My daughter was 16 when I got shot.

722
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:52,006
我看着她落泪
I watched her weep.

723
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:54,751
我听着她骂我
I watched her curse me.

724
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:59,692
我看着她加入邪教
I watched her join that cult.

725
01:07:01,983 --> 01:07:03,826
我看着那些凶手
I watched the murders.

726
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:12,061
先是杀害我的从不惹事 自由自在的女婿 然后...
My tree-hugging, sandal-wearing son-in-law first, and then...

727
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:18,473
然后是我的女儿
And then my daughter.

728
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:23,438
地狱的煎熬
Burning is nothing

729
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,986
比起看着自己孩子的头被人拧下来 又算得了什么
compared to watching your child's head being torn off.

730
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:42,028
谢谢你 Webster 我现在不会去喝那杯冰啤酒
Thank you, Webster. I don't believe I'll be having that beer just now.

731
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:48,534
直到我能拧下Jonah King的头盖骨 用它盛来喝
Not unless I'm drinking it from Jonah King's skull.

732
01:07:55,703 --> 01:07:59,708
John 那车我恐怕修不好了
John, I can't fix that car.

733
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:06,117
但我能让你去你要去的地方
But I can get you where you need to be.

734
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:27,974
Milton 如果我没记错的话
Milton, if memory serves,

735
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,777
你以前可是和这辆雪佛兰人车合一的 是吗?
you were always partial to the Chevelle, yes?

736
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:39,749
- 454的?  - 是啊
- 454?  - Yeah.

737
01:08:58,466 --> 01:08:59,877
- 这里是911  - 你好
- 9-1-1.  - Hi.

738
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,970
- 您有什么紧急状况?  - 昨晚有人
- What's your emergency?  - About that fella

739
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:05,449
在猛牛酒吧杀了里面所有的人
who killed all them people at the Bull By The Balls last night.

740
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,317
先生?
Sir?

741
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,184
我知道在哪找到他
I know where you can find him.

742
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:13,989
Stillwater Marsh监狱很多年以前就关闭了
Stillwater Marsh Penitentiary shut down ages ago.

743
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:17,025
想猜猜助祭树是什么吗?
You wanna guess what Deacon's Tree was?

744
01:09:17,852 --> 01:09:19,798
- 用来施绞刑的树  - 猜对了
- Hanging tree.  - Yeah.

745
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:23,996
上一次绞刑是在38年 他们留下了那棵树用来奚落囚犯
Last hanging was in '38. They left the tree to taunt the inmates.

746
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:26,403
谷歌地图说 开车要8小时
Google Maps says it's an eight-hour drive.

747
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:27,997
- 我们会在...  - Webster
- We should be...  - Webster,

748
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,432
- 我要你留下来  - 什么?
- I need you to stay here.  - What?

749
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:34,403
不行 你上次就是一个人去的
No. You went alone last time.

750
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:35,878
这次不是
I'm not going alone.

751
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:39,215
你是要带那个小萝莉 不带我吗?
Are you gonna take that little girl over me?

752
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,279
把弹壳都给我吧
Give me the shells.

753
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:47,049
你真是个该死的矛盾体 你知道吗?
You're a goddamned walking contradiction, you know that?

754
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:49,217
你有多少次想要伸张正义
How many times you walk towards the straight and narrow

755
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:51,991
最后却以牺牲别人而收场?
only to get covered up in someone else's blood?

756
01:09:53,054 --> 01:09:55,000
你这次又要以谁生命终结来收场?
Whose blood are you gonna end up covered in this time?

757
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:58,363
- 这次不一样  - 是吗?
- This time it's different.  - Is it?

758
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:20,292
他不一起来吗?
He's not coming?

759
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:21,955
Piper啊
Piper,

760
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:25,063
我需要你 但我不会对你说谎
I need you. But I won't lie to you.

761
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,929
这事很难办
This is going to be rough.

762
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:30,102
你确定要跟我一起吗?
Are you sure about this?

763
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:33,204
一直以来 我的生活除了等待一无所有
My whole life has been nothing but waiting.

764
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:37,732
等人点餐 等一个混蛋 我一直等着生活有意义的那一天
Waiting on tables, waiting on fools, waiting for it just to mean something.

765
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:39,773
现在 终于让我等到了
And now, it means something.

766
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:41,872
我跟定你了
I'm with you until the end.

767
01:11:09,263 --> 01:11:11,140
我们现在干吗?
What do we do?

768
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:12,836
没事
Nothing yet.

769
01:11:13,134 --> 01:11:14,477
该死
Shit.

770
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:30,395
你们只要把他们逼向这边 剩下的交给我们
You just keep driving them to us. We'll do the rest.

771
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:33,523
记得在爆炸之前脱身
And make sure you peel off before the fireworks.

772
01:11:36,657 --> 01:11:38,898
警官们 集合!
Troopers, fall in!

773
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:45,909
大家听好 这两个人杀了两个我们的人
Gentlemen, these two have killed two of our own.

774
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,810
我知道你们很想让他们偿命
I know you want to make them pay.

775
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:52,477
所以 当我下令瞄准轮胎时
Therefore, when I tell you to aim for their tires,

776
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,349
就是在说
what I mean is

777
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:58,515
瞄准他们的脑袋 都明白了吗?
aim for their heads. Are we clear?

778
01:11:58,613 --> 01:12:00,024
是 长官!
Yes, sir!

779
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:03,261
很好
Very well then.

780
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:05,325
现在
Please,

781
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,662
瞄准轮胎
aim for their tires.

782
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:20,940
前面会有更多
There'll be even more ahead.

783
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:23,204
继续开吧
Just keep driving.

784
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,349
抱歉
I'm sorry.

785
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:42,262
来了
Here we go.

786
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:46,369
穷途末路了 伙计
End of the line, folks.

787
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:48,804
举起双手 慢慢走出车子
Step out of the vehicle with your hands raised.

788
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:52,434
还是给他们的轮胎干净利落来一枪
May as well give the boys a clear shot

789
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,207
比较好
at their tires.

790
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:15,034
氢气
未来能源

791
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:18,034
那到底是什么?
What the hell is that?

792
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:23,265
噢 不速之客嘛
Well, this is unexpected.

793
01:13:24,532 --> 01:13:26,705
所有人 都让开!
Everybody, clear the road!

794
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:28,873
闪开!
Get out of here!

795
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:53,269
趴下
Get down.

796
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,168
把枪给我!
Give me that thing!

797
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:42,711
要不要打爆他的轮胎 长官?
You want us to shoot out his tires, Captain?

798
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:50,629
他妈的不是吧
No goddamn way.

799
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:56,925
老天真不给面子 偏偏在这个时候出现一个联邦调查员
No ever loving way in God's good heaven are you an FBI agent.

800
01:14:56,991 --> 01:14:58,470
我命令你们退下
I need you boys to stand down.

801
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:00,334
长官 这张证件你懂的 是吧?
Captain, you know what this badge means, right?

802
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:03,601
联邦调查局 你他妈的别碍事
Federal Bureau of get-the-fuck-out-of-my-way.

803
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:07,305
我们联邦正在调查的案子 被你们这群人搅得一团糟
You boys have blundered into an ongoing Federal case.

804
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:10,814
现在 放下你们的武器
Now, lower your weapon.

805
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:18,549
- 你  - 嘿 嘿 嘿! 长官!
- You.  - Hey, hey, hey! Captain!

806
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:24,020
看来你是一仆侍奉二主啊
It seems you're serving two masters.

807
01:15:24,518 --> 01:15:26,156
拿出你的电话 打给你主子
Take out your phone and call him.

808
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:27,930
打给Jonah King
Call Jonah King.

809
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,230
跟他说Milton已经死了
Tell him Milton is dead.

810
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,907
照他说的做 警员 你听到探员的命令了
Do as he says, Trooper. You heard the agent.

811
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:39,235
你们其他人 退下
The rest of you, stand down.

812
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:45,814
所有人立刻退下 该死的!
Everybody, stand down right now, God damn it!

813
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:50,520
他们为什么没来追我们?
Why aren't they following us?

814
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:53,455
因为你是个心狠手辣 名声在外的弑警杀手
Because you're a straight up, certifiable, cop-killing murderer,

815
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:55,755
他们怕你
and they're scared of you.

816
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:02,593
那现在呢?
So, what now?

817
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:04,500
开车
Now we drive.

818
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:12,305
# 与魔鬼同行 #
# Ride with the Devil #

819
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:14,375
# 和上帝同藏 #
# Hide with the Lord #

820
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:16,280
# 我没有枪 #
# I got no pistol #

821
01:16:16,935 --> 01:16:18,280
# 也没有剑 #
# Ain't got no sword #

822
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,352
# 我没有武器 #
# I got no army #

823
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,352
# 也没有土地 #
# Ain't got no land #

824
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:27,854
# 我一无所有 除了手中的石块 #
# Ain't got nothing but the stone that's in my hand #

825
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,694
# 我手中的石块 #
# Stone in my hand #

826
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:32,694
# 我手中的石块 #
# Stone in my hand #

827
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:34,233
# 我心中的爱慕 #
# All the love that's in my heart #

828
01:16:34,387 --> 01:16:36,633
# 我手中的石块 #
# And the stone that's in my hand #

829
01:16:37,287 --> 01:16:39,233
路易安娜州 Stillwater监狱

830
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,691
在这儿等我
Wait for me here.

831
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:05,223
Piper 你在哪?
Piper?

832
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:06,720
Milton 这儿
Milton.

833
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:17,703
- 放开她  - 我不想放
- Get away from her.  - I think not.

834
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:21,229
我用这个给你一枪 你知道后果怎样
I shoot you with this, you know what it means.

835
01:18:21,562 --> 01:18:23,542
不论天堂还是地狱
No heaven, no hell.

836
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,477
你将不复存在了
You cease to exist.

837
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:27,911
该死 Milton 开枪
Damn it, Milton, shoot him.

838
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:31,643
你这是给我理由 把Piper小姐给逼死
All the more reason to keep Ms Piper in close proximity.

839
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:34,049
你倦了 Milton 你会再次迷失的
You are weary, Milton. You might miss again.

840
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:37,122
你以为你是谁?
Who the hell do you think you are?

841
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:38,953
死神吗?
Anubis?

842
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:40,458
你阻止不了我
You can't stop me.

843
01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:43,085
阻止你?
Stop you? 

844
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,756
Milton 要不是我 你都不会出现在这儿 你这个不知感恩的家伙
Milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful shit.

845
01:18:45,986 --> 01:18:48,728
之前的那个小小路障 就能阻止你了
That little roadblock back there, that would have stopped you.

846
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:51,326
所以 我要你把那个铁杀神枪放下
So, I want you to holster that iron God-killer,

847
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:53,098
然后说一声 "谢谢"
and say, "Thank you."

848
01:18:58,432 --> 01:19:05,077
我说了 放下武器 还有说"谢谢"
I said, holster and "thank you."

849
01:19:11,812 --> 01:19:13,086
不要伤害她
Don't hurt her.

850
01:19:14,748 --> 01:19:16,022
谢谢
Thank you.

851
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:18,825
现在 解开皮带
Now, unbuckle the belt.

852
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:24,996
请放到这里
Right here, please.

853
01:19:28,329 --> 01:19:29,637
啊 这样好多了
Ah, that's better.

854
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:32,976
你不是第一个逃出来的 但是我想你是最后一个了
You're not the first to get out, and I doubt you'll be the last,

855
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:35,775
但是我要知道
but I have got to know,

856
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:40,510
你是怎么偷走杀神枪的?
how did you get out with the God-killer?

857
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:43,010
我直接进去拿的 
I just walked in and took it.

858
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:44,984
哦
Oh.

859
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:47,949
他一定很不想查出是你偷的
Wouldn't want to be you when he finds out.

860
01:19:48,048 --> 01:19:52,053
他会怎么惩罚我? 不让我回去了吗?
What's he gonna do? Not let me back in?

861
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:55,963
- 你为什么帮我?  - 都是因为那帮混蛋
- Why are you helping me?  - It's 'cause of those crazy fucks.

862
01:19:56,056 --> 01:19:58,229
他们找到了把地狱带到人间的方法!
They figured out how to bring hell to earth!

863
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,932
Milton 这是真的 Jonah就快得逞了
Milton, it's real. Jonah's gonna do it.

864
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:16,515
- 真有趣 你还没跟她说?  - 说什么?
- That's cute. You haven't told her?  - Told her what?

865
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:20,320
亲爱的Piper小姐 向你透露点小秘密
Young Ms Piper, let you in on a little secret.

866
01:20:21,515 --> 01:20:24,325
黑魔头 撒旦 别西卜(都是圣经中堕落的魔王的别称)
The Dark Lord, Satan, Beelzebub,

867
01:20:24,485 --> 01:20:26,123
路西法(魔王本名)
Lucifer,

868
01:20:26,186 --> 01:20:29,656
简单来说 他掌管着一个巨大的监狱  事实上他是个安静的人
simply the warden of a very large prison. Quiet man, actually.

869
01:20:29,757 --> 01:20:31,031
深思而博学
Thoughtful and he's well-read.

870
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:39,505
我碰巧了解到
I happen to know,

871
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,208
杀害婴孩向他献祭的做法 令他十分愤慨
the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly.

872
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:51,117
- 你究竟为什么帮我?  - 我也有自己的任务
- Why are you really helping me?  - We all have a job to do.

873
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:54,590
把你弄来这儿 我的任务就更好做了 你救出你的人
Getting you here makes my job easier. You get what you want,

874
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:56,923
- 我完成我的任务  - 那现在赶紧帮我
- I get what I want.  - Then help me now.

875
01:20:57,017 --> 01:20:58,394
- 不  - 他们那边有40个人
- No.  - There are 40 of them down there,

876
01:20:58,452 --> 01:21:00,056
- 你和我一起能...  - 不
- and you and I could...  - No.

877
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:12,844
你想救她吗 Milton? 那你得自己去 自己做
You want to save her, Milton? Then you go, and you do it.

878
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:19,851
你成功 我也就成功了
If you win, I win.

879
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:22,614
如果他们解决了你 我也成功了
If they take you down, I win.

880
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:33,626
希望你喜欢这场好戏
And I hope you like butter on your popcorn.

881
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:35,257
肯定是场精彩绝伦的打斗
It's sure to be a grand show.

882
01:21:35,322 --> 01:21:39,327
你还不去? Milton 时间在渐渐地流逝 午夜快到了
You're still here? Milton, the clock's ticking. Midnight approaches,

883
01:21:39,426 --> 01:21:41,372
- 圆月也已升起了  - 把钥匙给我
- and the moon is full.  - Give me the keys.

884
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,270
我就在这儿等你
I'll be right here.

885
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:48,670
我的信徒们
My children,

886
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:50,839
我们苦心孤诣
we have come so far

887
01:21:51,038 --> 01:21:54,110
才到达这个地方 这个垂死的世界
to this place where the dying earth

888
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,552
将在我们脚下 瓦解它那腐坏的灵魂
bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet.

889
01:21:57,044 --> 01:22:00,082
这个世界灭亡 我们就能得到重生
From its death, we shall all be reborn.

890
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,660
重生!
Reborn!

891
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:04,694
我们...
We...

892
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:06,856
我们以前一直被驱逐 被追捕
We have been cast out and hunted.

893
01:22:08,122 --> 01:22:09,863
以后不会了!
But no more!

894
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:11,568
不会了
No more.

895
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:20,776
经过这次献祭
With this sacrifice,

896
01:22:21,135 --> 01:22:22,773
我们不必再躲躲藏藏了
we shall no longer be shunned.

897
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:24,912
他们说温顺之人能成大器
They say the meek will inherit.

898
01:22:25,406 --> 01:22:28,819
他们错了! 我们不是温顺之人! 我们是天命所归!
They lie! We are not meek! We are chosen!

899
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:33,089
很快 地狱的喽们都会听命于我们!
And soon, the hounds of perdition will howl at our command!

900
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:37,021
现在 只要我这把匕首刺下去
For now, with a single thrust of this dagger,

901
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:39,064
我们所有人都将重获自由!
we shall all be set free!

902
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,900
到底怎么回事?
What the fuck?

903
01:23:24,898 --> 01:23:26,468
是他!
That's him!

904
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:29,275
快 抓住他!
Come on, let's get him!

905
01:23:34,575 --> 01:23:37,681
来 拿好 不管如何 这小孩今晚都得死
Here, take it. No matter what, that child dies tonight.

906
01:23:37,744 --> 01:23:39,781
听到我命令 你就一刀刺进她的喉咙
I tell you to, and you cut his throat.

907
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,694
就是他
That's him.

908
01:23:48,355 --> 01:23:49,629
他们都是和Milton一伙的
They're both with Milton.

909
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,670
哦 是吗? 你们以为可以阻止这一切吗?
Oh, yeah? You think you can stop all this?

910
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:04,378
我们会杀了你的朋友 还有那个婴儿 然后我们就会获得永生
We're gonna kill your friend and the baby. And We're gonna live forever.

911
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:06,609
永生?
Forever?

912
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:10,113
如果对你来说 多活5秒就算永生 那你算是说对了
If forever to you is the next five seconds, then you would be right.

913
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:25,365
噢...
Well...

914
01:24:37,604 --> 01:24:39,709
你做好准备
You be ready now.

915
01:24:40,908 --> 01:24:43,684
如果我杀了你 你就带不走他了
If kill you, you can't take him.

916
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:47,051
还会有别人来 他总归要回去的
Someone else will come. Someone else always comes.

917
01:24:48,348 --> 01:24:51,886
Piper 他偷那把枪 不是不想跟我回去
Piper, he didn't steal that to stop me.

918
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:54,693
他只是想让我行动慢些 他已经得偿所愿了
He stole it to slow me down. He's getting what he wanted.

919
01:24:55,088 --> 01:24:56,761
去帮他吧
Go to him.

920
01:24:57,357 --> 01:24:59,359
去吧 否则就迟了
Now, before it's too late.

921
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:14,442
握紧点 这枪后挫力可不小
Hold on tight. It has quite the kick.

922
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:08,523
嘿 狗杂种
Hey, dickless.

923
01:27:59,606 --> 01:28:02,177
噢 这下都他妈毁了
Well, this has all gone to shit.

924
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:15,556
你要去哪儿? Milton?
Where are you going? Milton?

925
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,997
胜利还是属于我 老兄
The victory is still mine, friend.

926
01:28:25,799 --> 01:28:28,302
把那孩子抱过来
Bring that baby over here now.

927
01:28:31,838 --> 01:28:34,182
我要他亲眼目睹她被杀死
I want him to witness this.

928
01:28:41,415 --> 01:28:43,952
我说把那个该死的孩子抱过来!
I said bring the fucking baby to me!

929
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,103
我要用你女儿唯一留下的东西 把你折磨至死
I'm gonna beat you to death with all that's left of your daughter.

930
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:56,134
你女儿恨死你了
A daughter who hated you.

931
01:28:59,232 --> 01:29:03,510
你女儿 因 你 而 死!
The daughter who you let die!

932
01:29:13,814 --> 01:29:15,816
那好吧
All right, then.

933
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:28,933
我只想让你知道 我要你女儿的死 相对这个婴儿
I just want you to know that your daughter's death will pale

934
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:32,474
将面临的一切 简直太幸福了
to what is about to befall this child.

935
01:29:39,272 --> 01:29:40,876
我要杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

936
01:29:43,109 --> 01:29:47,558
啊 Milton 你已经试过无数次了
Ah, Milton, so many have tried.

937
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:55,322
但我拥有的力量 你永远都不会了解
But I am armored with a power that you will never know.

938
01:29:57,924 --> 01:29:59,870
这个世界上没有什么能杀死我
Nothing of this earth can kill me.

939
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:13,709
我不是这个世界的
I'm not of this earth.

940
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:56,089
Milton啊
Milton.

941
01:30:56,816 --> 01:30:58,352
Milton啊!
Milton!

942
01:30:59,452 --> 01:31:01,728
- 不 Milton  - 她在哪儿?
- No, Milton.  - Where is she?

943
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,315
我很好奇
I'm curious,

944
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:25,553
你当时会让他那么做吗?
would you have let him do it?

945
01:31:32,285 --> 01:31:34,026
正如我所想
That's what I thought.

946
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:38,761
待会儿见
See you soon.

947
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:45,871
她在这儿
She's here.

948
01:32:00,647 --> 01:32:02,718
我终于圆满了
I am finished now.

949
01:32:07,921 --> 01:32:09,798
好好保护她
Keep her safe.

950
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:13,299
谁要是想伤害她 我就杀了他们
Anyone tries to hurt her, I'll kill them.

951
01:32:13,393 --> 01:32:14,997
我知道
I know it.

952
01:32:15,962 --> 01:32:18,340
所以我才选了你
That's why I chose you.

953
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:28,415
Webster会在有生之年
Webster will look out for you both,

954
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:31,513
照顾好你俩
as long as he can.

955
01:32:31,578 --> 01:32:32,886
不 Milton
No, Milton.

956
01:32:39,919 --> 01:32:42,399
Milton 求你 不要走
Milton, please, don't go.

957
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:45,799
代我去爱她 Piper
Love her for me, Piper.

958
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:49,171
爱她 把她当亲生女儿对待
Love her, and make her yours.

959
01:32:51,531 --> 01:32:56,981
我知道我无权要你发誓
I know I don't have a right to ask for your promise.

960
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:01,750
我发誓 Milton 我发誓
I promise. Milton, I promise.

961
01:33:02,575 --> 01:33:04,179
谢谢你
Thank you.

962
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,490
不
No.

963
01:33:32,772 --> 01:33:34,149
嘿
Hey.

964
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:52,698
走吧
Come on.

965
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:14,887
嗨
Hi.

966
01:34:18,618 --> 01:34:21,030
- 刚才那出怎么样?  - 我见过更精彩的
- How was that?  - I've seen better.

967
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:23,933
我想 她还不了解 你能
Guess she doesn't know you can

968
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:27,228
打败他 遏制他 击中他 甚至阻止他
beat him, slow him, shoot him, even stop him.

969
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:29,807
但死人永远都杀不死
But you can't kill a dead man.

970
01:34:33,399 --> 01:34:35,003
可以走了吗?
Shall we?

971
01:34:39,672 --> 01:34:43,950
即使地狱也有怜悯之心
Even in hell there is compassion.

972
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:00,661
我只想你知道 我没准备好好待着 
Just so you know, I don't plan on staying.

973
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,240
Milton 你已经得偿所愿了
Milton, you got what you wanted.

974
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:08,075
当然 但如果他还把我关回那个洞里 我还是会逃出来
I did, but if he puts me back in that hole, I'll still get out.

975
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:09,975
很好
Remarkable.

976
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,378
实际上 我盼望着那一天的到来
I actually look forward to that.

977
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:18,211
你以为你是沃坦(北欧神话主神)啊?
You think you're Wotan?

978
01:35:22,382 --> 01:35:24,089
把车钥匙给我
Give me the keys.

979
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:37,444
# 我还活着 #
# I'm still alive #

980
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:39,644
# 必有奇迹 #
# Must have been a miracle #

981
01:35:41,801 --> 01:35:43,977
# 这段地狱之旅 #
# It's been a hell of ride #

982
01:35:44,101 --> 01:35:45,977
# 前路充满未知 #
# Destination still unknown # 

983
01:35:46,072 --> 01:35:47,483
# 生活真实面目 #
# It's a fact of life #

984
01:35:47,574 --> 01:35:50,953
# 性命攸关 不能踏错一步 #
# If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head #

985
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:54,321
# 不能回头 否则只剩死路 #
# You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead #

986
01:35:56,082 --> 01:35:59,063
# 破旧轨道 执意脱轨前行 #
# I'm a runaway train on broken track #

987
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:03,794
# 倒数计时 永远附着炸弹 #
# I'm a ticker on a bomb that you can't turn back this time #

988
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:05,593
# 这是真的 #
# That's right #

989
01:36:05,692 --> 01:36:09,037
# 逃过浩劫 我还顽强生存 #
# I got away with it all and I'm still alive #

990
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:12,201
# 世界崩塌 就让末日来临 #
# Let the end of the world come tumbling down #

991
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:16,736
# 我仍会是 最后坚定的人 #
# I'll be the last man standing on the ground #

992
01:36:17,136 --> 01:36:19,810
# 只要还有 我的热血涌动 #
# As long as I got blood rush through my veins #

993
01:36:19,873 --> 01:36:23,343
# 我就顽强生存 #
# I'm still alive #
