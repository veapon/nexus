3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,645
会不会 很久以前 天空中曾经谧无繁星?
What if, once upon a time, there were no stars in the sky at all?

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,046
有没有可能 星星根本不是我们所想象的那样?
What if the stars are not what we think?

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,442
如果 满天繁星遥遥发出的光芒并不是来自于远空的恒星本身...
What if the light from afar doesn't come from the rays of distant suns...

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,849
而是来自于我们死后进入天堂时展开的羽翼?
but from our wings as we turn into angels?

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,900
2014年 纽约 

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,048
命运召唤着芸芸众生
Destiny calls to each of us.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,169
而在这个世界背后 还有另外一个世界 将我们紧紧相连
And there is a world behind the world where we are all connected.

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,762
成为伟大而更迭的计划中不可或缺的一环
All part of a great and moving plan.

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,727
奇迹无处不在
Magic is everywhere around us.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,763
你只需要一双善于发现的眼睛
You just have to look.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,166
去观察
Look.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,129
仔细地观察
Look closely.

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,491
因为即使是时间和距离 也很可能暗藏玄机
For even time and distance are not what they appear to be.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,001
1895年 纽约 

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,601
下一位
Next.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,885
先生 到你了
Sir, you're next.

19
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,607
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,086
你们必须原路返回
You'll have to go back.

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,486
什么?
What?

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,850
不 为什么? 我们...
No. No. Why? We...

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,690
你有肺病
It's pulmonary.

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,322
那... 孩子呢? 能让他过去吗?
Ah... What about the baby? Is there place for him?

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,887
如果我们只能原路返回的话 我们想留下他
If we have to go back, we leave him.

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,087
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,408
不是 你根本没听懂我的意思
No. You do not understand.

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,002
我们彼此相连
We are all connected.

29
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,770
每一个孩子在出生时就蕴含了造物的奇迹
Each baby born carries a miracle inside.

30
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,081
一个独特的目的
A unique purpose.

31
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,682
而这个奇迹对于每个人都是独一无二的
And that miracle is promised to one person and one person alone.

32
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,570
我们都是航海家 朝着命运的方向扬帆起航...
We are voyagers, set on a course towards destiny...

33
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,162
去找到命中注定的那个人
to find the one person our miracle is meant for.

34
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,168
但是请当心 当我们试图寻找光明...
But be warned, as we seek out the light...

35
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,521
黑暗也正凝聚如墨
darkness gathers.

36
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,800
而上帝与魔鬼之间永无止境地较量并非取决于兵力强弱...
And the eternal contest between God and Evil is not fought with great armies...

37
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,008
而是取决于每一份人生的选择
but one life at a time.

38
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,208
冬日奇缘

39
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,171
1916年 纽约 

40
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,171
站住!
Stop right there!

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,729
彼得 滚回来!
Get back here, Pete!

42
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,128
- 快点回来!  - 呃!
- Get back here!  - Unh!

43
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,885
彼得 我也只是奉命行事而已啊!
Pete, them was just orders!

44
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,961
不用 别这样
No. Not like that.

45
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,085
咱们已经抓到他了
We have him now.

46
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,884
让我们慢慢来...
Let's do it slowly...

47
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,725
用刀子来结果他
with the knives.

48
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,369
抓住他!
Get him!

49
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,125
马儿 乖马儿
Horse. Horse.

50
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,966
马兄
Horse.

51
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,445
跑啊 快跑!
Go, go, go!

52
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,761
哥们儿快跑啊!
Go on. boy!

53
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,082
哇哦!
Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Whoa.

54
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,442
马兄! 拜托了! 不是这条路!
Horse! Come on! Other way!

55
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,006
错了!
Other way!

56
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,441
马兄!
Horse!

57
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,687
你是何方神圣?
What are you?

58
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,002
他弄到了那匹奇葩的马
He's got the goddamn horse.

59
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,250
下午好
Good afternoon.

60
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,090
管家说我应该穿着大衣
The butler told me I should leave my coat on.

61
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,725
唔
Mm.

62
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,322
我们屋里有人正在发烧
We have fever in the house.

63
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,330
潘先生 要配眼镜的是您妻子吗?
Is it your wife that needs spectacles, Mr. Penn?

64
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,641
她死了
Dead.

65
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,211
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

66
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,044
都过去八年了
It's eight years ago.

67
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,441
有些人是你始终无法忘怀的
Still, you never stop missing them.

68
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,525
这眼镜是给我女儿配的
It's for my daughter.

69
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,170
她等会儿就下来
She'll be finished soon.

70
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,244
挺好听的 对吧? 勃拉姆斯的曲子
It is nice, isn't it? Brahms.

71
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
贝芙丽...
Beverly...

72
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,925
这位先生是来给你配眼镜的
this man has come to make you some new glasses.

73
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,086
别怕 不传染
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

74
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,925
不 不是
No, no.

75
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,571
我妹妹...
My sister...

76
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,045
她也得过这个
she had it.

77
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,370
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

78
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,767
这样比较好...
Better this way...

79
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,726
还是这样?
or this way?

80
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,690
她多大年纪?
How old was she?

81
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,371
你妹妹?
Your sister?

82
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,966
二十...
Twenty...

83
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,685
在她去世的时候
when she died.

84
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,083
你一定从未有过命不久矣的感觉
You never think you're as old as you're ever going to get.

85
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,846
没有
No.

86
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,044
我没有过这种感觉
I suppose not.

87
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,805
这样...
This way...

88
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,801
还是这样?
or this?

89
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,406
前一种
First.

90
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,731
发烧 可以让世界看起来美好得多
The fever, it can make things wonderful.

91
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,045
即使现在...
Even now...

92
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,448
我都能感觉到冬天就在我身边 他使屋里的光线变幻万千...
I can see winter as it turns around the room on the light...

93
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,567
如白色长矛般投射进来的光...
darting from white lances...

94
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,644
分散成一道道细细的光线...
to rays...

95
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,485
洒在银色的十字架上...
to silver crosses...

96
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,446
洒在镜片上...
to the optical glass...

97
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,048
洒在壁橱的火焰中 洒在光可鉴人的玻璃上
to the flames, to the reflective windows.

98
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,729
然后照亮我们每一个人
And illuminating each of us.

99
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,049
我病得越严重...
The sicker I become...

100
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,006
我就越能清醒地意识到这世间万事万物是由光紧密地联系
the more clearly I can see that everything is connected by light.

101
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,089
你有看这个的眼镜吗?
Do you have glasses for that?

102
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,606
嘿 塞西尔
Hey, Cecil.

103
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,485
额滴神啊
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

104
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,165
他不一般 是吧?
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

105
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,930
而且 哥们儿 他会跳
And, boy, can he jump.

106
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,484
给我弄个马鞍 再来点儿燕麦...
I want a saddle, oats...

107
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,200
还有 给它弄张好点儿的毯子 开司米羊绒的
and I want a nice blanket for him. Cashmere.

108
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,042
这是你最值钱的赃物啊 彼得
He's the best duff you ever stole, Pete.

109
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,969
得了吧 他可不是赃物 塞西尔
Oh, he ain't duff, Cecil.

110
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,210
他是我的新朋友
He's me new partner.

111
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,846
对吧 马兄?
Aren't you, horse?

112
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,246
- 你在阁楼里躲不了多久的  - 为啥?
- You can't keep hiding out up in the attic.  - Why?

113
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,126
听说帕里把赏金提高三倍 让他的人到处找你
Word went out, Pearly's tripled the reward. He's got his guys looking everywhere.

114
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,005
混蛋 他今儿早上就找到我了
Ugly son of a bitch. He found me this morning.

115
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,611
还好马兄救了我一命
Horse saved my life.

116
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,802
我觉得我得出去躲躲 等夏天再回来 和我的马兄一起
I think I'll get out of town till summer, you know? Me and horse.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,641
先偷到足够的东西够我俩过日子 然后等风头过去了再说 明白?
Steal enough to get us by. Just let this whole thing blow over, you know?

118
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,089
我觉得帕里不是那种会息事宁人的人
I don't see Pearly much as the blowing-over kind.

119
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,007
是啊
Yeah.

120
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,648
- 那是因为你担心的太多了 塞西尔  - 唔
- That's because you worry too much, Cecil.  - Heh.

121
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,844
帮我看一晚上马 成么?
Just board him for me, will you?

122
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,726
谢啦
Thanks.

123
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,487
彼得!
Pete!

124
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,531
你忘了拿...
You forgot your...

125
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,251
零钱
change.

126
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,002
我还在想你什么时候才会过来
I was wondering when you'd get here.

127
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,529
请注意
May I have your attention please.

128
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,963
第43列火车...
Train number 43...

129
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,010
正在4号站台检票上车
is now boarding on Track Number 4.

130
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,686
进来!
Enter!

131
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,491
为了主日的弥撒 圣派翠克大教堂准备举办篝火晚会
The fire at St. Paddy's is set for Sunday Mass.

132
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,170
那与我无关
That's not what matters to me.

133
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,045
但是他们承诺给我们每人500块买他的人头
But they reward everyone 500 for his head.

134
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,324
- 马呢?  - 一个价 对于一匹马而言这个价钱可不便宜
- And the horse?  - The same. Seems like a lot for a horse.

135
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,849
因为那不是一匹马
Well, that's because it's not a horse.

136
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,931
- 那是只狗  - 你刚说它是...
- It's a dog.  - You just said it was a...

137
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,561
至少就我们目前掌握的情况来看 他还没出城
As far as we can tell, he hasn't left the city.

138
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,560
那帮小子在密切监视着各处桥梁 纽约没那么大 他跑不了
Woola boys are watching all the bridges. New York's not that big. We'll find him.

139
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,603
- 你最好抓得住他  - 我保证 老板
- You better.  - I know, boss.

140
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,406
城里的气氛紧张压抑
People are scared and unhappy all over the city.

141
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,649
奇迹只完成了一半 如果算上布鲁克林 那就是一半多一点
Miracles are down by half. More if you count Brooklyn.

142
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,489
能说说彼得有什么特别之处吗?
If you don't mind me ask what's so special about Pete?

143
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,684
你以前还挺喜欢他的 我还从没见过一个比他更专业的扒手了
You used to like him. Never met me a better thief.

144
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,566
- 为什么突然之间 我们就要杀了他?  - 罗密欧啊罗密欧
- Why all of a sudden, we gotta kill him?  - Romeo, Romeo.

145
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,845
你有没有花一些时间...
Do you spend time...

146
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,769
去思考这个世界?
wondering about the world?

147
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,010
事物之间如何运作
The workings of things.

148
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,200
- 没有 先生  - 嗯 好...
- No, sir.  - Right. Well...

149
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,485
那最好也别现在开始思考
better not to start now.

150
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,288
你觉得 我偷金银和宝石是为了变得富有?
Do you think I, uh, steal gold and gems for wealth?

151
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,001
不
No.

152
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,328
让这些金银和宝石变得珍贵的原因...
What makes these most precious...

153
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,569
是因为他们接受光的方式不同
it's the way they accept the light.

154
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,244
彼得・雷克是个聪明人
Pete Lake is human.

155
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,925
但是那匹马...
But that horse...

156
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,888
那匹马可能会拖他的后腿
That horse might leave a trail.

157
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,690
游戏开始!
And Yahtzee!

158
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,089
中央车站 让我们去做了他
Grand Central Station. Let's go and kill him.

159
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,966
顺便试试看能不能抓住那匹马
And while we're at it, let's try and grab that horse.

160
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,685
你刚说那是只狗
You just said it was a dog.

161
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,165
去把你那帮手下叫上
Go and get the boys.

162
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,841
嗨
Hi.

163
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,487
嘿...
Hey...

164
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,842
家里的人都在收拾东西 准备明天去湖边度假
Everybody's all packed to go up to the lake tomorrow.

165
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,687
亲爱的 我后天就过去
I'll come up the next day, sweetheart.

166
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,087
我得等爸爸准备好我的帐篷
Daddy just has to get my tent ready.

167
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,606
那样你就能保持凉爽?
So you can stay cold?

168
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,609
对 那样我就能保持凉爽
So I can stay cold.

169
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,326
贝芙 你不能死
You can't die, Bev.

170
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,965
亲爱的...
Sweet girl...

171
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,089
这并不由我决定啊
it's not up to me.

172
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,404
再跟我讲一次吧
Tell me again.

173
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,242
有一场很棒的舞会...
There's this great dance...

174
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,291
我们都有自己的角色
and we all have our part.

175
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,488
而当我们的任务已尽...
And when we're done here...

176
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,729
可能是一生结束 也可能是分秒以后...
if it's after one life, or a thousand...

177
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,646
我们升入天空 成为空中的繁星
we rise up into the sky and we become stars.

178
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,928
再告诉我一遍他们的名字吧
Tell me their names again.

179
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,811
北河二星...
Castor...

180
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,451
北河三星...
Pollux...

181
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,731
五车二星...
Capella...

182
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,891
亲爱的 这事儿就得月黑风高的时候干
It's a great night's work, my friend.

183
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,443
我们往南走 直接去佛罗里达
We head south to Florida.

184
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,170
或者马里兰 也不是不可以
Or Maryland, maybe.

185
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,886
那儿听起来更像是你喜欢的地方
That sounds like the kind of place you might like.

186
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,242
成了 走吧
All right, let's go.

187
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,885
马兄
Horse.

188
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,610
嘿哥们儿
Horse.

189
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,041
给点力啊
Come on.

190
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,964
马兄 这天马上就亮了 咱们得快点出城
Horse, it's gonna be light soon. We need to get out of town.

191
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,208
帕里有一帮人在找咱们
Pearly's got a hundred eyes looking after us.

192
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,806
快点儿
Come on.

193
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,406
快点儿啊
Come on.

194
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,211
嘿...
Her...

195
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,564
你现在越来越贪心了
You're just getting greedy now.

196
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,521
好吧
Fine.

197
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,131
但是 下不为例啊
But this is our last score.

198
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,890
真不知道咱俩谁更蠢:
Don't know who's a bigger fool:

199
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,841
是你这个不听主人话的马 还是我这个听马话的主人
A horse who won't listen to his master, or a master who listens to his horse.

200
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,810
上帝啊 让我的温度降下来吧
God, make me cold.

201
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,925
嗨 美人儿
Hello, you beauty.

202
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,651
詹姆士...
James...

203
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,808
小詹姆士 巴塞洛缪...
James the Lesser, Bartholomew...

204
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,291
在响
Squeaks.

205
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,487
什么?
What?

206
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,651
地板吱呀响
It squeaks.

207
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,446
年久失修
Age.

208
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,486
你有枪
You have a gun.

209
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,526
对
Right.

210
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,161
你在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

211
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,601
我是来打劫的
I was just robbing the place, you know.

212
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,561
或者说我本来是来打劫的
Or that was the idea, anyway.

213
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,289
你现在还想打劫吗?
Is that still your intention?

214
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,164
唔...
Uh...

215
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,246
不
No.

216
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,366
不 不想了
No, it isn't.

217
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,846
好吧 那么...
Well, then...

218
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,368
我觉得好像先给你倒杯茶比较礼貌
I suppose the polite thing to do would be to offer you a cup of tea.

219
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,727
哇哦
Wow.

220
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,527
你确实听懂了我说...
You did understand the part about me...

221
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,322
我来这儿是为了偷东西的 对吧?
coming here to steal from you, yeah?

222
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,883
严格意义上来讲 偷的是我爸爸的东西
It's my father, technically.

223
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,605
我闯进来的
I broke in.

224
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,847
哪儿?
Where?

225
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,607
他花了很大力气去防止别人进来
He takes epic measures to bar entry.

226
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,361
唔 事实上 你忘了关屋顶那个小房间的门 所以我就...
Well, actually, you left the door to the roof wedged open. So I just...

227
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,767
- 我没关?  - 对啊
- Did I?  - Yeah.

228
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,563
我下次可不能这样了
I must stop doing that.

229
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,807
对啊
Yeah.

230
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,082
我的意思是 你一定吓坏了
I mean, you should be scared.

231
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,047
唔 并没有
Well, I'm not.

232
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,004
不 我能看见的
No, I can see that.

233
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,801
这茶真不错
The tea is lovely.

234
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,249
这是武夷山正山小种茶
It's called Lapsang Souchong.

235
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,489
是从中国进口来的红茶
It's black and from China.

236
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,485
对我来讲 这茶有点太热了...
It's too hot for me to drink...

237
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,571
但是这味道总能让我回忆起伦敦
but the smell always reminds me of London.

238
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,569
我没去过伦敦
I've never been to London.

239
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,206
我不这么认为 不
I didn't think so. No. Heh.

240
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,410
我在那儿出生
I was born there.

241
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,046
如果你不介意的话 我能问下你到底怎么了吗?
What's wrong with you, if you don't mind me asking?

242
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,811
肺痨
Consumption.

243
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,963
我今年都21了 但是从来没有跟别人接吻过
I'm 21 and I've never been kissed on the mouth.

244
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,002
对不起 跑题了
Sorry, that came out wrong.

245
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,408
我不认识别人 你也看到了
I don't know anyone, you see.

246
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,440
我不能出去 也不能去跳舞
I can't go out. I can't dance.

247
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,366
我住在屋顶的帐篷里 让我的身体不至于太烫
I sleep in a tent on the roof to keep my body temperature within reason.

248
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,241
我可能还有...
I have maybe...

249
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,806
按照那个来自巴尔的摩的医生的说法 我大概还能活一年半
according to one doctor who came up from Baltimore, a year and a half.

250
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,567
在波士顿的时候 他们说我只剩六个月好活
In Boston, they said six months.

251
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,129
但是那是八个月以前了...
But that was eight months ago...

252
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,450
所以事实上 我应该已经死了两个月才对
so really, I'm already two months dead.

253
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,725
我是彼得・雷克
I'm Peter Lake.

254
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,003
你从哪里来呢 彼得・雷克?
And where are you from, Peter Lake?

255
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,521
一艘船上
A boat.

256
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,525
- 一艘船?  - 对啊
- A boat?  - Yeah.

257
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,889
我从来不知道我父母是谁 我躺在一艘船里 被吹到了布鲁克林的海岸上
I never knew my parents. Boat washed up ashore in Brooklyn.

258
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,965
至少别人是这么告诉我的
So I was told.

259
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,406
你以偷窃为生
And you steal things.

260
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,602
我确实偷东西 时不时偷一次
I do steal things. Yeah, from time to time.

261
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,249
我本来没打算干这行的
It wasn't always that way, though.

262
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,206
我原来一直想做一名机械师 你知道的 我总是随身带工具...
I always wanted to be a mechanic. You know, I always had a knack...

263
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,201
来做一些维修的工作 或者把东西拆开看看内部构造
for fixing things, getting to the insides of things.

264
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,210
比如保险箱
Like safes.

265
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,244
唔 反正最后就成这样了
Well, that's how it ended up, anyways.

266
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,568
后来 我和原来的老板起了点争执
Lately, I've been having a bit of a disagreement with an old boss.

267
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,962
我感觉你们这种行业的争执都很难解决
I should imagine disputes in your line of work are hard to settle.

268
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,730
是啊 确实不容易
Challenging, yeah.

269
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,125
你偷过最好的东西是什么?
What's the best thing you've ever stolen?

270
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,767
我开始怀疑我还没把最好的东西偷到手
I'm beginning to think I haven't stolen it yet.

271
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,168
没人比你更迷人了
Aren't you the charmer.

272
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,885
真好
It's been lovely.

273
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,449
遇到你真好 彼得・雷克
Lovely to meet you, Peter Lake.

274
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,689
听着 我必须马上离开纽约
Listen, I have to leave New York.

275
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,490
最多几个月
A few months at most.

276
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,088
避避风头
Let that disagreement blow over.

277
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,841
但是可能当我回来的时候 或许...
But maybe when I get back, I was wondering if...

278
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,042
我要独自去乡下了
I'm going to the country myself.

279
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,561
而等你回来的时候...
And by the time you get back...

280
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,289
我应该已经死了
I'll already be dead.

281
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,205
你走的时候 别偷我家的东西
Please don't steal anything on your way out.

282
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,930
马兄
Horse.

283
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,323
你把我弄进去是为了偷什么呢 马兄?
What have you gotten me into, horse?

284
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,049
桌子! 就那张
Table! That one.

285
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,410
索姆斯先生 先生 你想要多少?
Mr. Soames, sir. How many are you going to have?

286
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,284
一直上
Just keep them coming.

287
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,528
我会告诉你他们有什么企图
I'll tell you what they're trying to do.

288
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,242
他们想要天空充满星星
What they're trying to do is to fill the whole sky with stars.

289
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,361
每个善良的灵魂都上天变成一个小的点
They got little spots all picked out up there for each and every virtuous soul.

290
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,207
天上没有像我们这样的人的位子了 兄弟们 哈
Ain't no room in the heavens for the likes of us, though, boys. Heh.

291
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,808
没有帕里・索姆斯的位子 完全没有
No room for Pearly Soames. No room at all.

292
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,525
我很好奇他们是怎么选的翅膀的颜色
I wonder how they choose the color of their wings.

293
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,362
我一直想要对翅膀
I've always wanted wings.

294
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,729
我想要一对我自己的翅膀 你知道吗?
I'd like a pair of wings myself, you know?

295
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,001
请问您还需要什么吗 先生?
Anything more, sir?

296
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,487
是的
Oh, yes, please.

297
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,971
我想要南非的斑雕^...
I would like to have a South African spotted eagle owl...

298
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,242
如果可以 请你把它平摊开...
uh, if you could butterfly it, thank you...

299
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,091
然后油煎 最好再放些土豆
and pan-fry it, uh, with some potatoes would be lovely.

300
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,887
上面放一点欧芹 请去掉鸟嘴和鸟爪
A little bit of parsley on top. Take off the beak and the feet, please.

301
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,048
对不起先生 我们没有斑雕^
I'm sorry, sir. Don't got no owl.

302
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,085
找到她
Find her.

303
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,850
找到她 就能找到他
You find her, and you're gonna find him.

304
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,481
- 找谁?  - 那个女孩
- Find who?  - The girl.

305
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,961
- 什么女孩?  - 那个红头发女孩
- What girl?  - The red-haired girl.

306
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,241
哪个红头发女孩?
Which red-haired girl?

307
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,521
那个 你看到了吗 罗密欧? 那个红头发女孩
That one. You see, Romeo? That red-haired girl.

308
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,008
那就是他命中注定的那个人
The one who is his destiny.

309
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,044
就这些吗 小姐?
That all of it, miss?

310
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,885
就这些? 哈
All of it? Heh.

311
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,651
不 还早着呢
No, not even close.

312
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,487
怎么了?
What?

313
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,844
我只是想到我把你从那条小破船抱出来的那天
I just remembered the day we pulled you out of the drink in that silly little boat.

314
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,525
我需要一些好建议 我遇见了一个女孩
I need some friendly advice. I met a girl.

315
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,609
- 明白了  - 我们没有任何相似的地方
- Oh, I see.  - We've nothing in common.

316
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,006
嗯
Hmm.

317
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,969
- 她要死了  - 我们不都是吗?
- She's dying.  - Well, aren't we all?

318
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,568
不那么简单 她有肺病
Well, not just dying. She's consumptive.

319
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,331
- 啊  - 就快死了
- Ah.  - Near death.

320
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,445
我们才刚认识
We've only just met.

321
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,488
- 我觉得我已经认识她一千年了  - 嗯
- I feel like I've known her a thousand years.  - Hmm.

322
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,005
帕里在抓我 如果我不离开镇上 我就是在自杀
Pearly's on top of me. If I don't get out of town, I'm as good as killing myself.

323
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,965
彼得 有什么问题吗?
Peter, is there a question here?

324
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,765
我该怎么做?
What should I do?

325
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,650
当我想到她...
When I think of her...

326
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,810
我以前从来没有这样的感觉
I've never felt this way before.

327
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,206
为什么现在会这样?
Why now?

328
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,447
彼得 我们相信每个人都有10首歌
Peter, our people have 10 songs.

329
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,202
这些歌告诉我们每个人的内心都有一个奇迹
The songs tell us that inside of each of us is a miracle.

330
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,683
这个奇迹只为了等待一个人 只有那一个人
And that miracle is meant for one person, and one person alone.

331
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,363
当我们快要找到这个人的时候 整个宇宙都会伸出援助之手...
And when we're close, the universe reaches down...

332
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,370
帮助我们实现我们的命运
and helps us fulfill our destiny.

333
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,211
整个宇宙都会帮助我们? 到底怎么帮?
And the universe helps us? How, exactly?

334
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,971
宇宙在精神上指引我们
Well, the universe sends us spirit guides.

335
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,209
有时通过小孩子跟我们说话
Sometimes they speak to us through small children.

336
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,847
他们经常以动物的形式出现
They often appear as animals.

337
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,884
山瑟就是其中之一 他是东方之狗
One is Athansor. He's the Dog of the East.

338
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,171
他有时也变作一匹白马
He sometimes appears as a white horse.

339
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,245
也许这个女孩就是你命中注定的那个人
Perhaps this girl is the person that your miracle is for.

340
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,889
但是如果真是如此 你要知道:
But if so, know this:

341
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,010
- 福祸两相依  - 你在说什么?
- Chaos has agents too.  - What are you talking about?

342
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,770
上帝和恶魔?
God and the devil?

343
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,726
天使和魔鬼?
Angels and demons?

344
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,248
这是一些新的名字 是的
Those are some of the newer names, yes.

345
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,805
我只知道...
All I know...

346
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,130
我需要她...
is that I'm pulled to her...

347
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,848
就像我在水下需要空气一样
like air when I'm under the water.

348
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,409
那么 你在这里和我说话是为了什么?
So, what are you standing here talking to me for?

349
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,164
司机?
Driver?

350
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,011
我恐怕他不愿意干了
I'm afraid he's become indisposed.

351
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,131
我猜他突然发了一笔小财
Suddenly come into a small fortune by his standards, I imagine.

352
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,369
我是帕里・索姆斯
Pearly Soames.

353
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,480
你是?
And you might be?

354
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,000
我是贝芙丽・潘
Beverly Penn.

355
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,884
贝芙丽・潘
Beverly Penn.

356
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,009
看来...
Well...

357
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,449
彼得总是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉啊?
Peter does like to reach above his station, doesn't he?

358
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,043
而且你发烧了 是吗 亲? 
And you've got a touch of the fever, haven't you, button?

359
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,888
时日不多了
Already only half here.

360
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,691
很有趣
Interesting.

361
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,484
你知道彼得?
You know Peter?

362
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,487
彼得・雷克吗?
Peter Lake?

363
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,170
知道他? 哦 是的
Know him? Oh, yes.

364
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,368
可以说 我们非常密切
We're associates, you might say.

365
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,847
好吧...
Well...

366
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,209
总之曾经是
past tense, anyway.

367
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,922
这个孩子很有潜力
The boy had such potential.

368
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,170
他很能偷
Could he steal.

369
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,962
偷得像艺术 像物理现象
Like art, like physics.

370
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,082
他把他当做自己的孩子养大
I raised him as my own.

371
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,682
我让他继承我的王国
I had him pegged to inherit the keys to the kingdom.

372
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,488
但是小彼得...
But little Peter...

373
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,047
他有自己的想法了
he started to having ideas.

374
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,364
比如不杀人就想偷得一枚钻石胸针
There's how to steal a diamond brooch without spilling blood.

375
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,564
不断掉指头就想偷得一枚戒指
Here's how to take a ring and leave the finger.

376
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,845
但是你知道 贝芙丽・潘...
But, you see, Beverly Penn...

377
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,805
在我的规则里...
in my line...

378
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,245
这些小波折才是工作的意义
it's the ripples that give the work meaning.

379
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,245
思想...
Ideas...

380
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,201
虽然利大于弊
they can do more good than harm.

381
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,202
但这些都是违背计划的
And that would be the opposite of the plan, you see.

382
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,441
非常严重的伤害
It's doing harm that is the very point.

383
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,688
我可能明天才去北部
I might not go upstate until tomorrow.

384
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,688
- 嗯  - 不用麻烦了
- Hmm.  - No bother at all.

385
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,167
- 我愿意付你钱  - 美女
- I'd be very happy to pay you.  - Beautiful.

386
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,921
生病
Sick.

387
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,449
- 年纪轻轻就要死了  - 我不怕你
- Too young to die.  - I'm not afraid of you.

388
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,642
我敢打赌你绝对是他命中注定的那个人
I'll bet that you're who his miracle is for.

389
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,161
如果遇到绑架我爸爸有非常严格的政策
My father has a strict policy when it comes to kidnappers.

390
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,681
他会救你 如果他救不了你...
He has to save you. If you can't be saved by him...

391
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,726
就没有然后了
job's done.

392
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,930
任务完成
Mission accomplished.

393
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,405
我喜欢看到血溅到雪地里 贝芙丽・潘
I love blood on the snow, Beverly Penn.

394
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,322
尤其是处女的血
Especially virginal blood.

395
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,245
纯洁
Unspoiled.

396
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,927
而又无暇
Unmolested.

397
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,926
贝芙丽!
Beverly!

398
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,447
不要!
No!

399
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,128
- 抓紧  - 彼得・雷克
- Hold on.  - Peter Lake.

400
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,962
- 快点!  - 是的 当然
- Go fast!  - Yes, clearly.

401
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,644
我们总会被追上的
We can't outrun them forever.

402
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,002
我知道! 我们得出城
I know! We have to get above the city.

403
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,208
沿着河往北走
Go north along the river.

404
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,608
- 彼得! 那里太深了!  - 抓紧!
- Peter! That's way too far down!  - Hold on!

405
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,171
- 抓紧?  - 抓紧!
- Hold on?  - Hold on!

406
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,765
彼得 彼得 等一下!
Peter. Peter, wait!

407
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,803
这怎么可能?
How is that even possible?

408
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,401
我不知道 这匹马
I don't know. This horse.

409
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,045
我们不能继续追他们了
We can't follow them up there.

410
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,648
- 为什么不能?  - 这是规矩
- Why not?  - The rules.

411
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,287
几百年前一个小争论的结果 真没有远见
A little dispute a couple hundred years ago. Shortsighted.

412
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,564
我们差一点就抓到他了
Well, we almost had him.

413
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,361
差一点可不够好 罗密欧
Almost is not good enough, Romeo.

414
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,088
你想做这个工作吗 小丁?
Do you want the job or not, Dingy?

415
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,044
我要见法官
I need to see the Judge.

416
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,567
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

417
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,570
以你的情况...
All the excitement...

418
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,731
这些惊吓
and your condition.

419
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,685
我很好
I'm perfect.

420
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,081
那就好
Good.

421
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,285
往上游走
Head upriver.

422
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,966
贝芙丽!
Beverly!

423
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,921
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,122
- 可以吗?  - 可以
- Okay?  - Yeah.

425
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,244
你好 小不点
Hello, little one.

426
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,651
哈
Mm.

427
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,611
我只对城市比较了解
I've only known the city.

428
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,122
这里叫樱湖
It's called the Lake of the Coheeries.

429
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,601
从小我就经常到这里来
I've been coming here since I was a little girl.

430
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,327
我爸爸说一切不该发生的事情这里都不会有
My father says nothing happens here that isn't supposed to.

431
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,807
你好
Hello.

432
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,162
你好 我是维拉
Hi. I'm Willa.

433
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,448
维拉 你好吗 维拉?
Willa. How are you, Willa?

434
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,883
你是贝芙丽的男朋友吗?
Are you Beverly's boyfriend?

435
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,843
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

436
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,130
我肯定爸爸有些话要说
I'm sure father will have something to say about the matter.

437
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,847
你吃饭时喝酒吗?
Do you take wine with your meals?

438
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,966
有的时候
Sometimes.

439
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,207
很好
That's good.

440
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,484
我们今天晚上会喝酒
We'll have wine tonight.

441
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,727
好的
Okay.

442
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,686
- 红葡萄酒可以吗?  - 都行
- Would claret be all right with you?  - Anything.

443
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,761
但是红酒不是应该念...
But, uh, don't you pronounce it...

444
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,487
"克拉雷"吗?
"claret"?

445
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,206
不是 是克拉雷特
No. Claret.

446
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,207
发出t音 就像发菲利特这个音一样
You pronounce the T. Just as in fillet.

447
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,646
菲利特吗?
Fillet?

448
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,524
我一直以为是念"菲利"
I always thought it was "fillet."

449
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,369
不 是念菲利特
No, it's fillet.

450
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,366
就像沃利特 你不读"沃利"吧? 你会念成沃利特
Just as in wallet. You don't say "wallet," do you? You say wallet.

451
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,246
我明白了
I see.

452
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,208
- 你知道吗?  - 什么?
- You know what?  - Sir?

453
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,202
你看上去像一个混蛋
You look like a crook.

454
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,008
你是谁? 你是做什么的?
Who are you? What do you do?

455
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,727
你和贝芙丽是什么关系? 你知道她的特殊情况吗?
What is your relationship to Beverly? Are you aware of her special condition?

456
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,366
你的动机是什么 想要干什么 想要什么?
What are your motivations, intentions and desires?

457
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,688
说出事实吧 别想隐瞒
Tell the absolute truth. Don't elaborate.

458
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,726
如果有邻居 孩子或者仆人进来就停下 长话短说
Stop if a neighbor, child or servant comes in. And be brief.

459
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,048
长话短说? 这是个复杂的问题
Be brief? These are complicated questions.

460
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,050
如果你是我的记者 你现在就可以回去了
If you were one of my journalists, you'd be finished by now.

461
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,846
上帝只用了六天创造世界 学学他
God created the world in six days. Ape him.

462
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,441
- 好吧 我试试  - 没有必要
- Heh. I'll try.  - It's unnecessary.

463
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,971
- 好吧  - 没有必要
- All right.  - Unnecessary.

464
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,201
我叫彼得・雷克
My name is Peter Lake.

465
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,370
你说的没错 我是个贼 而且专业技能一流
You're right, I'm a thief, and I'm a damn good one.

466
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,647
我爱贝芙丽
I love Beverly.

467
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,365
我们之间的关系不因为名利
Our relationship goes by no name.

468
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,204
我没有目的
I have no intentions.

469
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,246
我想要她 因为我爱她
I desire her, and I am moved by love.

470
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,527
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

471
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,769
我怎么能知道你不是为了虚荣心或者好奇心?
How do I know that you're not moved by vanity or curiosity?

472
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,725
我怎么知道你不是为了想要这个家里的钱?
How do I know you're not here for the money in this family?

473
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,241
我是个孤儿 孤儿没有虚荣心
I was an orphan. Orphans don't have vanity.

474
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,967
我不知道为什么 但是有父母的人才有资格虚荣
I'm not sure why, but one needs parents to be vain.

475
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,931
那钱呢?
And the money?

476
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,730
首先我不会从你那拿一个子
I wouldn't take a penny from you, for a start.

477
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,488
我不会接受帮助 甚至是一句为我说的好话
I would accept no favors, not even a kind word said on my behalf.

478
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,529
那她的状况呢?
And of her condition?

479
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,448
我以前从来没有这么爱过一个人
I've never loved much before.

480
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,971
死亡...
So death...

481
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,282
是无法避免的
hasn't been something to be avoided.

482
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,642
但是现在想到要失去她...
But now when I think of losing her...

483
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,806
有没有可能非常爱一个人他就不会死?
Is it possible to love someone so completely they simply can't die?

484
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,007
没有
No.

485
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,811
但是我是一个贼...
But I'm a thief...

486
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,167
就像你看到的
as you so keenly observed.

487
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,845
我不能偷一个生命吗?
Can't I steal just one life?

488
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,288
我们走着瞧吧
Well, we'll see about you.

489
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,646
这是不是意味着说我现在可以喝一点红葡萄酒了?
Does that mean I might try some of that claret now?

490
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,808
我们都喝点吧
Let's both, shall we?

491
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,325
还有一件事:
One more thing:

492
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,006
她睡在屋顶的帐篷里
She sleeps in her tent on the roof.

493
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,524
你不行
And you do not.

494
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,170
一些当地人挖蛤蚌的时候发现了我
Some locals found me while they were digging up clams.

495
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,728
我在一些孤儿院之间辗转了几年
I spent a few years on the bounce from orphanage to orphanage.

496
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,161
我猜这让我更适应流浪生活
Just got on better on the streets, I suppose.

497
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,691
你做什么?
What did you do?

498
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,485
我的意思是做什么工作
To live, I mean.

499
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,524
在街头唱歌跳舞挣零花钱
I danced and sang in the streets for coins.

500
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,690
当扒手 我和两个姑娘一起住了一段时间
Picked pockets. I lived with two girls for a while.

501
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,204
- 两个?  - 两个
- Two?  - Two.

502
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,765
你这个花花公子
Aren't you the playboy.

503
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,724
不是那样的
Ah, it wasn't like that.

504
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,201
差不多
Mostly.

505
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,170
我那时很小 然后帕里发现了我
I was young. And then Pearly scooped me up.

506
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,045
他说我有天赋
He said I had talent.

507
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,561
我猜不是因为你的唱歌能力
I take it wasn't for your singing.

508
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,647
这不管用吧? 你的体温并没有下降
It's not working, is it? You're not getting any cooler.

509
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,641
没有
No.

510
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,969
来 让我试试
Here, let me try something.

511
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,767
来这里
Come here.

512
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,889
实际上 这不管用
Actually, this isn't helping.

513
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,650
你能听到你的心跳吗?
Can you hear your heart?

514
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,403
当我发烧的时候 这差不多是我唯一能听到的
When the fever comes, it's about the only thing I can hear.

515
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,369
开第一个保险柜的时候 心跳的太大声 根本听不到齿轮的声音
When you crack your first safe, your heart beats so loud you can't hear the tumblers.

516
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,488
你必须学会平静下来 放慢心跳 才能工作
You have to learn to quieten it, slow it down, so you can work between the beats.

517
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,083
窍门就是列举词汇
The trick to it is lists.

518
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,489
说一些没有意义的词...
Meaningless words...

519
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,690
同时放慢呼吸
you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath.

520
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,404
慢慢吸气...
Inhale quietly...

521
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,524
呼气 不停地说直到这口气结束
exhale and say the words until the breath is gone.

522
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,442
- 明白了吗?  - 明白了
- Got it?  - I think so.

523
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,491
你想要词汇表嘛? 动物是个不错的选择 颜色 人名
Do you need a list? Animals are good. Colors. Saints.

524
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,006
北河二星

525

00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,481
北极星
Polaris.

530
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,365
彼得
Peter

531
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,642
这个方法管用
It's working.

532
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,481
继续
Go on.

533
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,325
昴星团
Pleiades.

534
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,685
昴宿星

535
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,485
仙后座
Cassiopeia.

536
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,406
你好
Hello.

537
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,250
那些是我的
Those are mine.

538
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,167
这些纸也是
The paper too.

539
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,930
我猜到了
Yeah, I figured as much.

540
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,370
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

541
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,203
我喜欢在月光下画画
I like to draw by the moon.

542
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,211
你看 我画的不是很好 在昏暗的光线下就看不出来了
See, I'm not very good and the light helps hide it.

543
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,571
这是贝芙丽吗?
Is it Beverly?

544
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,922
我不认识别的红头发的人了
I don't know anyone else with red hair.

545
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,650
你爱她吗?
Do you love her?

546
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,931
全心全意
With all my heart.

547
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,724
你发誓吗?
Do you swear?

548
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,125
我发誓
I swear.

549
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,721
好吧
Okay.

550
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,731
跟我来
Come with me.

551
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,085
这是个公主床
It's a princess bed.

552
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,844
我让邻居的男孩为她造的
I made the neighbor boys make it for her.

553
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,289
他们听我的
They listen to me.

554
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,445
爸爸给我讲过一个故事 有一个公主死了...
Daddy told me a story about a princess who died...

555
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,440
但一个吻又让她活过来了
and a kiss that made her not dead anymore.

556
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,764
如果你在这里吻她...
If you kiss her here...

557
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,610
她就不会死了
she won't die.

558
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,645
我知道的
I know it.

559
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,086
好吗?
Okay?

560
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,210
快答应
Say okay.

561
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,721
好
Okay.

562
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,886
好的
Okay.

563
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,122
你现在可以把我抱到床上了
You can put me to bed now.

564
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,369
我是帕里・索姆斯
Pearly Soames.

565
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,363
我有预约
I have an appointment.

566
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,169
你好 帕里
Hello, Pearly.

567
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,807
你好 很荣幸来到这 大人
Ah. Hello, Your Honor. Sir.

568
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,926
当然了
Oh, of course.

569
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,484
那个...
Eh...

570
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,202
我来是希望能得到豁免边界限令的特权
I'm here to request special dispensation regarding the boundaries of jurisdiction.

571
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,447
继续说
Proceed.

572
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,325
我想获准进入城北地区 大人
I'd like permission to travel north of the city, Your Honor.

573
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,880
噢 这可有点为难我了 帕里 根据你上次的表现
Wow, that is quite a request, Pearly, considering what happened last time.

574
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,924
噢 那只是个误会
Well, you know, it was a misunderstanding.

575
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,247
是嘛
Yeah.

576
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,081
好吧 小鬼 干脆一次把这事说清楚
Well, demon, let's get this over with.

577
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,647
帕里・索姆斯 作为曼哈顿和第五区的恶魔执行者
Pearly Soames, Warden of Manhattan and the Five Boroughs

578
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,161
你凭什么要我批准你的请求?
on what grounds do you make this request?

579
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,887
因为我发现有个人类可能会使用奇迹
I've come to believe that a human is on the verge of using his miracle

580
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,726
而这会对我们来说可不是个好消息
which would be a formidable advancement for the other side.

581
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,242
- 有证据吗?  - 守护天使现身了 大人
- Evidence?  - The presence of guardian angels, Your Honor.

582
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,364
东方之狗还有塞西尔・麦卓
Both the White Dog of the East and Cecil Mature.

583
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,289
- 还有别的吗?  - 嗯 我预见到未来的一些片段
- What else?  - Well, I've had a vision.

584
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,406
一个红发女孩 我用少女的血液把她画下来了
A red-haired girl I've drawn in a fugue with the blood of a virgin.

585
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,771
帕里 不一定就是她
Pearly, that could be anyone.

586
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,010
路大人 我亲眼见到他和一个这样的女人在一起
Okay, Lu, I mean, he's already been seen with a girl matching that exact description.

587
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,045
这个女人快死了
She's dying.

588
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,486
他爱她吗?
And he loves her?

589
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,128
百分之百 全心全意
Purely, entirely, and with all his heart.

590
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,766
那你的意思是他会用自己的奇迹去救她
So you believe it is his miracle to save her.

591
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,928
对 噢不 是的 大人
I do, sir. Yes, Your Honor. I do.

592
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,288
但一个人的命运往往不如眼见到的那般
A man's destiny is often not what it seems.

593
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,801
我明白的 我知道
I understand that, sir, I do. I do. I understand that.

594
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,168
但... 我... 我...
But I... Heh. I, uh...

595
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,567
我觉得这次准没错的
I have a feeling about this one, you know?

596
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,162
他是你训练出来的
You trained him.

597
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,201
你从街上捡到他
Picked him up off the street.

598
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,880
你将他视若亲生
The son you never had.

599
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,685
走到今天这步 惭愧吗?
Embarrassing, no?

600
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,370
人有失足
Shit happens.

601
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,081
大人
Your Honor

602
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,366
请批准我进入北地
I just need the permission to go north.

603
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,801
驳回
Denied.

604
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,010
这只是你的私心
This one is too personal.

605
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,806
你仍然不许进入北地
Your prohibition from the northern territories is upheld.

606
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,371
路西法大人!
Lucifer!

607
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,246
我一定要阻止他 现在就要!
I need to stop this one, now!

608
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,207
现在?
Now?

609
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,327
你懂什么叫"现在"
You have no idea what "now" is.

610
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,361
听清楚 过去天下任我畅飞
Now, I was flying.

611
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,686
火焰皆为我食
Now, I breathed fire and I ate them as they fled.

612
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,010
举手间地动山摇
Now, I whipped my tail and the winds trembled.

613
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,647
可现在 我确只能带着此等残破身躯
Now, I am hidden in this pale shade of flesh and bone.

614
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,571
眼睁睁看着不断有人得到救赎
Now, I am witness to man's eternal salvation.

615
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,569
再目睹他完结一生
Now, I am witness to his demise.

616
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,730
少跟我说道时间 小鬼
Do not speak to me of time, demon.

617
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,448
它最简单的变化都不是你浅薄的智力所能理解的
Its simplest ebbs and turns elude your meager understanding.

618
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,847
现在! 给我自寻他路! 
Find another way! Now!

619
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,769
我带你去跳舞吧
Let me take you dancing.

620
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,290
迎新夜怎么样?
How about New Year's Eve?

621
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,443
你行吗? 你会跳舞?
Can you? Dance, I mean.

622
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,881
会啊 一点点
I have done. A bit.

623
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,127
不太多
Some.

624
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,964
我倒是全会
Well, I know them all.

625
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,449
但也仅限书本理论
From books, anyway.

626
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,525
听起来不错
It seems wonderful.

627
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,245
那就说好了
So it's sorted, then.

628
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,760
不行的 彼得
I can't, Peter.

629
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,090
是我的原因吗? 因为我没有车驾和礼服?
Is it me? Because I'm not a gentleman with a driver and the right clothes?

630
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,725
当然不是了
You know it's not that.

631
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,446
那是为什么?
What, then?

632
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,965
嗯 我爸爸说过 跳舞会害我丧命
Well, my father says that dancing will kill me.

633
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,571
这样
Ah.

634
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,244
爸爸总是爱过度保护
Fathers are overprotective.

635
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,964
别脱外套
Coat stays on.

636
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,446
我们一起去隔壁喝下午茶
We're all to go next door for an afternoon peppermint.

637
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,687
怎么一回事? 出什么问题了?
What is it? What's wrong?

638
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,009
已经一个下午了
It's been happening all afternoon.

639
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,602
是暖炉出了点问题
Has something to do with the furnace.

640
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,201
你爸和技师已经在下面呆了一个小时了
Your father's been down there for an hour with the mechanic.

641
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,882
他把所有人都送到盖米利斯家了
He sent the rest of the staff to the Gamelys'

642
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:51,882
他要你也立刻过去 
and asked that you join them right away.

643
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,361
好啦 维拉 走吧
Now, Willa, please.

644
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,647
去隔壁吧 贝芙 我呢 去楼下看看能不能帮上忙
Go on next door, Bev. I'll, uh, see if I can help them out downstairs.

645
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,405
小姐 小小姐
Miss. The little one.

646
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,049
小姐
Miss.

647
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,244
她堵住了
She's jammed up.

648
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,647
让我来看看
Let me take a look.

649
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,571
这里危险 你该去隔壁的
We're in the red already. You should go next door.

650
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,684
那你们呢? 听起来动静会很大
What about you? This sounds like it's about to blow sky-high.

651
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,882
船要沉的话 只好一起沉了
Go down with the ship, as it were.

652
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,809
可这是房子 不是船
Yeah, it's a house, not a ship.

653
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,729
这地方是我太太弄起来的
My wife made this place.

654
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,048
每一件家具都是她挑选的
She picked every stitch of furniture.

655
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,011
不管是枕头 烛台还是窗栏
Every pillow, every sconce and window frame.

656
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,925
我不能丢下不管
Wouldn't do to leave it.

657
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,808
听着 你们现在得赶快走
Listen, you should go now.

658
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,724
温斯顿 走吧 快
Winston, go, go.

659
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,041
你也是
Now, you.

660
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,329
不能让蒸汽爆炸
The steam can't come.

661
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,803
- 你疯了  - 一下就好
- Are you mad?  - Wait.

662
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,126
我对复杂的系统很有一手
I have a sympathy for complex systems.

663
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,288
各部分零件之间的搭配运作
How things go together and come apart.

664
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,610
比如说锁
Like locks.

665
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,042
只要能弄清楚连接点
Just need to feel for the connection.

666
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,846
那根管子很烫 小心 避开它
That pipe's too hot, avoid it, avoid it.

667
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,050
这个被堵着了 说明问题出在前一个
This one's blocked. Means the problem's before it.

668
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,325
卡着了
It's stuck.

669
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,489
- 糟  - 糟了?
- Uh-oh.  - Uh-oh?

670
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,407
- 不小心  - 不小心?
- Qops.  - Oops?

671
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,725
我轻吗?
Am I light or heavy?

672
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,127
轻得像根羽毛
Light as a feather.

673
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,165
晚安 彼得・雷克
Good night, Peter Lake.

674
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,804
晚安 小维拉
Good night, little Willa.

675
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,044
我爸爸说是你救了大家
My father says you saved all our lives.

676
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,320
他夸张了 我只是救了他和那个技师
He's overstating things. It was just him and the furnace man's.

677
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,405
还有你自己的
And yours.

678
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,049
是的 还有我自己的命
Yeah, mine too, I suppose.

679
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,163
周四是迎新夜
Thursday is New Year's Eve.

680
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,969
我想去跳舞
I'd like to go dancing.

681
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,967
你真有勇气 敢来找我
You take great risk coming to me for this.

682
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,241
这是你欠我的 天使
You owe me, angel.

683
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,970
我只不过是过来讨债罢了
And this is me calling in my marker.

684
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,207
你要知道 我不能直接插手
You know I cannot directly intervene.

685
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,205
放轻松 小天使
Relax, flyboy.

686
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,080
这只不过是让心跳稍稍快一点
It just makes the heart beat a little faster.

687
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,002
一般人只有在非常激动的情况下才会出问题
Someone would have to be real excited to experience any deleterious effects.

688
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,686
你应该懂的
You know the rules.

689
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,402
欠债还钱
Debts must be paid.

690
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,609
那我这就算还债了
And then ours is settled.

691
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,366
当然 一笔勾销
Then we're square. Yes, indeed.

692
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,528
之后你还是善良的天使
You're a good man yourself. Well done.

693
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,371
我一直在想
I've been wondering.

694
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,284
人人都想上天
With all these trying to go up

695
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,045
独独你却下界
and you come down.

696
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,283
成为了人类 值得吗?
Was it worth it, becoming human?

697
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,369
还是说 你只是一时冲动?
Or was it an impulse buy?

698
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,606
你肯定很想念自己的翅膀吧?
You must miss the wings, right?

699
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,124
肯定是的吧 别急着走嘛
Oh, come on. You must.

700
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,170
你穿这套很帅
You look good in that suit.

701
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,171
那你...
You...

702
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,802
就是惊人的美丽了
are impossibly beautiful.

703
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,771
彼此彼此
So are you.

704
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,566
停
Stop it.

705
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,327
否则我会热到把脚下的雪都融化的
Or I'll melt all the snow I'm standing on.

706
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,490
只要你愿意 我可以让你融化全世界的雪
Give me a chance and you'll melt all the snow in the world.

707
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,607
好啦 走吧
Come on.

708
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,764
我妈妈常说 舞会场地总是比外面看起来的要大好多
My mother always said that it was bigger on the inside than it was on the outside.

709
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,529
- 跳一曲?  - 好的
- Shall we?  - Yes.

710
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,971
你太晚了
You're late.

711
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,846
对不起
I'm sorry.

712
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,362
除了你 不会再有人爱我了
If you don't make love to me now, no one ever will.

713
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,842
好吧 我也正打算这么做
Well, that's exactly what I'll do, then.

714
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,091
地点
Places.

715
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,171
什么地点 亲爱的?
What, Love?

716
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,209
我们去过的地方
Places we've been.

717
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,245
什么意思?
What do you mean?

718
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,160
贝芙丽 说话?
Beverly?

719
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,206
亲爱的?
Beverly?

720
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,681
回答我?
Beverly?

721
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,881
说话啊
Beverly.

722
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,526
说...
Bev...

723
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,371
噢 不 不 不
No, no, no.

724
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,971
快醒来 贝芙丽
No. Beverly.

725
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,481
宝贝
Baby.

726
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,970
不该这样的
This isn't right.

727
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,926
不能这样
This isn't right.

728
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,931
亲爱的 贝芙丽!
Beverly. Beverly. Beverly!

729
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,731
别离开我
Don't leave me.

730
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,005
别走
Please don't go.

731
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,091
对不起
I'm sorry.

732
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,891
有他的消息了 奥特发现了他
They spotted him. Otter did.

733
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,083
我是指彼得・雷克 他回来了
Peter Lake, I mean. He's back.

734
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,327
在哪?
Where?

735
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,560
他先在皇后区的墓地参加了一个女人的葬礼...
He was at a graveyard in Queens burying some girl...

736
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,688
然后就回中央车站牵马
then went back to Grand Central for his horse.

737
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,967
没跟丢他吧?
Do they still have him?

738
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,367
噢 事实上是没法跟丢
Well, that's just the thing. They can't lose him.

739
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,483
- 他们只是在单纯的散步  - 散步?
- They're just walking.  - Just walking?

740
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,880
那我们也去散散步吧
Let's go for a little walk ourselves.

741
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,764
和小彼得一块儿
With little Peter Lake.

742
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,890
没事的 马兄
It's all right, horse.

743
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,849
我知道他们会找来
I know they're coming for us.

744
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,566
打个架也不坏
A fight will do us good.

745
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,489
你失败了
You failed.

746
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,009
你没能救活她 你最爱的红发女孩
You couldn't save her. Your beloved red-haired girl.

747
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,771
哈哈 她可能会是某个大人物吗?
Ha, ha. Was she gonna be somebody important?

748
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,729
总统? 教皇?
The president? The pope?

749
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,611
还是登上火星第一人的曾祖母?
The great-grandmother of the first man on Mars?

750
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,804
亦或者简单些
Or was it something simpler?

751
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,843
她的爱是伟大无私的?
That she was capable of great love?

752
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,411
能够温暖世界 带来光亮
The kind of love that makes the world all warm and light.

753
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,290
给予他人希望
And gives the others hope.

754
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,121
还是那种折骨断翅的爱
The kind of love that tilts the scales.

755
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,529
不管怎么说 现在都不重要了
Well, it doesn't matter.

756
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,281
反正她已经死了
She's dead.

757
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,929
没有温度 死尸一具
Cold. Dead.

758
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,724
被土掩埋
And already in the ground.

759
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,006
你以为你能逃开?
Quit me?

760
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,528
那是不可能的 孩子
You don't quit me, boy.

761
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,006
我都记不清是何时开始...
I've been blackening souls...

762
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,210
抹黑灵魂 碾碎奇迹的
and crushing miracles for longer than I can remember.

763
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,963
你是不是也在想 为何世界如此混乱
Do you ever ask yourself why the universe goes to all this trouble

764
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,489
既然要你走完人生长路 却有我做其中的拦路虎?
to help you fulfill your destiny and then throws me in your path?

765
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,401
也许只是因为上帝也如同我们一样嗜血
Maybe it's because God is just as bloodthirsty as the rest of us.

766
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,161
也许是他也厌烦了无尽的善与光
Maybe he doesn't like eternal benevolence and light.

767
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,011
也许他也喜欢战斗
Maybe he just likes a good fight.

768
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,283
我不知道你在说什么 但我要告诉你:
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I'll tell you one thing:

769
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,087
真遗憾你爸当年没有把你弄死
It's a shame your daddy didn't do a better job on your neck with that soda bottle.

770
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,850
是嘛 小彼得?
Is that right, little Peter Lake?

771
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,441
那就让我们看看该怎么对你下手了
Well, let's see what we're gonna do with you.

772
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,642
快 前进!
Come on. Move! Move it!

773
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,241
你还行吗 伙计?
How are you, lads?

774
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,123
- 给我活剥那只狗的皮  - 不!
- Skin that white dog alive.  - No!

775
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,446
撒网!
Bring in the net!

776
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,760
- 拿下他!  - 你快走
- Get him!  - I want you to go.

777
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,126
马儿 快走!
Horse, go!

778
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,087
稳住
Hold, boys.

779
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,761
马兄!
Horse!

780
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,526
走啊
Go.

781
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,250
快走
Go.

782
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,441
等一下 别急
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

783
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,249
让我来
Well, well, well.

784
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,249
嗨 朋友
Hey, pal.

785
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,807
想找谁?
You looking for someone in particular?

786
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,326
呃...
L...

787
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,091
我也不知道
I don't know.

788
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,485
我记不得了
I can't remember.

789
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,889
什么都不记得了
I can't remember anything.

790
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,162
当真爱被遗失
When true love is lost

791
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,080
生命丧失意义
life can bleed of all meaning.

792
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,089
人也仅剩空壳
We are left blank.

793
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,203
但请记住 命运仍存转机
But the possibility of destiny remains.

794
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,769
虽然关于前路 迷雾重重
What we are meant for may yet be discovered.

795
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,208
多年以后
And once in a very long while

796
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,201
重拾的道路将会打败一切时间
that journey to find our destiny may defeat even time itself.

797
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,201
2014年 纽约 

798
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,884
你是谁?
Who are you?

799
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,529
彼得 转机来了
Pete, here's your change.

800
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,444
我撞到了你
I smashed into you.

801
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,768
没错 没事吧?
You did. Are you all right?

802
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,769
我重还是轻?
Am I light or heavy?

803
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,686
轻得像羽毛
Light as a feather.

804
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,247
我叫艾比 你呢?
I'm Abby. What's your name?

805
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,126
我不知道
I don't know.

806
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,203
人人都知道自己的名字
Everybody knows their name.

807
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,407
不包括我
Not me.

808
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,290
你真笨
You're silly.

809
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,127
看 那有一颗星
Look. There's a star.

810
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,283
就连星星也有名字
Even the stars have names.

811
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,646
- 什么?  - 星星们
- What?  - The stars.

812
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,962
我只是记不得他们叫什么
I just can't remember them.

813
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,961
北河二星
Castor.

814
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,684
好了 艾比
Abby.

815
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,520
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

816
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,926
对不起
Sorry.

817
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:21,084
彼得・雷克?

818
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,084
那个混蛋
That son of a bitch.

819
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,808
他不可能还活着的
He can't still be alive.

820
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:38,321
- 罗密欧 找到这个男人  - 我是凯撒
- Romeo, find this man.  - Cesar.

821
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,242
罗密欧是我爷爷
Romeo was my grandfather.

822
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,561
好吧 凯撒...
Cesar...

823
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,605
别的事先放下
drop everything else.

824
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,491
给我找到这个男人
Find this man.

825
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,648
老板 这人应该有上百岁了吧
Boss, this is like a hundred years old.

826
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,245
我看起来像是不知道这一点吗?
Do I, uh, strike you as a man who wouldn't know that?

827
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,445
不 先生 我没有...
No, sir. I didn't...

828
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,007
很抱歉 我不...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't...

829
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,841
还记得我是怎么干掉你爷爷的吗?
Remember I told you how I killed your grandfather?

830
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,687
我错了 老板
Sorry, sir.

831
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,211
找到这个男人
Find that man.

832
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,126
找到他
Find him.

833
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,568
我们当初可能是找错红头发的人了
We may have killed the wrong redhead.

834
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,120
麻烦你 我想找艾萨克・潘
Isaac Penn, please.

835
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,322
前台说他在这里面
The woman out front said he was back here.

836
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,164
这里确实是艾萨克・潘的阅览室
This is the Isaac Penn Reading Room.

837
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,886
对对 如果可以的话 我想和他本人谈谈
Yeah, I mean, I'd like to speak with him if I could.

838
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,485
玩笑开得不错啊
Be a neat trick.

839
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,924
潘在90年前就死了
Penn's been dead 90 years.

840
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,331
呵呵 在哈德逊大街上有个叫樱的戏院
Heh. There's a theater on Hudson Street called the Theater of the Coheeries.

841
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,650
你能给我点关于它的相关信息吗?
Could you, uh, tell me if you have any information on it, please?

842
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,569
它是艾萨克・潘捐助的
Isaac Penn donated it.

843
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,729
不行 我这里能看到词条...
Nope. I see it here...

844
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,527
但相关信息没有从胶片上录入下来
but the information on it hasn't been cataloged from the microfiche.

845
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,121
好吧 那我能看下那个胶什么的东西吗?
Okay, might I see them, please? These micro fish.

846
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,525
当然 两种身份证件 填完表 再等两周审批...
Sure. Two forms of ID, fill this out, two-week approval period...

847
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,922
你就可以随便搜查资料了
and you can search to your heart's delight.

848
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,326
我能不能...? 我的意思是...
Can I just...? I mean...

849
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,124
对不起 我帮不了你
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

850
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,527
现在有太多规定
There's so many regulations these days.

851
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,527
- 嗨 我是维吉尼亚・嘉明丽  - 嗨 我是彼得・雷克
- Hi, I'm Virginia Gamely.  - Hi, Peter Lake.

852
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,165
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

853
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,924
我在哪里认识过你吗?
Do I know you from somewhere?

854
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,088
不 我可不这么认为
I don't think so, no. No.

855
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,725
尽管我也不确定
Although I can't be sure.

856
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,644
我没有记忆...
I've had no memory...

857
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,241
- 从我记事时候起就没有  - 哦
- for as long as I can remember.  - Oh.

858
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,809
或许我的头被撞击过 虽然我没找到疤
Maybe there was once a blow on the head, although I can't find a scar.

859
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:48,326
整个世界看起来就像刚刚升起的浓雾
And the whole world has seemed like a deep fog that's just now beginning to lift.

860
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,601
尽管我喜欢升得更快点儿
Although not fast enough for my liking.

861
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,689
我确信...
I've become convinced...

862
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,602
如果我能知道樱是什么...
that if I could just learn what this Coheeries is...

863
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,683
或许能帮助唤起我的记忆
it may help jog my memory.

864
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,360
可是现在他们告诉我得等两个星期...
But now they're telling me I have to wait two weeks...

865
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,770
我不得不用两种身份证件 我要是有证件就不需要来这里找回记忆了
and I have to have two forms of ID that I don't have just to even get back there.

866
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,521
而现在我越来越怀疑 我或许能更快得到自己需要的...
But I have a growing suspicion that I may be able to get what I need faster...

867
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,007
就跟每个人晚上回家过夜一样快
as soon as everybody goes home for the night.

868
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,807
如果我知道微缩胶片是什么样就好了
If only I knew what a micro fish looked like.

869
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,369
你知道 像这种地方的安全系统总是很完备的
You know, places like this have all sorts of security systems.

870
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,406
不知怎么 我发现自己很无畏
Well, somehow I find myself undaunted.

871
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,161
你很幸运 我在这工作 所以我不需要任何批准
Well, you're in luck. I work here, so I don't need any approvals.

872
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,521
是不是啊 杰克?
Isn't that right, Jack?

873
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,961
嘉明丽小姐 新闻记者可以随意进出
Reporters come and go as they please, Ms. Gamely.

874
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,128
- 这边请  - 谢谢帮忙
- There you go.  - I appreciate the help.

875
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,043
反正我现在不走运
I wasn't having any luck anyway.

876
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,651
你在找什么?
What were you looking for?

877
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,088
治疗癌症的方法
A cure for cancer, I suppose.

878
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,731
所以...
So...

879
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,249
应该是在...
this should go...

880
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,686
这儿
here.

881
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,841
还有...
And...

882
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,011
啊
Aw.

883
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,966
等一下
Wait a sec.

884
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,760
让我看看
Let me see.

885
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,680
还以为你连显微胶片是什么都不知道
Thought you didn't even know what microfiche were.

886
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,882
我刚刚掌握了机器的诀窍
I just got a knack with machines.

887
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,040
试试
Try it now.

888
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,923
那不是个剧院
Well, that's not a theater.

889
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,124
可恶 估计是贴错了标签
Damn. Guess it's mislabeled.

890
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,889
樱不是剧院
Coheeries isn't a theater.

891
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,365
是一座小镇

892
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,886

01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,485
她的名字叫...
Her name was...

897

她叫贝芙丽
Her name was Beverly.

898
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,766

谢谢你 大使先生 很高兴我们能达成共识

921

我想是他找到了我
I think he found me.

922
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,128
这怎么可能?
How is this really possible?

923
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:23,324
人生漫长 你会看到
Well, in a life this long, you do see things.

924
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,924
一些我们已知世界里没有的事物
Things that don't always add up to the world we think we know.

925
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,406

我一直保留着那张桌子

没什么特别的 我也说不上来为什么

她死去的那一晚...
The night she died...

934
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,120
我为她搜寻了整个天空
I searched the sky for her.

935
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,322
我想 我在猎户座找到了她
And I found her there in Orion's Belt, I think.

936
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,730
她曾说过 当我们完成了地球上的事业...

937
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,446
我们就会飞起来 变成星星

938
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,766
什么事业?
What work?

939
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,810
她才21岁
She was 21.

940
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,567
她怎么可能已经完结了呢?
How could she have possibly been finished?

941

为什么我依然活着?

Well, I look at you, Peter, unchanged after all these years.

943

也许你仍然有要做的事情

I have a feeling we won't see each other again, will we?

950
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,367
跟长辈顶嘴不礼貌哦
It's poor manners to talk back to your elders.

951
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,249
严格来说 我比你年纪大
Technically, I think I'm older than you.

952
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,803
是的 我觉得不会再见

971
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,126
不是他的奇迹
Not his miracle.

972
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,646
是她的
Hers.

973
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,647
什么?
What?

974
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,161
你一直念念不忘去阻止他...
You were so fixated on stopping him...

975
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,330
你完全忽略了她
you missed her entirely.

976
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,008
她使得他如此爱她 以至于不会死去
She made him love her so much that he could not die.

977
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,283
他就是她的奇迹
He was her miracle.

978
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,291
我想杀了他 我希望他留在死亡里
I want to kill him, and I want him to stay dead.

979
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,450
我想让他变成白雪 散落在四面八方
I want him turned into snow and scattered to the four winds.

980
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,966
恩
Mm.

981
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,482
旧的秩序仍将适用 你的战斗将会是致命的
Older rules would apply. You would be fighting as a mortal.

982
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,728
你不觉得 这太极端了吗?
That's rather extreme, don't you think?

983
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,891
我来告诉你一些让你血液冰冷的事情
I'll tell you something that should chill your blood.

984
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,763
无论我们把局面怎样扭转...
No matter how far we tip the scales our way...

985
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,645
无论他们多少人被打入黑暗...
no matter how many of them we turn dark...

986
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,890
没有什么能消灭他们的希望
nothing seems to break their capacity for hope.

987
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:32,243
他们自由传播希望 就像学前班集市上的流感
They pass it back and forth like the flu at a preschool fair.

988
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,764
路西法 我们输了
We're losing, Lucifer.

989
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,927
一次只能有一颗明亮的星星 我们输了
One bright star at a time, we're losing.

990
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,407
帕里 你得说出那些话
You will have to say the words, Pearly.

991
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,806
好的
Right.

992
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,804
我 帕里・索姆斯...
I, Pearly Soames...

993
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,002
第五区的恶魔执行者...
Demon Enforcer of the Five Boroughs...

994
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,521
堕落军团的黑暗骑士...
Black Knight of the Armies of the Fallen...

995
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,645
路西法 您本人忠心耿耿和心甘情愿的仆人...
and faithful and willing servant to Lucifer, your good self...

996
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,121
在此请求 这场战斗中失败的一方...
hereby request that the loser of the fight...

997
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,800
在人类 彼得・雷克 还有我之间...
between the human, Peter Lake, and myself...

998
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,209
必有人真正死去
die the one true death.

999
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,085
再考虑一下
Reconsider.

1000
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,566
不
No.

1001
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,089
帕里 最后一次机会
Last chance, Pearly.

1002
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:29,687
同意
Granted.

1003
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,401
帕里...
Pearly...

1004
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,368
注意星光
Watch out for the starlight.

1005
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,004
路大人 你说什么?
What are you talking about, Lu?

1006
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,444
小心点 我不想失去你
Be careful. I would hate to lose you.

1007
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,486
为什么?
Why?

1008
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,124
你习惯了人类
You get used to people.

1009
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,368
豆芽吃了吗?
Did you try the Brussels sprouts yet?

1010
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,607
妈妈 我不饿
I'm not really that hungry, Mom.

1011
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,364
宝贝 就试着吃点儿 好吗?
Just try to eat something, baby, okay?

1012
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,647
好
Okay.

1013
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,001
给你
Here you go.

1014
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,450
- 妈妈?  - 怎么了 孩子?
- Mama?  - Yes, baby?

1015
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,526
你觉得 我们死去以后会去哪儿呢?
Where do you think we go when we die?

1016
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,246
来
Come here.

1017

你说住在十二街 这儿是唯一一家姓嘉明丽的
You said 12th Street, and you're the only Gamelys on 12th Street.

1019

我的确喜欢吃鸡
And I do like chicken.

1020
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,801
- 你坐船漂过来的?  - 别人是这么对我说的
- You floated here? In a boat?  - That's what I was told.

1021
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,169
我们有巧克力 草莓...
We have chocolate, strawberry...

1022

扶她躺下来
Lay her down.

1027
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,166

It's all right. It's all right, darling. Mama's here.

她得了癫痫
She gets seizures.

1031
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,285
她现在要睡觉
She'll sleep now.

1032
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,769
艾比是红头发
Abby has red hair.

1033
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,210
我们必须得走 现在

1034
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,367

画里的女孩...
The girl in the pictures...

1036

我一直在画的女孩...
the girl I've been drawing...

1037
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,765
自始至终是她
it was her all along.

1038
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,450
彼得 她得了癌症
She has cancer, Peter.

1039
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,408
医生们说她快要死了

1040
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,003
我想我知道怎样救她
I think I know how to save her.

1041
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,884
他们说唯有奇迹可以
They said only a miracle.

1042
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,891
我
Me.

1043
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,244
这是我活着的原因
That's why I stayed alive.

1044
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,681
是为了她
For her.

1045
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,010
我是她的奇迹
I'm her miracle.

1046
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,565
这简直是疯了
This is crazy.

1047
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,247
我能救她 我知道我能
I can save her. I know I can.

1048

我们得离开
We have to go.

1049
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,561
有一群人要来这儿伤害我 我想他们也想要伤害艾比
There are men coming who mean to harm me. I think they mean to harm Abby too.

1050
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,330

Trust me, please.

1051

- You know where to go, horse.  - What?

1058
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,889
嘘 让他自己解答
Shh. Let him do the math.

1059
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,246
好的
Okay.

1060
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,481
- 她怎么样了?  - 还在睡着

1061

Coheeries.

1063
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,930
看起来被遗弃了
It looks forgotten.

1064
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,406
来 这边走
Come on, this way.

1065
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,249
他们怎么会 呃...? 上帝 管他们是谁
What about those, uh...? Whoever they were. Christ.

1066
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,886
我想他们不会跟到这儿
I don't think they can follow us up here.

1067
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,481
你认为不会 这是安慰的话
You don't think. That's reassuring.

1068
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,688
不 我相当肯定
No, I'm fairly sure.

1069
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,644
规则变了
Rules change.

1070
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,800
小彼得想要救人
Little Peter wants to save someone.

1071
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,849

1072

彼得 很高兴见到你
Good to see you, Peter.

1073
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,561
平心而论 帕里 我没法对你说同样的话
In fairness, I can't say the same thing about you, Pearly.

1074
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:31,169
看来我把红头发的人弄混了
Well, it seems I got my redheads mixed up.

1075
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,331
无心之过
Honest mistake.

1076
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,891
我会改正的
I'll fix it.

1077
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,684
我们有20个人
There's 20 of us.

1078
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,204
你只有一个
And there's just the one of you.

1079
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,889
今晚不会有奇迹了
There'll be no miracles tonight.

1080
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,642
她的命运已经注定了
And her destiny is getting skewered.

1081
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,121
马儿
Horse.

1082
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,042
马儿 我想你知道怎么做
I suppose you know what to do, horse.

1083
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,646
这个白狗 一直是懦夫!
Always a coward, that White Dog!

1084
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,040
伙计们
Boys.

1085
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,649
帕里 你为什么要这么做?
Why do you do it, Pearly?

1086
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,611
你自己都不知道吧?
Do you even know?

1087
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,929
我知道我的命运
I know my destiny.

1088
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,640
是时候让你去面对命运了
And it's high time you met yours.

1089
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,801
它向冰面俯冲了!
Off the ice!

1090
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,681
好吧
Right, then.

1091
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,120
艾比?
Abby?

1092
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,567
艾比
Abby.

1093
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,364
哦 上帝 不
Oh, Jesus. No.

1094
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,086
一百年前 一个小姑娘做了这张床 许下愿望 她现在已成为老妇
A bed of wishes made 100 years ago by a little girl who's now an old woman.

1095
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:52,166
这张床是为了拯救一个红头发的姑娘 避免她在年轻时死去
A bed made to save a girl with flaming red hair from dying too young.

1096
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,929
这是一个能产生奇迹的地方
A place made for a miracle.

1097
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,603
现在 我只是个机械师 可是我们如果没有机器又是什么呢?
Now, I'm just a mechanic, but what are we if not machines?

1098
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,370
这些机器需要来自宇宙的一点帮助才能运转
Machines that need a little help from the universe to run.

1099
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,807
艾比
Abby.

1100
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,803
这是我们去爱的原因吗?
Is this why we love at all?

1101
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,726
为了拯救?
To save?

1102
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,642
你一直就是那个人 不是吗?
You were always the one, weren't you?

1103
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,370
拜托 你肯定是那个我要去拯救的人
Please, you were always the one I was meant to save.

1104
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,251
回来
Come back.

1105
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,250
求求你活过来
Please come back.

1106
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,201
不
No.

1107
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,041
妈妈?
Mama?

1108
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,326
为什么大家都在哭?
Why is everybody crying?

1109
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,566
我是又生病失去知觉了吗?
Did I get sick and pass out again?

1110
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,411
是的 艾比
Yes, Abby.

1111
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,329
不过你现在好些了
But you're better now.

1112
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,608
为什么这么多事物都齐心协力去救一个小姑娘呢?
Why would so many things conspire to save one little girl's life?

1113
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:23,207
但是如果不仅仅是艾比需要帮助呢?
But what if it wasn't just Abby?

1114
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,928
如果她不比我们任何人特殊呢?
What if she is no more or less special than any of us?

1115
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,809
如果我们每个人都很特别...
What if we are all unique...

1116
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,924
宇宙对我们同等喜爱会怎么样?
and the universe loves us all equally?

1117
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,246
爱的如此之深 以至于它穿越许多个世纪...
So much so that it bends over backwards across the centuries...

1118
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,602
为我们每一个人
for each and every one of us.

1119
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:45,926
有时候 我们很幸运 能够看见
And sometimes, we are just lucky enough to see it.

1120
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,924
众生平等
No life is more important than another.

1121
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,881
没有什么事物是毫无意义的
And nothing has been without purpose.

1122
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,286
没有
Nothing.

1123
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:08,887
假使我们都是这伟大蓝图的一部分呢? 某一天我们或许会了解的伟大蓝图
What if we are all part of a great pattern that we may someday understand?

1124
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:19,048
有一天 当我们完成独自一人有能力做的事情...
And one day, when we have done what we alone are capable of doing...

1125
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,840
我们会升起 与自己最爱的人相聚...
we get to rise up and reunite with those we have loved the most...

1126
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,449
永远拥抱在一起
forever embraced.

1127
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,570
假使我们变成了星星会怎么样?
What if we get to become stars?

1128
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
