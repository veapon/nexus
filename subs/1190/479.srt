1
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,493
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

2
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:24,125
This is my story and that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:29,540
Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

4
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,751
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

5
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,554
...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

6
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:43,348
I'm the only one who could speak for
them...and the children we were.

7
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,322
My three friends and
I were inseparable...

8
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:29,382
...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

9
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:32,841
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

10
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,552
...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

11
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,387
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

12
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,429
Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

13
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,056
and Eastern European laborers.
Hard men living hard lives.

14
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:01,269
We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

15
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:04,312
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

16
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,315
I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

17
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,403
Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

18
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,113
Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

19
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,196
The will of the Church was forceful.

20
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:31,322
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

21
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,491
Yet, despite the harshness of life...

22
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,742
...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

23
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,451
...enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

24
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:45,702
Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

25
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,788
When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

26
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,704
...and, in some cases, final.

27
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:54,706
A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

28
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:58,166
A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

29
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,959
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

30
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,837
Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence...ruled by corruption.

31
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:11,504
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

32
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,381
We each served as altar boys.

33
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,841
Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

34
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,799
since the funeral included a $3 fee...

35
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:20,175
...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

36
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:24,426
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

37
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,177
...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

38
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:29,595
Two weeks into the new school year,

39
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,638
I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

40
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,472
...and I was ready for the big leagues.

41
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,515
In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

42
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,849
...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

43
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,268
...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

44
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,518
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

45
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:59,440
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

46
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,859
And you will receive the gifts...

47
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,359
...of the Holy Spirit.

48
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,570
It's gonna be a great day and your...

49
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:16,072
...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptized...

50
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,907
...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

51
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,865
-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

52
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,032
What clacker?

53
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,866
Now!

54
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,409
Let everyone rise.

55
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:30,869
Let us pray.

56
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,498
Nuns are such easy targets.

57
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,876
John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

58
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,961
We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

59
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,879
And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

60
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,420
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

61
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,172
...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

62
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,839
Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

63
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:03,214
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

64
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,049
...committed by people we knew.

65
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,635
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

66
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,844
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

67
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,427
What if our mothers are out there?

68
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:15,053
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

69
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,763
What if we hear something worse?

70
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,263
Like what?

71
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,639
Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

72
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:26,140
Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

73
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,854
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

74
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,479
I...sleep with married men.

75
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,355
Men with families.

76
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:47,608
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

77
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,485
Yes?

78
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,986
You see, I'm...I'm pregnant.

79
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,321
The father?

80
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,655
Take a number.

81
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,491
What are you going to do?

82
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,033
I know what you want me to do.

83
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,367
And I know what I should do.

84
00:08:10,993 --> 00:08:12,701
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

85
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:16,911
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,662
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

87
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,872
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

88
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:30,583
She knew.

89
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,501
Yeah, she knew.

90
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,542
Why do you think she told us all that?

91
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:38,211
I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

92
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:45,089
Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

93
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,923
...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

94
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,216
...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

95
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,925
He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

96
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,760
He was a friend...a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

97
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,345
You know what crap like
that does to your body?

98
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,930
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,889
Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

100
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:07,763
No, nothing.

101
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:09,723
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

102
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,765
Who says?

103
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,641
Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

104
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:17,019
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

105
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,061
You don't?

106
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,769
Maybe I got the wrong information.

107
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,354
I guess you did.

108
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,480
I'll see you later tonight.

109
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,148
What's tonight?

110
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,066
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

111
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,065
...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

112
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,399
Your mother said you'd love to help.

113
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,066
I bet she did.

114
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:41,237
Shakes...l don't want you
getting into any trouble.

115
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,404
Come on, Father, you know I never do.

116
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,613
That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

117
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:46,822
That's it?

118
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:48,655
That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

119
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,406
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

120
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:53,365
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

121
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,406
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:55,576
All right...see you.

123
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,495
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

124
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:05,162
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

125
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,664
But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

126
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:12,747
Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

127
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:14,292
her mother having died at childbirth.

128
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,168
Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

129
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,084
We could always count on Carol...

130
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,378
...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

131
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,128
While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

132
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:26,337
...waiting to see the skaters perform...

133
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,753
...we each had one eye in a hole...

134
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,380
...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

135
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,881
...get into their skaters' outfits.

136
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,675
This is what heaven must be about.

137
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,178
Carol, you want to take a look?

138
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,637
Like it's something I haven't seen?

139
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,306
You're so lucky!

140
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,849
She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

141
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,684
When my friends and I were young,

142
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,767
...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

143
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:07,185
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

144
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,521
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

145
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:13,023
But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

146
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:16,732
There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

147
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:20,859
...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

148
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:24,192
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

149
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:27,777
I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

150
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,903
As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

151
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,363
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

152
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:37,072
And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

153
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:41,117
...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

154
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,991
...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

155
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,952
King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

156
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:47,619
You know what King Benny does?

157
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:52,413
He waits. He waits 8 years...

158
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,955
...to get even with that prick.

159
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,414
He walks into a public bath house.

160
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:57,705
The guy's soaking in the tub.

161
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:02,916
King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

162
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,878
Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

163
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,921
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

164
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,129
Then he pulls out a gun...

165
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,422
...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

166
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,132
Then he says to the guy:

167
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:26,301
"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

168
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,135
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

169
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,471
Revenge!

170
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,347
Revenge!

171
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:40,473
Can I talk to you for a minute?

172
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:44,015
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

173
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,016
You're the butcher's kid...am I right?

174
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,185
What kind of a job are you looking for?

175
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,894
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

176
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,938
It doesn't matter?

177
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,272
Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

178
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,980
Who is everybody?

179
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,856
People from the neighborhood.

180
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,941
Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

181
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:09,109
They know you got jobs.

182
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,529
Sorry I wasted your time.

183
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,113
Hold on a sec!

184
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:22,823
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

185
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:24,824
-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

186
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,033
You'll be here?

187
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,992
I'm always here.

188
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:38,162
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

189
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:40,162
...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,957
In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

191
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,583
...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

192
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,124
It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

193
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,668
Come on, let's go! Right here.

194
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,378
Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

195
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,711
You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

196
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,003
Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

197
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,048
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

198
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:07,507
Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

199
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,383
This time they took my money!

200
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,050
You took the money from the boy?

201
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,300
The money they took is in the bag.

202
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,133
Let me have the bag.

203
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:13,967
Fuck you!

204
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,260
How about now?

205
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,510
All right, take it easy.

206
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:21,513
You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

207
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,638
Let me have the bag.

208
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,347
Now, go!

209
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:28,391
What about them?

210
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:29,224
You care?

211
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,100
Then go! Go! Run!

212
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,935
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

213
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,603
What you need?

214
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,103
My friends.

215
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:42,188
Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

216
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:45,023
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

217
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,898
Okay, get your friends.

218
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:52,691
Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

219
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,775
He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

220
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,528
...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

221
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,570
He didn't want that to happen to us.

222
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:02,029
You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

223
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:02,862
It pays.

224
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,237
A lot of things pay.

225
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,238
Not like this.

226
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,865
Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

227
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:13,492
Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

228
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:15,119
Good shot!

229
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,827
I found an art class for you to take.

230
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,494
You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

231
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,911
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

232
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,163
It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

233
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,079
Maybe, or it could be the first step.

234
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,373
First step to what?

235
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,582
Doing something with your life.

236
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:32,248
You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

237
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:33,166
You all can get out of here.

238
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,084
Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

239
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,252
Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

240
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,087
It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

241
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,336
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

242
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:46,962
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

243
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:50,630
He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,008
Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

245
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,342
Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

246
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:57,967
...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

247
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,843
It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

248
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:01,469
Well, for Michelangelo it was.

249
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,719
Michelangelo needed the job...

250
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,846
...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

251
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,305
And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

252
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,097
What's his father?

253
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,932
He was like a low-level...con guy.

254
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,641
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

255
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,474
Goats?

256
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,975
Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

257
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,810
-Chickens?
-Chickens?

258
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,185
You know what happened?

259
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,478
He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

260
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:25,519
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

261
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:27,603
Did he pay off the loans?

262
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:28,895
Every single one of them.

263
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,981
How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

264
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:33,647
It took him about 9 years.

265
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,065
9 years?!

266
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,399
That's a big ceiling!

267
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,525
I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

268
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:40,650
And he had a bum leg.

269
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,027
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

270
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,903
Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

271
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,195
You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

272
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,238
Sixteenth Chapel?

273
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,198
Who painted the other fifteen?

274
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:04,159
Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

275
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:07,077
...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

276
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:10,662
Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

277
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:14,414
...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

278
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:16,955
...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

279
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,581
...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

280
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,042
...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

281
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,835
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

282
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,378
...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

283
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:34,672
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

284
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,590
...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

285
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,424
...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

286
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,386
For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

287
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:50,762
They might as well have occurred in
another country...in another century.

288
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,513
Our attention was elsewhere.

289
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,556
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

290
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,223
...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

291
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,224
A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

292
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,726
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

293
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,604
Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

294
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,313
I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

295
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:15,020
John Reilly.

296
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:16,437
The little punk!

297
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,106
He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

298
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,605
You put him in the hospital.

299
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:24,275
He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

300
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,900
What are you? About 220, 230?

301
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:31,236
You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weighs?

302
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,153
80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

303
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,321
If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

304
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:41,948
Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

305
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:44,533
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

306
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:49,033
And I may not be in your division, but
I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

307
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,911
And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

308
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,120
...to pray over your body.

309
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,705
See you in church.

310
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,875
Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

311
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,711
It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

312
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:17,837
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

313
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,506
...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

314
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,507
Come on, Davy...take this chump out.
He got nothing!

315
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,466
Shut up!

316
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:26,842
Who's that?

317
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,175
His sister.

318
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,010
What happened to her?

319
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:33,343
I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

320
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:34,677
Worry about the game, come on.

321
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,386
Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

322
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,764
He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

323
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,056
Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

324
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,639
This is it...home run!

325
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:47,309
Easy, Mike.

326
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:50,058
What the fuck you
looking at, little dick?!

327
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,392
She's nothing but charm.

328
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,852
Come on, Davy!

329
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,352
You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

330
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,687
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

331
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:00,771
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

332
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:02,772
You could've helped her
across the street...

333
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:04,023
...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

334
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:05,273
You didn't have to throw the game.

335
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,690
Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

336
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:10,025
You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

337
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:12,734
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

338
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,151
He's no better than you.

339
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:16,777
He was today.

340
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,446
No. You let him be.

341
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:21,988
All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

342
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,155
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

343
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,698
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

344
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:30,033
And when it does, it's
going to hurt...bad.

345
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:33,742
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

346
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,284
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

347
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,994
Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

348
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:39,536
Do you see that street?

349
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:43,287
That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetizers.

350
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:46,789
Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

351
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,372
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

352
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,708
Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

353
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,208
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

354
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,419
All right, all right, calm down.

355
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,586
It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

356
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:02,170
Be funny, limp dick.

357
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,503
Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

358
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,338
You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

359
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,340
Thanks a lot, fat man.

360
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,841
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

361
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:14,926
But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

362
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,425
...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

363
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,427
...was more than the right thing to do.

364
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,556
Come on, let's go swimming.

365
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,974
The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

366
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,267
...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

367
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:38,393
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

368
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,769
a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

369
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,936
Can't you feel the breeze up here?

370
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,020
What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

371
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,103
The devil couldn't stand this heat.

372
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:47,479
Will you guys shut up, please?

373
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:48,771
I'm trying to get my burn.

374
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,271
It's 98 degrees!

375
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,023
-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

376
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:55,358
We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

377
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,734
I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

378
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,777
I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

379
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:06,487
We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air...choose.

380
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,155
Air is probably safer, Mike.

381
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,615
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

382
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,823
Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

383
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:16,241
Yours!

384
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:19,409
-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

385
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,244
-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

386
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:22,409
-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

387
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,577
-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

388
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:25,410
I'm not going.

389
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,577
-Why?
-It's too hot.

390
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:28,662
If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

391
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,123
Mustard and onions. No soda.

392
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,748
I know you!

393
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,583
I look like a lot of people.

394
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,750
The scam was simple.

395
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,335
I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

396
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:47,169
The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

397
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:50,505
This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

398
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:54,131
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

399
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:56,464
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

400
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:58,549
...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

401
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,425
I'm gonna need two napkins?

402
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:06,719
Pay my money, thief!

403
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:15,306
Wow! Ketchup!

404
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,722
I took it from him and ran!

405
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,975
I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

406
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:25,644
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

407
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:28,229
You gonna give me two?

408
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:40,691
You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

409
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:43,859
Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

410
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,360
They're heavier than shit!

411
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,694
Think we can push it, the three of us?

412
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:49,736
Push it where?

413
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,986
A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

414
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,821
...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

415
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:19,038
The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

416
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,039
I was on the other side of the street.

417
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,126
He was beat...but not beaten.

418
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,209
He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

419
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,961
Give it up.

420
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,134
What's wrong, Mikey?

421
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:50,260
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

422
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,927
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

423
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,096
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

424
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:00,638
-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

425
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:01,765
He still near?

426
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:04,308
I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

427
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:08,893
The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

428
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,976
We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

429
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,310
Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

430
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,437
We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

431
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:19,772
Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

432
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,522
To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

433
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,440
But, we would all pay a price.

434
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,150
It only took a minute...but
in that minute...everything changed.

435
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,401
Guys, I can't hold it!

436
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:33,276
-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

437
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,320
I can't hold it!

438
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:51,949
Stop! God, no! !

439
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:15,543
Damn!

440
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:24,922
Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

441
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:28,007
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

442
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,424
I think we just killed a man.

443
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,054
While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

444
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:42,637
...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

445
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,597
I'm sorry, dad.

446
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:46,306
'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

447
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,641
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

448
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:54,225
You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

449
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,017
Ma! Come look, Ma!

450
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,518
I don't know. Bastard!

451
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,185
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

452
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,855
Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

453
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:33,658
I hear you're short an altar boy.

454
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:38,702
You still remember what to do?

455
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,202
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

456
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,413
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

457
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,373
Get ready...we got 5 minutes
till show time.

458
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,876
I'm gonna miss this.

459
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,422
I'm gonna miss all of this.

460
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,881
I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

461
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:22,135
I could run...we all could run.

462
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:26,469
Disappear for a while.

463
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:28,847
Nobody's gonna come looking.

464
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,973
Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

465
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,268
You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

466
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:49,021
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

467
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,646
You've gotta face this.

468
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,149
I can't, Father.

469
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,234
I don't want to face it.

470
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,111
I'm too scared to face it.

471
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,237
I'm scared, too.

472
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:16,197
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

473
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:23,159
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

474
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:25,576
You understand?

475
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,913
Come on. We got an audience.

476
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:43,376
I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

477
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,753
Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

478
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:53,087
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

479
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:00,672
This is one of my favorites.

480
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,009
What is?

481
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,761
"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren...you do to me."

482
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:14,429
Come on.

483
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,098
We never saw the vendor as a man...

484
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:25,807
...not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood.

485
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:29,101
And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

486
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,811
We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

487
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,729
...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

488
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,564
We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

489
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:43,649
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

490
00:30:46,734 --> 00:30:50,068
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

491
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:53,069
...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

492
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:55,110
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

493
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:59,738
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

494
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:02,656
...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

495
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,115
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:05,990
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

497
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:10,117
Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

498
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:12,285
...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

499
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,451
...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

500
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:19,829
...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

501
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,580
Michael Sullivan.

502
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,040
The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

503
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,790
...for a period of no more than
18 months...

504
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,250
...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

505
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,252
And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

506
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,503
...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

507
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:38,212
...l would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

508
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,631
I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

509
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,298
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

510
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,132
Could you do me a favor?

511
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,674
What do you want? Name it.

512
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,050
The past couple of weeks...

513
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,803
...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

514
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:57,802
Could you watch over them for me?

515
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,846
I will.

516
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:03,347
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

517
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,222
You mean, you want me to lie?

518
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,891
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

519
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,185
Come on, let's go.

520
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,019
Be strong.

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,395
I will.

522
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:59,368
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

523
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,453
...housed in 5 separate units.

524
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:05,037
From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

525
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,538
...wanted it to resemble...

526
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,414
...some kind of nice
school or university.

527
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:14,791
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

528
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:19,877
We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

529
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:23,753
...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

530
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,754
...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

531
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,756
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

532
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:44,970
Hello, Carcaterra.

533
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,138
Toss your clothes on the floor.

534
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:49,930
Here?

535
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:52,348
Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

536
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,474
Now, lose the clothes.

537
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:55,349
In front of you?

538
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,102
Let's go, let's go!

539
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,484
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

540
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,109
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

541
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:24,485
I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

542
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,200
Everything.

543
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,866
You want me to stand here naked?

544
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,158
Now you're catching on.

545
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,703
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

546
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:54,622
Now, what?

547
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:58,458
Get dressed.

548
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:06,001
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

549
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:09,504
...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

550
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:14,005
Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

551
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,089
...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

552
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:17,422
...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

553
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:21,925
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

554
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:25,009
Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

555
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,218
...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

556
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:31,677
It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

557
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:34,014
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

558
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:36,931
A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

559
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,724
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

560
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,225
And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

561
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:22,323
What the fuck did you do that for?

562
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:25,157
You got close to me.

563
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,326
So?

564
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:28,575
It bothers me.

565
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:32,494
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

566
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:31,225
You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

567
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,312
You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

568
00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:37,060
...the day you walked in here.

569
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:43,314
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

570
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,480
There's nothing to see.

571
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,398
Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

572
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:51,858
Go on.

573
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,572
That go for me too?

574
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:05,571
No, it don't go for you.

575
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:10,449
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

576
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:15,243
You and me...we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

577
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:16,701
Maybe at dinner.

578
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:21,287
So...you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

579
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,080
I got to smell it.

580
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,413
You got to smell it...

581
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:32,750
That's good.

582
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,209
Where you going?

583
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:37,251
You said to get lunch.

584
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:41,294
You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

585
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:43,795
...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

586
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:45,963
You could smell it.

587
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:52,799
I'm not hungry.

588
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:56,092
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

589
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:58,928
You eat...because I'm
telling you to eat.

590
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,220
I'm still not hungry.

591
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,390
I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

592
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:14,433
Now, eat.

593
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:20,144
Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

594
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,560
Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

595
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:29,606
Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

596
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:33,814
You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

597
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:37,817
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

598
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:39,776
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

599
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:45,655
None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

600
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:48,947
You got that? Hey you....

601
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:52,073
There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

602
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:55,407
Come on now, that's good.

603
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,991
Show the boys how you follow my rules.

604
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,492
Rules! You understand?

605
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,327
Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

606
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,246
Your shift's over, Nokes.

607
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:10,996
I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

608
00:40:11,163 --> 00:40:13,289
...l gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

609
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:16,499
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

610
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,499
Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

611
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,667
This one, I'm staying in.

612
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,504
Don't fuck with me, boy.

613
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:32,713
No, Nokes...you fuck with me.

614
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:35,714
I'm asking you.

615
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:44,176
You're eating into my shift.

616
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,680
I'll get out of your way...for now.

617
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,472
I'll take what I can get.

618
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:57,682
You boys get off your knees.

619
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,645
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

620
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:17,523
I don't understand you boys.

621
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,816
I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

622
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:22,150
You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

623
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,610
I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

624
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:29,402
...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

625
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:32,779
And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

626
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:36,196
You had rules, and you had discipline.

627
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:42,324
Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

628
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:47,161
Right around there to the right.
There you go.

629
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:58,290
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

630
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,707
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

631
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,169
We understand each other?

632
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:12,169
Turn and face the wall.

633
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,842
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

634
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,717
...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

635
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,473
What do you want?

636
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:43,098
A blow job.

637
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Down on your knees.

638
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,480
Face the wall.

639
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:18,236
There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

640
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,946
I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

641
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,698
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

642
00:43:24,781 --> 00:43:26,282
...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

643
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:28,784
...and the end of my childhood.

644
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:41,953
Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

645
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:45,122
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

646
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,246
...all that had happened to me.

647
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:49,791
Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

648
00:43:49,957 --> 00:43:51,957
Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

649
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:54,126
John's mother came up once a month.

650
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,213
But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

651
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:05,464
So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

652
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:08,714
Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

653
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,008
If we did, reprisals would be severe.

654
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:28,391
You lost a few pounds.

655
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:30,724
It's not exactly home cooking.

656
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,391
Sit down.

657
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,559
This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

658
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,727
I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

659
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:43,353
I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

660
00:44:43,436 --> 00:44:45,187
...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

661
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,564
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

662
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,857
Anything at all?

663
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,608
You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

664
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,985
I appreciate it and all, but...

665
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:02,860
...l don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

666
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:31,081
I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

667
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,999
You have any friends not in jail?

668
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,542
Not as many as I would like.

669
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,375
What's he in for?

670
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,796
Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

671
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:48,254
And he's a good friend?

672
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:50,047
He's my best friend.

673
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:54,090
We hung out together.

674
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:57,133
We were close...
just like you and the guys.

675
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:10,930
We were both sent up here.

676
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,348
That's right. And it wasn't easy...

677
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,435
...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

678
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:29,563
This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

679
00:46:34,273 --> 00:46:36,690
Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

680
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:40,106
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

681
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:43,108
I've got to go, Father.

682
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:52,779
I'll see you in the Kitchen.

683
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:56,155
I'm counting on you.

684
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:00,783
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

685
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:05,659
Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

686
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,453
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

687
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,537
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,625
I didn't want to let him go.

689
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,501
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

690
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:37,672
A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

691
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,715
...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

692
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:42,215
There were other cries, too.

693
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,343
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

694
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:49,636
They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

695
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,428
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

696
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:57,055
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

697
00:47:57,555 --> 00:48:00,390
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

698
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:02,806
...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

699
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,398
I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

700
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:26,274
There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

701
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:31,110
This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

702
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,947
I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

703
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:40,113
Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

704
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:50,700
-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

705
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:53,702
No. You did a great
job on your book report.

706
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:58,787
You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

707
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:02,289
It's my favorite.
I like it more since I've been here.

708
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:03,705
Why is that?

709
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,915
It's like...he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

710
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,585
Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

711
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:15,627
And he learned from it.

712
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,128
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

713
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:24,588
-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

714
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,298
You got a copy of the book at home?

715
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,801
I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

716
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,133
No, it's not the same thing.

717
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:36,135
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

718
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:38,970
I've got something for you.

719
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:42,179
I thought you might like to have it.

720
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:44,137
Are you serious?

721
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:47,138
Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

722
00:49:47,764 --> 00:49:50,225
-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

723
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:52,724
You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

724
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:53,975
It's been a while.

725
00:49:55,184 --> 00:49:58,519
-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

726
00:49:59,686 --> 00:50:02,354
That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

727
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,605
You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

728
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:06,896
Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

729
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:08,816
...think the Count can
hold their attention.

730
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,315
He's got a shot.

731
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,441
Any particular section
I should read from?

732
00:50:13,192 --> 00:50:15,859
That's easy...the part where
he escapes from prison.

733
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:32,366
There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

734
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:44,412
It was only a game...just a touch
football game, nothing more.

735
00:50:45,246 --> 00:50:46,997
But a game I wish we
had never played.

736
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:51,873
Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

737
00:50:52,707 --> 00:50:54,875
Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

738
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:57,083
We had a 2 hour practice.

739
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,209
It didn't matter much.

740
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:02,585
We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

741
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:04,713
Who's the toughest guy here?

742
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:06,921
How do you mean, tough?

743
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,088
Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

744
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:11,256
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

745
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:16,716
Michael saw an opening...a chance
to bring the game to our level.

746
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:20,885
Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

747
00:51:21,718 --> 00:51:25,803
Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

748
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:29,722
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

749
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:32,140
I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

750
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:33,931
...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

751
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,766
Why?

752
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,099
Look man...

753
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,099
...guards stay clear of me, all right?

754
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:39,766
They stay back and let me do my time.

755
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,935
If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

756
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,728
...they just might change my cushion.

757
00:51:43,936 --> 00:51:47,103
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

758
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,604
You do every day.

759
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:52,605
-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

760
00:51:55,773 --> 00:51:58,815
They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

761
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,233
You're just an animal to them.

762
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,067
-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

763
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:06,944
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

764
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:08,987
Then why, white boy, why?

765
00:52:09,155 --> 00:52:13,530
To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

766
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,532
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

767
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,867
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:21,201
I call heads.

769
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:26,328
He called heads.
It is a head.

770
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:29,204
Let's go.

771
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:42,793
You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

772
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:55,505
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

773
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,174
We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

774
00:52:59,674 --> 00:53:00,840
This shit feels good.

775
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:08,844
Fuck!

776
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:17,264
Get the fuck off me!

777
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,352
Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

778
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:37,022
For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

779
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,564
...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

780
00:53:39,731 --> 00:53:41,857
...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

781
00:53:42,483 --> 00:53:45,274
...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

782
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:49,360
For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

783
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,701
Rizzo! Rizzo!

784
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:25,415
Rizzo...Rizzo.

785
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:30,292
Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

786
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:36,545
For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

787
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:41,547
It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

788
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:46,631
I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

789
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:51,468
Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain...suffering his own demons.

790
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,219
Rizzo was there, too.

791
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:57,927
I had lost any sense of time.

792
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:39,945
I thought you'd never wake up.

793
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:42,613
I thought I'd never want to.

794
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:46,155
John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

795
00:55:47,698 --> 00:55:51,367
How are they?
They're alive.

796
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:54,160
Who isn't?

797
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:57,076
Rizzo.

798
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:00,953
They killed him?

799
00:56:02,953 --> 00:56:07,164
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

800
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:13,500
Rizzo was dead because of us.

801
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,917
We made him think that going
up against the guards...

802
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,418
...in a meaningless football game...

803
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:22,169
...had some value...that it would
give us a reason to go on.

804
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:25,047
Once again, we were wrong.

805
00:56:28,214 --> 00:56:29,548
Did they give you
your release date yet?

806
00:56:29,714 --> 00:56:31,048
Nokes had a letter from the warden.

807
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:33,759
Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up....

808
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:35,759
When do you figure?

809
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,760
End of spring, early
summer or something.

810
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:42,385
I wish we were coming with you.

811
00:56:43,427 --> 00:56:45,763
It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

812
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:50,389
No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

813
00:56:52,432 --> 00:56:55,767
When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

814
00:56:55,975 --> 00:56:57,392
Shave a month or two off.

815
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:00,226
-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

816
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:03,645
Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

817
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:05,896
I don't want anybody to know.

818
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:10,397
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

819
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,898
...not my mother. Nobody.

820
00:57:14,523 --> 00:57:16,066
I don't either.

821
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:18,399
I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

822
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:21,778
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

823
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:25,487
Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

824
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,739
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

825
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:35,073
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

826
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:38,617
So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

827
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:40,951
The truth stays with us.

828
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,953
I want to be able to sleep one night...

829
00:57:47,494 --> 00:57:51,080
...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

830
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,790
If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

831
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,253
Someday, John, I promise.

832
00:58:20,926 --> 00:58:24,425
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

833
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:27,177
I was given four copies
of my release form.

834
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:29,845
The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

835
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:33,888
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

836
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:36,556
...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

837
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,391
You should be asleep.

838
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:44,684
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

839
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,686
I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

840
00:58:49,853 --> 00:58:51,687
I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

841
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,312
I'm not working those kind of hours.

842
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:54,854
Yeah, did you put in for it?

843
00:58:55,354 --> 00:58:56,314
I put in for it!

844
00:58:56,356 --> 00:58:58,064
Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

845
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,899
I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

846
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:05,026
A part of all of us was
left there that night.

847
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:08,402
That night will never be
removed from my mind.

848
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:13,529
The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

849
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:17,197
My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

850
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,632
At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

851
01:00:07,632 --> 01:00:10,718
The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names.

852
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:13,761
They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

853
01:00:13,845 --> 01:00:15,345
They were also its deadliest.

854
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:20,430
The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

855
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,097
He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

856
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,599
He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

857
01:00:27,182 --> 01:00:30,769
He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

858
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,061
He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

859
01:00:36,353 --> 01:00:38,354
The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

860
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:40,688
...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

861
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:45,399
In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

862
01:00:45,564 --> 01:00:48,691
...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

863
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,819
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

864
01:00:54,903 --> 01:00:58,569
-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

865
01:00:58,694 --> 01:01:00,362
It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get....

866
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:01,738
They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

867
01:01:02,238 --> 01:01:05,072
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

868
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:07,950
He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

869
01:01:09,575 --> 01:01:11,784
Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

870
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,201
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

871
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:19,704
Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

872
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:24,455
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

873
01:01:24,622 --> 01:01:28,123
...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

874
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,541
Sure thing.

875
01:01:36,584 --> 01:01:39,503
The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

876
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:43,504
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

877
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:45,255
You get my meaning?

878
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,430
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

879
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:37,400
Can I help you with something, chief?

880
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:43,654
Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

881
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:33,921
I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

882
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:38,090
...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

883
01:03:39,218 --> 01:03:40,218
Is that okay by you?

884
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:45,677
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

885
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:58,599
Motherfucker.

886
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,693
That's him.

887
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:28,402
Are you fucking kidding me?

888
01:04:31,945 --> 01:04:32,653
Bingo!

889
01:04:58,373 --> 01:04:59,497
This is amazing.

890
01:04:59,665 --> 01:05:02,333
Hello...it's been a long time!

891
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,167
Who the fuck are you guys?

892
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:11,127
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

893
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:14,713
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

894
01:05:16,547 --> 01:05:18,964
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

895
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:21,841
You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

896
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:24,507
...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

897
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:26,134
That seems like a waste.

898
01:05:26,342 --> 01:05:28,300
I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

899
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,217
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

900
01:05:36,013 --> 01:05:37,806
I can see how he might forget us.

901
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:41,389
You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

902
01:05:41,556 --> 01:05:43,682
It's a little harder for us to forget.

903
01:05:44,057 --> 01:05:46,309
You gave us so much more to remember.

904
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:51,060
You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

905
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,812
Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

906
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:08,191
Yeah, that's right.

907
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:16,321
That was a long time ago.

908
01:06:19,862 --> 01:06:20,614
So how you been?

909
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:23,114
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

910
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:25,740
So, what do you want?

911
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:29,909
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

912
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:36,995
You ordered the meat loaf.

913
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:41,622
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

914
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:43,746
You fucked up.

915
01:06:57,545 --> 01:07:01,879
Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

916
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:08,091
All of you...scared shitless.
But l...

917
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:13,467
...l tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

918
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:17,136
I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

919
01:07:17,302 --> 01:07:18,803
...fucking and beating up little boys.

920
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:21,262
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

921
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:23,179
You're gonna burn in hell.

922
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:24,303
Yeah, after you.

923
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:31,267
Did that hurt, Nokes?

924
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:13,033
Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

925
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:26,955
John Reilly, how do you plead?

926
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,497
Not guilty, Your Honor.

927
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,332
Thomas Marcano?

928
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:33,000
Not guilty, Your Honor.

929
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:37,251
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

930
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:41,878
In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

931
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:45,379
...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

932
01:08:45,546 --> 01:08:47,546
...but the relationship
had been altered.

933
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:52,883
We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

934
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:55,090
...that would force us to
deal with the past.

935
01:09:08,597 --> 01:09:11,930
One down, Shakes, one down.

936
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:14,763
One what?

937
01:09:17,016 --> 01:09:20,350
One Sean Nokes.

938
01:09:21,518 --> 01:09:22,393
Nokes?

939
01:09:30,687 --> 01:09:31,937
At the time of Nokes' shooting,

940
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:34,938
Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

941
01:09:35,732 --> 01:09:38,484
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

942
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:40,275
Then, he hung up.

943
01:09:44,818 --> 01:09:46,528
-So, what did they say?
-What?

944
01:09:46,778 --> 01:09:48,028
John and Tommy, what'd they say?

945
01:09:48,196 --> 01:09:49,529
It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

946
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:52,447
Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

947
01:09:54,363 --> 01:09:55,698
-John did.
-Yeah?

948
01:09:56,573 --> 01:09:57,573
What did he say?

949
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:01,034
He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

950
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,577
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

951
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,244
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

952
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:12,162
Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

953
01:10:12,413 --> 01:10:14,789
-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

954
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,414
Perfect for what?

955
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,292
Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

956
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:23,459
-Me?
-Yeah.

957
01:10:23,793 --> 01:10:27,460
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

958
01:10:27,627 --> 01:10:28,585
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

959
01:10:33,631 --> 01:10:34,463
Get some coffee?

960
01:10:35,506 --> 01:10:36,465
Let's take a walk.

961
01:10:47,468 --> 01:10:49,301
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

962
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:52,179
What, are you fucking nuts?

963
01:10:53,388 --> 01:10:54,054
Just hear me out.

964
01:10:54,429 --> 01:10:57,223
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

965
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:58,723
I'm not taking this case to win.

966
01:11:00,264 --> 01:11:01,932
I'm taking this case to lose.

967
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,183
What does that mean?

968
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,185
It means it's payback time.

969
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:13,729
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

970
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,854
It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but...here it is.

971
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:21,981
And you and l, we can finish it.

972
01:11:22,857 --> 01:11:24,108
Finish what, Mikey?

973
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,317
You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

974
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,236
I don't know...ten years ago.

975
01:11:33,403 --> 01:11:35,737
You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

976
01:11:36,862 --> 01:11:41,073
I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

977
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,782
Payback time.

978
01:11:46,616 --> 01:11:47,950
It's our time.

979
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:49,993
What are you saying, Mike?

980
01:11:50,952 --> 01:11:53,744
I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

981
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:57,538
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

982
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:00,746
Let's walk.

983
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:06,082
So, I asked for the case.

984
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:08,126
I told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused...

985
01:12:08,293 --> 01:12:10,292
...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

986
01:12:10,585 --> 01:12:11,458
They bought it.

987
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:14,419
And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

988
01:12:14,919 --> 01:12:17,712
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

989
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:20,337
We were never at Wilkinson's.

990
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,466
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

991
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:28,757
Bring it all down.

992
01:12:29,593 --> 01:12:32,759
Adam Styler, plain-clothes cop,
works narcotics in Queens.

993
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:36,553
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

994
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:38,387
Other personal information there.

995
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,055
Henry Addison now works for the Mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

996
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:44,264
He's a Community Outreach
Director in Brooklyn.

997
01:12:44,597 --> 01:12:48,558
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

998
01:12:48,808 --> 01:12:51,976
Ralph Ferguson works in a Social
Service agency in Long Island.

999
01:12:52,226 --> 01:12:53,643
How long have you been
working on this, Mike?

1000
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:55,935
He's recently divorced, got
one child, and on weekends...

1001
01:12:56,227 --> 01:12:57,769
...teaches Catholic Sunday school.

1002
01:12:58,227 --> 01:12:59,561
Well, he seems clean then, right?

1003
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,645
That's exactly why I
want the piece of shit.

1004
01:13:02,313 --> 01:13:05,064
The plan is to call Ferguson
in as a character witness.

1005
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:07,398
Get him talking about his
best friend, Sean Nokes.

1006
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:11,567
Once I got him on the stand, I'm
gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

1007
01:13:12,442 --> 01:13:16,652
Mike, are you sure you
want to go this way?

1008
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:22,069
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

1009
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,073
Do you still sleep with the light on?

1010
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:34,867
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

1011
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:36,869
No, it'll play better in
court if they don't know.

1012
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:53,042
The 'not guilty' verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question.

1013
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,514
Danny Snyder was to remain as
Tommy and John's attorney.

1014
01:13:58,139 --> 01:13:59,973
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen...

1015
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:01,974
...to deliver information and keep quiet.

1016
01:14:02,559 --> 01:14:04,518
Both were skills the Neighborhood
had in abundance.

1017
01:14:05,352 --> 01:14:07,352
We'd set up a simple
method of communication.

1018
01:14:07,894 --> 01:14:10,352
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work...

1019
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,688
...for me to call my non-existent
girlfriend, "Gloria".

1020
01:14:13,395 --> 01:14:16,730
If I needed to get word to Michael, I'd
have someone from the neighborhood...

1021
01:14:16,898 --> 01:14:18,564
...pick up an early edition
of the New York Times...

1022
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,899
...write the word "Edmund" in the upper
right hand corner of the Metro section...

1023
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:23,901
...and drop it in front
of Michael's apartment.

1024
01:14:29,276 --> 01:14:30,068
For this plan to succeed...

1025
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:33,152
...we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted.

1026
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:35,778
The plan depended on
keeping Michael alive...

1027
01:14:36,153 --> 01:14:38,365
...which meant that word had to get
to John and Tommy's killing crew...

1028
01:14:38,447 --> 01:14:39,740
...that he was not an open target.

1029
01:14:40,281 --> 01:14:43,616
After this night, Michael would
not be available to any of us.

1030
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:46,033
The only time we would see
him would be in court.

1031
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:48,243
-That's it?
-Not quite.

1032
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:51,953
We've got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify.

1033
01:14:52,203 --> 01:14:53,077
Gotta get that number down.

1034
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,719
-I'll talk to King Benny.
-Good.

1035
01:14:57,053 --> 01:15:00,556
I can handle two, but...
you gotta get us one for our side.

1036
01:15:01,057 --> 01:15:03,014
-One of what?
-One witness.

1037
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:06,517
A witness who'll put John & Tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder.

1038
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,892
A witness they can't touch.

1039
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:11,851
Don't they have a name for that?

1040
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,144
A judge would call it perjury.

1041
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:17,020
And what are we calling it?

1042
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:18,522
A favor.

1043
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:22,850
Get up!

1044
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,151
-Tony!
-Yeah, King?

1045
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:30,361
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

1046
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:32,278
Who? Danny Snyder, the lawyer?

1047
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,111
You know more than one Danny Snyder?

1048
01:15:35,487 --> 01:15:36,821
Bring me the one you know.

1049
01:15:55,829 --> 01:16:00,163
I can't do this now, you gotta know that.
It's been a long time for me.

1050
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:05,999
You need somebody younger, you know.
Somebody like I used to be.

1051
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07,709
Younger is not better.

1052
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:12,002
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

1053
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,045
Yeah, I'm lucky I can
find the courthouse.

1054
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:19,339
I had only four cases last year.
You know how many I won?

1055
01:16:20,213 --> 01:16:22,880
None. That's how many. None.

1056
01:16:24,174 --> 01:16:27,257
In two of them, I think the...

1057
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:29,092
...the jury blamed me personally.

1058
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:30,676
They must've been innocent.

1059
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:35,093
It's tough to get
innocent men off a rap.

1060
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,720
I wasn't even planning on
going to court with this one.

1061
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:40,846
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could and walk away.

1062
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,765
I wasn't planning on
taking this to trial, sir.

1063
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:46,099
Well, your plans have been changed.

1064
01:16:46,557 --> 01:16:50,476
Well, I am afraid that I'll make a
mistake and say the wrong thing...

1065
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:55,768
...make a wrong turn somewhere.
And you don't want to take that risk.

1066
01:16:56,102 --> 01:16:57,436
Life is risk.

1067
01:16:57,728 --> 01:16:58,603
I'm sorry.

1068
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,270
Life is risk.

1069
01:17:00,854 --> 01:17:01,855
Life is a risk?

1070
01:17:06,523 --> 01:17:08,024
I haven't been in here before.

1071
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:11,567
What do you need me to do?

1072
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:16,068
You're gonna be given the
answers and the questions.

1073
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:20,696
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1074
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:23,238
Is it in English?

1075
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,324
Just don't drift, don't drink,
and don't lose.

1076
01:17:27,948 --> 01:17:29,074
What if I do lose?

1077
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:31,575
Then you'll go down for the dirt nap.

1078
01:17:32,784 --> 01:17:34,576
Never heard that expression before.

1079
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:37,619
Dirt nap.

1080
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:43,955
I'm not really cut out for this anymore.
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus...

1081
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:47,289
...and sues, I like that.

1082
01:17:47,457 --> 01:17:51,249
Some lady slips in a supermarket...
I'm with her.

1083
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,916
The discussion is over.

1084
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:57,001
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

1085
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,336
It was once.

1086
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,003
Before you let the drink lead.

1087
01:18:02,504 --> 01:18:06,337
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1088
01:18:07,005 --> 01:18:09,547
You've got nothing to lose...
just like the rest of us.

1089
01:18:10,465 --> 01:18:13,341
I don't want to be a burden
to you, but l...

1090
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:18,553
...along with my alcohol problem,
I have a slight drug problem.

1091
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:19,718
I mean, nothing big.

1092
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:21,303
Go away.

1093
01:18:32,348 --> 01:18:33,974
Within days of Michael taking the case...

1094
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:36,226
...the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.

1095
01:18:36,851 --> 01:18:40,059
The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

1096
01:18:40,519 --> 01:18:43,852
"Traitor" and "gutter rat" were
heard up and down the avenue.

1097
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,187
But there was never to be
a death move against him.

1098
01:18:46,813 --> 01:18:50,647
The hit on Michael Sullivan, if there was
one, could only come from King Benny.

1099
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,523
The underground word...
the only one that mattered...

1100
01:18:53,731 --> 01:18:56,066
...had spread through the streets with
the speed of a late-night bullet.

1101
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,069
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

1102
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:08,029
"Sleepers" was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.

1103
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:20,326
You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

1104
01:19:20,742 --> 01:19:23,743
Need your help, fat man.
Need a big favor.

1105
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:24,952
I'll be outside.

1106
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:26,452
King Benny been to see you?

1107
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,787
Oh, my goodness!

1108
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,496
What a fucking thing we put together!

1109
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:35,123
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1110
01:19:35,456 --> 01:19:37,957
Fucking paper boy,
making like Dick Tracy.

1111
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:41,626
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing!

1112
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:45,710
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1113
01:19:46,252 --> 01:19:48,461
Fucking General Custer has
a better shot at a walk!

1114
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:50,380
There's no connection
with the guard and us.

1115
01:19:50,545 --> 01:19:52,422
The cops think it's a
drug-related homicide.

1116
01:19:52,589 --> 01:19:54,423
It's just we need you to
pull a few strings, fat man.

1117
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,756
You know, if you get caught on this,
you're looking straight at serious.

1118
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:00,091
I'm talking real jail.
The big house....

1119
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:09,386
They are not good boys any more.

1120
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:13,555
They're killers now.
Cold as stone.

1121
01:20:15,264 --> 01:20:16,347
I know.

1122
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:19,850
I know what they were, and I know
what they are, and it's not about that.

1123
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:23,641
It's not worth it, throwing
away life just to get even.

1124
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,102
You and the lawyer have
a chance to get out.

1125
01:20:27,394 --> 01:20:28,436
To get out the right way.

1126
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:31,103
There's no choice...not for us.

1127
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,273
On occasion, I'd have
dinner with Carol.

1128
01:20:37,814 --> 01:20:41,149
She still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the South Bronx.

1129
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:44,359
Her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years.

1130
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:48,487
Whenever we went out as a group, Carol
would walk between Michael and John...

1131
01:20:48,943 --> 01:20:49,904
...grasping their arms...

1132
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,446
...in step between the lawyer
and the killer.

1133
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:57,155
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1134
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,114
Would you settle for a
couple of beers, Carol?

1135
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,783
If that's your best offer.

1136
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:06,786
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1137
01:21:08,161 --> 01:21:08,993
Deal.

1138
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:16,038
You look tired.

1139
01:21:16,579 --> 01:21:17,580
Thank you.

1140
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,623
They don't give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours?

1141
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:26,667
So, how much do you know?

1142
01:21:28,044 --> 01:21:29,336
Just what the neighborhood says.

1143
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,211
And what I read in papers like yours.

1144
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:34,544
What does the neighborhood say?

1145
01:21:35,087 --> 01:21:36,671
That they're gonna put
Johnny and Tommy away.

1146
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:39,004
That their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

1147
01:21:39,214 --> 01:21:40,173
You believe that?

1148
01:21:40,589 --> 01:21:41,923
It's hard not to, Shakes.

1149
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,801
Unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1150
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:49,134
-He did take the case.
-What else is there to say?

1151
01:21:52,177 --> 01:21:53,261
You know Michael very well...

1152
01:21:54,303 --> 01:21:55,969
...maybe even better than I do.

1153
01:21:56,221 --> 01:21:58,805
Yeah, I thought I did.
Now, I don't know.

1154
01:21:59,012 --> 01:22:00,679
-You do know.
-I don't know!

1155
01:22:01,555 --> 01:22:03,139
He went in there, and
he asked for the case.

1156
01:22:03,349 --> 01:22:05,432
Now, you tell me, what the
hell kind of friend is that?

1157
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,391
The best kind.

1158
01:22:08,809 --> 01:22:10,851
The kind who'll throw away
everything to help his friends.

1159
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:16,187
What are you telling me, Shakes?

1160
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:21,522
You know this neighborhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1161
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:23,523
Why should this be any different?

1162
01:22:30,108 --> 01:22:31,067
I'm hungry.

1163
01:22:32,317 --> 01:22:33,609
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1164
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:39,028
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1165
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:42,114
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1166
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:45,781
And he just...he shut down.

1167
01:22:46,323 --> 01:22:49,909
Couldn't touch him...
couldn't even breathe on him.

1168
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:53,951
I thought it was me.

1169
01:22:56,369 --> 01:22:58,245
After a while, it just
gets easier to let it go.

1170
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,538
Do you still love him?

1171
01:23:00,996 --> 01:23:02,163
I don't think about it, Shakes.

1172
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:06,164
If I did, I'd say 'yes.'

1173
01:23:07,165 --> 01:23:08,041
But you're with John now.

1174
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:12,958
Yeah...as much as
anybody can be with John.

1175
01:23:15,084 --> 01:23:17,044
The man I know is not
the boy you remember.

1176
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:18,420
None of us are.

1177
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,421
But there's something
special about John.

1178
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:25,423
You just have to look a
little harder to see it.

1179
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,259
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1180
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:34,633
-Me?
-Yeah.

1181
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:37,300
Cause you were Mikey's girl.

1182
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:41,096
He got to you first.

1183
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:42,721
And after Mikey?

1184
01:23:43,722 --> 01:23:44,722
I think it was Tommy's turn.

1185
01:23:45,346 --> 01:23:47,013
Fuck you!

1186
01:23:50,306 --> 01:23:51,347
Because...

1187
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:54,558
...l didn't think you'd say 'yes.'

1188
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:02,769
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1189
01:24:04,437 --> 01:24:05,396
You were wrong.

1190
01:24:12,773 --> 01:24:13,940
What? Go ahead and say it.

1191
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:19,736
You work at Social Services, you
got files. You got access to files.

1192
01:24:20,485 --> 01:24:22,611
And from time to time, we're
gonna need some information.

1193
01:24:22,777 --> 01:24:23,862
Yeah, sure...whatever...

1194
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:26,780
Wait. What?

1195
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,280
Well, what do you want?
You want information?

1196
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,489
You want me to get the files?
I'll get the files!

1197
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:33,157
What do you want?

1198
01:24:39,535 --> 01:24:40,659
You still visit John?

1199
01:24:41,494 --> 01:24:43,368
Yeah, once a week for about an hour.

1200
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,578
-Good.
-Good?

1201
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:48,495
Yeah, good. Just don't tell
him that you've seen me.

1202
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:50,331
Just don't tell him anything.

1203
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:52,999
I mean, the more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

1204
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:56,374
Shakes, what is this about?

1205
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:01,917
You want a Rolls Royce?
You don't come here.

1206
01:25:02,252 --> 01:25:04,711
You go to England or wherever
the fuck they make it.

1207
01:25:05,337 --> 01:25:07,378
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1208
01:25:07,628 --> 01:25:09,379
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1209
01:25:09,755 --> 01:25:13,548
But if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere, or...

1210
01:25:13,883 --> 01:25:17,549
...some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about, there's only one place to go.

1211
01:25:18,092 --> 01:25:22,217
Right here, Hell's Kitchen!
It is the lost and found of shit!

1212
01:25:22,843 --> 01:25:26,093
They lose it and we find it!
Forget about it, man.

1213
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:31,056
Now, you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1214
01:25:32,056 --> 01:25:33,766
Two others changed their minds.

1215
01:25:34,722 --> 01:25:37,057
-Which two?
-The suits at the bar.

1216
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:41,018
So that still leaves the
couple in the booth?

1217
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:42,517
For now.

1218
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:45,726
Everything else falling into place?

1219
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:51,106
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1220
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:52,772
I know.

1221
01:25:57,983 --> 01:25:59,399
When you were sent away,

1222
01:26:00,316 --> 01:26:03,234
I was always sorry I
couldn't do more for you.

1223
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,988
I didn't know you liked
pigeons so much.

1224
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:16,406
I like anything that don't talk.

1225
01:26:18,405 --> 01:26:21,240
Michael's vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear.

1226
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:22,950
He was aiming for guilty...

1227
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,867
...a charge of guilty against
the Wilkinson Home for Boys...

1228
01:26:25,951 --> 01:26:29,536
...against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison, and Ralph Ferguson.

1229
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:33,330
I will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that.

1230
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:36,081
I will place them at
the scene of the crime.

1231
01:26:36,248 --> 01:26:38,248
I will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm...

1232
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:40,748
...that they were there
on that deadly night.

1233
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:45,624
I will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room...

1234
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:49,210
...and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

1235
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:51,336
I'm sure you all know what that means...

1236
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:53,796
...since you probably watch
as much television as I do.

1237
01:26:56,838 --> 01:27:00,631
John...John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1238
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:04,132
...are two innocent pawns,
quickly arrested and just...

1239
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:07,635
...as quickly prosecuted on the...

1240
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:10,010
...slightest threads of evidence.

1241
01:27:10,302 --> 01:27:12,970
Look on the bright side, he
seems to know their names.

1242
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:14,971
I don't have to tell you. You and I
know how these things work.

1243
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:26,184
It's nice when you come around.

1244
01:27:29,726 --> 01:27:31,394
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty!

1245
01:27:32,435 --> 01:27:33,269
Take it.

1246
01:27:33,352 --> 01:27:34,687
No, no, she'll do it.

1247
01:27:44,107 --> 01:27:44,858
How's work?

1248
01:27:47,608 --> 01:27:48,567
I'm still there.

1249
01:27:53,193 --> 01:27:54,193
You know, Pop, l...

1250
01:27:56,279 --> 01:27:57,320
...l went down to the courthouse.

1251
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:00,613
You know, I saw John and Tommy.

1252
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:03,739
I started thinking back
to when we were young....

1253
01:28:03,824 --> 01:28:04,741
Where's the chicken?

1254
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:09,992
So...?

1255
01:28:11,742 --> 01:28:14,743
Nothing. I was just thinking.

1256
01:28:16,578 --> 01:28:17,995
You're doing good, right?

1257
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:21,246
Yeah. Doing good.

1258
01:28:21,622 --> 01:28:22,538
Good.

1259
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,431
What the hell do these things do?

1260
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:08,097
They're for praying.

1261
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:09,599
Look at all this shit!

1262
01:29:09,681 --> 01:29:12,183
What, does your mother think you're
in the fucking army or something?

1263
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,142
Ain't none of it on the approved list.

1264
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:15,934
I'm sure your Mommy
got a copy of that list.

1265
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,644
My mother can't speak English that well.

1266
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:20,978
Don't blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid, all right?

1267
01:29:26,314 --> 01:29:27,482
When are you gonna let us hear you pray?

1268
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:40,612
Maybe he needs something to pray for.

1269
01:29:40,944 --> 01:29:42,612
Put your hands on the table
and lay them flat.

1270
01:29:44,987 --> 01:29:45,780
Spread your legs.

1271
01:29:47,489 --> 01:29:49,489
Now start thinking up some prayers.

1272
01:29:59,203 --> 01:30:00,076
We don't hear no praying.

1273
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:02,994
You better start, or Styler might
lose his baton up your ass.

1274
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,829
Blessed art thou among women...

1275
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:06,705
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus....

1276
01:30:06,788 --> 01:30:08,079
Pray nice and loud!

1277
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:13,500
Fucker, pray! Come on, now!

1278
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:18,501
-Louder.
-Hail Mary...

1279
01:30:19,418 --> 01:30:20,919
Louder, fucker!

1280
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:24,712
Pray like you're in fucking church!

1281
01:30:35,883 --> 01:30:37,842
Sorry I'm late.
I lost all track of time.

1282
01:30:38,342 --> 01:30:41,010
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

1283
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:43,177
But I want you to come along.
So, you want to just go...

1284
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:47,262
-Where are we going?
-To his place.

1285
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:49,221
-Where is it?
-It's in the rectory.

1286
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:50,764
No. Shakes!

1287
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,682
-Just trust me.
-I can't.

1288
01:31:00,227 --> 01:31:01,351
How was court today?

1289
01:31:02,601 --> 01:31:06,852
Like the first round of a fight...
everybody just feeling each other out.

1290
01:31:08,603 --> 01:31:09,603
How did the boys look?

1291
01:31:10,605 --> 01:31:11,939
Like they wished they
were someplace else.

1292
01:31:14,273 --> 01:31:16,565
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

1293
01:31:19,108 --> 01:31:20,442
It's not too late, Father.

1294
01:31:23,276 --> 01:31:25,693
We still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep...

1295
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:27,944
...one more chance.

1296
01:31:30,904 --> 01:31:32,029
Is that chance legal?

1297
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:35,657
Last chances never are.

1298
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:37,656
King Benny behind this?

1299
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:42,075
He's in on it, but...
he's not calling the shots.

1300
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,077
Who is?

1301
01:31:45,118 --> 01:31:45,785
Michael.

1302
01:31:47,786 --> 01:31:49,036
I should've smelled it.

1303
01:31:50,121 --> 01:31:52,413
The minute he went for the case,
I should've figured something was up.

1304
01:31:52,956 --> 01:31:54,164
It's a good plan.

1305
01:31:54,664 --> 01:31:57,790
Michael's got it all covered...
just about every base you look at.

1306
01:31:58,624 --> 01:31:59,623
He's got it covered.

1307
01:31:59,874 --> 01:32:00,833
Not every base.

1308
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:03,959
You're short something, or else
you wouldn't be here.

1309
01:32:04,791 --> 01:32:06,459
You don't shit a shitter, right?

1310
01:32:06,669 --> 01:32:07,627
That's right.

1311
01:32:10,337 --> 01:32:11,045
So, what is it?

1312
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:12,463
Where do you come up short?

1313
01:32:15,046 --> 01:32:15,880
Witness.

1314
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:19,340
We need somebody
to take the stand and say...

1315
01:32:19,424 --> 01:32:21,757
...they were with John and
Tommy on the night of the murder.

1316
01:32:21,924 --> 01:32:23,841
So, you figured if you had a
priest, it would be perfect?

1317
01:32:25,092 --> 01:32:26,593
Not just any priest.

1318
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:47,476
You're asking me...
you're asking me to lie.

1319
01:32:48,811 --> 01:32:51,687
You're asking me to swear
to God and then lie.

1320
01:32:52,979 --> 01:32:54,938
I'm asking you to save two of your boys.

1321
01:33:00,565 --> 01:33:03,899
-Did they kill that guard?
-Yes.

1322
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:08,985
So what they said is true?
They walked in and they killed him?

1323
01:33:09,986 --> 01:33:10,610
Yes.

1324
01:33:12,237 --> 01:33:14,653
They killed him exactly like that.

1325
01:33:18,904 --> 01:33:19,905
I think I need a drink.

1326
01:33:22,532 --> 01:33:23,532
Anyone want a drink?

1327
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,790
This is some favor you're asking me.

1328
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:46,291
We know that.

1329
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:48,959
No, I don't think you do know.

1330
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,918
You said, if there was ever
anything really important...

1331
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,710
...l could come to you, ask you.

1332
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:58,587
I was thinking more along
the lines of Yankee tickets.

1333
01:34:01,048 --> 01:34:05,507
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

1334
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:10,299
What about the life that was taken,
Shakes? What's that worth?

1335
01:34:10,925 --> 01:34:13,300
To me? Nothing.

1336
01:34:16,093 --> 01:34:18,597
Why not?
Tell me.

1337
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:29,642
He was a guard at Wilkinsons.

1338
01:34:33,392 --> 01:34:34,185
All right.

1339
01:34:34,726 --> 01:34:38,103
If Father Bobby was gonna be involved, he
deserved to know what he's getting into.

1340
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:41,979
If he wasn't, I trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room.

1341
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:45,440
I thought that Carol
needed to know, as well.

1342
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,107
Jesus Christ, we were just boys.
We were not tough.

1343
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:54,234
They held us down.

1344
01:34:58,154 --> 01:35:01,820
I told him about the torture,
the beatings, and the rapes.

1345
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:04,656
I told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed...

1346
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:07,156
...to Father Bobby's God
for help that never came.

1347
01:35:07,949 --> 01:35:09,282
I told them everything.

1348
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:12,367
We can't fight anymore.
They just took it all.

1349
01:35:13,825 --> 01:35:18,119
John used to wail at night, hear
it all the way down the hall.

1350
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:23,622
You know he wanted to be a priest,
John wanted to be a priest.

1351
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:31,998
Then he pulls his pants down.
I didn't even know what a blow job was.

1352
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:39,211
I just blacked out what I could.
It was like I couldn't even breathe.

1353
01:35:41,003 --> 01:35:43,462
Then...l started to choke.

1354
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:45,963
He was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head.

1355
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,964
Then I blacked out.

1356
01:35:52,632 --> 01:35:57,010
But I do remember when, for fun,
they'd take us down in the basement...

1357
01:35:58,218 --> 01:36:00,344
...tie two or three of us together...

1358
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:04,095
...and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked'em.

1359
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,102
I got a decision to make.

1360
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:27,853
I only pray it's the right one.

1361
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:33,274
It will be, Father...
whichever way you go.

1362
01:36:39,234 --> 01:36:40,192
Good night.

1363
01:36:49,028 --> 01:36:51,447
So, you were sitting down,
you were having dinner...

1364
01:36:52,781 --> 01:36:54,448
...and two men entered
McHale's, correct?

1365
01:36:55,366 --> 01:36:58,615
Did you see them as they approached
the table where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

1366
01:36:58,825 --> 01:37:00,158
I noticed it, yes.

1367
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:02,159
Did you hear what
was said between them?

1368
01:37:03,995 --> 01:37:06,119
-Did you see them pull out their guns?
-No.

1369
01:37:06,369 --> 01:37:09,996
-Did you hear the shots?
-Yes, I heard the shots.

1370
01:37:10,204 --> 01:37:14,330
And what did they do? What was
their behavior after the shooting?

1371
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:18,083
They walked out of McHale's
as if nothing had happened.

1372
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:23,166
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

1373
01:37:24,334 --> 01:37:27,295
Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1374
01:37:27,753 --> 01:37:30,713
-Are you positive?
-Yes, very positive.

1375
01:37:31,088 --> 01:37:34,046
Are the two men you saw at
McHale's in this room today?

1376
01:37:34,088 --> 01:37:35,048
Yes, they are.

1377
01:37:35,505 --> 01:37:37,047
Could you point them
out to the jury, please?

1378
01:37:38,423 --> 01:37:39,591
They're sitting right over there.

1379
01:37:40,967 --> 01:37:44,718
Your Honor, will the record reflect that
Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants...

1380
01:37:44,885 --> 01:37:47,928
...John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
as the two men in question.

1381
01:37:48,219 --> 01:37:49,053
Noted.

1382
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:50,928
Thank you. No further questions.

1383
01:37:51,762 --> 01:37:54,430
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1384
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:56,097
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

1385
01:37:56,556 --> 01:37:57,431
Good morning.

1386
01:37:57,515 --> 01:38:01,141
I just have a few questions. I won't
take too much of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

1387
01:38:02,349 --> 01:38:06,728
You stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner. Is that correct?

1388
01:38:07,226 --> 01:38:11,395
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1389
01:38:12,562 --> 01:38:14,229
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1390
01:38:14,605 --> 01:38:17,063
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1391
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:19,148
What do you mean "prior"?

1392
01:38:19,397 --> 01:38:23,358
At lunch...maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch?

1393
01:38:23,941 --> 01:38:24,735
Yes, I did.

1394
01:38:25,735 --> 01:38:27,068
What did you have to drink?

1395
01:38:27,444 --> 01:38:31,110
I went shopping, and I stopped
at a place on Madison Avenue...

1396
01:38:31,278 --> 01:38:32,904
-...for some lunch.
-See, I didn't ask you where you went.

1397
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,779
I asked you what you
had to drink at lunch?

1398
01:38:35,946 --> 01:38:38,238
-A martini.
-And what else?

1399
01:38:41,239 --> 01:38:42,574
Probably some wine.

1400
01:38:43,492 --> 01:38:47,659
Yes, and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink?

1401
01:38:50,076 --> 01:38:51,911
One glass, maybe two.

1402
01:38:52,578 --> 01:38:55,496
-Closer to two?
-Yes, probably two glasses.

1403
01:39:01,582 --> 01:39:02,998
It's like pulling teeth.

1404
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,001
I should've pinned the
questions to his shirt.

1405
01:39:10,251 --> 01:39:13,211
And tell me, then at dinner you...

1406
01:39:13,294 --> 01:39:14,293
Strike that.

1407
01:39:22,632 --> 01:39:25,091
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1408
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:26,258
Objection, Your Honor!

1409
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:29,841
What Mrs. Salinas did on the
day of the murder...

1410
01:39:30,009 --> 01:39:32,303
...has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder.

1411
01:39:32,345 --> 01:39:34,135
How much she had to
drink does, Your Honor.

1412
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:35,303
Overruled!

1413
01:39:37,303 --> 01:39:40,807
Mrs. Salinas, what time
did you have lunch?

1414
01:39:41,139 --> 01:39:42,473
About one-thirty.

1415
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,848
And what did you have for lunch?

1416
01:39:44,348 --> 01:39:47,433
It was a while ago.
Probably a salad.

1417
01:39:47,557 --> 01:39:49,558
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1418
01:39:49,724 --> 01:39:52,809
A martini, two glasses of wine
and a salad, is that correct?

1419
01:39:52,976 --> 01:39:54,435
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:39:54,727 --> 01:39:59,396
And then you had wine at dinner,
about 6 hours later, is that correct?

1421
01:39:59,729 --> 01:40:00,647
Yes, that's right.

1422
01:40:01,271 --> 01:40:02,438
How much wine did you have to drink...

1423
01:40:02,522 --> 01:40:05,024
...by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHale's?

1424
01:40:05,314 --> 01:40:09,317
-Two glasses.
-Would you say that four glasses of wine...

1425
01:40:09,482 --> 01:40:13,486
...and a martini within a 6-hour
period is a lot for you to drink?

1426
01:40:14,151 --> 01:40:15,400
Yes, it is.

1427
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:25,864
Have you ever heard a gun fired,
prior to the night in question?

1428
01:40:29,074 --> 01:40:30,658
How would you describe the sound?

1429
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,866
It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1430
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,203
-Did the sound frighten you?
-Very much.

1431
01:40:39,371 --> 01:40:42,037
Did you close your eyes?

1432
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,747
At first...until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1433
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,041
Did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHale's?

1434
01:40:51,417 --> 01:40:55,126
Well, I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been shot.

1435
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:59,878
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1436
01:41:01,086 --> 01:41:02,420
Yes, I did.

1437
01:41:02,587 --> 01:41:06,755
Yet, despite that fear, despite
that risk to your life...

1438
01:41:06,964 --> 01:41:11,090
...you looked at their
faces as they left?

1439
01:41:11,841 --> 01:41:13,800
-Yes, I did.
-Is that correct?

1440
01:41:15,552 --> 01:41:16,218
Yes, I did.

1441
01:41:17,135 --> 01:41:19,302
Did you look at their faces?
Did you really...

1442
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:23,303
...really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1443
01:41:23,721 --> 01:41:27,055
I glanced at them when they
walked by, but I did see them!

1444
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:31,223
You...glanced?
You didn't look?

1445
01:41:32,391 --> 01:41:33,475
I saw them!

1446
01:41:34,684 --> 01:41:38,935
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.
You glanced at them through the eyes...

1447
01:41:39,269 --> 01:41:43,936
...of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink.

1448
01:41:44,937 --> 01:41:47,564
-Objection, Your Honor.
-There is no need, Your Honor.

1449
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:49,064
I have no further questions.

1450
01:41:49,272 --> 01:41:51,690
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1451
01:41:55,775 --> 01:41:57,609
It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

1452
01:41:57,817 --> 01:42:01,192
Frank Magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

1453
01:42:01,485 --> 01:42:04,486
He was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation.

1454
01:42:05,153 --> 01:42:06,696
He was also King Benny's nephew.

1455
01:42:07,613 --> 01:42:09,654
Nick Davenport
was with Internal Affairs.

1456
01:42:10,615 --> 01:42:13,283
He was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty.

1457
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:15,949
He knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a...

1458
01:42:16,117 --> 01:42:18,868
...maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time.

1459
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:20,868
Frank, what is this shit?

1460
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:23,077
If I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1461
01:42:23,826 --> 01:42:24,578
You make this one...

1462
01:42:24,661 --> 01:42:26,786
...you're gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the Commissioner.

1463
01:42:27,037 --> 01:42:30,457
You know, you got a real hard-on for this
Styler guy. What's your beef with him?

1464
01:42:30,621 --> 01:42:32,789
-One more thing.
-I can't wait.

1465
01:42:32,956 --> 01:42:37,625
It's simple. No one knows who fed you
this information. And I mean, nobody.

1466
01:42:37,957 --> 01:42:38,833
How did you get it?

1467
01:42:39,001 --> 01:42:42,334
It fell into my lap...just like
it's gonna fall into yours.

1468
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:50,963
Christ Almighty!

1469
01:42:58,675 --> 01:43:00,050
You got everything in
here but a confession.

1470
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:01,801
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1471
01:43:02,175 --> 01:43:03,843
My preference is that
you beat it out of him.

1472
01:43:04,009 --> 01:43:05,510
There's even surveillance photos.

1473
01:43:06,385 --> 01:43:09,429
This piece of shit's pulling in about
five grand a month, ripping off pushers.

1474
01:43:09,511 --> 01:43:10,929
Has been for about 3 years.

1475
01:43:11,222 --> 01:43:13,139
-More like 4.
-He ain't gonna see 5.

1476
01:43:13,264 --> 01:43:14,641
So, you got enough for conviction?

1477
01:43:14,722 --> 01:43:16,849
That ain't up to me.
That's up to a jury.

1478
01:43:20,515 --> 01:43:21,850
Show the jury this.

1479
01:43:24,933 --> 01:43:25,937
What do you got there, Ness?

1480
01:43:26,353 --> 01:43:28,729
About 3 weeks ago,
the body of a drug dealer...

1481
01:43:28,896 --> 01:43:32,103
...named Indian Red Lpez was found
in an alley in Jackson Heights.

1482
01:43:32,688 --> 01:43:34,522
Three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

1483
01:43:34,605 --> 01:43:35,522
I'm with you so far.

1484
01:43:36,022 --> 01:43:38,441
This is the gun that killed him,
and these are the shells.

1485
01:43:39,106 --> 01:43:42,024
What's behind door number 3?

1486
01:43:42,734 --> 01:43:44,902
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

1487
01:43:49,236 --> 01:43:51,237
-Hey, do me a favor, would you?
-What's that?

1488
01:43:51,404 --> 01:43:53,404
If I ever make it onto your
shit list, give me a call.

1489
01:43:54,488 --> 01:43:56,197
Give me a chance to apologize.

1490
01:43:57,113 --> 01:44:00,823
So, you need anything else, you talk to
Frank. He knows how to get a hold of me.

1491
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:04,326
Take care of yourself, kid.
Water gets choppy out your way.

1492
01:44:04,742 --> 01:44:05,784
I'll do what I can.

1493
01:44:07,576 --> 01:44:10,912
Hey, Ness...did you ever
think of becoming a cop?

1494
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:13,204
And leave the good guys?

1495
01:44:31,294 --> 01:44:32,628
The body of Christ.

1496
01:44:57,012 --> 01:44:58,179
The body of Christ.

1497
01:45:01,932 --> 01:45:03,932
Michael had done all
that could be expected...

1498
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,934
...of an Assistant District Attorney
seeking a conviction.

1499
01:45:07,684 --> 01:45:11,935
He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.

1500
01:45:12,434 --> 01:45:14,852
He just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence.

1501
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:17,271
And he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.

1502
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:21,481
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working...

1503
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:24,275
...and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him.

1504
01:45:24,691 --> 01:45:25,816
Did you see their faces?

1505
01:45:26,274 --> 01:45:29,066
Yes, I looked at them,
and they looked at me.

1506
01:45:29,192 --> 01:45:30,276
Did they say anything to you?

1507
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:33,151
No, they just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

1508
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:35,486
Are you sure the two
defendants killed Sean Nokes?

1509
01:45:35,653 --> 01:45:36,778
I know they killed him.

1510
01:45:37,486 --> 01:45:39,780
If the plan worked, it would
be everyone's success.

1511
01:45:40,487 --> 01:45:42,489
If it failed, the fault
would fall to Michael.

1512
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:49,992
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the West Side...

1513
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,785
...remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder.

1514
01:45:54,742 --> 01:45:58,079
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1515
01:45:58,329 --> 01:45:59,913
Why didn't you turn around, Mr. Carson?

1516
01:46:00,162 --> 01:46:02,997
I was concerned for my
companion's safety.

1517
01:46:03,163 --> 01:46:04,998
Mr. Carson, did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?

1518
01:46:06,164 --> 01:46:09,124
Did they threaten anyone
in McHale's Restaurant...?

1519
01:46:10,959 --> 01:46:12,293
I didn't see it, but I know it!

1520
01:46:12,834 --> 01:46:15,127
If you didn't see the defendant
shoot the guard...

1521
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:17,460
...then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him?

1522
01:46:41,262 --> 01:46:42,430
So, what's the emergency?

1523
01:46:47,055 --> 01:46:48,847
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
It's too risky.

1524
01:46:49,056 --> 01:46:52,391
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

1525
01:46:54,392 --> 01:46:55,267
Why?

1526
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,269
Shakes met with Father Bobby
2 weeks ago.

1527
01:46:59,936 --> 01:47:02,937
-He hasn't heard from him since.
-It's not an overnight decision for him.

1528
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:10,231
-What if he doesn't testify?
-Then we got a very serious problem.

1529
01:47:26,322 --> 01:47:28,322
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1530
01:47:30,072 --> 01:47:33,283
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1531
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,326
He already has.

1532
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:37,783
What?!

1533
01:47:39,117 --> 01:47:42,745
I...was with him when he
talked to Father Bobby.

1534
01:47:45,953 --> 01:47:47,497
I heard everything, Michael.

1535
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:58,794
So, you know.

1536
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:08,464
If only you told me.

1537
01:48:13,548 --> 01:48:15,341
I think things could've been different.

1538
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:19,426
If you could've talked.

1539
01:48:24,636 --> 01:48:26,637
Maybe...maybe we...

1540
01:48:30,847 --> 01:48:31,806
Maybe....

1541
01:48:57,357 --> 01:48:59,775
Carmen, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1542
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:04,234
You still have a thing for Doris Day.

1543
01:49:04,693 --> 01:49:08,737
She was a good woman.
You know the strega?

1544
01:49:10,029 --> 01:49:12,488
It's hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye.

1545
01:49:13,405 --> 01:49:15,697
She needs the heads.

1546
01:49:21,366 --> 01:49:22,699
Take this to the witch.

1547
01:49:24,411 --> 01:49:25,993
Now, why does she need that?

1548
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:29,037
-She takes the eyes.
-Wonderful!

1549
01:49:29,245 --> 01:49:32,745
Puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil.

1550
01:49:33,288 --> 01:49:34,121
And then?

1551
01:49:36,206 --> 01:49:40,499
People get headaches, they go to her.
She looks into their eyes...

1552
01:49:40,706 --> 01:49:43,709
...and tells them who is
wishing the headaches.

1553
01:49:44,335 --> 01:49:47,876
She says a few words, and
the headaches go away.

1554
01:49:48,544 --> 01:49:52,879
Once in a while, the person who
wished the headaches, goes away too.

1555
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,214
This guy, Addison, the one
who works for the Mayor...

1556
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:59,506
...he quits his job in 2 weeks.

1557
01:50:00,716 --> 01:50:04,217
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1558
01:50:04,426 --> 01:50:07,593
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1559
01:50:09,093 --> 01:50:10,678
-He knows this?
-He will.

1560
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:14,929
The boys he buys for
parties are expensive.

1561
01:50:15,096 --> 01:50:18,431
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1562
01:50:19,764 --> 01:50:20,932
How much does he owe?

1563
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:25,100
Eight grand with a heavy vig.
I paid that off.

1564
01:50:25,268 --> 01:50:29,561
-You paid?
-Addison's debts belong to me now.

1565
01:50:31,185 --> 01:50:33,687
-You hate debts.
-I hate Addison!

1566
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:39,690
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1567
01:50:40,106 --> 01:50:41,815
And I like to play alone.

1568
01:50:42,482 --> 01:50:47,026
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1569
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:04,742
His mother named him Edward Goldenberg
Robinson, after her favorite actor.

1570
01:51:05,615 --> 01:51:06,949
To continue the Hollywood connection...

1571
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:09,616
Eddie Robinson took the street name
"Little Caesar"...

1572
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,118
...as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.

1573
01:51:13,703 --> 01:51:16,829
He had a 12-year-old son in a
private school in upstate New York.

1574
01:51:17,663 --> 01:51:19,621
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother...

1575
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:23,248
...who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

1576
01:51:23,997 --> 01:51:27,166
-I want you to give me some money.
-All right.

1577
01:51:27,709 --> 01:51:31,042
I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

1578
01:51:31,543 --> 01:51:34,878
I ain't paying it back.
Somebody else is.

1579
01:51:37,504 --> 01:51:38,838
This somebody I know?

1580
01:51:39,172 --> 01:51:42,504
-Your little brother knew him.
-Rizzo?

1581
01:51:45,256 --> 01:51:46,506
How did he know Rizzo?

1582
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:51,550
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

1583
01:51:51,843 --> 01:51:56,179
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1584
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:04,556
Count out $8,000.
Put it in an envelope.

1585
01:52:08,557 --> 01:52:12,683
You...go back a long time, old man.

1586
01:52:14,101 --> 01:52:15,560
Old men always do.

1587
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:18,811
Ran with the guineas, back
when the guineas were tough.

1588
01:52:18,853 --> 01:52:20,187
I ran when I could.

1589
01:52:21,437 --> 01:52:22,897
Looked good doing it, too.

1590
01:52:25,814 --> 01:52:29,815
Gave the business some style, some class.

1591
01:52:31,566 --> 01:52:34,567
Made it a call for respect, the way
you wore it...the way you talked it.

1592
01:52:36,193 --> 01:52:38,195
I always liked that about you.

1593
01:52:38,736 --> 01:52:42,071
I'm no help to you.
My tailor is dead.

1594
01:52:49,073 --> 01:52:53,408
I'll look up our friend and
collect the money he owes me.

1595
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,701
He owes you something more than money.

1596
01:52:56,243 --> 01:52:58,160
Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1597
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:01,412
-This is.
-What, old man?

1598
01:53:02,412 --> 01:53:04,620
What's this guy owe that
means more than dollars?

1599
01:53:05,162 --> 01:53:09,122
He owes you Rizzo. He's the man
that killed your brother.

1600
01:53:18,335 --> 01:53:20,461
They said he died of pneumonia.

1601
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:22,087
They said.

1602
01:53:29,422 --> 01:53:31,090
What is the relevance of this?

1603
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:34,258
So, Ralph Ferguson is
a Sunday school teacher?

1604
01:53:34,466 --> 01:53:37,259
I don't know, counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1605
01:53:38,134 --> 01:53:42,302
I understand that, Your Honor. Again,
I need to put a face to the victim.

1606
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:46,304
Otherwise it's just another
name in the obituaries.

1607
01:53:47,011 --> 01:53:49,099
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1608
01:53:51,265 --> 01:53:52,556
I don't have a problem with that.

1609
01:53:53,848 --> 01:53:57,183
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1610
01:54:23,776 --> 01:54:25,862
-Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
-Good morning.

1611
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:29,487
I'd like to thank you for coming, I
understand it's been a long trip for you.

1612
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:32,405
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1613
01:54:33,864 --> 01:54:36,241
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were such good friends.

1614
01:54:36,406 --> 01:54:39,074
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

1615
01:54:39,323 --> 01:54:41,992
We were great friends. It would
be hard to find a better friend.

1616
01:54:42,951 --> 01:54:46,744
-Would you say you were his best friend?
-I was his closest, that's for sure.

1617
01:54:47,536 --> 01:54:51,496
-How long did you know each other?
-About 17, 18 years.

1618
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,621
And did you see each other often?

1619
01:54:54,123 --> 01:54:58,541
As often as we could...
weekends, holidays, vacations.

1620
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:04,043
-What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
-He was a good man.

1621
01:55:04,419 --> 01:55:06,627
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1622
01:55:07,254 --> 01:55:09,628
Objection, Your Honor, statement
is one of opinion not fact.

1623
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,045
He was asked his opinion.

1624
01:55:11,255 --> 01:55:13,380
Overruled. Please proceed.

1625
01:55:15,131 --> 01:55:19,424
Mr. Ferguson...were you aware of
any enemies he might have had?

1626
01:55:19,799 --> 01:55:21,549
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1627
01:55:22,301 --> 01:55:25,635
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1628
01:55:30,386 --> 01:55:31,888
Is that a prison?

1629
01:55:32,054 --> 01:55:34,430
No, it's a juvenile
facility for young boys.

1630
01:55:34,513 --> 01:55:37,514
Your function was what at this facility?

1631
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,390
Standard stuff.

1632
01:55:39,557 --> 01:55:43,642
Keep the boys in line, make sure
they got to classes on time....

1633
01:55:44,392 --> 01:55:46,893
Keep an eye out for trouble,
put them down for the night.

1634
01:55:47,977 --> 01:55:51,729
As guards, were you and
Mr. Nokes allowed to use force to...

1635
01:55:51,896 --> 01:55:53,896
...as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1636
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:56,479
What...what do you mean, force?

1637
01:55:56,647 --> 01:55:57,523
Were you allowed to hit them?

1638
01:55:59,772 --> 01:56:00,648
Of course not.

1639
01:56:00,983 --> 01:56:04,775
Were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the Wilkinson home?

1640
01:56:06,317 --> 01:56:09,276
I'm sure something like that
may have happened. It was a...

1641
01:56:09,944 --> 01:56:13,279
...big place, but it wasn't
the common practice.

1642
01:56:13,445 --> 01:56:14,778
Let's narrow the place down.

1643
01:56:14,945 --> 01:56:18,323
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care...

1644
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:20,947
...at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1645
01:56:28,702 --> 01:56:31,160
Would you like me to
repeat the question?

1646
01:56:31,368 --> 01:56:32,285
No.

1647
01:56:34,369 --> 01:56:36,496
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

1648
01:56:37,538 --> 01:56:40,622
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems...

1649
01:56:40,789 --> 01:56:42,790
...were hit on occasion.

1650
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,500
And how were they hit?

1651
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:46,541
-I don't know what you mean.
-A fist?

1652
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:50,876
Open hand? Kick? Baton, maybe?

1653
01:56:51,586 --> 01:56:55,294
-Depends on what the situation called for.
-Who determined that situation?

1654
01:56:55,837 --> 01:56:56,713
The guard on the scene.

1655
01:56:57,464 --> 01:56:59,463
That's a lot of power to
have over a boy, isn't it?

1656
01:56:59,964 --> 01:57:03,548
-It came with the job, sir.
-Did torture come with the job?

1657
01:57:12,843 --> 01:57:15,304
Boys were tortured, weren't they,
Mr. Ferguson?

1658
01:57:15,387 --> 01:57:16,386
Define torture.

1659
01:57:18,513 --> 01:57:20,139
Well, let's define torture.

1660
01:57:22,598 --> 01:57:23,640
Cigarette burning...

1661
01:57:25,182 --> 01:57:26,140
...random beatings...

1662
01:57:27,681 --> 01:57:31,226
...solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1663
01:57:32,935 --> 01:57:36,394
-Say that took place?
-On occasion.

1664
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,563
-Who tortured them?
-Guards.

1665
01:57:39,771 --> 01:57:40,771
Which guards?

1666
01:57:42,606 --> 01:57:44,939
I can't remember all of them.

1667
01:57:46,774 --> 01:57:47,732
Remember one.

1668
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:58,238
Remember one.

1669
01:58:05,406 --> 01:58:08,740
This line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case.

1670
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:11,282
-It will, Your Honor.
-For your sake.

1671
01:58:12,284 --> 01:58:16,786
Mr. Ferguson, was there ever any sexual
abuse at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1672
01:58:20,286 --> 01:58:24,788
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1673
01:58:26,789 --> 01:58:28,248
Yes, I heard that there was.

1674
01:58:28,415 --> 01:58:29,748
I'm not asking what you heard.

1675
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:33,834
I'm asking...what you...saw.

1676
01:58:35,334 --> 01:58:36,419
Please, Ferguson, don't do this.

1677
01:58:37,128 --> 01:58:38,420
I thought you boys liked it.

1678
01:58:39,794 --> 01:58:41,086
Yes, I saw.

1679
01:58:42,796 --> 01:58:46,630
Did you and Sean Nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys?

1680
01:58:48,256 --> 01:58:49,966
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape...

1681
01:58:50,466 --> 01:58:53,299
...any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

1682
01:58:59,594 --> 01:59:03,345
Counselors...approach.

1683
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:17,059
I just fucked your
little friend, Johnny.

1684
01:59:17,226 --> 01:59:19,184
Counselor, what the
hell is going on here?

1685
01:59:22,018 --> 01:59:24,104
I guess I called the
wrong character witness.

1686
01:59:24,271 --> 01:59:28,022
Counselor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness...

1687
01:59:28,189 --> 01:59:29,356
...now, it's blown up in your face.

1688
01:59:29,857 --> 01:59:31,566
Please Mr. Ferguson,
don't do this, please.

1689
01:59:37,152 --> 01:59:39,151
Mr. Ferguson,
please answer the question.

1690
01:59:43,695 --> 01:59:46,529
-Mr. Ferguson, Sean Nokes...
-I like it nice and slow.

1691
01:59:47,072 --> 01:59:50,405
...visited your home on numerous
occasions, is that correct?

1692
01:59:50,865 --> 01:59:54,199
Did you ever leave Sean Nokes
alone with your child?

1693
01:59:54,698 --> 01:59:55,491
A child?

1694
01:59:56,074 --> 01:59:59,409
Yes, in other words, would your
ex-wife ever leave Sean Nokes alone...

1695
02:00:00,034 --> 02:00:01,368
...with your child?

1696
02:00:01,533 --> 02:00:02,867
There would be no reason for that.

1697
02:00:03,076 --> 02:00:06,580
There would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child. It wouldn't come up.

1698
02:00:07,579 --> 02:00:10,663
Never came up?
Did she ever voice any concern?

1699
02:00:10,831 --> 02:00:13,999
We have a statement explaining
why she would never allow...

1700
02:00:15,082 --> 02:00:18,750
...Sean Nokes to be in a
room alone with your son.

1701
02:00:19,584 --> 02:00:20,751
-Objection!
-Sustained.

1702
02:00:30,171 --> 02:00:31,714
You ain't gonna touch me ever again!

1703
02:00:42,218 --> 02:00:42,968
Yes....

1704
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:55,431
Yes?

1705
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:01,225
Yes, what?

1706
02:01:06,894 --> 02:01:10,228
Yes, Sean Nokes had
experiences with some boys.

1707
02:01:13,812 --> 02:01:17,106
-Were you there?
-Yes.

1708
02:01:18,482 --> 02:01:22,108
-Did you observe these experiences?
-Yes.

1709
02:01:24,817 --> 02:01:27,110
Did you do more than observe?

1710
02:01:27,402 --> 02:01:29,570
I was drinking then....

1711
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:35,905
Were there any other guards
around during these experiences?

1712
02:01:36,946 --> 02:01:37,822
Yes.

1713
02:01:40,157 --> 02:01:42,367
-With you and Mr. Nokes?
-Yes.

1714
02:01:43,492 --> 02:01:46,743
-On more than one occasion?
-Yes.

1715
02:01:58,957 --> 02:02:03,040
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think
that Sean Nokes was a good man?

1716
02:02:04,457 --> 02:02:05,584
He was my friend.

1717
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,627
A friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after?

1718
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:25,841
I have no further questions.

1719
02:02:31,635 --> 02:02:33,052
I want this to be over.

1720
02:02:35,553 --> 02:02:37,012
I want this to be over.

1721
02:02:40,473 --> 02:02:41,890
Witness is excused.

1722
02:02:43,891 --> 02:02:44,683
Mr. Ferguson...

1723
02:02:46,685 --> 02:02:50,685
Mr. Ferguson, if I were you...

1724
02:02:50,851 --> 02:02:52,559
...l wouldn't stray too far from home.

1725
02:02:53,394 --> 02:02:55,645
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

1726
02:02:58,479 --> 02:03:01,230
Michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time.

1727
02:03:01,897 --> 02:03:05,773
Playing prosecution and defense attorney,
he exposed Ferguson for what he was...

1728
02:03:05,983 --> 02:03:08,191
...and still kept John and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes...

1729
02:03:08,275 --> 02:03:09,774
...hidden from the eyes of the court.

1730
02:03:10,693 --> 02:03:15,112
Little Caesar, who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket...

1731
02:03:15,694 --> 02:03:17,320
...called in the Henry Addison loan.

1732
02:03:19,196 --> 02:03:21,196
It was a loan Addison couldn't
afford to pay back.

1733
02:03:21,948 --> 02:03:24,615
And it gave Little Caesar
the only reason he needed...

1734
02:03:24,864 --> 02:03:26,407
...to even his score for Rizzo.

1735
02:03:57,253 --> 02:04:00,378
Davenport wasted little time on
following up on Adam Styler.

1736
02:04:01,212 --> 02:04:03,463
He was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death...

1737
02:04:03,630 --> 02:04:06,631
...of the Queens drug dealer, and eight
counts of corruption and bribery.

1738
02:04:22,096 --> 02:04:23,430
That's six for me, two for you.

1739
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:29,682
Most people play this game
in the summer.

1740
02:04:30,308 --> 02:04:32,474
It's easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

1741
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:34,726
I give a fuck about most people!

1742
02:04:40,186 --> 02:04:43,354
You're gonna have a heart attack...
and I'm not breathing in your mouth.

1743
02:04:44,854 --> 02:04:46,314
Well, I'm not going to marry you either.

1744
02:04:50,023 --> 02:04:53,150
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

1745
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:57,359
A spic be living in the White House by
the time it reaches their fucking brains!

1746
02:04:57,776 --> 02:05:00,695
Snyder came through big.
He's not half bad.

1747
02:05:01,152 --> 02:05:03,195
The way you told it, I thought
he could hardly stand up.

1748
02:05:03,861 --> 02:05:06,029
He's a drunk, but he's not a fool.

1749
02:05:06,531 --> 02:05:08,447
We only win when John and Tommy walk.

1750
02:05:09,199 --> 02:05:11,698
Then you'll have to get them
out of the shooting hall.

1751
02:05:11,866 --> 02:05:15,366
You have to put them some place else.
And only a witness does that for you.

1752
02:05:15,658 --> 02:05:18,701
Now, he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker!

1753
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:22,451
What if he doesn't show? What if
we have to go on the way we are?

1754
02:05:23,703 --> 02:05:25,537
The street is the only one that matters.

1755
02:05:26,164 --> 02:05:29,497
Court is for uptown people
with suits, money...

1756
02:05:29,663 --> 02:05:33,124
...lawyers with three names. If you
got cash, you can buy court justice.

1757
02:05:33,873 --> 02:05:36,540
But on the street, justice has no price.

1758
02:05:36,707 --> 02:05:40,168
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

1759
02:05:40,335 --> 02:05:44,838
-Out here, the bitch got eyes.
-We need both.

1760
02:05:46,712 --> 02:05:48,421
Then you need a witness.

1761
02:06:35,689 --> 02:06:39,024
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you are to disregard...

1762
02:06:39,191 --> 02:06:40,526
...the testimony of Ralph Ferguson.

1763
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:44,443
His entire testimony is
stricken from this record.

1764
02:06:44,944 --> 02:06:46,736
That concludes the people's case,
Your Honor.

1765
02:06:46,903 --> 02:06:48,611
-The people rest?
-The people rest.

1766
02:06:49,237 --> 02:06:50,613
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1767
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,115
Your Honor, I don't...
I don't know.

1768
02:06:58,282 --> 02:06:59,074
You don't know?

1769
02:06:59,407 --> 02:07:01,575
Well, I'm not sure that...
we're waiting...

1770
02:07:02,742 --> 02:07:05,743
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Present
a witness or be prepared to sum up!

1771
02:07:29,045 --> 02:07:29,794
Everything good?

1772
02:08:06,184 --> 02:08:08,853
I found it very interesting
attending morning Mass.

1773
02:08:12,477 --> 02:08:15,019
Your Honor, the defense
calls Father Robert Carillo.

1774
02:08:24,065 --> 02:08:25,816
Father, do you know most of
the people in your parish?

1775
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:27,485
I know all the people in my parish.

1776
02:08:27,649 --> 02:08:30,026
Do you know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?

1777
02:08:31,527 --> 02:08:34,529
-How long have you known them?
-Since they were boys.

1778
02:08:35,362 --> 02:08:36,696
They were both students of mine.

1779
02:08:36,863 --> 02:08:37,529
Remain standing.

1780
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,697
-How long have you been there?
-It'll be twenty years this spring.

1781
02:08:43,281 --> 02:08:44,199
I'm a priest.

1782
02:08:44,366 --> 02:08:45,867
In the case of the people
of the State of New York...

1783
02:08:45,949 --> 02:08:47,907
...against John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1784
02:08:48,908 --> 02:08:51,243
...do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth...

1785
02:08:51,493 --> 02:08:53,995
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

1786
02:08:55,662 --> 02:08:56,412
I do.

1787
02:08:56,913 --> 02:09:01,330
Acting pastor, serve Mass daily,
listen to confessions....

1788
02:09:03,749 --> 02:09:07,458
Do you recall where you were on the
night of November first this past year?

1789
02:09:07,915 --> 02:09:10,374
-Yes, I do.
-Where was that?

1790
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:14,211
I was at the basketball game at
the Garden: the Knicks vs. the Celtics.

1791
02:09:14,878 --> 02:09:17,879
And when did the Knicks game begin?

1792
02:09:20,255 --> 02:09:22,255
-About 7:30.
-What time did it end?

1793
02:09:23,089 --> 02:09:24,423
Between 9:30 and 10:00.

1794
02:09:25,547 --> 02:09:26,882
Do you remember who won that game?

1795
02:09:27,715 --> 02:09:29,258
Sad to say, it was the Celtics.

1796
02:09:29,549 --> 02:09:32,760
Kevin McHale and Robert Parish were
a little too much for our boys that night.

1797
02:09:33,052 --> 02:09:34,385
Even if it was All Saints Day.

1798
02:09:35,635 --> 02:09:38,053
Next time, you give me a call,
I'll try my guy.

1799
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:39,095
I'll try that.

1800
02:09:42,055 --> 02:09:43,764
Father Carillo,
were you at the game alone?

1801
02:09:45,639 --> 02:09:46,973
No, I went there with two friends.

1802
02:09:47,973 --> 02:09:49,308
And who were those two friends?

1803
02:09:51,309 --> 02:09:53,142
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

1804
02:09:55,102 --> 02:09:58,852
-The two defendants?
-Yes, the same two defendants.

1805
02:09:59,979 --> 02:10:03,854
Father Carillo, at 8:25 p.m.,
the time the police say...

1806
02:10:04,438 --> 02:10:06,439
...victim Sean Nokes was murdered...

1807
02:10:06,647 --> 02:10:10,274
...were you still with Mr. Reilly and
Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

1808
02:10:10,608 --> 02:10:11,941
Yes, I was.

1809
02:10:12,316 --> 02:10:15,942
And what time did you, Mr. Reilly,
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1810
02:10:17,611 --> 02:10:20,944
It was around 10:30...a little later.

1811
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:24,613
They dropped me off in front of the
rectory, near where they'd picked me up.

1812
02:10:25,781 --> 02:10:27,199
Did the two defendants tell
you where they were going?

1813
02:10:28,157 --> 02:10:30,948
No, they didn't, but I imagine,
after a night spent with a priest...

1814
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:33,116
...they went looking for the
first open bar they could find.

1815
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:38,826
So then, Father, if the two defendants
were with you at 8:25...

1816
02:10:38,993 --> 02:10:42,119
...the night of the murder, they couldn't
have shot and killed Sean Nokes...

1817
02:10:42,286 --> 02:10:44,662
...as the prosecution contends.
Isn't that correct?

1818
02:10:46,205 --> 02:10:48,498
Not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the Garden.

1819
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:53,000
He was not shot from there.

1820
02:10:56,167 --> 02:10:57,876
And he was not shot by those boys.

1821
02:11:00,044 --> 02:11:02,127
No further questions, Your Honor.

1822
02:11:02,836 --> 02:11:04,254
Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.

1823
02:11:04,754 --> 02:11:05,714
Thank you, Your Honor.

1824
02:11:11,383 --> 02:11:13,382
Did you buy the tickets for the game
Father, or were they given to you?

1825
02:11:13,549 --> 02:11:15,217
-No, I bought them.
-On the day of the game?

1826
02:11:15,509 --> 02:11:17,716
I went to the box office
about a week before.

1827
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:21,094
Did anyone know you were going to the
game, other than the two defendants?

1828
02:11:21,386 --> 02:11:22,302
I don't think so.

1829
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:25,471
Was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets?

1830
02:11:25,554 --> 02:11:26,346
No.

1831
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:29,055
-No one saw you buy the tickets?
-That's right.

1832
02:11:29,389 --> 02:11:31,389
-Did you get a receipt?
-No, I didn't.

1833
02:11:31,681 --> 02:11:34,556
Paid by check?
Mastercard? Visa?

1834
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:38,351
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1835
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,978
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

1836
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:43,895
Very much.

1837
02:11:45,437 --> 02:11:47,688
And there isn't anything you
wouldn't do for them, am I right?

1838
02:11:48,313 --> 02:11:50,855
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1839
02:11:51,897 --> 02:11:55,232
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1840
02:11:56,065 --> 02:11:57,732
Something along those lines, yes.

1841
02:11:58,232 --> 02:12:01,193
And is it true then, as a good father,
you would want to protect them...

1842
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,694
...from something they
shouldn't have done.

1843
02:12:02,901 --> 02:12:06,903
As much as I would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did.

1844
02:12:07,612 --> 02:12:10,780
-Like a murder?
-Yes, like a murder.

1845
02:12:12,072 --> 02:12:15,699
Let me get this straight then.
No one knew you were going to the game.

1846
02:12:15,863 --> 02:12:18,324
No one saw you at the game. No one
saw you buy tickets for the game.

1847
02:12:18,574 --> 02:12:19,992
There's no record you even
bought tickets.

1848
02:12:20,075 --> 02:12:22,119
You have no receipt for the tickets.

1849
02:12:22,409 --> 02:12:26,120
-Am I correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

1850
02:12:26,744 --> 02:12:28,371
Then how do we really know, Father?

1851
02:12:28,787 --> 02:12:29,996
How do we know...

1852
02:12:30,329 --> 02:12:32,997
...you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder?

1853
02:12:34,372 --> 02:12:37,998
I'm telling you as a witness...
and as a priest. We were at the game.

1854
02:12:38,165 --> 02:12:41,959
Yes, as a priest, and a priest
wouldn't lie? Am I right?

1855
02:12:42,626 --> 02:12:45,127
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1856
02:12:48,003 --> 02:12:49,503
I always keep the stubs.

1857
02:12:54,463 --> 02:12:55,255
Do you want to see them?

1858
02:13:02,634 --> 02:13:04,884
Why is that, Father?
Why do you keep the stubs?

1859
02:13:05,634 --> 02:13:08,468
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1860
02:13:10,928 --> 02:13:12,846
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

1861
02:13:13,096 --> 02:13:17,390
No. No one ever has. But there's
a first time for everything.

1862
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:30,186
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1863
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,854
Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

1864
02:13:42,192 --> 02:13:45,775
I've never recovered from seeing Father
Bobby take the stand and lie for us...

1865
02:13:46,025 --> 02:13:47,860
...to even the score for John and Tommy.

1866
02:13:49,318 --> 02:13:52,361
He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson's...

1867
02:13:52,944 --> 02:13:55,030
...and the evil that had lived
there for too long.

1868
02:13:55,696 --> 02:13:57,697
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

1869
02:14:05,034 --> 02:14:07,826
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1870
02:14:08,035 --> 02:14:11,868
...do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilty or not guilty?

1871
02:14:12,036 --> 02:14:13,037
Not guilty.

1872
02:14:13,204 --> 02:14:15,829
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1873
02:14:15,996 --> 02:14:20,664
...do you find the defendant, Thomas
Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1874
02:14:20,956 --> 02:14:22,041
Not guilty.

1875
02:14:22,915 --> 02:14:26,041
Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

1876
02:14:46,798 --> 02:14:49,091
Hi, how are you?
Could I get a hot dog?

1877
02:14:50,342 --> 02:14:54,344
Mustard and relish...a lot of relish.

1878
02:14:57,387 --> 02:14:58,846
Give him two napkins.

1879
02:15:04,723 --> 02:15:06,057
You did good in there, counselor.

1880
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:10,059
So, what happens to you now?

1881
02:15:10,393 --> 02:15:12,017
What happens?
I walk away.

1882
02:15:13,935 --> 02:15:15,936
Wait a few weeks,
I'll hand them my notice.

1883
02:15:17,102 --> 02:15:19,103
After the way I handled this case...

1884
02:15:19,979 --> 02:15:21,979
...they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1885
02:15:24,773 --> 02:15:28,566
So, you switch to the other side and work
as a defense lawyer. The money's better.

1886
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:32,275
There's always gonna be more
bad guys than good, Mikey.

1887
02:15:34,235 --> 02:15:36,903
And can you imagine the work you'd
get from John and Tommy's crew?

1888
02:15:37,986 --> 02:15:39,278
That's a house and a pool.

1889
02:15:41,821 --> 02:15:45,988
Not for me. I've seen
all the law I want to see.

1890
02:15:47,448 --> 02:15:50,116
-It's time for something else.
-Like what?

1891
02:15:50,617 --> 02:15:51,951
I'll let you know when I know.

1892
02:15:53,158 --> 02:15:55,701
You know, you're too old to
play for the Yankees...

1893
02:15:55,784 --> 02:15:57,161
...and you're too young to take up golf.

1894
02:15:57,619 --> 02:15:59,453
Why are you shooting holes
through all of my plans?

1895
02:15:59,619 --> 02:16:00,662
You gonna make me panic.

1896
02:16:02,412 --> 02:16:03,747
You'll work it out.
You always have.

1897
02:16:09,957 --> 02:16:11,542
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1898
02:16:13,668 --> 02:16:16,876
I just want to shut my eyes and not
have to see the places I've been.

1899
02:16:19,793 --> 02:16:20,837
I'm weary...

1900
02:16:25,381 --> 02:16:26,423
I don't know.

1901
02:16:29,507 --> 02:16:31,715
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

1902
02:16:33,341 --> 02:16:35,300
Well, don't disappear on me,
counselor.

1903
02:16:36,883 --> 02:16:38,677
I may need a good lawyer one day.

1904
02:16:38,884 --> 02:16:40,010
You can't afford a good lawyer.

1905
02:16:43,011 --> 02:16:44,513
I may need a good friend, though.

1906
02:16:47,889 --> 02:16:50,223
I'll find you when you do.
Count on it.

1907
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:53,516
Always have.

1908
02:17:00,184 --> 02:17:03,728
A full month had passed since the
acquittal, and no one had made contact.

1909
02:17:04,312 --> 02:17:06,979
In those few weeks, our lives had
reverted back to what they'd been...

1910
02:17:07,147 --> 02:17:08,981
...prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

1911
02:17:09,604 --> 02:17:12,941
Carol had returned to her
stack of social service files...

1912
02:17:13,149 --> 02:17:14,567
...helping troubled teens
and single mothers.

1913
02:17:15,399 --> 02:17:19,067
John and Tommy went back to the
streets, running the West Side Boys.

1914
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:23,986
I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.

1915
02:17:24,738 --> 02:17:26,988
Michael, as he'd promised,
resigned from his job...

1916
02:17:27,196 --> 02:17:29,405
...after working the losing
end of a "can't miss case".

1917
02:17:34,657 --> 02:17:36,407
I don't know how to fucking thank you!

1918
02:17:40,868 --> 02:17:43,536
I can't believe what you did.
I can't believe we got away with it!

1919
02:17:43,702 --> 02:17:46,578
It wasn't me. That was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1920
02:17:46,745 --> 02:17:49,370
When I first heard he was taking the
case, I was gonna have him burned.

1921
02:17:50,413 --> 02:17:53,081
I figured, he's a friend, and if you've
gotta be sent away on a murder rap...

1922
02:17:53,247 --> 02:17:53,914
...who better to do it?

1923
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:56,749
Well, the way he was handling the case,
I thought he sucked as a lawyer.

1924
02:17:56,957 --> 02:17:58,375
I started feeling sorry for the bastard.

1925
02:17:59,584 --> 02:18:01,043
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1926
02:18:02,127 --> 02:18:03,586
Get over here, counselor!

1927
02:18:04,543 --> 02:18:06,794
You are the real Count!

1928
02:18:06,962 --> 02:18:09,254
Alive and well and
living in New York City!

1929
02:18:11,421 --> 02:18:13,756
You fucking maniac! All right!

1930
02:18:15,964 --> 02:18:17,465
What is this, a gay bar?

1931
02:18:19,134 --> 02:18:20,467
It was until you came in!

1932
02:18:20,759 --> 02:18:22,301
Why don't you give me a
kiss to go with that hello?

1933
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:30,804
Get out of the way.

1934
02:18:36,472 --> 02:18:37,390
Let's have a drink.

1935
02:18:43,268 --> 02:18:44,602
The Four Gladiators!

1936
02:18:46,018 --> 02:18:49,770
The "Four Gladiators", worst quartet
to ever hold a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1937
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:52,771
But what was that name that
Shakes wanted to call it?

1938
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:56,232
Genius wanted to call it,
"The Count and His Cristos."

1939
02:18:56,481 --> 02:18:58,732
-Nice!
-Well, you know, it's so sweet, isn't it?

1940
02:19:00,358 --> 02:19:02,359
Hey, that would've sent albums
flying out of the store.

1941
02:19:02,524 --> 02:19:04,942
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

1942
02:19:05,109 --> 02:19:06,817
That kid at the deaf school don't count!

1943
02:19:11,862 --> 02:19:12,987
One song for Carol.

1944
02:19:13,695 --> 02:19:15,947
-I retired a long time ago.
-Come on, you mutts!

1945
02:19:16,322 --> 02:19:18,323
Don't you guys have to go out
and shoot somebody?

1946
02:19:23,992 --> 02:19:26,118
We always got time for a song!

1947
02:19:27,577 --> 02:19:29,326
Just kidding, you know what I'm saying?

1948
02:19:30,951 --> 02:19:32,536
You pick it, Mikey.
Nothing too slow.

1949
02:19:32,912 --> 02:19:33,745
Start us up.

1950
02:19:37,498 --> 02:19:39,831
-How many songs do you know?
-One.

1951
02:19:45,667 --> 02:19:50,336
"Walk...like...a...man!"

1952
02:19:53,337 --> 02:19:55,337
"Walk like a man..."

1953
02:19:55,505 --> 02:19:56,713
"...fast as you can..."

1954
02:19:57,214 --> 02:20:00,546
"Walk...like a man, my son..."

1955
02:20:01,674 --> 02:20:04,924
"Go tell the world...
forget about the girl!"

1956
02:20:05,216 --> 02:20:06,925
Don't forget about the girl!

1957
02:20:21,181 --> 02:20:23,515
On March 16, 1984...

1958
02:20:23,682 --> 02:20:26,808
John Reilly's bloated body was found
face up in a tenement building...

1959
02:20:27,307 --> 02:20:29,600
...right next to the bottle of
boiler gin that killed him.

1960
02:20:30,184 --> 02:20:33,894
At the time of his death, he was a
suspect in five unsolved homicides.

1961
02:20:34,271 --> 02:20:36,687
He was two weeks past
his 29th birthday.

1962
02:20:41,730 --> 02:20:45,190
Thomas Marcano died on July 26, 1985.

1963
02:20:45,357 --> 02:20:47,816
He was shot at close range 5 times.

1964
02:20:48,191 --> 02:20:50,609
The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.

1965
02:20:51,068 --> 02:20:54,236
There was a crucifix and a picture
of Saint Jude in his pocket.

1966
02:20:54,611 --> 02:20:56,070
He was 29 years old.

1967
02:20:58,445 --> 02:21:01,530
Michael Sullivan lives in a small
town in the English countryside...

1968
02:21:01,698 --> 02:21:03,364
...where he works part-time
as a carpenter.

1969
02:21:04,072 --> 02:21:06,907
He no longer practices law,
and he has never married.

1970
02:21:07,575 --> 02:21:09,284
He lives quietly and alone.

1971
02:21:12,076 --> 02:21:16,244
Carol still works for a Social Service
agency and lives in Hell's Kitchen.

1972
02:21:16,786 --> 02:21:17,911
She has never married...

1973
02:21:18,286 --> 02:21:20,912
...but is a single mother supporting
a growing 12-year-old son.

1974
02:21:22,121 --> 02:21:26,456
The boy, John Thomas Michael
Martinez, loves to read...

1975
02:21:26,915 --> 02:21:28,500
...and is called Shakes by his mother.

1976
02:21:31,459 --> 02:21:34,960
It was our special night, and we
held it for as long as we could.

1977
02:21:35,501 --> 02:21:36,876
It was our happy ending.

1978
02:21:37,877 --> 02:21:40,296
And the last time we would
ever be together again.

1979
02:22:29,857 --> 02:22:31,982
The future lay sparkling ahead...

1980
02:22:32,357 --> 02:22:34,524
...and we thought we would
know each other forever.
