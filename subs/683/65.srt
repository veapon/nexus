00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,910
I need a good number-two man, I want to make Brad my deputy commander.

163
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,010
You clear it with Ike?

164
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,910
All right, thanks, Bedell.

165
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,510
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower anymore, you're working for me.

166
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,210
-Okay? -Fine, okay.

167
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,910
Dick. You got those stars?

168
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,810
-Yes, sir. -Let's get them on.

169
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,210
What's the matter, Brad? I've been nominated by the president.

170
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,010
I know, but it doesn't become official until it's approved by the Senate.

171
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,010
Well. . .

172
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,210
. . .they have their schedule and I have mine.

173
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,710
George. . .

174
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,110
. . .if you were named admiral of the Turkish Navy. . .

175
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,610
. . .I believe your aides could dip into their haversacks. . .

176
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,910
. . .and come up with the appropriate badge of rank.

177
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,910
Anyway, congratulations. Premature congratulations.

178
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,610
You know. . . .

179
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,110
I think those stars look better on a green shirt.

180
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,010
Did I ever tell you about the time I designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

181
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,310
It was green leather, it had red stripes. . .

182
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,310
. . .and sort of a row of brass buttons down across here.

183
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,510
And topped off by a gold football helmet.

184
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,110
The Army rejected it, of course.

185
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,710
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

186
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,010
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

187
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,510
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

188
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,710
George, there's one other thing I put in my Kasserine report.

189
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,810
Some of our boys were just plain scared.

190
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,810
That's understandable.

191
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,810
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out.

192
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,710
I can remember. . .

193
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,510
. . .when nothing frightened me as much as the idea of. . .

194
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,210
. . .a bullet coming straight for my nose.

195
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,610
I don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose. . .

196
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,110
. . .was more horrible than any other possibility.

197
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,810
Well, I can understand that, with such a handsome nose.

198
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,010
You want to know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it?

199
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,210
Blind man could see it in a minute.

200
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,410
They don't look like soldiers. They don't act like soldiers.

201
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,310
Why should they fight like soldiers?

202
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,810
You're absolutely right. The discipline's pretty poor.

203
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,810
ln about 1 5 minutes we're going to start turning these boys. . .

204
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,710
. . .into fanatics, razors.

205
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,410
They'll lose their fear of the Germans.

206
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,910
I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.

207
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,310
Up bright and early, general? Breakfast?

208
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,710
Have all my officers finished breakfast?

209
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,010
We're open from 6 till 8.

210
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,610
Most of the officers are just coming in, sir.

211
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,310
Please inform these officers the mess hall is closed.

212
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,310
But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.

213
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,310
From now on, you will open at 6 and no one will be admitted after 6: 1 5.

214
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,910
Where are your leggings?

215
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,910
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir, I'm a cook.

216
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,210
You're a soldier.

217
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,210
$20 fine.

218
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,610
Gentlemen. . .

219
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,510
. . .from this moment any man. . .

220
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,810
. . .without leggings, without a helmet, without a tie. . . .

221
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,910
Any man with unshined shoes or soiled uniform. . .

222
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,810
. . .is going to be skinned.

223
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,710
This is a barracks. It's not a bordello.

224
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,310
(CHATTERING)

225
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,610
-Good morning. -Good morning, sir.

226
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,510
Doctor.

227
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,810
Sir.

228
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,310
I understand you have two cases of self-inflicted wounds.

229
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,810
Yes, sir, we do.

230
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,610
Get them out of here.

231
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,210
One has developed a serious infection.

232
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,610
I don't care if he dies, just get him out of here.

233
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,310
Doesn't belong in the same room with men wounded in battle.

234
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,410
-I'll see that they're moved. -One more thing.

235
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,910
There'll be no "battle fatigue. " That's an order.

236
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,510
Battle fatigue is a free ride to the hospital.

237
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,810
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

238
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,210
Yes, sir.

239
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,810
Doctor. . . . Where's your helmet?

240
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,710
I don't wear a helmet in the hospital.

241
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,910
Start.

242
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,210
I can't use my stethoscope when I'm wearing my helmet.

243
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,110
Well. . .

244
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,110
. . .then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can.

245
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,910
And get those yellow-bellies out of here, today.

246
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,710
Hold it.

247
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,810
Turn right, here.

248
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,110
The battlefield is ahead.

249
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,610
Don't argue. I can smell a battlefield.

250
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,410
He was out here yesterday.

251
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,410
It's over there. Turn right, damn it.

252
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,410
It was here.

253
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,410
The battlefield was here.

254
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,510
The Carthaginians defending the city. . .

255
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,010
. . .were attacked by three Roman legions.

256
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,110
They were brave, but they couldn't hold. They were massacred.

257
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,210
Arab women. . .

258
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,810
. . .stripped them of their tunics and their swords and lances.

259
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,410
The soldiers lay naked in the sun. . .

260
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,810
. . .2000 years ago.

261
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,810
I was here.

262
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,510
You don't believe me.

263
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,910
You know what the poet said:

264
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,510
"Through the travail of ages

265
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,310
It's the pomp and toils of war

266
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,210
Have I fought and strove and perished

267
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,410
Countless times upon the star

268
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,110
As if through a glass and darkly

269
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,910
The age-old strife I see

270
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,010
Where I fought in many guises Many names

271
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,310
But always me. "

272
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,310
You know who the poet was?

273
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,310
Me.

274
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:19,079
Sir, the interrogation reports on the American prisoners...

275
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,790
...captured in our victory at Kasserine.

276
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:27,462
They are not very good soldiers, these Americans.

277
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:31,550
I'm not so sure...

278
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,678
...after only one battle.

279
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:41,143
Their tanks were no match for our guns.

280
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:43,770
And neither was their leadership, sir.

281
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:51,737
At Kasserine they were not under American command.

282
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:54,489
They were under the British General Anderson.

283
00:31:55,198 --> 00:32:00,620
British commanders and American troops... the worst of everything!

284
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:05,292
I remind you that Montgomery is a British Commander.

285
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,920
And he has driven us half way across Africa.

286
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:13,717
Anyway, we have met the Americans for the first time and defeated them.

287
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:15,761
I'm optimistic.

288
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:18,930
You can afford to be an optimist, I can't.

289
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,610
There's an opportunity for us to mount an offensive.

290
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,910
We've concentrated on the flank. . .

291
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,110
. . .draw strength from the British.

292
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,610
It appears now that we could. . .

293
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,710
. . .split the African corridor.

294
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,410
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

295
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,710
I'm sorry, but that territory has been reserved. . .

296
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,210
. . .for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

297
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,310
We're supposed to let him win this one no matter what.

298
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,110
They're entitled to have their hero.

299
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,610
Montgomery did push Rommel clear across North Africa.

300
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,110
What about the Americans? Don't they need a hero too?

301
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,610
You have anybody in mind?

302
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,210
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham is here with General Buford.

303
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,910
Excuse me, gentlemen. . .

304
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,110
. . .while I ask our British friends what's happened to our air cover.

305
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,810
BRADLEY: Harry.

306
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,410
How are you?

307
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,710
George. Good to see you.

308
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,810
-You know Arthur Coningham. -Sir Arthur.

309
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,510
Delighted to see you.

310
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,810
I've heard so much about you.

311
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,310
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a slight misunderstanding here. . .

312
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,710
. . .and Ike thought we should fix it.

313
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,010
No, no. No misunderstanding.

314
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,110
We're supposed to have Allied air cover and we don't.

315
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,010
German planes are strafing my troops.

316
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,410
lf I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate.

317
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,310
Report? Three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car. . .

318
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,310
. . .ran my ass into a ditch.

319
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,610
My staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy. . .

320
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,610
. . .everywhere in the Mediterranean.

PATTON: When I complained about air cover. . .

322
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,910
. . .you said our troops were not battleworthy.

323
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,010
You spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi. . .

324
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,210
. . .for lack of success on the ground.

325
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,110
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery, I don't have to stand for that.

326
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,010
I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it.

327
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,810
And I promise you one thing, general:

328
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,310
You will see no more German planes.

By God, that's enough!

00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,510
Get that thing out of here!

336
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,710
Come on, you bastards, take a shot at me on the nose!

337
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,510
Get back in here, George! We need a corps commander, not a casualty.

338
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,110
CONINGHAM: How'd you manage to stage that?

339
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,610
I don't know. . .

340

. . .I'd give them each a medal.

PATTON: Can't get over how cold it gets in the desert.

343
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,610
Awfully cold, sir.

344
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,610

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,010
. . .if I had my way, I'd send that genius son of a bitch. . .

. . .an engraved invitation in iambic pentameter:

349
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,110
A challenge in two stanzas to meet me alone in the desert.

350
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,210
I'll deliver it.

351
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,510
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.

352
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,010
We'd stop about 20 paces. We'd get out, we'd shake hands. . .

353
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,010
. . .then we'd button up and do battle, just the two of us.

354
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,410
That battle would decide the outcome of the war.

355
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,310
It's too bad jousting's gone out of style.

356
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,310
It's like your poetry, general.

357
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,210
It isn't part of the 20th century.

358

You're right, Dick.

The world grew up.

360
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,210
Hell of a shame.

361
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,110
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard put around this area.

362
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,710
lf we don't, the Arabs will dig them up for their clothes.

363
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,410
Yes, sir.

364

Come with me, Steiger.

369
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:05,855
Field Marshal Rommel... I hope you are feeling better...

370
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:12,987
Captain Steiger has been assigned to research General Patton.

371
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:16,241
Very well. What do you have for me?

372
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:24,958
General Patton comes from a military family.

373
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,377
His grandfather was a hero of the American Civil War.

374
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,465
He was educated at the Virginia Military Institute and West Point.

375
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:35,635
You're not telling me anything about the man.

376
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,556
He writes poetry and believes in reincarnation.

377
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,268
He's one of the richest officers in the American Army.

378
00:40:44,018 --> 00:40:47,063
He prays on his knees, but curses like a stable boy.

379
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:50,817
He has one standing order. "Always take the offensive, never dig in".

380
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:02,370
In 15 minutes we meet with the F¨¹hrer.

381
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:06,666
He will want to know how you plan to deal with Patton's forces.

382
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,423
I will attack and annihilate him!

383
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:17,635
Before he does the same to me.

384
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,610
General.

385
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,310
General?

386
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,110
We intercepted a German radio message.

387
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:50,210
Rommel's 1 0th Panzer is going to hit us near El Guettar.

388
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,910

00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,210
Now I'm going to do it.

393
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,510
Look.

394
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,510
Battalion strength at least.

395
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,910
They haven't spotted our positions yet.

396
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,010
They'll get an education in about 1 0 seconds.

397
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,010
Wait till they get a dose of that artillery fire.

398
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,210
Commence firing. Fire at will.

399
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,410
Commence firing. Fire at will. Commence firing. Fire at will.

400
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,110
What a hell of a waste of fine infantry.

401
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,610
-Get General Bradley on the radio. -Yes, sir.

402
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,010
Sir, I can't raise him.

403
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,810
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's where we hold them by the nose. . .

404
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,910
. . .and kick them in the ass. Go on.

405
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,810
Put him in my car.

PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson was a fine boy.

410
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,810
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.

411
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,210
I am terribly sorry.

412
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,710
There are no coffins here since there is no wood.

413
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,510
We will have a trumpeter and an honor guard...

414
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:55,110
...but we will not fire the volleys as people would think an air raid was on.

415
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:15,710
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair in a letter to his mother.

416
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,510
He was a fine man...

417
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,810
...and a fine officer.

418
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,910
And he had no vices.

419
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,510
I shall miss him a lot.

420
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,910
I can 't see the reason such fine young men get killed.

421
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:54,110
There are so many battles yet to fight.

422

...at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.

425
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:23,710
For the first time in this war, Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands.

426
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,710
Meanwhile, General Montgomery, hero of El Alamein...

427
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,910
...continues to lead his victorious British 8th Army...

428
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,310
...in a relentless drive against Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.

429
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,481
It is obvious that North Africa will soon be lost.

430
00:54:42,564 --> 00:54:45,359
We must now anticipate the enemy's next move.

431
00:54:45,776 --> 00:54:50,864
I shall expect a staff report within 24 hours. That will be all.

432
00:54:57,663 --> 00:55:01,208
Steiger, you have said nothing.

433
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,210
I wasn't asked anything.

434
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:07,923
I'm asking you now. You think Patton will attack Sardinia?

435
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,710
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)

436
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:10,426
And why not?

437
00:55:11,718 --> 00:55:15,889
Patton, sir... is a military historian.

438
00:55:16,473 --> 00:55:21,145
He knows that Sicily, not Sardinia, has always been the key to Italy.

439
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:26,984
If Patton has his way he will attack Sicily at Syracuse, as the Athenians did.

440
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:29,194
Steiger, this is the twentieth century!

441
00:55:29,403 --> 00:55:33,073
But you must understand, sir... Patton is a sixteenth-century man.

442
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:34,366
May I read an example?

443
00:55:38,078 --> 00:55:42,499
"On a dark street in New York 1922, wearing white tie and tails...

444
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:46,628
"...Patton saw three men pushing a young girl into the back of a truck.

445
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:49,339
"He leaped out of his car, produced a revolver...

446
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:53,093
"...and forced the men at gunpoint to release the girl".

447
00:55:55,804 --> 00:55:59,057
It turned out that the girl was the fianc¨¦e of one of the men.

448
00:55:59,975 --> 00:56:02,436
They were merely helping her into the truck.

449
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:09,151
What could be more revealing?

450
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:11,236
I don't know what you¡¯re talking about.

451
00:56:11,987 --> 00:56:17,117
Don Quixote encounters six merchants of Toledo and saves Dulcinea's virtue!

452
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:19,077
Who the devil is Dulcinea?

453
00:56:19,953 --> 00:56:21,079
Don't you see, sir?

454
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:25,834
Patton is a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times.

455
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:28,337
The secret of Patton is the past.

456
00:56:29,671 --> 00:56:34,134
He'll urge an attack on Sicily because that's what the Athenians did!

457
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,710
General Bradley's done a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.

458
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,010
He's moved into Bizerte and taken over 41 ,000 prisoners.

459
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:48,810
Good. Very good.

460
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,410
You're not surprised, are you? After all, you trained that outfit.

461
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,010
-Excuse me, general. -Hm?

462
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,810
This is interesting. We've discovered Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.

463
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,810
-Who says so? -G2, sir.

464
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,410
When we took 1 0th Panzer, Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?

465
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,810
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.

466
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,610
Also, Hitler probably retained Rommel in Berlin. . .

467
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,210
. . .because things were going badly for the Africa Corps.

468
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,210
He didn't want his favorite general to lose face.

469
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,010
I'm my favorite general, and I don't like to be told. . .

470
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,810
. . .that some second-stringer is up against me. Then I lose face.

471
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,210
Who the hell are you, anyway?

472
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,010
CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Your new aide.

473
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,010
Codman. I pulled your name off the list because I know your family.

474
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,410
I'm glad you did, sir.

475
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,210
Rommel is the best the krauts have, and I kicked the hell out of him.

476
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,410
Now my own G2 section is telling me he wasn't even there.

477
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,810
But, general, he undoubtedly planned the German battle.

478
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:06,210
lf you defeat Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel. lsn't that true?

Codman. . . .

480
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,010
-Have a drink with me tonight. -Yes, sir.

481
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,010
I have a plan for the invasion of Sicily.

482
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,210
I want to make sure I get it approved. You can help me.

483
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,210
I want to give a dinner for General Alexander.

484
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,810
Get to him before Montgomery does.

485
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:31,210
This will be strictly a formal affair, Codman, but purely social.

486
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,210
By that I mean. . .

487
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,610
-. . .purely political. -Yes, sir.

488
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,610
I want the finest food, the best wine available. Everything, comme il faut.

Thank you.

00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,410
George, this is really splendid wine.

494
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,810
Thank you, Arthur.

00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,210
Thank you.

Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades in the Peloponnesian War. . .

497
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,810
. . .41 5 B.C.

498
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,810
He said, "lf Syracuse falls, all Sicily falls, and then ltaly. "

499
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:35,610
He knew that Syracuse was the jugular of the island.

500
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,610
Old Alcibiades always went for the throat.

501
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,010
I propose to take Sicily in the same way.

502
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:44,410
-How's it going? -The old man has them in his pocket.

503
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,010
PATTON: Now, according to my plan. . .

504
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,210
. . .General Montgomery will land here.

505
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,010
I'll hit the beaches here, take Palermo.

506
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,610
Monty will drive north on the coast, I'll come due east. . .

507
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,410
. . .take Messina and cut off the German escape route.

508
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,410
Yes. . . .

509
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,810
It looks like an interesting plan.

510
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,610
Well, gentlemen, to the conquest of Sicily.

511
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,610
ALEXANDER: To the conquest of Sicily.

512
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,010
OFFICERS: To Sicily!

513
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,010
George, you'd have made a great marshal for Napoleon. . .

514
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,810
. . .if you'd lived in the 1 8th century.

515
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,410
But I did, sir. I did.

516
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,210
Morning. Is General Smith in?

517
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,410
MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory. -Thank you.

518
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,410
-Ah, there you are, Bedell. -Monty.

519
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,610
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of thought to the Sicily operation.

520
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,010
Yes?

521
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,410
I assume we're alone.

522
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:29,010
Georgie Patton has already discussed his plan with Alexander.

523
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,410
I realize that. . .

524
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,610
. . .but I have an idea that his plan may lead to an absolute disaster.

525
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,210
Oh?

526
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,010
Bedell, look.

527
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,410
This is Sicily.

528
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,010
Now then, according to Patton's plan. . .

529
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,810
. . .I will attack Syracuse here.

530
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,610
And he would attack Palermo up here.

531
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,210
Now, obviously our forces would be divided.

532
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,010
And obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal.

533
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:02,810
Now then, what I propose, and what I shall insist on, by the way. . .

534
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,410
. . .is this.

535
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,410
(MONTGOMERY EXHALES)

536
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,410
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

537
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,410
But the Americans-- The Americans will land here, at Gela.

538
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:18,410
I will advance north to Messina, the Americans protecting my flank.

539
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,810
After all, Messina is the key.

540
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,610
It's the reason for invading Sicily.

541
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,410
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

542
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,210
I'm sure he'll give it serious consideration.

543
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,810
-Amusing, isn't it? -What?

544
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,810
That the plans for the invasion of Sicily. . .

545
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,810
. . .should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory.

546
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,610
George, I have bad news for you about your Sicily plan.

547
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,810
Ike has turned it down.

548
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:54,610
Since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time. . .

549
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,410
. . .and the German resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

550
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,010
-Well, where do my people land then? -In the Gulf of Gela.

551
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,010
There's nothing there but a beach.

552
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:10,210
Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery.

553
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,210
Where does Montgomery land?

554
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:17,610
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

555
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,210
And you'll be alongside, protecting his left.

556
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,810
I see.

557
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:29,010
ln other words, we get the burden again while good old Monty gets the glory.

558
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:32,210
Ike had to consider all points of view.

559
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,810
He made his decision not as an American, but as an Ally.

560
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:40,210
Had it been the other way around, I assure you, Monty would protest.

561
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,810
No. . .

562
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,410
. . .I've been in the Army 30 years.

563
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:51,210
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir. " And I do my best to carry it out.

564
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,410
This is what happens when your commander stops being an American. . .

565
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,010
. . .and starts being an Ally.

566
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,888
Here's the gangster Patton, landing at Gela with his Seventh Army.

567
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:19,975
This film was captured after the landing.

568
01:04:24,646 --> 01:04:26,773
I didn't realize he was so tall.

569
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:29,192
Over six feet.

570
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:40,704
He's constantly giving personal commands.

571
01:04:40,912 --> 01:04:45,000
Obviously they now have two prima donnas in Sicily... Montgomery and Patton!

572
01:04:54,259 --> 01:04:56,428
There's another three-star general.

573
01:04:57,012 --> 01:05:00,432
General Bradley...Commander of the American II Corps.

574
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,642
He looks like a common soldier.

575
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:05,645
He is most capable, yet unpretentious.

576
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:07,439
Unusual for a general.

577
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:10,525
Sorry...

578
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,210
I don't think I've made myself clear, sir.

579
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:19,010
It's true, Montgomery met the toughest resistance there at Catania.

580
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,210
However, if we're--

581
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,010
Perfectly clear.

582
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,010
Old Monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper.

583
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,210
But this order from General Alexander. . .

584
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:33,210
. . .directing you to turn over the Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

585
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,810
Well, then, old Bradley will have to slug-- slug, mind you. . .

586
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:41,810
. . .his way up center of the island over those tough mountain roads, won't he?

587
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,410
Yes, sir.

588
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,810
Messina, Bell.

589
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,410
Messina. . .

590
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,410
. . .is the heart of it. lf they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

591
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,010
I'd cut off the retreat of every German on this island!

592
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:58,210
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

593
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,810
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

594
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:04,010
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina if it's the last thing I ever do!

595
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,410
Hey, what's all this talk about taking the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

596
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,010
General Alexander's orders. Road goes to Montgomery.

597
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,810
Now, that road was assigned to me.

598
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,410
How can I get north without it? You know the terrain there.

599
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:25,810
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run into tough opposition. Very tough.

600
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:32,010
You wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you?

601
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

602
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,210
Without that road, your army, except for my 2nd Corps. . .

603
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,810
. . .would be out of a job.

604
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,410
Free for you to go into Palermo.

605
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,810
Who said anything about Palermo?

606
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,010
I can read a map.

607
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,610
Does Alexander know you've pushed out this far?

608
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,410
That's a reconnaissance in force.

609
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:57,810
George. . .

610
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,010
. . .are you saying I've got to slug it out in those mountains. . .

611
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,410
. . .with heavy resistance?

612
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,810
Just so you can make a bigger splash than Monty?

613
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,810
General. . .

614
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,010
. . .I just follow my orders.

615
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,610
Like the simple old soldier I am.

616
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,210
General Bradley.

617
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,210
Sir, General Alexander has heard we're moving west.

618
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:26,810
He says here, "Stop immediately. Go no farther than Agrigento.

619
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,010
Repeat. Stop, immediately. "

620
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,010
That's what you think it says.

621
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:36,210
I think it was garbled in transmission.

622
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,110
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

623
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,410
That'll take half a day at least.

624
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:42,810
Yes, sir.

625
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,610
Now, Brad.

626
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:52,810
Where were we?

627
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:57,210
We were talking about a simple. . .

628
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,410
. . .old soldier.

629
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,210
Look at that, gentlemen.

630
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,210
Compared to war. . .

631
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,010
. . .all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance.

632
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,210
Let's go, sergeant. Move out!

633
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:34,010
Give me that helmet.

634
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:38,410
Come on, let's get out of here!

635
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,910
What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation?

636
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,810
I don't know, but they ought to hang him.

637
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,410
PATTON: Afternoon, Padre.

638
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:12,210
PADRE: These men are here from the States, looking over our program. . .

639
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,410
. . .for the spiritual welfare of the men.

640
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,210
We'll take you right into Palermo.

641
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,610
Col. David toured us around your quarters. . .

642
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:23,410
. . .and I saw a Bible by your bed. Do you actually find time to read it?

643
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:25,610
I sure do.

644
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,810
Every goddamn day.

645
01:10:31,262 --> 01:10:32,889
Sir, the Americans have taken Palermo!

646
01:10:33,473 --> 01:10:34,599
Damn!

647
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,210
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

648
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,410
Damn!

649
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,010
(CHEERING)

650
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:08,110
(BAND PLAYS)

651
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,210
Palermo's the most conquered city in history.

652
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,410
First the Phoenicians. . .

653
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,410
. . .the Romans, Carthaginians, Byzantines.

654
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,410
Then came the Arabs. . .

655
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,210
. . .Spaniards, Neapolitans.

656
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,810
Now comes. . .

657
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:31,010
. . .the American Army.

658
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,210
This is from General Alexander, sir. . .

659
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:46,610
. . .reminding you that you are not to take Palermo.

660
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,210
Send him a message, Cod.

661
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:51,810
Ask him if he wants me to give it back.

662
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:40,010
PATTON: Let me ask you a question for a change.

663
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,210
You've just come from Washington.

664
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,010
How do they feel about our boys taking Palermo?

665
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:49,410
The general impression is, your army barreled through token resistance. . .

666
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,010
. . .while Montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting.

667
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,010
Don't they know we took on the Hermann Göring division?

668
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,810
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

669
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,010
The people at home are interested in you.

670
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,610
They're curious about your pearl-handle revolvers.

671
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,810
They're ivory. Only a pimp from a New Orleans whorehouse. . .

672
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,810
. . .would carry a pearl handle.

673
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,610
What about your language?

674
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,010
When I want it to stick, I give it to them loud and dirty.

675
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,010
What do your troops feel about that?

676
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:17,610
I don't want these men to love me. I want them to fight for me.

677
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:22,010
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret weapon here: General Bradley.

678
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,210
Ernie calls him "The GI General. "

679
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,610
Omar Bradley is no secret. He's a damn fine commander.

680
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,010
MAN: What's your feeling about Montgomery?

681
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,410
PATTON: He's the best general the English have.

682
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:36,210
He seems more concerned with not losing than he does about winning.

683
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,610
He's not aggressive enough, is that correct?

684
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,010
Look, I've been getting into a lot of trouble lately.

685
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:46,210
Yesterday, the office told me that my Italian prisoners. . .

686
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,210
. . .didn't have enough latrine.

687
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,810
They didn't know what a latrine was till I showed them.

688
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:55,410
lf I've said anything too critical of my British colleague. . .

689
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,210
. . .let's forget about it.

690
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:00,210
I will tell you one thing, though. Off the record.

691
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,810
I'm gonna beat that. . .

692
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,010
. . .gentleman to Messina.

693
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,610
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what this madman Patton is saying?

694
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:19,010
He's going to save our skins by taking Messina.

695
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,410
This report might interest you.

696
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:25,210
Here I am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria and Germans. . .

697
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,810
. . .while he's taking Palermo and getting all the glory.

698
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:31,810
Well!

699
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,610
Now he's up against three good German divisions and he's stuck.

700
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,810
He's not going to get Messina.

701
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:41,410
That's reserved for the British 8th Army and me.

702
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,610
(BOMBS EXPLODING)

703
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:52,210
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.

704
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,210
You're bogged down too.

705
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,810
What we need is another end run just to break things loose.

706
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:02,410
-Lucian. How's my fighter? -Fine, George.

707
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,810
Come in, come in. We need another one of your amphibious specialties.

708
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:14,210
Lucian, I want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea. . .

709
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,010
. . .to make a landing up here at Brolo behind the kraut lines.

710
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,610
You want me to do a land-based attack.

711
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,010
Right. I want a coordinated attack the morning of the 1 1 th.

712
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,610
I don't think we can make it by the 11 th.

713
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:31,610
-Hell, it's only 1 5, 20 miles. -My boys have been dying for yards.

714
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,010
Hm.

715
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:37,210
Maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to.

716
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:41,210
I recommended you for your DSM in your last promotion.

717
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:44,010
I know what you can do when you put your mind to it.

718
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,210
Excuse me, sir.

719
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:50,610
I'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible.

720
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:55,610
You're too old an athlete to think you can postpone a scheduled match.

721
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,410
You're an old athlete yourself. You know matches are postponed.

722
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:03,810
lf we can't back Lucian up by land, our end run could be a disaster.

723
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,010
Those men might get caught on the beach and cut to pieces.

724
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:11,010
-What's the matter? BRADLEY: All we're saying is. . .

725
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,810
. . .not to rush in until we're ready.

726
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,810
Give him an extra day.

727
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:17,410
Just one more day.

728
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,810
The landing is on.

729
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,610
We're going to Messina.

730
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,210
We're going to get there before Montgomery does.

731
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:29,810
-What's so important about that? -General Truscott. . .

732
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:33,810
. . .if your conscience won't permit you to conduct this operation. . .

733
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:35,810
. . .I'll find somebody who can.

734
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:41,010
General, it's your privilege to relieve me anytime you want to.

735
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,410
This match will not be postponed.

736
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,810
Any questions?

737
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,810
No, sir.

738
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,810
You're a very good man, Lucian.

739
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,810
You want to guard against being too conservative.

740
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,210
Remember what Frederick the Great said:

741
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:08,010
''L 'audace, I'audace! Toujours I'audace!''

742
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:12,210
Go on, have a drink.

743
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:18,210
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking for the next couple of days.

744
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:25,610
lf anything happens to those men, I'd like to be there with them.

745
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,010
You're not going, so forget about it.

746
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,210
You believe Truscott's right?

747
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,210
No.

748
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:41,610
But you're gambling with those boys' lives. . .

749
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,410
. . .just to beat Montgomery into Messina.

750
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,810
lf you pull it off, you're a hero, but if you don't. . . .

751
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:53,610
What happens to them? The ordinary combat soldier.

752
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:58,410
He doesn't share in your dreams of glory, he's stuck here.

753
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:04,010
He's living out every day, day-to-day, with death tugging at his elbow.

754
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,210
There's one big difference between you and me, George.

755
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,010
I do this job because I've been trained to do it.

756
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,610
You do it because. . .

757
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,410
. . .you love it.

758
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:41,210
The men on the beach are catching hell, general.

759
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:45,010
The men are doing their best. We have no replacements.

760
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,810
I can't break through to the coast.

761
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,010
I'm going down there myself.

762
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,610
PATTON: Colonel!

763
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,410
How did he get over there?

764
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,610
PATTON: What the hell are you waiting for?

765
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:15,210
Looking for a place to ford, general.

766
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,410
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

767
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:22,010
PATTON: I've done that. Down there this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

768
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:25,410
Get that outfit cranked up or you'll be out of a job!

769
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:30,610
-And put that helmet on. -Yes, sir.

770
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:47,810
Move it! Let's go!

771
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:01,210
-What's holding up this column? -I don't know, sir.

772
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,610
Planes!

773
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,410
Come on, move it!

774
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,210
Pull up over there.

775
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,210
-Come on. -What's going on here?

776
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,410
Sir, these mules--

777
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:43,810
Jackasses!

778
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:48,410
You let a column get stalled and strafed on account of two jackasses?!

779
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:52,610
(GUNSHOT)

780
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,610
No. No.

781
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:05,210
Now, dump them over the side and clear this bridge!

782
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:55,210
We're pinned down because we can't get air support!

783
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,610
Nobody's getting any air support!

784
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:01,010
Put fire into this battalion, or I'll get somebody who can.

785
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,510
Major!

786
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:04,610
-You the executive officer here? -Yes, sir.

787
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,210
-Your name? -WaIker.

788
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,210
You're now commanding officer.

789
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,810
You've got 4 hours to break through that beachhead.

790
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:13,010
lf you don't make it, I'll fire you.

791
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:27,210
50,000 men on this island would like to shoot that son of a bitch.

792
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,010
Please take me home. Take me home.

793
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:09,410
Please take me home. Take me home.

794
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:38,320
-There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts. " -Yeah, our blood. His guts.

795
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,120
Hi, how are you, son?

796
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,920
Where are you from, Gomez?

797
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,120
California, sir.

798
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,920
Me too.

799
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,320
-Where were you hit? -In the chest, sir.

800
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,320
Well. . .

801
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:13,720
. . .this might be interesting to you. The last German I saw had no chest.

802
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,120
Didn't have any head either.

803
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,320
You get well quickly, son.

804
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,120
What's the matter with you?

805
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,720
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

806
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,120
What did you say?

807
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,520
It's my nerves, sir.

808
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,720
I just can't stand the shelling anymore.

809
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,320
Your nerves?

810
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,920
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

811
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,920
Shut up!

812
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,320
I won't have a yellow bastard crying. . .

813
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,120
. . .in front of these brave, wounded men.

814
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,920
Shut up!

815
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,320
Don't admit this yellow bastard. Nothing wrong with him.

816
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,120
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to fight stink up this place of honor.

817
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,520
You're going back to the front, my friend.

818
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:24,120
You may get shot, you may get killed, but you're going up to the fighting.

819
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,520
Either that or I'll stand you up in front of a firing squad.

820
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,920
I should shoot you myself, you bastard! Get him out of here!

821
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,920
Send him up to the front!

822
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,120
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

823
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,520
I won't have cowards in my army.

824
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,520
I had to kick a few butts. . .

825
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,720
. . .but Truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach.

826
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,320
Have you seen the casualty lists?

827
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,520
Yes, I've seen them.

828
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,120
What's the word from the coast road?

829
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,120
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo, heading toward Messina.

830
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,720
Let's get over there. I want to go in with the troops.

831
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,920
You go ahead, George. I'm not very good at that.

832
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,720
General Bradley. . .

833
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,320
. . .it's time to consider how many casualties we'd have. . .

834
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,920
. . .if we were still crawling on that goddamn road.

835
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,520
Forward, march!

836
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,720
Don't smirk, Patton. I shan't kiss you.

837
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,720
Pity. I shaved close this morning to prepare for getting smacked by you.

838
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,720
Forward, march!

839
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,520
You wanted to see me, George?

840
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,320
Got a letter here from Ike.

841
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,120
I was rereading Caesar's Commentaries last night.

842
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,520
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men.

843
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,320
I was struck by that fact because--

844
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,720
"Despicable. " First time anybody's ever applied that word to me.

845
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,120
Well, at least it's a personal reprimand, it's not official.

846
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,120
The man was yellow. He should've been tried for cowardice and shot.

847
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,720
People have taken a lot worse than a little kick in the pants.

848
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,520
I ruffled his pride a bit. What's that compared to war?

849
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,120
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said I was the greatest general. . .

850
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,920
-. . .since Stonewall Jackson. -Now they draw cartoons about you.

851
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,120
Dirty bastard!

852
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,520
They got me holding a little Gl and kicking him with an iron boot.

853
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,320
You see that, what's on my boot? A swastika.

854
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:52,120
On my boot. An iron boot with a swastika!

855
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,920
"You will apologize to the soldier you slapped. . .

856
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,520
. . .to all doctors and nurses present in the tent at the time. . .

857
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,920
. . .to every patient in the tent who can be reached. . .

858
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,720
. . .and last but not least to the 7th Army as a whole. . .

859
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,920
. . .through individual units, one at a time. "

860
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,720
God, I. . .

861
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,120
. . .feel low.

862
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,720
PATTON: Oh, God...

863
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,720
... Thou art my God.

864
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
Early will I seek Thee.

865
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,520
My soul thirsteth for Thee.

866
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,120
My flesh longeth for Thee in a dry and thirsty land.

867
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,320
So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary.

868
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,720
My soul followeth hard after Thee.

869
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:59,520
But those that seek my soul to destroy it...

870
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,320
...shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

871
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,120
They shall fall by the sword.

872
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,120
They shall be apportioned for foxes.

873
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,320
But the king shall rejoice in God.

874
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,520
Everyone that sweareth by him shall glory.

875
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,720
But the mouth of them that speak lies...

876
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,720
...shall be stopped.

877
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,320
Ten-hut!

878
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,720
PATTON: At ease.

879
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,720
I thought I'd stand up here and let you people see. . .

880
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:59,720
. . .if I am as big a son of a bitch as some of you think I am.

881
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,320
I assure you I had no intention. . .

882
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:12,120
. . .of being either harsh or cruel in my treatment of the. . .

883
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,320
. . .soldier in question.

884
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,120
My sole purpose was to try to restore in him. . .

885
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,320
. . .some appreciation of his obligations as a man. . .

886
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,720
. . .and as a soldier.

887
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,720
lf one can shame a coward. . .

888
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,720
. . .I felt one might help him to regain his self-respect.

889
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,820
This was on my mind.

890
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,720
Now, I freely admit. . .

891
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,120
. . .that my method was wrong. . .

892
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,320
. . .but I hope you understand my motive. . .

893
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,720
. . .and will accept this. . .

894
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,120
. . .explanation. . .

895
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,320
. . .and this. . .

896
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,520
. . .apology.

897
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,120
-Dismissed. -Ten-hut!

898
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,720
Good evening, general. I want to report on a private poll I'm taking.

899
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
What poll?

900
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,120
The fan mail.

901
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,920
Eleven percent con, 89 percent pro.

902
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,720
And that 11 % of protest, in most cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

903
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,520
But the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen.

904
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,320
"I want you to know we're proud our son is serving in your army.

905
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,320
From the newspaper, we're not clear exactly what you did and why. . .

906
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,120
. . .but we want you to know we're for you.

907
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,120
Keep going, and God bless you. "

908
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,720
Keep going, huh?

909
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,520
Where?

910
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,320
I thought you might like a sip of wine, general. It's New Year's.

911
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,520
You didn't celebrate at all last night.

912
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,720
I'm sick of sitting around this. . .

913
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,320
. . .royal doghouse.

914
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,320
We've taken Sicily. I'm ready for a new assignment.

915
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:23,920
Maybe you've got it. Here's a radio message, just came in.

916
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,720
Cod.

917
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,120
I've been relieved.

918
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,520
They've relieved me from command of the 7th Army.

919
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,320
I don't believe it.

920
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,320
Happy New Year.

921
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,520
Just a minute, sir.

922
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,120
Since they're sure to give you another command. . .

923
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,720
. . .isn't it logical they'd relieve you here first?

924
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,120
You mean command of all American troops going into Europe?

925
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,720
It's possible. I know it's been discussed from time to time.

926
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:12,520
The logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else.

927
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:18,520
Sir, I'm going to open this bottle of wine.

928
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,520
No, Sir Cod. . .

929
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:24,120
. . .but if you find a bottle of cognac, I'll help you drink it.

930
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,320
-How you feeling tonight, general? -Not bad, not bad at all.

931
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,520
-Get me some writing paper, will you? -Yes, sir.

932
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,120
Your wife ever give you the devil for not writing?

933
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,720
All the time, sir.

934
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,720
Only I don't write as often as you do. Don't seem to get around to it.

935
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,720
Lucky for us we got them.

936
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,920
Who wants to marry a couple of broken-down old horse captains?

937
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,920
That's what my wife says to me every time I come home, sir.

938
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,920
Why are you up so late, George?

939
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,720
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath or something.

940
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,120
I got this sleeping pill from the doc, just in case you need it.

941
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,120
Sleeping pill!

942
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,720
-What's going on here? -I heard the news, sir.

943
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,320
-They announced it on the radio. -What news?

944
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:30,520
About General Bradley, sir. How they gave him the top American command.

945
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,720
Oh.

946
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,320
Oh, yeah.

947
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,720

01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,420
They promised there wouldn't be any reporters.

1103
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,920
I made a few remarks off the record.

1104
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:39,620
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

1105
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,520
You know how suspicious the Russians are of the British and us.

1106
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,120
I was only trying to be polite to the old ladies.

1107
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:52,620
lf I'd seen the Russians there, I'd have mentioned the sons of bitches.

1108
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:56,120
Bedell, I don't know anything about politics.

1109
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,320
I have no political ambitions.

1110
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:01,520
All I want to do is to command an army in combat.

1111
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:03,820
Well, it's out of our hands now.

1112
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:07,320
Ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff.

1113
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:12,720
Now it's up to General Marshall whether you stay here as a decoy. . .

1114
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:15,120
. . .or he sends you home.

1115
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:19,320
He's a good man.

1116
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,020
At least he's a fair man.

1117
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,320
I'll let it sit with him.

1118
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,820
PATTON: George. . .

1119
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,320
. . .our war is over.

1120
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:45,820
Over, sir?

1121
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:49,720
It's just a question of waiting for the orders now.

1122
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,120
I feel I'm. . . .

1123
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:05,120
I'm destined to achieve some great thing. What, I don't know.

1124
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,920
But this last incident is. . .

1125
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:15,720
. . .so trivial in its nature and so terrible in its effect--

1126
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,920
It can't be an accident. It has to be the work of God.

1127
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,320
Yes, sir.

1128
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:25,420
The last great opportunity of a lifetime. . .

1129
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:30,120
. . .an entire world at war and I'm left out of it?

1130
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,820
No, sir.

1131
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:34,220
God will not permit this to happen!

1132
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:39,120
I am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny!

1133
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,120
His will be done.

1134
01:58:58,820 --> 01:59:02,120
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted...

1135
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:05,020
...a predawn naval bombardment prepares the way...

1136
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:08,320
...for allied soldiers to assault the Normandy beaches...

1137
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:12,120
...and claw out a desperate foothold on the continent of Europe.

1138
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:32,520
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen on D-day or D-plus-1 0. And I said so.

1139
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:36,720
And here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country.

1140
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:41,120
They should pivot the way von Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

1141
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:45,720
Then we might get a chance to do some real broken field running.

1142
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:48,720
But they don't listen to me.

1143
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,320
What a way to enter the continent of Europe.

1144
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:57,020
Along with all the rest of the spare parts.

1145
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:00,320
Sir, everything on this plane is high priority.

1146
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:05,220
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you unless he had something in mind.

1147
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,020
I'll tell you, Cod. I've learned my lesson.

1148
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:13,220
lf I ever do get another chance, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

1149
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,020
I'm gonna play the game.

1150
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,520
lf I forget, you remind me.

1151
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:24,520
-I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs. -Give me a swift kick in the ass.

1152
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:26,820
Yes, sir.

1153
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:50,120
Welcome to France, sir.

1154
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:52,720
Hope the war's still on. Where's the boss?

1155
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:54,220
Right this way, sir.

1156
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:34,920
Patton, haven't seen you since Messina.

1157
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,320
How are you?

1158
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,120
You're doing a splendid job decoying the Jerries.

1159
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,820
You'll forgive me, I'm off to the front.

1160
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,920
Best of everything, old boy.

1161
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:49,620
By the way. . .

1162
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:53,420
. . .intelligence confirms that I'm against Rommel again.

1163
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,620
Rommel.

1164
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,920
Hi, how are you, George?

1165
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,220
-Pretty fair, Brad. How are you? -Fine.

1166
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:13,320
Well. My, my.

1167
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,320
Isn't this plush?

1168
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,420
Looks like you're bucking for archbishop.

1169
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:21,920
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me. George, sit down.

1170
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:26,420
Ike wanted me to talk to you since we can level with each other.

1171
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:28,020
That's right.

1172
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,720
We're making 3rd Army operational when I take over 12th Army group.

1173
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,520
Do I get it?

1174
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,620
I'll be honest with you.

1175
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,620
I've had reservations.

1176
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,520
You've been my senior ever since I left the academy.

1177
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:46,720
You were the boss in North Africa and Sicily and I just thought. . .

1178
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:50,220
. . .well, it might be a problem for us.

1179
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:52,420
It wouldn't bother me.

1180
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,620
There's one other thing.

1181
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,820
We're different kinds of people.

1182
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:59,820
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

1183
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:04,520
With your brains and my screwy ideas, we make a great team, like in Sicily.

1184
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:09,120
Truthfully, if I had been your senior in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

1185
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,120
Brad. . .

1186
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,420
. . .I'm not crawling on my belly to get a command.

1187
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:20,320
For God's sake, get me in this fight.

1188
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:25,320
The only way out of the doghouse is to do something great.

1189
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:27,220
I gotta get back in the war!

1190
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,620
Hitler's own people tried to kill him a few days ago.

1191
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,320
First thing you know, it'll be over and. . . .

1192
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:37,820
I'll. . .

1193
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:43,020
. . .keep my mouth shut. I'll behave myself.

1194
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,720
I give you my word.

1195
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,920
George. . .

1196
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:56,120
. . .I've been working on a plan called Cobra.

1197
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,420
I'd like your opinion.

1198
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:01,020
We've been slugging through hedgerow country. . .

1199
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:04,420
. . .half an acre a day and we've got to find a way out.

1200
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,320
I want to use this road.

1201
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,220
The Saint L?Periers road.

1202
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:11,120
Monty will pin down the enemy forces at Caen.

1203
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:14,920
We'll pulverize an area 3 1 /2 miles wide with bombing.

1204
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,320
Then seven divisions will follow.

1205
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:22,520
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a sweeping end run right across France.

1206
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,720
What do you think?

1207
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:31,320
I think you'll need a screwball old cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

1208
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,220
George. . .

1209
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,920
. . .Ike came to that conclusion in London three months ago.

1210
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:42,920
He what?

1211
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,920
Why, that dirty--! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1212
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,220
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

1213
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:54,620
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

1214
02:04:55,475 --> 02:04:56,893
What's this activity near Coutances?

1215
02:04:57,477 --> 02:05:00,939
Enemy armored forces driving through our defenses at Lessay.

1216
02:05:01,022 --> 02:05:06,361
"American tanks moving rapidly, slicing through to the rear areas".

1217
02:05:06,986 --> 02:05:09,781
This sounds like Patton, Field Marshal.

1218
02:05:10,114 --> 02:05:11,282
Patton is in England.

1219
02:05:11,824 --> 02:05:13,034
Do we know this?

1220
02:05:13,785 --> 02:05:17,622
The landing in Normandy is merely a diversionary maneuver.

1221
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:21,918
The real invasion will come at Calais and Patton will lead it.

1222
02:05:22,210 --> 02:05:26,881
The F¨¹hrer says that the Fifteenth Army is not to be moved to Normandy.

1223
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:30,176
Those men are sitting on the beach at Calais throwing pebbles at each other...

1224
02:05:30,385 --> 02:05:33,930
...while our men are being slaughtered in Normandy.

1225
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:38,476
The Fifteenth Army is waiting for Patton at Calais and he will land there.

1226
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:44,941
You seem perfectly willing to accept this nonsense, Jodl.

1227
02:05:46,025 --> 02:05:47,026
Why?

1228
02:05:50,071 --> 02:05:53,324
Because I am not prepared to dispute the F¨¹hrer.

1229
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:50,020
George could have the courtesy to tell us where he's going.

1230
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:06,620
Good God, look at that. Where you going, general?

1231
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:08,120
Berlin.

1232
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:12,220
I'm going to personally shoot that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

1233
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:15,320
(CHEERING)

1234
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:57,020
Hold it. Hold it!

1235
02:07:58,220 --> 02:07:59,520
This place isn't on the map.

1236
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,620
You know why? We've run clear off the map.

1237
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,920
Give George a headline, and he's good for another 30 miles.

1238
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,220
(HONKING)

1239
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,520
SOLDIER: Atten-hut!

1240
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,820
Hold it!

1241
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:28,620
Pay attention. We're gonna clean this mess up right now.

1242
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:32,520
Let's move this vehicle out this way. This one out this way.

1243
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:35,720
Back that thing up there, and we'll take this one here.

1244
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,420
All right, get up off your ass. Let's go now!

1245
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,120
That's it. That's the way to move.

1246
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:55,220
Good boy. All right, come on.

1247
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,620
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on. That's it!

1248
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,720
That's it! Gun it!

1249
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:03,220
Gun that thing!

1250
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:05,420
Okay, come on.

1251
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,320
Watch it!

1252
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:11,420
Go, go, go! Come on. Hold it up.

1253
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,920
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah. Come on.

1254
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:16,720
That's it.

1255
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,820
Come on, now.

1256
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:23,320
-Chet. -Yeah, will do.

1257
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,820
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming. Hold it up there.

1258
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:34,220
Now come on! Hold it!

1259
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:37,620
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

1260
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:44,520
That's it. Come on.

1261
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,020
Good boy.

1262
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,520
-Hold it up there. -General!

1263
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:53,020
General Bradley wants to have a word with you.

1264
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:56,120
Okay. Come on!

1265
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:01,720
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

1266
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:12,020
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

1267
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:16,220
George this drive has been magnificent. . .

1268
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,420
. . .but I'm sorry to say I have to slow you down.

1269
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:23,720
-What the hell for? -We'll have to cut off your supplies.

1270
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:27,820
Gasoline, ammunition, everything. We're up against new priorities.

1271
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:31,620
-I think I smell Montgomery. -Take it easy, George.

1272
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,920
There are serious issues involved. Political issues.

1273
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:37,020
By God, it is Montgomery.

1274
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:41,220
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs are all in his area.

1275
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:43,520
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

1276
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:47,120
Hitler kills more civilians in London than soldiers.

1277
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,120
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

1278
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:53,520
You give me gasoline and I'll gain ground with it, kill Germans too.

1279
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,720
Give me 400,000 gallons. I'll go to Berlin.

1280
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:57,720
George, I can't do it.

1281
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,820
The Siegfried line is an empty shell.

1282
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,220
They stripped the equipment and sent it east.

1283
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:05,220
It's crawling with cows. I can punch through in two days.

1284
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:08,520
There's no use in arguing with me. It wasn't my idea.

1285
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:10,720
Why did you pick me to command?

1286
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:13,020
I didn't pick you.

1287
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:16,420
Ike picked you.

1288
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,320
George, you have performed brilliantly.

1289
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:24,420
You are loyal, dedicated.

1290
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:27,420
You're one of the best I've got, but you don't know when to shut up.

1291
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:31,320
George, you're a pain in the neck.

1292
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:37,420
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

1293
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:40,020
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

1294
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:41,820
I owe you a lot.

1295
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:46,520
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna. I admit it.

1296
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:50,020
What I can't stand about Monty is, he won't admit it.

1297
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:04,620
(TANK SPUTTERS)

1298
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:18,720
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

1299
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,020
The point tank has run out too.

1300
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,920
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

1301
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:26,820
Yeah, I know.

1302
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,920
PATTON: Were you in command here, captain?

1303
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:33,620
I was in command.

1304
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:38,320
My tank platoon was supporting an infantry company.

1305
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:43,320
Tanks ran out of gas, so we had to fight it out.

1306
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:47,620
We started 1 1 :00 last night.

1307
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:51,220
Finished a couple hours ago.

1308
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:57,720
This morning the fighting was hand-to-hand.

1309
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:48,120
I had a dream last night.

1310
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:53,520
In my dream it came to me. . .

1311
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:57,020
. . .that right now the whole Nazi Reich is mine for the taking.

1312
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:01,620
Think about that, Cod. I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

1313
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,020
Now I have precisely the right instrument. . .

1314
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,920
. . .at precisely the right moment of history and exactly the right place.

1315
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,720
The Saar?

1316
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:14,020
This will change too, very quickly.

1317
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,820
Like a planet spinning off into the universe.

1318
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:19,920
A moment like this won't come again for 1 000 years.

1319
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:22,920
All I need is a few miserable gallons of gasoline.

1320
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:26,920
Right now, the weak spot is here.

1321
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:31,920
In 1 0 days, we could be in Berlin.

1322
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:35,620
What about the fortifications that were done in Metz?

1323
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:39,820
Fixed fortifications, huh?

1324
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:43,020
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

1325
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,220
When mountain ranges and oceans could be overcome. . .

1326
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,620
. . .anything built by man can be overcome.

1327
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:57,020
You know how I'm sure they're finished out there?

1328
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,620
The carts.

1329
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:05,520
They're using carts to move their wounded and the supplies.

1330
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:11,320
The carts came to me in my dream. I couldn't figure it out.

1331
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,520
Then I remembered. . .

1332
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:20,720
. . .that nightmare in the snow. The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

1333
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:23,520
How cold it was.

1334
02:18:27,020 --> 02:18:30,520
They threw the wounded and what was left of the supplies in the carts.

1335
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:33,620
Napoleon was finished.

1336
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:38,620
Not any color left. Not even the red of blood.

1337
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:41,620
Only the snow.

1338
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,020
Look at this, Cod.

1339
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:57,220
I love it.

1340
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,420
God help me, I do love it so.

1341
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:09,220
I love it more than my life.

1342
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:21,520
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated, and French troops lead the way.

1343
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:27,020
The Allies march into the city after four years of Nazi occupation.

1344
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:30,320
The hard-fighting French 2nd Armored Division...

1345
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:33,020
...under Major General Jacques Leclerc...

1346
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,020
...gets an unforgettable welcome...

1347
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:37,620
...as they enter their beloved Paris.

1348
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:44,620
In a powerful drive to the north...

1349
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:48,220
... General Montgomery cuts off and bypasses the French coastal towns...

1350
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:51,020
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.

1351
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:54,420
Pushing on to capture the vital Belgian port of Antwerp.

1352
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:02,320
Meanwhile, the main body of Patton 's army...

1353
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:06,720
...resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.

1354
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,820
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.

1355
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:14,720
It seems that nothing can stop our troops from driving on into Germany.

1356
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:26,720
-Sir, General Bradley on your line. -Good, good.

1357
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:35,520
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead across the Saar.

1358
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:37,120
I'm on my way to Germany.

1359
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,920
Wait a minute, George. There's a lot of trouble up north.

1360
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:45,120
I want you to transfer tank armor to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

1361
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,320
Brad, you can't do that.

1362
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:50,520
George, listen. I don't have time to argue.

1363
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:53,620
There's a lot of enemy activity up around Ardennes.

1364
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:56,220
No, I don't know how serious it is. . .

1365
02:20:56,520 --> 02:21:00,820
. . .but Ike wants us to meet with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

1366
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:02,420
Be there at 1 1 00.

1367
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:04,320
Yes, sir.

1368
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:48,020
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason for us to assume. . .

1369
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:51,020
. . .that the Germans are mounting a major offense.

1370
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:56,320
The weather is awful and their supplies are low.

1371
02:21:57,420 --> 02:22:00,920
The Germans haven't mounted a winter attack since Frederick the Great.

1372
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:06,920
Therefore I believe that's exactly what they're going to do.

1373
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:51,720
I want you to start making contingency plans. . .

1374
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:53,720
. . .for pulling out of our eastward attack.

1375
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:56,820
Changing directions 90 degrees, moving up to Luxembourg.

1376
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,520
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

1377
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:03,820
I want you to plan for three possible axes of attack.

1378
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,920
From Diekirch, due north.

1379
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:10,420
From Orléans to Bastogne.

1380
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:14,220
From Neufchâteau against the German left flank.

1381
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:36,920
We've identified four German armies:

1382
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:42,120
The 7th, the 5th Panzer, 6th SS Panzer and the 1 5th.

1383
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:44,720
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

1384
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:47,820
They've overran two regimens of the 1 06th Division.

1385
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:51,120
And 7500 of our men were forced to surrender.

1386
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:54,120
Our concern is that von Rundstedt. . .

1387
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:58,220
. . .has the 1 01 st Airborne trapped here at Bastogne.

1388
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:05,320
Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area.

1389
02:24:06,220 --> 02:24:09,920
lf we can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive.

1390
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:13,320
lf they take it, we're in serious trouble.

1391
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:16,820
Ike wants to know if anybody can go. . .

1392
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,220
. . .and relieve the 1 01 st before they're torn to pieces.

1393
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,820
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

1394
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,420
At any rate, not for some weeks.

1395
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:30,120
What about you, George?

1396
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,420
I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours.

1397
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:39,120
I'd give myself some leeway.

1398
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,820
Ike wants a realistic estimate, George.

1399
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:46,120
You're in the middle of a fight now. It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

1400
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:48,820
My staff's already working out the details.

1401
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:54,020
Frankly, I don't see how it's possible.

1402
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,620
Not in this kind of weather.

1403
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:00,020
I should have thought you'd want to fall back and regroup.

1404
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:03,020
Not me. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice.

1405
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:04,620
TEDDER: But what about your men?

1406
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:09,120
You can't cart them off 1 00 miles, expecting them to attack without rest.

1407
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:10,920
I trained these men.

1408
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:13,020
They'll do what I tell them to do.

1409
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:16,920
We hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general.

1410
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:22,220

The war shouldn't be over. We should stop pussyfooting about the Russians!

1568
02:43:52,220 --> 02:43:56,020
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why not do it now, when the army's here?

1569
02:43:56,520 --> 02:44:00,120
lnstead of disarming Germans let's get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.

1570
02:44:00,820 --> 02:44:03,120
You better shut up. This line may be tapped.

1571
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:05,120
I don't care. I'll tell you. . .

1572
02:44:05,420 --> 02:44:07,420
. . .we've been fighting the wrong people.

1573
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:11,120
You and I don't have to get involved, you're so soft about it.

1574
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:14,720
Leave it to me. In 1 0 days I'll have us at war with them. . .

1575
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:16,920
. . .and make it look like their fault!

1576
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:20,520
George, you're mad. You're absolutely out of your mind!

1577
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:22,420
Well, I'm no diplomat.

1578
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:25,320
I'm a combat soldier. That's all they understand.

1579
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:29,420
Get Ike to give me the word, and I'll kick them back to Russia!

1580
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:41,220
Shall I call the artist back, sir?

1581
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:45,020
Oh, the hell with it.

1582
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:50,120
Nobody wants to see a picture of me. I'm mad!

1583
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:52,720
Don't you know that?

1584
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:42,720
Field Marshal Montgomery, his majesty is prepared. . .

1585
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:46,520
. . .to receive the next chief of the imperial general staff.

1586
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:01,120
Thank you.

1587
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:03,620
Thank you.

1588
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:05,820
Take care of yourself.

1589
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:07,420
George.

1590
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:23,420
Well, gentlemen. . .

1591
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:28,420
. . .all good things must come to an end.

1592
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:33,620
And the best thing that's happened to me. . .

1593
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:36,220
. . .in my life. . .

1594
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:40,120
. . .has been. . .

1595
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:44,620
. . .uh. . .

1596
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,020
. . .the honor. . .

1597
02:46:47,620 --> 02:46:50,520
. . .and privilege. . .

1598
02:46:52,820 --> 02:46:54,920
. . .of commanding the 3rd Army.

1599
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,120
Goodbye. . .

1600
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,920
. . .and God bless you.

1601
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:30,420
Brad. . .

1602
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:33,220
. . .they've taken the 3rd Army away from me.

1603
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:34,620
I know.

1604
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,220
I thought we could have dinner together tonight.

1605
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:42,920
Thank you, Brad.

1606
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:45,520
That's damn thoughtful. I appreciate it.

1607
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:55,420
Right now, I think I'll take Willie for a walk.

1608
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:04,820
George, look out!

1609
02:48:12,220 --> 02:48:14,620
After all I've been through. . .

1610
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:17,620
. . .imagine getting killed by an oxcart.

1611
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:23,520
No, Brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die.

1612
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:27,820
That's from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war.

1613
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:32,220
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.

1614
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:35,820
In our drive across Europe, we liberated. . .

1615
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:38,120
. . . 1 2,000 cities and towns. . .

1616
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:41,120
. . .and inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties.

1617
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:45,220
I sense from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing.

1618
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:50,120
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators, you name it.

1619
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:52,120
God help us.

1620
02:48:57,420 --> 02:49:00,420
George, I want to say one thing.

1621
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,620
You've done a magnificent job here in Europe.

1622
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:06,920
That's right, George.

1623
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:12,620
That soldier you slapped did more to win the war than any other private.

1624
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:17,620
I'll see you for dinner.

1625
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:19,420
Six-thirty?

1626
02:49:36,020 --> 02:49:37,720
PATTON: For over a thousand years...

1627
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:40,920
...Roman conquerors returning from the wars...

1628
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:45,720
...enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade.

1629
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:50,820
In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals...

1630
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:52,920
...from the conquered territories...

1631
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:58,020
... together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments.

1632
02:49:59,320 --> 02:50:02,820
The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot...

1633
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:06,220
... the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him.

1634
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:10,020
Sometimes, his children, robed in white...

1635
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:13,720
...stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses.

1636
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:17,820
A slave stood behind the conqueror...

1637
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:20,820
...holding a golden crown...

1638
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:24,320
...and whispering in his ear a warning...

1639
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:26,720
... that all glory...

1640
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:29,320
...is fleeting.
