00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,251
... that today, these 15...

316
00:25:55,097 --> 00:26:01,434
... so-called men did not deserve
to wear the hallowed green and gold.

317
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,634
Here's your muti, Madiba.
I warmed the milk tonight.

318
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,177
Ah. You are too good to me, Mary.

319
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:16,213
Your daughter called
to cancel her visit this weekend.

320
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,443
Did she say why?

321
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,454
No, she didn't.
She said to tell you she was sorry.

322
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,183
I see.

323
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,858
Do you need anything else tonight?

324
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,192
No, Mary, thank you. I will go to bed.

325
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,526
Good evening, Dada.

326
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,928
Good evening, Mary.

There you go.

DLAMINl:
God bless you.

333

You're a very lucky boy.
It's a real Springbok practice jersey.

334
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:32,186
I mean, I know it's a bit big,
but it's warm and it'll last forever.

335
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,090
Huh? Come.

Go on, take it, it's yours.

- Lf he wears it, the others will beat him up.

338
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:45,429
Because the Springboks
are playing so badly?

339
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:50,203
No, because for them
Springbok still represents apartheid.

340
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:01,719
And now for the next item on our agenda.

341
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:07,017
The NSC executive proposes a vote
on the following motion:

342
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:11,030
That, as a permanent symbol
of the apartheid era...

343
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,260
...the colors, emblem...

344
00:28:14,436 --> 00:28:20,568
...and the name of the Springboks,
be eliminated immediately.

345
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:27,241
And that all sports teams
representing South Africa...

346
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,982
...shall be known forthwith...

347
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:34,144
...as the Proteas.

348
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:38,225
Now, comrades,
we will submit this motion to a hand vote.

349
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:44,161
And in the event of a close count,
we'll go to a written ballot.

350
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:49,464
All of those in favor of eliminating
the Springboks, raise your hands.

351
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:54,938
- Viva, Proteas, viva!
- Viva!

352
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,840
- Viva, Proteas, viva!

00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,176
- Viva, Proteas, viva!

00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:12,353
Both units to their cars right now.

355
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,995
All right, let's go. Let's do it.

356
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:23,127
BRENDA: What do I tell
the Japanese trade delegation?

357
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,897
MANDELA:
I delegate that decision to you.

358
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:27,303
- Do you want me to inform the VP?
- No.

359
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,740
We should at least include
the minister of sport.

360
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:30,935
No.

361
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,344
I strongly advise against doing this,
especially on your own.

362
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:37,007
It gives the impression
of autocratic leadership.

363
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:40,621
You risk alienating your cabinet
and your party.

364
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:42,313
Your advice is duly noted.

365
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,325
Madiba. The people want this.
They hate the Springboks.

366
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:49,658
They don't want to be represented
by a team they cheered against.

367
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,527
Yes, I know. But in this instance,
the people are wrong.

368
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:56,262
And as their elected leader,
it is my job to show them that.

369
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:58,702
You're risking your political capital.

370
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:01,001
You're risking your future as our leader.

371
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:05,112
The day I am afraid to do that
is the day I am no longer fit to lead.

372
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,816
At least risk it for something
more important than rugby.

373

to Eersterust, very fast.

Let me tell you why.

400
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,572
On Robben Island...

401
00:32:55,083 --> 00:33:01,283
...in Pollsmoor Prison,
all of my jailers were Afrikaners.

For 27 years...

...their poetry.

407
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,736
I had to know my enemy...

...before I could prevail against him.

409

And we did prevail, did we not?

All of us here, we prevailed.

411
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:37,319
Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner.

412
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,823
They are our fellow South Africans...

413
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:46,763
...our partners in democracy.

414
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:52,566
And they treasure Springbok rugby.

If we take that away, we lose them.

what they feared we would be.

We have to be better than that.

But I must.

438

That minority still controls the police,
the army and the economy.

If we lose them,
we cannot address the other issues.

So this rugby
is just a political calculation?

It is a human calculation.

442
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:22,886
If we take away what they cherish...

443
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,619
...the Springboks,
their national anthem...

444
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:31,164
...we just reinforce
the cycle of fear between us.

On the day of a big match, say, a test...

631
00:49:06,387 --> 00:49:10,414
...in the bus on the way to the stadium,
nobody talks.

- Right.

But to hear that song in the voices
of people from all over our planet...

642
00:49:58,506 --> 00:50:02,203
...made me proud to be South African.

and do better.

May I ask, what was the song, sir?

646

Well, it was "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika."

01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:38,833
...to put the finishing touches
to their grueling training program.

785
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:43,271
And I, for one, must admit
to being cautiously optimistic.

786
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:47,903
I say "cautiously"
because in my humble opinion...

787
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:52,313
...this Springbok team
has been over-practiced on the field...

788
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:54,715
...and overcommitted off it...

789
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:59,484
...which makes beating a powerhouse
Australian side in next week's Cup opener...

790
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:03,459
... a tall order, especially as this is
an inexperienced team...

791
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,929
... with a history of coming up short
in big matches.

792
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,227
This is Johan de Villiers,
live in Cape Town...

793
01:02:09,402 --> 01:02:12,132
... returning you to the studio
in Johannesburg.

794
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:17,035
MAN: Thanks, Johan, for the update...
- Around the world, objectively...

795
01:02:17,277 --> 01:02:20,542
...what are they saying
about our chances to beat Australia?

796
01:02:20,714 --> 01:02:23,683
Everyone thinks they'll beat us,
and if they do...

797
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:28,514
...we'll have to go through England
and the All Blacks just to get to the final.

798
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:33,591
So it is very important
that we beat Australia?

799
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:36,822
Thank you.

800
01:02:48,475 --> 01:02:53,708
Madiba? The cabinet ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.

801

Oh, yes. I'll be right out.

802
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:57,441
Thank you, sir.

803
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:43,822
One week, boys.

804
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,470
We want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here.

805
01:03:57,644 --> 01:03:58,872
No problem.

806
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:01,912
We want those two approaches
completely sanitized.

807
01:04:02,082 --> 01:04:03,106
Two approaches?

808
01:04:03,283 --> 01:04:06,844
We're not gonna decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment.

809
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:12,117
We want uniforms, plain-clothes,
sharpshooters.

810
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:13,486
And sniffer dogs.

811

If you need more men, we have an
army unit for you on standby at Silvermine.

We're not going to
take chances, gentlemen.

813
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:23,259
The president is going to be exposed.

814
01:04:24,037 --> 01:04:26,232
Much too exposed.

815

Brenda...

816

...I have been studying.

817

For the summit in Taiwan? Good.

818
01:04:45,258 --> 01:04:48,091
No. Not exactly.

Test me.

820
01:04:50,163 --> 01:04:53,030
They look like thugs.

Did I get them right?

824
01:05:08,548 --> 01:05:10,539
Yes, Madiba.

825
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,351
That's the way I used to study
in law school.

826
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:19,784
Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy
to identify.

827
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:24,623
But that will change. It must.

Yeah, yeah. A little.

834

Make sure everyone's got one.

01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:06,295
What is this?

836
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:09,840
Right. We need to learn this song.
We can't just mouth the words anymore.

837
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,307
Nobody cares as long as
we're winning the matches.

838
01:06:12,479 --> 01:06:14,344
You're wrong, they do care.

839
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:16,709
It's their bloody song, not ours.

840
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:20,614
- Flipping terrorist song, man.
- They used to arrest you for singing it.

841
01:06:20,787 --> 01:06:22,618
Right, and now it's one of our anthems.

842
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:25,883
I can't even read it
or pronounce the words.

843
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:31,628
All right, okes, it's optional.
Take it if you want to.

844
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,034
It means "God Bless Africa."

845
01:06:44,577 --> 01:06:47,375
Which, you have to admit, we could use.

846
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:04,993
Tell us, Mr. President,
have you always been a rugby fan?

847
01:07:05,633 --> 01:07:10,536
People don't realize
that I played rugby myself...

848
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:13,697
...when I was a student at Fort Hare.

849
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:17,868
It is a very rough game,
almost as rough as politics.

850
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:22,448
How do you think the Springboks
will do?

851
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:24,983
Oh, I think they will do very well.

852
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:27,917
Their level of commitment is tremendous.

853
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:32,315
Now, it's been said
that you used to support any team...

854
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:34,461
...that played against the Springboks.

855
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:37,655
Yes, well,
obviously that is no longer true.

856

I am 100 percent behind our boys.

857
01:07:41,035 --> 01:07:46,200
After all, if I cannot change
when circumstances demand it...

858
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:49,275
...how can I expect others to?

859
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:44,196
- Frangois.
- Welcome, Mr. President.

860

Gentlemen.

861

Forgive me for interrupting your work
the day before such an important match.

and wish you good luck in person.

I am allowed to do what I want.

- He's injured, sir.
- Hm?

His hamstring.
We're trying to keep it quiet.

Well, will he be out
for the entire tournament?
