the man is a grade-A mystic.

1320

A true, original mystic
of the highest order.

1321
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:04,335
But his work is garbled and twisted,
and let me tell you...

- Please.

1329
01:46:06,925 --> 01:46:10,339
- I've been reading the new book.
- What do you think?

I think it's wonderful.

- Oh, yes.

1332
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:22,811
Well, as I've begun, I did notice
on page 13 there's a change.

1333
01:46:22,942 --> 01:46:27,617
You've changed the
processing-platform question.

1334
01:46:27,746 --> 01:46:30,284
Now it says,
"Can you imagine...?"

1335
01:46:34,219 --> 01:46:35,324
Yes.

1336
01:46:36,755 --> 01:46:38,393
Yes.

1337
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:45,269
If our previous method was to induce
memory by asking, "Can you recall,"

1338
01:46:45,397 --> 01:46:48,039
doesn't it then change everything
if now we say, "Can you imagine?"

1339
01:46:48,168 --> 01:46:53,277
We are invoking a new, wider range
to account for the new data.

1340
01:46:53,406 --> 01:46:59,288
"Can you imagine," allows for a more
creative pathway to the mind.

1341
01:46:59,411 --> 01:47:01,016

1342

- What do you want?!

02:01:19,141 --> 02:01:20,813
Are you drunk?

1488
02:01:22,611 --> 02:01:24,557
No. No, no.

1489
02:01:29,116 --> 02:01:31,562
You look sick.

1490
02:01:31,686 --> 02:01:33,687
Freddie, you don't look healthy.

1491
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:38,830
I don't look like that.
That's not how I look.

You can't take this life straight,

What do you want?

1496
02:02:01,316 --> 02:02:02,920
I don't know.

1497
02:02:05,353 --> 02:02:08,391
I had a dream...

1498

Where's Elizabeth?

1499
02:02:19,067 --> 02:02:24,175
- DCF.
- Really? What is that?

1500

What did you expect
would happen coming here?

1501
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:36,790
I can take pictures...

1502

We don't need pictures, Freddie.

This is something you do

you figured out where we met.

I went back and I found it.

1523
02:04:52,152 --> 02:04:54,759
I recalled you and I working together...

1524
02:04:56,223 --> 02:04:58,965
...in Paris.

1525
02:04:59,094 --> 02:05:02,132

1527

of the city by Prussian forces.

1528
02:05:08,937 --> 02:05:12,474
We worked and rigged balloons...

1529
02:05:12,607 --> 02:05:16,487
...that delivered mail
and secret messages...

1530
02:05:16,611 --> 02:05:20,218
...across the communications blockade,

1531
02:05:20,348 --> 02:05:23,089
set up by the Prussians.

1532
02:05:23,218 --> 02:05:28,065
We sent 65 unguided mail balloons
and only two went missing.

In the worst winter on record.

1534
02:05:42,304 --> 02:05:43,749
Two.

1535
02:05:52,647 --> 02:05:56,026
If you leave here,
I don't ever want to see you again.

1536
