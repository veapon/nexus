1
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:47,404
传道书云“欢度青春”

2
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:09,210
天，那是我想的东西吗？
Oh, man! ls that what l think it is?

3
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,184
好了，新丁 欢迎来到越南，跟我来
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,525
糟了，有新血
l'll be dipped in shit. New meat!

5
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:26,735
你们会很喜欢越南的，永远的
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

6
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:31,469
365天
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

7
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:44,451
1967年9月B连第25队步兵

8
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,452
在柬埔寨边境附近

9
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,433
下面小心
Watch it below!

10
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,133
莫浩，走快点
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

11
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,168
查理，谁在队尾？
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

12
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:30,087
总部，这是六队 位置如下…
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six, Pos rep follows,'

13
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,420
L、A、W、A、F…
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot...,

14
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,092
华伦，你去队侧
Warren, you get out on flank.

15
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,235
-何迈特 -什么事？
-Hey, Hoffmeister! -Yo?

16
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,504
你有香烟吗？
You got a smoke?

17
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,740
-没有 -没关系
-No, man, l don't. -Sin loi, man.

18
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:48,037
B26，为何延迟了？
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

19
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,745
又找不到路了吗？
Having compass trouble again?

20
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,471
继续走
Get a move on, boy.

21
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,336
你还在等什么？
Boy, what you waiting for?

22
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,043
他不会咬你
He ain't gonna bite you.

23
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,846
那是越南兵，死了
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

24
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,408
-新丁 -新丁
-Cherry. -Yo, cherry!

25
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:32,444
行动，第六队说我们挡住了他们 完毕
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

26
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:35,378
叫他去见鬼吧
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

27
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,418
这是第25队，听好 我们很快便出发，完毕
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

28
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,988
戴，你怎么了？
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

29
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,323
你是个大混蛋
You are one simple son of a bitch.

30
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,960
中士，对不起
l'm sorry, sergeant.

31
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:49,665
叫另外那个新丁过来，葛拿 还有军医
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

32
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,866
葛拿，军医，上前来
Gardner, doc, up!

33
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,694
葛拿，军医，上前来
Gardner, doc, to the front!

34
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,803
葛拿，快过来，你他妈的
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

35
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,171
大胖子，快点
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

36
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,724
-你有没有事？ -蚂蚁
-You all right? -Ants.

37
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,125
我脖子全都是蚂蚁
l got ants all over my neck.

38
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,071
这些是红蚂蚁
You got some red ants.

39
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,066
红蚂蚁是杀手 黑蚂蚁最可怕
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

40
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,940
快点，混球
Hurry up, lard-ass!

41
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,806
我很累
l'm so tired!

42
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,645
只喝一点
Just a little.

43
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,116
不要喝太多 你不要再喝了
Don't drink too much. l don't want you drinking any more.

44
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,619
我不想你抽搐
l don't want you cramping up.

45
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,292
你带着太多东西
You're humping too much stuff.

46
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,597
有一半是不需要的
You don't need half this shit.

47
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,796
我帮你拿
l'll haul it for you.

48
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,003
但请你下次先向我请示
But next time check with me first, all right?

49
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,367
谢谢你，中士
Thanks, sarge.

50
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,216
-你有没有事？ -没事
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

51
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:25,387
这是总部，有直升机接近你们
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

52
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,566
总部，请留意
Bravo Six, be advised.

53
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,838
军资直升机正驶来
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

54
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:41,746
快点搬军火下来
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

55
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:26,852
这个字不是这样写的
lt ain't D-E-R-E. lt's D-E-A-R.

56
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,958
而且莎拉也不是那样写的 笨蛋
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

57
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:34,396
没关系，她会明白我的意思
Don't matter. She know what l mean.

58
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,860
她也不大认识字
She don't read too good nohow.

59
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,702
你看，又是猪肉
Look at this shit! Pork again!

60
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,708
我跟你换你的火鸡 我不能再吃这玩意了
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. l can't eat this shit.

61
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,380
你抽了什么？
What you been smoking?

62
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:58,285
希望你不用洗衣服 你要运动一下
l hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

63
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:01,022
白小子，你在等什么？
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

64
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:03,316
那个洞不会自己出现的
That hole won't dig itself.

65
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,027
快点掘
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

66
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,662
时间无多，快点掘…
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

67
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:14,237
有人写过 “地狱是不可理喻的”
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

68
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,370
这个地方就像地狱
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

69
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:19,833
我只是来了一周但已经讨厌这里
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

70
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,476
祖母，这一周很痛苦
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

71
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:27,247
最辛苦的事就是这星期站岗三次
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

72
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,176
我不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing,

73
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,854
我连越共在我面前出现也不知道
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

74
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,748
我实在很累
I'm so tired,

75
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,291
我们早上五点起床…
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

76
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:42,362
整天走动，四、五点钟扎营 掘壕沟，进食…
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

77
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:46,261
然后整晚埋伏，或是当哨兵
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

78
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:49,198
我是新来的，没有人教我任何事
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

79
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:53,777
没人理会新丁 他们连你的名字也不想知道
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

80
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,674
新丁的生命不重要因他没有经验
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

81
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:03,613
若在越南战死，最好在最初几周
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

82
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,686
原因是你不会受太多苦
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

83
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,050
如果幸运，留在外围防线…
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

84
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:13,592
守卫时能够睡三至四小时
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

85
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,194
但你不能真的入睡
But you don't really sleep,

86
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,707
我认为我撑不到一年
I don't think I can keep this up for a year,

87
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,738
我不应该来这里
I've made a big mistake coming here,

88
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,777
我们有很多活动
We got beaucoup movement.

89
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,256
第三部队在15公里外被袭击
3rd Battalion got hit 1 5 klicks north of here.

90
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,583
越共在树上挂上地雷
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

91
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:46,954
整排军队被炸，真倒霉
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

92
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,471
两个中尉和一个上尉被炸死
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

93
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:55,966
我的天
Jesus.

94
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,039
你想谁去埋伏？
All right, who do you want on ambush?

95
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,239
奕礼，你带你的小队出去
Elias, you take your squad out.

96
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,543
华伦，留下 我需要德斯和小尊
Warren, stay in, but l need Tex and Junior from your squad.

97
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,581
知道
Roger.

98
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,082
调动到20M的位置
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

99
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:15,358
我以为今晚轮到奥尼
l thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

100
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,160
托斯和莫浩经验不足
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

101
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:21,728
福生明天放假，还要他们去吗？
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

102
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,829
你要带新丁去
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

103
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,536
他们什么都不懂 可能会遇到事情，仔细想想
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

104
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,771
太好了，你想我怎样做？
Great. What do you want me to do?

105
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:35,306
你想我为了一个混蛋要好好睡觉 而让手下被杀吗？
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

106
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,612
奥尼…
Hey, O'Neill...

107
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,314
别再罗嗦
...take a break.

108
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,881
你不用每天都这么讨厌
You needn't be a prick every day.

109
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:43,813
奕礼，叫手下准备好
Elias, get your men ready.

110
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,058
他来了三年，以为自己是耶稣
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,485
奥尼，他们留下，但你要去
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

112
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,592
我需要有经验的老兵
l need veterans out there.

113
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,527
彭斯中士？
Sergeant Barnes?

114
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:05,903
在他们面前应由我下命令
l think in front of the men, l need to give the orders.

115
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,109
是，长官
Yes, sir.

116
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,450
看来会下两
Shit, looks like rain.

117
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,189
我们整晚都要在两中了
lt's gonna piss on us all night.

118
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,657
会令你脸烂掉
lt'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

119
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,532
你为那个白人而冒险
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

120
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:32,233
这里是没有公义的
No justice around here.

121
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,165
奥尼又触怒中尉了？
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

122
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,407
为什么总是我们负责埋伏？
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

123
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,574
这是因为他们在玩政治
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

124
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,683
-我有否给你看过露珍的照片？ -没有
-Did l show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

125
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,914
她会是我的另一半
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

126
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:51,846
她也在等我
She's waiting for me too.

127
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,681
她很漂亮，你很幸福
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

128
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,960
你有你女朋友的照片吗？
You got a picture of your girl?

129
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:00,560
那我们有一个被 留在家乡的可怜女孩，不是吗？
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

130
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,695
插进去
Tuck this in.

131
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,400
装进去
Shit-can this.

132
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,271
不需要这个，转身
Don't need this. Turn around.

133
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,800
来吧
Come on.

134
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,446
德斯！跟小尊和戴一队

爸妈不想我来这里
Mom and Dad didn't want me to come here,

144
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,389
他们想我以他们为榜样

145
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,759
受人尊敬、工作勤劳、拥有家庭
Respectable, hard-working, a little house, a family,

146
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:50,471

They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, Grandma, You know Mom,

147
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,575
我一向都备受保护…
Having always been sheltered and special...

148
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,438
我想像其他无名氏一样
...I want to be anonymous like everyone else,

149
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,307
为国家效力
Do my share for my country,

150
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:03,984
就像祖父在一次大战时一样 和爸爸在二次大战时一样
Live up to what Grandpa did in the first war, Dad in the second,

151
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,383
我现在的确是无名氏了

152
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:10,193
和没人在乎的一班人一起
With guys nobody really cares about,

153
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,721
他们来自荒芜的地方
They come from the end of the line,

154
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,793
你从没听过的小镇

若他们幸运，会在工厂找到工作
If they're lucky, a job waiting for them in a factory,

159
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,869
他们大部分都一无所有
Most of them got nothing,

160
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:30,976
他们穷苦而且不受欢迎
They're poor and unwanted...

161
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:33,875
但他们却为我们的 社会和自由而战
...yet they're fighting for our society and freedom,

162
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,387
真奇怪，他们自知是箩底橙
It's weird, They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it,

163
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,188
所以他们自称平凡人
Maybe that's why they call themselves grunts,

164
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,722
因为平凡人什么都能承受
Because a grunt can take it, can take anything,

165
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:48,520
他们是我见过最有真本性的人 祖母

Okay.

174
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,699
或许我终于在泥泞里找到答案
Maybe I finally found it way down here in the mud,

175
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,146
或许我可以从这里重新来过
Maybe from down here I can start up again,

176
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,577
也许我可以骄傲的做个 堂堂正正的虚假人
Be something I can be proud of without faking it, Be a fake human being,

177
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,456
我或许能看见我还没看到的东西 学一些我还没学到的东西
Maybe I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know,

178
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,527
我想你，很想你

告诉妈妈我想念她 基斯上

00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,276
我便可以回加州了
Home to California.

269
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:14,209
我会坐在海滩上看美女
l'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

270
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,816
冲浪一定会很好玩
The surfing's gonna be good.

271
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,318
三月在田纳西州
March, man, in Tennessee.

272
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:25,026
可以闻到松树的气味 可以在河边闻到女人的气味
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

273
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,954
真棒
Hot damn!

274
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:30,456
戴，你还有多少天？
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

275
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,400
-三百什么？ -三十二
-Three hundred and what? -Thirty-two.

276
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,134
332天
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

277
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,305
傻小子
Sin loi, my boy.

278
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:43,304
我不记得那个日子了
l can't even remember when l was 332, man.

279
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:47,947
你要向前数，好像你已来了40天
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

280
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,242
想的乐观些
Think positive, dude.

281
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:55,483
你怎会来这里？你看来受过教育
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

282
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,090
-我自愿来的 -什么？
-l volunteered for it. -You did what?

283
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,395
我自愿来的
l volunteered.

284
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,292
我退出大学，想加入越战
l dropped out of college and told them l wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

285
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:07,330
你自愿来的？
You volunteered for this shit, man?

286
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,265
你能相信吗？
Can you believe that?

287
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,498
你放弃念大学实在太疯狂
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

288
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,440
我在大学什么都学不到
lt didn't make much sense. l wasn't learning anything.

289
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,183
为什么穷人就要去打仗 有钱人就不用？
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

290
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,513
他是个斗士
What we got here is a crusader.

291
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,286
-看来是了 -可恶
-Sounds like it. -Shit.

292
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,293
你一定是很富有才会那样想
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

293
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,162
大家都知道…
Everybody knows...

294
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,561
穷人总是被有钱人欺负
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

295
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:41,529
那是不能改变的事实
Always have, always will.

296
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:49,209
如果你上道 我会介绍一些大头给你认识
lf you be cool, l'll introduce you to some of the heads.

297
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:51,013
什么样的大头？
What are the heads?

298
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,113
晚一点吧
Later, man.

299
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,488
怎么了？
What's up, brother?

300
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:09,288
大人驾到，发生什么事？
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

301
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:13,966
我以为你在柬埔寨
l thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

302
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,610
你为什么在这里？
Why are you in the underworld?

303
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:29,612
这个不是戴，戴中枪了 是基斯，他被救活了
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

304
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,855
戴，你跛了吗？
You lame, Taylor?

305
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:42,995
你是跛的吗？
Are you lame or something?

306
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,796
继续吧，抽一口吧
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

307
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,884
抽一口享受一下吧
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

308
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,712
你好吗？
Hey, man. What's happening?

309
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:09,287
不是那样叫的
lf you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

310
00:31:13,263 --> 00:31:14,730
你很古怪
You're weird, man.

311
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:18,229
你是个孩子，我不会 在你身上浪费时间
You're a child. l don't waste time on you.

312
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:31,407
-第一次吗？ -是
-First time? -Yeah.

313
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,918
那么你一定会上瘾
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

314
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:40,153
感觉好吗？
Feel good?

315
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,255
队，感觉很好 我的脖子不痛了
Yeah, it feels good. l got no pain in my neck now.

316
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,695
感觉很好已足够
Feeling good's good enough.

317
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:00,535
放入口里
Put your mouth on this.

318
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,029
大家在哪里？
Where the hell is everybody, man?

319
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:29,134
大家都正在享受，一群毒虫 他们觉得他们很特别
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

320
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,600
你听，很糟的演奏
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

321
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,337
烦透的噪音，就是那样
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

322
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,910
和你一样那么烦
Make about as much sense as you do.

323
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:42,375
他们都在埋怨…
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

324
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:45,450
埋怨自己没有钱
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

325
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:50,682
去他的！ 给我黑人音乐，开始吧？
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

326
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,655
你干嘛那样说？
What are you talking that shit for?

327
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,829
小尊，你吸食过毒品吗？
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

328
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,064
对
That's right.

329
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:01,962
你们想用毒品荼毒黑人
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

330
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,831
但黑人很快就会推翻你们
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

331
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,940
很简单，释放你的心灵就行 你的身体就会跟随
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

332
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:14,281
明白，你吸那东西 一切会变得离奇
Yeah, l can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

333
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,579
越南人在草丛散布化学毒药
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

334
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:20,321
令我们不再打仗 变成反战者吧
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

335
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:23,592
不用担心，你怎样都是个杀手
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

336
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,487
但我仍然喜欢女人
But l still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

337
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,890
除了赛车，没东西比得上女人
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

338
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,828
只有女人死了遗留她的身体 给你
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

339
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,296
你或许才会有
...and then maybe.

340
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,372
宾尼，你好吗？
How's it going, Bunny?

341
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,167
中尉
L.T.

342
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:44,771
你看
Check it out.

343
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:48,442
你喜欢吗？
You like that?

344
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,245
很棒
Terrific.

345
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,982
我会寄回家
l'll send it home.

346
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,220
小尊
Hey, Junior.

347
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,326
-中尉 -你好
-Lieutenant. -Hello, sir.

348
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,802
罗志杰，你的寺庙很棒

349
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,434
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

350
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,306
-你有什么需要吗？ -没有
-You need anything? -No, sir.

351
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,243
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

352
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,610
这个人比我大三至四倍
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

353
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,644
他被奥尼勒着
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

354
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,579
他不知道要害怕还是瞎了较好
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

355
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,184
-中尉，你认为怎样？ -你好吗，里德？
-What do you say, L.T.? -How you doing, Red?

356
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,458
不好，他拿了所有的好牌
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

357
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:30,953
呼鲁
Full house.

358
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:32,859
你还不错
You're doing all right.

359
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,664
对，我还没开始作弊呢
Yeah, and l ain't even cheating yet.

360
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:40,732
-中尉，要喝酒吗？ -谢谢
-Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? -Oh, thanks, Andy.

361
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,328
中尉，你想玩吗？
Play, lieutenant?

362
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,473
不，我不想被你们强奸
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

363
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,644
为什么？你留着为了谁？
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

364
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:51,879
犹太人？
Jewish?

365
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:59,014
我要走了
l gotta run.

366
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,581
稍后再见，你们玩得高兴点
l'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

367
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:12,401
他真是一个混蛋
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

368
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:18,198
你认为呢？彭？ 他能挨过这场仗吗？
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

369
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:22,437
我也是那样想
l have to say that's precisely what l saw.

370
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,113
我只用看一看他就知道了
Sometimes l just look at a guy, and l know he's not going to make it.

371
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,208
他一定不行
Just no fucking way.

372
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,617
1968年，元旦
New Year's Day, 1 968,

373
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:40,179
又是一天 仍然活着
Just another day, Staying alive,

374
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:45,051
敌军在柬埔寨边境 附近越过边界
Lots of movement near the Cambodian border, NVA regiments moving across,

375
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:47,693
有很多交战和埋伏
A lot of little firefights, ambushes,

376
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:52,525
我们投下炸弹后 像鬼魅般穿越丛林
We drop bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape,

377
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,313
地堡
Bunker.

378
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,549

384
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:04,155
戴，去那边五十米以外
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank, about 50 meters.

385
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,900
华盛顿，你去这边

386
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,232
-是 -海洛，快点
-Yes, sir. -Get off your ass, Harold.

387
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,436
可恶
Shit.

388
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,203
真失望
Bummer!

389
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:09,291
天啊，看看这个 茶壶仍是烫的，他们刚离开
Christ, look at that. The teapot's still boiling. They were just here!

390
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,734
气氛很可怕，我们离开吧
Man, this is spooky, Sander. Let's get out of here.

391
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,415
小心
Watch it, watch it!

392

我们走吧
Come on. Let's go.

398

402
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:43,308
刚才发生爆炸，两个士兵被炸伤
We got two men down, sir. There was an explosion.

403
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,809
我们需要增援
This-- We need help, sir. ASAP.

404
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,449
立即离开这里 一轮搏斗你们就完蛋
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

405
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,778
罗德里，乔利亚，快点
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

406
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:53,090
中尉
Lieutenant.

407
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,789
告诉总部我们需要工程师 这里到处是陷阱
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

408
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,059
他们快来了
They're coming.

409
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:01,262
下面的村庄有北越军的踪影
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

410
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,294
六队说我们要立即赶去
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

411
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:06,797
留下四个手下和军医
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

412
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:08,264
-好 -快点
-All right. -Move it out.

413
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:34,725
召集所有士兵，快点！
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

414
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:38,328
曼尼在哪里？
Hey, where's Manny?

415
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,876
曼尼，你在哪里？
Manny, where you at?

416
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:18,174
我们要在入黑前到达村庄
We had to reach the village before dark,

417
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:18,770
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

418
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,212
伊利亚等人继续找寻 和等候工程师
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

419
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,004
但最后金找到他
But it was King who found him...

420
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:27,784
他在下游一千码那里
...about 1 000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

421
00:44:32,657 --> 00:44:34,386
谜团被解开了
It was the end of the mystery,

422
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,315
混蛋
The motherfuckers.

423
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:21,169
那个千年村的村民不知道我们会来
The village, which was maybe 1 000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

424
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,370
否则他们早就逃走
If they had, they would have run,

425
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:28,877
巴恩是众矢之的 阿合上尉会经过他
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

426
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,909
改善事情
...who would set things right again,

427
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:33,409
那一天我们都很敬爱他
That day, we loved him,

428
00:45:38,856 --> 00:45:40,346
他在那里
There he goes, sarge.

429
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,693
-把他检起来 -好
-Pick him up. -Yeah, you got it, sarge.

430
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:51,893
快来
Let's go.

431
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:56,940
不要那样望着我
Get that stupid look off your face!

432
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:00,767
奥尼尔，清除房子
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

433
00:46:01,078 --> 00:46:03,444
小猪…
Hey, piggy-piggy. Hey, pig.

434
00:46:08,786 --> 00:46:11,084
宾尼，你要烧掉房子
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

435
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:15,586
去右边，小心，出发！
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

436
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:18,718
这里有什么？
What do you got here, huh?

437
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,464
去那边，快！
Get over there! Move it!

438
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:25,268
来吧，快点！
Come on, let's go!

439
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:28,463
乔利亚，集合他们
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

440
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:37,603
出来，混球！行动！
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

441
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:54,455
来吧
Come on!

442
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,834
-把他们赶进猪栏去 -过来
-Put them in the pigpen! -Get over here.

443
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,406
回去！住口！
Get back! Shut up!

444
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:05,436
给我
Give me your willie pete.

445
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:10,507
退后
Get back!

446
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,846
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

447
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,020
住口
Shut up!

448
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,199
赶他们出来
Get them out of here!

449
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,632
妈的！这里有一个
Oh, fuck! We got one.

450
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:37,497
赶他出来
Get the fuck out of the hole!

451
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:40,242
出来，混蛋
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

452
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:42,705
冷静下来，他们很害怕
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

453
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:45,675
他们害怕？我又怎样？
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

454
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:49,645
我厌倦这样，快出来 混球，快！
l'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

455
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:51,719
看看这混球
Watch this fucker!

456
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:54,616
他们认为我们为谁而战？
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

457
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,223
-还有一个 -你…
-You got one more! -Hey, hey!

458
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,097
有什么发现？
Well, what have we here?

459
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:12,601
我们有一，二，三，四支机关枪 捷克制米克58机关枪
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

460
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:14,706
他们有二、四…
They got two, four....

461
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:20,382
他们有足够米粮供应一队军队
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

462
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:26,016
华伦，带村长来
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

463
00:48:26,357 --> 00:48:29,292
特斯，出来，乔利亚，烧掉房子
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

464
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:32,757
怎么了？我不会伤害你
What the fuck's the matter? l wasn't gonna hurt you!

465
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,688
我看来想伤害你吗？
Look like l was gonna hurt you?

466
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:38,523
你为什么不听我说？ 你为什么不他妈的听我说？
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

467
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:41,899
你这个笨蛋！你这个王八！
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

468
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,037
他妈的过来！到这里！混球！
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

469
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:49,073
你在笑什么？ 你为什么不听我说？
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

470
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,369
杀死他们
Do them, man!

471
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:54,382
你在笑什么？ 想有点可笑的东西？
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

472
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:57,186
-想有点可笑的东西？ -对
-You want something to smile at?! -That's right!

473
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,011
-混蛋，跳舞吧 -对
-Dance, motherfucker! -Yeah!

474
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,388
跛子，跳舞吧
Dance, one-legger!

475
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,923
跳舞…
Dance! Dance!

476
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,427
跳舞，跛子
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

477
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:20,944
来吧
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

478
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:29,374
他妈的！他在嘲笑你
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

479
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,181
越南人是那样笑的
That's the way the gook laughs.

480
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,055
当然了
Yeah, sure you are!

481
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,359
你很后悔吧？
You're real sorry, ain't you?

482
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:40,721
你为曼尼他们的死感到内疚吧？
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

483
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:43,794
宾尼，算了吧？我们走！
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

484
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:45,692
你说呢？
What do you say?

485
00:50:06,657 --> 00:50:10,252
妈的！你看到他的头颅 是怎样爆开吗？
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

486
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:14,089
我从来没见过那样的脑袋
l never seen brains like that before, man.

487
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:20,604
我打赌一定是她指挥一切的
l bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

488
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:25,136
大概是她割开曼尼的喉咙 她一定也想把我的睾丸割掉
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

489
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,603
宾尼，离开吧，没有人看到什么
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

490
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,436
泰勒，你明白吗？
You understand, Taylor?

491
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:31,976
杀死她吧，杀死整条村的人
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

492
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,286
这个越南人头目脸上有些疤痕
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

493
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:41,781
特斯，出来
Get out of here, Tubbs.

494
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,227
他从哪里弄到伤痕？
Where did he get these wounds?

495
00:50:58,075 --> 00:51:01,340
-他说他在轰炸中受伤 -他一定是北越的人
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid. -He's a dink for sure.

496
00:51:03,948 --> 00:51:06,109
问他这里为什么会有武器
Ask him why these weapons are here.

497
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:13,354
他们没有选择 北越杀了抗命的老头目
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

498
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:17,252
-他说那些米是属于他们 -莱纳，胡说
-He says all the rice is theirs. -Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

499
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:20,586
我们在河边杀死的越军是谁？
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

500
00:51:27,705 --> 00:51:31,106
他不知道，北越军几个月没来过
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

501
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:34,343
-或许他是哨兵 -当然了
-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

502
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,773
那些米和武器是给谁的？
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

503
00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:40,239
北越军
An NVC!

504
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:43,212
他知道我在说什么吧？
That cocksucker knows what l'm saying. Don't you?

505
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:45,681
他一定知道
Goddamn right he does.

506
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:46,921
他在说谎
He's lying!

507
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:49,953
杀死他，看谁会说真话
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

508
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,522
他说他什么都不知道
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

509
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,467
他讨厌北越但他们擅自来这里
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

510
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,067
她在说什么？
What's the bitch saying?

511
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:06,409
她问我们为什么要杀死猪只
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

512
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:09,406
他们是农夫，要养活自己
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

513
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:19,614
住口
Shut up!

514
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,956
叫她住口
Shut her the fuck up!

515
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:50,812
你叫他快点说 否则我会杀死更多人
You tell him to start talking or l'll waste more of them.

516
00:52:51,622 --> 00:52:52,953
莱纳，告诉他
Tell him, Lerner!

517
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:01,422
让我们大开杀戒
Let us in on this, all right?

518
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:09,734
我们杀死整条村吧
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

519
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:13,069
中士，我们还在等什么？
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

520
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,604
-杀死他们 -走开
-Let's do them! -Out of my way!

521
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:24,251
这是他的女儿吧？
This is his daughter, right? Right?

522
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,457
你说谎！不，你说谎！ 你这个越共！
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

523
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,333
巴恩
Barnes!

524
00:53:54,918 --> 00:53:57,045
你在他妈的做什么？
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

525
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:03,351
别管闲事，这和你无关
Stay out of this. lt ain't your show.

526
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:07,723
你不是火枪队，猪哥！
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

527
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,793
-打倒他 -巴恩，加油
-Get him! -Come on, Barnes!

528
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:15,298
打倒他！… 打烂他的头！
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

529
00:54:22,146 --> 00:54:24,774
伊利亚，杀死他
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

530
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,077
妈的！别这样！停手！
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

531
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,948
停手
Break it up!

532
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:38,887
停手
Break it up!

533
00:54:40,664 --> 00:54:41,460
伊利亚，冷静点
Elias, chill.

534
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,734
伊利亚，你死定了 我发誓，你死定了
You're dead, Elias! l swear to fucking God, you're dead!

535
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:49,129
你会坐牢的
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

536
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,270
这件事不会就此罢休的，混蛋
This shit won't wash, you puke!

537
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:54,771
停手！…住口！
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

538
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:57,778
停手，留心听着
Break it up! Listen up!

539
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:00,847
上尉说烧掉这里，听到了吗？
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

540
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:02,482
烧掉这里
Torch this place!

541
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,116
烧掉武器
Blow the weapons in place!

542
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:08,452
集合他们，我们时间不多
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

543
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:11,886
中尉，你为什么不作出行动？
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

544
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,786
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:16,530
你知道我在说什么
You know what the fuck l'm talking about.

546
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,098
不，我不知道 我不知道你他妈的在说什么
No, l don't. l don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

547
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:28,501
快点出发！快！听到命令了吧！
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

548
00:55:28,812 --> 00:55:33,044
泰勒，走了，妈的！ 烧掉武器，然后离开
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

549
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:34,577
哈洛，来吧
Come on, Harold.

550
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,012
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

551
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:23,962
准备爆炸
Fire in the hole!

552
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:10,278
来吧
Hey, come on.

553
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,906
妈的！滚开
You fucker! Get out of here!

554
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,913
滚开！…不要那样做
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

555
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:20,348
混蛋，这是什么一回事？
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

556
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:25,917
你是同志吗？
You a homosexual?

557
00:57:26,296 --> 00:57:28,696
你怎么了？她是越南人
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

558
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:32,695
她是人类！去你的！
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

559
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,061
泰勒，你这个可恶的新兵
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

560
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,863
妈的禽兽！你们全部都是禽兽！
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

561
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,040
混蛋
Fucking lame fuck!

562
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:43,973
你不属于越南，这里不适合你
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

563
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:46,509
你们一点都不明白吧？
You don't fucking get it, do you?

564
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,718
你们不明白
You just don't fucking get it.

565
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:52,115
没事的
lt's okay.

566
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:57,855
离开吧
Get out of there!

567
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,056
出发吧
Police up your dicks and let's go.

568
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:03,189
-我什么都看不见 -我看到
-l didn't see anything, sir. -l did.

569
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,995
巴恩中士说那个是北越兵
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

570
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:09,958
我的报告中 沃夫上尉是目击证人
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

571
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,732
伊利亚，好
All right, Elias.

572
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:15,035
-巴恩中士 -是
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

573
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:18,364
我们回到总部后我要详细报告
l want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

574
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:22,735
你有日志，我有很多目击证人
You got a diary. l have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

575
00:59:23,046 --> 00:59:25,310
不是现在
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

576
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,640
我们回到总部才调查这件事
We'll get into this at the base camp.

577
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:32,250
我保证如果发现非法杀戮…
l can promise you, if l find out there was an illegal killing...

578
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,250
一定会有军事法庭
...there will be a court-martial.

579
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:39,721
现在我要全军作战，你们别再吵
Right now, l need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

580
00:59:40,096 --> 00:59:43,122
巴恩和伊利亚中士，听到吗？
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

581
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,364
-是 -知道
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:48,865
明天你们从东面再去那越共地堡
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

583
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:53,802
你们休息一下， 晚上七点钟回来开会
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

584
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,338
-是 -是
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

585
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,183
你认为他们会在乎我们吗？
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

586
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,556
哈洛，也许会是你阻碍了巴恩
lt could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

587
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,924
那个宾尼呢？
And that Bunny?

588
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:13,460
他是疯的
That motherfucker's crazy.

589
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,227
他令我不寒而栗
l mean, he scares me.

590
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:17,566
他很可怕
He just scares me.

591
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:20,961
你已经受牵连
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

592
01:00:21,638 --> 01:00:24,129
这些越南人比你想像中聪明
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

593
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,408
巴恩知道他在做什么
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

594
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:29,507
他们是北越兵
They was NVA, every last of them.

595
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:33,211
他带领我们走到这里了 他会带领我们走完这场战争
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

596
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,482
我不知道
l don't know, Holmes.

597
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,718
基督教徒不会到处杀人
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

598
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,822
情况失去控制了，完全失控了
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

599
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:46,091
看来你不知道怎样分别…
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

600
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,761
事情的轻重
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

601
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:51,233
我不知道…
l don't know, brothers...

602
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,298
但我内心大受伤害
...but l'm hurting real bad inside.

603
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:01,102
别担心，伊利亚不能证明什么
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

604
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:02,378
他是个麻烦制造者
He's a troublemaker.

605
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,273
伊利亚像华盛顿的政客…
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

606
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:10,245
想独力打这场仗
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

607
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,584
这里没有时间进行审讯
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

608
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,852
-中士 -谢谢你
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

609
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:20,292
情况怎样？
How did it go there, Bob?

610
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,658
那个可恶的伊利亚
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

611
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,971
他是个卑鄙小人
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

612
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:32,139
他会连累这个连的所有人
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

613
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,703
有人要教训他
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

614
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:38,547
你认为呢？ 会有调查吗？
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

615
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:41,080
鲍布？
Bob?

616
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:46,385
你太担心了，中士会解决他
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

617
01:01:52,896 --> 01:01:54,261
今晚天色很美
lt's a beautiful night.

618
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,030
我喜欢这里的夜晚
Yeah, l love this place at night.

619
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,333
繁星…
The stars....

620
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:06,041
它们没有对与错 它们就是在那里
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

621
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,842
你的比喻很好
That's a nice way of putting it.

622
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,509
巴恩憎恨你吧？
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

623
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,717
巴恩相信他所做的一切
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

624
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,522
你呢？你相信吗？
And you? Do you believe?

625
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:28,387
1965年时吗？我会相信
ln '65? Yeah.

626
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:31,493
现在呢？
Now?

627
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:35,293
不相信
No.

628
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,370
今天所发生的事只是开始
What happened today is just the beginning.

629
01:02:42,946 --> 01:02:44,709
我们会输掉这场仗
We're gonna lose this war.

630
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:47,015
不会吧
Come on.

631
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,910
你真的认为我们会输？
You really think so? Us?

632
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,582
我们欺负别人太久了
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

633
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:56,153
现在轮到我们被打击
...l figure it's time we got ours kicked.

634
01:03:06,903 --> 01:03:09,201
我每天都在挣扎
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

635
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,099
我努力维持体力和意志
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

636
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:14,000
一切都很模糊
It's all a blur,

637
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,210
我没有气力写信
I have no energy to write,

638
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,113
我不能分辨对与错
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

639
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,243
我们的士气低落，出现内讧
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

640
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:26,054
一半支持伊利亚，一半支持巴恩
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

641
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,083
有很多猜忌和憎恨
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

642
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:33,155
我们竟然在自伤残杀
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

643
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:39,892
数着日子和留意着周遭，没别的
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

644
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,538
祖母，希望你一切安好
Hope things are well, Grandma,

645
01:03:42,872 --> 01:03:44,703
告诉妈妈和爸爸…
Tell Mom and Dad I--

646
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:48,508
你知道告诉他们什么的 柯里斯上
Well, just tell them, Chris,

647
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:14,436
我知道你以为会被派去洗衣服
Hey, big boy. l know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.

648
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:18,137
我要把自己涂白 才能得到那些工作
Hell, l gotta paint myself white just to get one of those jobs.

649
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:22,434
我递了申请去割包皮，我要离开
Got my request in for a circumcision. l'm getting my big ass out of here.

650
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:24,714
你会成为犹太教教士吗？
What are you gonna do, become a rabbi?

651
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:26,037
水蛭
Leech.

652
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:33,086
继续走
All right! Move it out!

653
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,287
不要喝，你会得到痢疾
Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria.

654
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:41,123
我希望会
Yeah, l hope so.

655
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:43,298
去吧
Let's go.

656
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:23,335
军医，莱纳被击中
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

657
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:30,879
中士，华伦被击中

659
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:39,915

lt's an ambush! They were just waiting for us here!

660
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,224
-谁负责防守？ -莱纳和华伦
-Who's on point? -Lerner and Warren.

661
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,049
你去哪里？
Where are you going?!

662
01:05:47,964 --> 01:05:51,695
天啊！混球！派火力上前
Goddamn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there!

663
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:52,899
对
Right!

664
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:04,173
小心，火箭
Watch out! Rockets!

665
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:14,216
莱纳在哪里？
Where the fuck is Lerner?

666
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:17,082
他在木头那边
He's over there! By the log!

667

721

只要被他们攻破，我们便死定了
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

722
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:31,996
你去哪里？

到下游大约一百米处…
Down by the river about 1 00 meters...

724
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:37,568
以防他们准备从外围进攻

第三连正在后面赶来

我可以和你一起去吗？
Hey. Can l go with you?

727
01:11:43,486 --> 01:11:46,387
不，我单独行事较敏捷

728
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:57,391

What about Elias? lf we pull back, he'll be cut off.

732
01:12:07,977 --> 01:12:10,912

对，他在一百米外
Yeah, he's back there about 1 00 meters.

764
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:24,914
什么？

765
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,819
退后…

769
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,127
我知道是他，我看到他的眼神
l know he did. l saw his eyes when he came in.

770
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:18,994
你怎知不是越兵？你没有证据
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

771
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,630
证据就在他的眼神，我看得出
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

772
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:24,027
你也看见，我知道你在想什么
You saw. l know what you were thinking.

773

我们今天解决他
l say we frag him tonight.

774
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,207
我赞成，以牙还牙
l go with that. An eye for an eye.

775
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:32,303
让军事法庭处理吧
l say let military justice do the job on him.

776
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:36,171
去他的军事法庭！ 你在说笑吗？
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

777
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:40,509
他们会相信谁？奥尼尔？宾尼？ 全是胡说！
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

778
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,915
巴恩不会放过你的
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

779
01:21:45,258 --> 01:21:46,919
你认为我们应怎做？
What do you suggest we do?

780
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:52,254
你们小心， 巴恩会一个个的解决他们
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

781
01:21:52,599 --> 01:21:55,762
你们忘记和伊利亚的 美好日子吗？
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

782
01:21:56,102 --> 01:21:59,663
你想把头砍下来治头痛？
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

783
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,341
伊利亚没有叫你为他打仗
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

784
01:22:04,277 --> 01:22:07,838
如果真的有天堂，天啊 我希望真的有
And if there's a heaven, and God, l hope there is...

785
01:22:08,181 --> 01:22:12,845
他会在上面喝到大醉
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

786
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,821
因为他把痛苦留在这里
...because he left his pains down here.

787
01:22:16,156 --> 01:22:19,387
你错了，总之巴恩是杀人凶手
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

788
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,660
-对 -泰勒…
-Right on. -Taylor...

789
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:27,199
你当初入伍时说很欣赏巴恩
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

790
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:31,732
-我错了 -你做任何事都是错的
-l was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

791
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:35,237
你们这班混蛋，留心听着
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

792
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:39,476
巴恩中枪七次都没有死去
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

793
01:22:39,813 --> 01:22:41,678
那对你有意思吗？
Does that mean anything to you?

794
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:44,412
巴恩是不会死的
Barnes ain't meant to die.

795
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:49,220
唯一能杀死他的是他自己
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

796
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:51,650
你们在谈死亡吗？
Talking about killing?

797
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,837
你们是专家吗？
You all experts?

798
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:10,003
你们都知道杀戮吗？
You all know about killing?

799
01:23:11,478 --> 01:23:13,912
我想听听，猪头
Well, l'd like to hear about it, potheads.

800
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:24,279
你们抽这个来逃避现实？
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

801
01:23:27,227 --> 01:23:29,058
我不需要这个
Me, l don't need this shit.

802
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:37,497
我就是现实
l am reality.

803
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,502
现实应该是这样 而现实就是这样
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

804
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:53,309
伊利亚满口一派胡言
Elias was full of shit.

805
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:57,218
伊利亚是个斗士
Elias was a crusader.

806
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:02,828
我不会跟听从命令的人作对
Now, l got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

807
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:04,828
但当他不听命时…
But when he don't...

808
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:06,893
运作便会崩溃
...the machine breaks down.

809
01:24:07,867 --> 01:24:12,031
运作崩溃时 我们就会崩溃
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

810
01:24:13,273 --> 01:24:15,207
我不会许容那样的事
l ain't going to allow that.

811
01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:17,171
你们任何一个都不能
From any of you.

812
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:19,872
一个都不可以
Not one.

813
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:38,459
你们都爱伊利亚
You all love Elias.

814
01:24:43,903 --> 01:24:45,962
你们想为他报仇
You want to kick ass.

815
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:55,210
我独个儿在这里
Well, here l am. All by my lonesome.

816
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,142
没有人会知道
And ain't nobody gonna know.

817
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:08,326
你们六个对我一个
Six of you boys against me.

818
01:25:14,834 --> 01:25:15,926
杀我吧
Kill me.

819
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,987
我卑视你们
l shit on all of you.

820
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:40,793
混蛋
You motherfucker!

821
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:48,227
打吧
Come on, man.

822
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:50,462
柯里斯，打他
Get him, Chris.

823
01:25:54,907 --> 01:25:57,137
巴恩，不要下手
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

824
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,705
你要坐牢的
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

825
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,014
杀军人要坐十年牢，十年
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

826
01:26:03,349 --> 01:26:05,078
你想想吧
Climb the fucking walls, man.

827
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:09,154
不要下手
Don't do it.

828
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:28,665
死亡？
Death?

829
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,800
你们对死亡有什么认识？
What do you all know about death?

830
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:49,361
我们翌日被派回到山谷里
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

831
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:53,427
进入离柬埔寨约二千米的战区
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

832
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:56,599
我们好像回到案发现场
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

833
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:34,729
A连在前一天被重击
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

834
01:27:35,074 --> 01:27:37,338
C连在那一天被袭击
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

835
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,672
山谷里有其他战事…
There were other battalions in the valley...

836
01:27:41,013 --> 01:27:43,880
但我们是引他们出来的饵
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

837
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,779
141北越军就在下面某处
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment,

838
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:10,705
他们昨晚想袭击C连
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

839
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,045
他们发现地图
They found maps on them, man.

840
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:18,080
听说每个散兵坑都有地雷
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

841
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:22,821
知道我方的距离、林木线和地雷
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

842
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:24,714
情况不妙
This is bad, man.

843
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:29,489
-我有不祥之兆 -听说我们身在柬埔寨
-l got bad vibes here. -l also heard we're in Cambodia now.

844
01:28:29,829 --> 01:28:32,389
柬埔寨？你在开玩笑
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

845
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,860
你想见我？
You wanted to see me, sir?

846
01:28:36,669 --> 01:28:39,832
拉姆治，伊利亚小组归你
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

847
01:28:40,173 --> 01:28:44,041
小组？我不知道我的连叫小组
Squad? l didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

848
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:48,710
我要你去那两个坑
l want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

849
01:28:49,015 --> 01:28:51,813
跟在上面的巴恩 和在下面的金联络
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

850
01:28:53,452 --> 01:28:55,147
长官，对不起…
Begging your pardon, sir...

851
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:59,124
那两个坑距离太远 一个连队可以从中通过
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

852
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,016
我只有五个军人活着
l have five live bodies left.

853
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,887
我不想听你的问题，新兵很快到
l don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

854
01:29:05,231 --> 01:29:06,858
你要和别人一样作战
Make do like everybody else.

855
01:29:07,266 --> 01:29:09,632
-我没有要求这个 -我不想再听
-l didn't ask for this. -l don't want to hear it.

856
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,164
-你不想再听？ -对
-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

857
01:29:12,872 --> 01:29:15,807
因为老实说我毫不在乎
Because, to tell you the truth, l don't give a shit.

858
01:29:16,642 --> 01:29:18,837
我不再在乎
l just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

859
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:28,450
我很高兴我不用和他们一起去
l'm glad l ain't going with them.

860
01:29:30,857 --> 01:29:33,826
外面有一头饥饿的野兽
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

861
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,291
真失败
What a fucking bummer.

862
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:40,860
只剩十天了，我仍要面对这一切
Ten days and a wake-up, and l'm still dealing with this shit.

863
01:29:44,437 --> 01:29:46,029
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

864
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:48,564
你为什么不写信？
Why ain't you writing nobody?

865
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:50,865
你的父母呢？
What about your folks?

866
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,769
你向我提起的祖母怎样？
That grandma you told me about?

867
01:29:56,415 --> 01:29:57,347
女朋友？
Girl?

868
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:01,716
你有父母吧？
You got parents, don't you?

869
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,879
一定有些亲密的人
There must be somebody.

870
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:06,820
没有
No, there's nobody.

871
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:10,893
你抽太多了
You been smoking too much of this shit.

872
01:30:13,299 --> 01:30:15,767
你要控制一下 令人颓丧
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

873
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:20,670
我记得你初来时什么都不懂
l remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

874
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:25,299
你可曾被无法 摆脱的错误缠绕着？
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

875
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,244
总有方法解决的
There's a way out of anything.

876
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:31,984
只要你振作精神
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

877
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:34,216
一定有方法的
...and the worm will turn.

878
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,713
你还有多少天？
How many days you short?

879
01:30:40,026 --> 01:30:43,553
不只是我，而是整个事情
lt's not just me. lt's how the whole thing works.

880
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,523
像伊利亚般的人要牺牲
People like Elias get wasted.

881
01:30:45,865 --> 01:30:49,562
巴恩那种人却能继续为所欲为
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

882
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:53,599
我们只能逆来顺受吗？
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

883
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,838
我们不用理会那些事情
We just don't add up to dry shit.

884
01:30:57,343 --> 01:31:01,939
谁说你需要的？ 你只需要活着离开这里
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

885
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:06,581
然后每天快乐地生活
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

886
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:11,947
你是理想主义者
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

887
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:16,217
收拾你的行装 你的命令刚下达
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

888
01:31:16,562 --> 01:31:17,859
不要骗我
Man, don't fuck with me.

889
01:31:18,197 --> 01:31:20,791
你要邀请信吗？
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

890
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:25,693
天啊！他们做错事
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

891
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:27,505
他们竟然饶我一命
They cut me some slack!

892
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:31,504
你有十分钟时间赶去搭直升机
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

893
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:33,435
因为如果你不上机…
Because if you're not on it...

894
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:35,310
我便会去
...l'm gonna be.

895
01:31:36,482 --> 01:31:38,416
泰勒，法兰西准备好了
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

896
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:42,418
太好了，金，我为你 感到高兴，回家吧！
That's great, King, l'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

897
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:45,952
你有我的地址 你知道怎么联络我
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

898
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,019
我要走了，我不想错过直升机
l gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

899
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:55,664
-你没事吧？ -我没事
-You okay? -Yeah, l'm okay.

900
01:31:56,535 --> 01:31:57,729
记住放松点
Remember, take it easy.

901
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:00,670
不要想太多 别做傻瓜
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

902
01:32:01,374 --> 01:32:04,639
记住这里没有人是懦夫
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

903
01:32:05,444 --> 01:32:06,672
我的朋友
My man.

904
01:32:14,353 --> 01:32:15,820
我送你出去
l'll walk you out, man.

905
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,316
金，保重
Take it easy, King.

906
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:25,129
-我会 -再见
-l'll take it any way l can get it. -l hear you. Later.

907
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:29,293
很痛，中士，不要碰它
l'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

908
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:31,800
我一定要上直升机
l gotta get on the chopper, man.

909
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:34,639
-有什么问题？ -他说不能走路
-So, what's the problem? -Says he can't walk.

910
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,100
可恶
Shit.

911
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:39,242
马丁…
Martin...

912
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,377
穿上靴子
...get your boots on.

913
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:48,816
下次给我见到你喷防蚊水…
And the next time l catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

914
01:32:49,155 --> 01:32:51,555
我会送你上军事法庭
...l'll court-martial your nigger ass.

915
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:54,649
送我去吧
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

916
01:32:54,994 --> 01:32:57,326
逮捕我啊！送我去坐牢吧
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

917
01:32:58,330 --> 01:32:59,456
下手吧
Do your fucking worst!

918
01:33:00,299 --> 01:33:03,200
你们白人欺负我
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

919
01:33:04,236 --> 01:33:06,602
奥尼尔，把蜈蚣拿来
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

920
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,805
-中士？ -是
-Sarge? -Yeah.

921
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:13,840
我找到那毛茸茸、红黑色的虫
That long, hairy, red and black bastard l found in the ammo crate.

922
01:33:15,614 --> 01:33:17,582
我会把它放进他的伤口
l'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

923
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:18,847
我记得了
l remember now.

924
01:33:20,853 --> 01:33:22,184
等一下
Hold up, man!

925
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:24,250
等一下好吗？
You just hold up and wait, okay?

926
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,115
我会走路了
Fuck it, l'll walk! l'll fucking walk!

927
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,054
我要和他同一个坑？
Fucking pussy! Sarge, l gotta have him in my hole?

928
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:31,556
对
Yeah.

929
01:33:31,964 --> 01:33:34,524
我可以和你谈谈吗？
Bob, l'd like to speak to you a minute.

930
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:40,962
我不能再忍受了
l can't take it no more.

931
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:46,011
什么事？
Yeah, what is it?

932
01:33:46,378 --> 01:33:49,472
我有伊利亚的假期 有三天
Bob, l got Elias' R and R. lt's coming up in three days.

933
01:33:49,815 --> 01:33:52,477
我想回去夏威夷见柏丝
l was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

934
01:33:53,052 --> 01:33:55,145
我从没向你要求过任何事
l never asked you for a thing over here.

935
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:57,456
坦白说…
Well, to be honest with you...

936
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:01,282
我想和金一起坐直升机回去 你觉得呢？
...l was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

937
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,189
我不能让你那样做
l can't do that for you.

938
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:06,157
你知道这里很需要人手
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

939
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:09,866
你可以跟我说 我只是请三天假
You can talk to me, for chrissake! l'm just asking for three days.

940
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:12,727
我告诉你不可以
l am talking to you, Red. And l'm telling you no.

941
01:34:13,839 --> 01:34:15,602
回到散兵坑
Get back in your foxhole.

942
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:19,636
我有不祥之兆，知道吗？
Bob, l've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

943
01:34:20,246 --> 01:34:22,407
我今次有不祥之兆
l mean l've got a bad feeling.

944
01:34:23,182 --> 01:34:25,480
我觉得我不能活着离开这里
l don't think l'm gonna make it out of here.

945
01:34:25,818 --> 01:34:27,683
你明白吗？
You understand what l'm saying?

946
01:34:28,888 --> 01:34:31,516
每个人都会死的
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

947
01:34:39,498 --> 01:34:40,226
可恶
Oh, shit!

948
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,114
混蛋们，再见
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

949
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:12,387
埋伏在哪里？
Where's that fucking ambush?

950
01:35:13,098 --> 01:35:17,398
他们不会等，他们现在就来了
They ain't even waiting till later. lt's fucking coming now, man.

951

You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

953
01:35:28,614 --> 01:35:30,844
我不觉得我们在做错事
...l don't feel like we done something wrong.

954
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,176
但有时…
But sometimes, man...

955
01:35:35,254 --> 01:35:37,188
我有不祥的感觉
...l get this bad feeling.

956
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:42,554
我坦然对随军牧师说我喜欢这里
l told the padre the truth. l like it here.

957
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:45,659
你可以为所欲为，没有人理会你
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

958
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:48,363
你只用担心死亡
The only worry you got is dying.

959
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:51,064
反正死的时候你不会知道
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

960
01:35:51,403 --> 01:35:53,268
那么担心什么？
...so, what the fuck, man?

961
01:35:53,672 --> 01:35:57,073
我要和你同一个坑？
Shit. l got to be in this hole with you, man?

我早知道我不应该来
l just know l shouldn't have come.

963
01:36:01,981 --> 01:36:06,077
不用担心，你和爱迪墨菲在一起
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here.

01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:48,175
好，因为第二连由你指挥
Good, because you got 2nd Platoon.

1067
01:52:49,754 --> 01:52:50,721
是
Yes, sir.

1068
01:53:00,999 --> 01:53:02,660
-准备好吗？ -准备好
-Ready? -You bet.

1069
01:54:32,123 --> 01:54:34,387
现在回想一切…
I think now, looking baCk...

1070
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:39,591
我们不是对抗敌人，而是自己
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1071
01:54:39,931 --> 01:54:42,195
敌人就在我们心中
...and the enemy was in us,

1072
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:46,527
战争对我来说现在已经完结
The war is over for me now...

1073
01:54:46,871 --> 01:54:50,671
但它永远会存留在我的心中里
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1074
01:54:51,209 --> 01:54:53,109
伊利亚会和…
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1075
01:54:53,611 --> 01:54:56,944
巴恩为了，像罗德所说的 “灵魂的掌控”继续作战
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1076
01:54:59,517 --> 01:55:00,916
我有时会觉得…
There are times sinCe...

1077
01:55:01,285 --> 01:55:05,312
我是那两个父亲的儿子
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1078
01:55:07,892 --> 01:55:09,723
但无论如何…
But be that as it may...

1079
01:55:10,428 --> 01:55:14,023
我们有责任重建社会…
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1080
01:55:14,799 --> 01:55:16,926
教导别人我们认识的一切…
To teaCh to others what we know...

1081
01:55:18,336 --> 01:55:20,930
我们利用剩下的一生…
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1082
01:55:21,272 --> 01:55:25,003
尝试找寻生命的意义
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,

1083
01:55:36,387 --> 01:55:41,757
献给在越战牺牲的士兵
