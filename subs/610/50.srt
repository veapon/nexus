你死定了，臭婊子！
You're dead, bitch!

00:01:14,60 --> 00:01:16,40
你他妈的看什么？

看来你今天很不走运啊，美女
Looks like you are shit outta luck, beautiful.

让我帮你来个剖腹产

她在哪？
Where is she?

13
00:02:09,62 --> 00:02:10,72
她在那儿！
There she is!

14
00:02:12,39 --> 00:02:13,95
- 快离开这儿！  - 那边儿！
- Get out of here! - Over there!

15
00:02:15,73 --> 00:02:17,06
快杀了她！
Kill her on sight!

16
00:02:22,87 --> 00:02:24,24
谁他妈的在那边？
Who the fuck is that?

17
00:02:24,27 --> 00:02:25,97
那个女的跑哪去了？
Where the hell is the girl?

- Do you know what i hate? - No.

37
00:03:22,03 --> 00:03:25,52
我讨厌那些四十多岁的老男人  还留着马尾辫
I hate these 40-year-old jack-holes wearing ponytails.

38
00:03:27,04 --> 00:03:29,16

47
00:03:56,10 --> 00:03:57,89
我流血了，快不行了
I'm bleedin'. I'm bleedin' out.

48
00:03:57,97 --> 00:04:00,03
别乱动  不要干扰我瞄准
Quit squirming, you're ruining my shot.

49
00:04:04,71 --> 00:04:05,83
什么烂东西
What a piece of crap.

50
00:04:08,88 --> 00:04:10,57
我们得离开这里
We're outta here.

51
00:04:16,18 --> 00:04:18,31
很抱歉这么粗鲁的搬动你
Sorry about the messy delivery, mom.

52
00:04:26,89 --> 00:04:28,19
得安静下来
We need quiet.

53
00:04:28,26 --> 00:04:29,39
给孩子点喝的
Give junior something to drink.

好极了，大英雄 棒极了
Bravo, mr. Hero. Bravo.

你们为什么要杀这个女人？
Why you tryin' to kill this woman?

56
00:05:00,03 --> 00:05:01,46
很好笑吗？
Something funny?

57
00:05:01,50 --> 00:05:03,99
哦，我只是突然想起了一首打油诗
Oh, i was just remembering a limerick.

58
00:05:04,07 --> 00:05:06,53
“曾经有一个很能生的女人...”
Well, "there once was a woman who was quite begat...

59
00:05:06,60 --> 00:05:09,33
“她有三个孩子：  Nat，Pat和Tat”
"she had three babies named nat, pat and tat...

60
00:05:09,37 --> 00:05:10,84
“她说生孩子很有趣...”
"she said it was fun at the breeding...

61
00:05:10,87 --> 00:05:13,27
“但是喂养它们却是另一回事儿”
"but found it was hell in the feeding...

62
00:05:13,31 --> 00:05:16,87
“因为没有奶头（tit）给Tat了”  （双关语：tit for tat也指以牙还牙）
"when she saw there was no tit for tat."

63
00:05:16,91 --> 00:05:20,04
你已经给我惹了不少麻烦
You have caused me no end of trouble.

64
00:05:20,08 --> 00:05:22,45
现在该轮到我回报你了
But now i shall return the favor.

65
00:05:22,48 --> 00:05:24,25
以牙还牙,对吧？
Tit for tat, right?

66
00:05:25,72 --> 00:05:28,62
哦，对了 还有一件事儿
Now, see, that's the latest thing.

67
00:05:28,66 --> 00:05:30,45
这枪只有确认主人的指纹后
The gun will only fire when it recognizes...

68
00:05:30,49 --> 00:05:32,08
才能开火
the thumbprint of the owner.

69
00:05:32,13 --> 00:05:35,49
这样既能避免走火  又降低了犯罪率
It makes firearms safer and it cuts down the crime too.

70
00:05:36,50 --> 00:05:37,66
别让他跑了！
Get him!

71
00:05:47,84 --> 00:05:49,47
你是谁？
Who are you?

72
00:05:49,51 --> 00:05:51,88
夫人，你叫什么名字？
Lady, what's your name?

73
00:06:49,80 --> 00:06:51,20

Nice knockers.

74

00:07:05,12 --> 00:07:06,28
∮而我要告诉你整个的故事∮
## So i'll tell you all the story ##

79
00:07:06,32 --> 00:07:08,08
∮关于那个家伙还有那晚的贼∮
## about the joker and the thief of the night ##

80
00:07:14,40 --> 00:07:17,56
∮他总是嘲笑那些权贵∮
## he's always laughing in the midst of power ##

81

∮辛酸的生活中总有美好∮

83
00:07:23,74 --> 00:07:25,80
操你妈的 你们这帮该死的混蛋
fuck you, ya fuckin' fuckers.

84
00:07:49,16 --> 00:07:51,13
以牙还牙，大英雄 (后面的英文：Fuck u too，也操你妈）
Tit for tat, mr. Hero.

85
00:07:51,17 --> 00:07:52,76
以牙还牙
Tit for tat.

86
00:07:58,87 --> 00:08:00,17
把他抬进去，快点
Get him in there. Come on.

87
00:08:01,74 --> 00:08:03,18
我来帮你抬，老板
I was goin' back for her, boss.

88
00:08:03,21 --> 00:08:05,34
不用，我自己来
No, i got it.

89
00:08:05,38 --> 00:08:08,11
嘿，我可不是那种只会站在一旁...
Hey, i'm not the head honcho who sits on his hands...

90
00:08:08,15 --> 00:08:09,71
一边哈气，一边暖手...
warming them with his own exhaust...

91
00:08:09,75 --> 00:08:11,15
而让手下们
while everybody else does the work.

92
00:08:11,19 --> 00:08:12,98
拼命干活的人，对吧？
Every second counts, right?

93
00:08:17,53 --> 00:08:20,29
这他妈的是怎么搞的？
Now, how the heck did this happen, huh?

94
00:08:25,10 --> 00:08:27,00
本来一切都很顺利...
Everything was goin' smooth at the safe house...

95
00:08:27,64 --> 00:08:28,86
...没想到那女的掏出一把枪
...when the woman draws a gun.

96
00:08:28,90 --> 00:08:31,87
我的意思是…  谁会想到一个怀孕的女人会带着枪？
I mean, who expects a pregnant lady to pull a piece on ya, eh?

97
00:08:31,94 --> 00:08:34,24
那么那个男的又是谁？  怎么会和她在一起？
And who was this man who was with her?

98
00:08:34,28 --> 00:08:35,67
我不知道
I don't know.

99
00:08:35,71 --> 00:08:37,64
那女的逃跑后  我们一直追着她到这里
After the woman escaped, we tracked her here.

100
00:08:37,68 --> 00:08:39,17
那个家伙，本来是在...
This guy, he was hangin' around...

101
00:08:39,21 --> 00:08:40,44
在公交车站乱逛的
at the bus stop.

102
00:08:40,48 --> 00:08:42,35
我本来决定先解决那女的  再回来找他...
I mean, so we decided that we'd deal with him later...

103
00:08:42,38 --> 00:08:43,78
但谁想到 当他看到我们追那女的…
but we go after the woman...

104
00:08:43,82 --> 00:08:45,88
他也跟了过来
he gets in on the action. You know?

105
00:08:45,92 --> 00:08:48,22
他拿出一把抢，然后朝我们开枪
He took a gun, he started shootin' at us,

106
00:08:48,26 --> 00:08:49,69
这时候，你来了…
and that's... that's when y...

107
00:08:49,72 --> 00:08:51,06
哦，好的，知道了
- oh. Ok. ...you arrived.

108
00:08:51,09 --> 00:08:53,06
放松点，坐下
Take it easy. Sit down.

109
00:08:53,09 --> 00:08:54,25
好的
All right.

110
00:08:54,30 --> 00:08:55,52
哦！你还好吗？
Oh, you all right?

111
00:08:55,93 --> 00:08:57,16
好吧
Ok.

112
00:08:58,30 --> 00:08:59,77
你是不是想说…
Are you tryin' to tell me...

113
00:08:59,83 --> 00:09:03,20
一个流浪汉来英雄救美？
that some bum came to her rescue?

114
00:09:03,27 --> 00:09:06,30
哦，哦，哦  这可真是太糟糕了，是吧？
Well, well, well, this is a fine mess, huh?

115
00:09:06,91 --> 00:09:08,71
我不会再犯同样的错误了
I won't make this mistake again.

116
00:09:09,84 --> 00:09:11,84
我屁股里的弹片会一直提醒我的
Well, i got a piece of lead in my butt as a reminder.

117
00:09:11,88 --> 00:09:12,90
好吧
Ok.

118
00:09:12,95 --> 00:09:15,61
很高兴你这么想
I can appreciate that.

119
00:09:16,38 --> 00:09:17,87
我的屁股！
My ass!

120
00:09:18,75 --> 00:09:21,35
让它时刻提醒着你  别再让我失望
And let that be a reminder never to fail me again.

121
00:10:31,13 --> 00:10:32,11
见鬼
Damn.

122
00:11:08,96 --> 00:11:10,93
别让我为了个婴儿而杀了你
Don't make me kill you to get the baby.

123
00:12:05,52 --> 00:12:07,49
退后
Back off.

124
00:12:58,37 --> 00:13:01,67
亲爱的，任务快要完成了
Sweetie, this deal is almost done.

125
00:13:01,71 --> 00:13:05,15
我已经订好了回去的机票
Look, i've already booked my flight home.

126
00:13:05,18 --> 00:13:07,01
好吗？
Ok?

127
00:13:07,05 --> 00:13:08,64
好的
Ok.

128
00:13:08,68 --> 00:13:10,67
我也爱你
I love you too.

129
00:13:10,72 --> 00:13:12,55
好，拜拜
Yeah. Bye-bye.

130
00:13:15,59 --> 00:13:18,32
你们知道为什么枪要比老婆好吗？
You know why a gun is better than a wife?

131
00:13:20,23 --> 00:13:21,22
不知道
Don't know.

132
00:13:21,26 --> 00:13:24,79
因为你可以给枪装个消声器
Well, you can put a silencer on a gun.

133
00:13:31,07 --> 00:13:32,27
先生，我们发现目标...
Sir, we spotted the target...

134
00:13:32,31 --> 00:13:34,27
在第三大街和杰斐逊大街路口  正前往公园
at third and jefferson heading toward the park.

135
00:13:34,31 --> 00:13:35,33
掉头
Turn us around.

136
00:13:41,12 --> 00:13:42,45
来啊！爸爸！
Come on! Dad!

137
00:13:42,48 --> 00:13:45,08
- 快来啊  - 好的
- Come on. - All right.

138
00:13:45,12 --> 00:13:47,21
谁是爸爸的小宝贝呢？
Who's daddy's little girl?

139
00:14:05,94 --> 00:14:09,31
别担心，孩子  会有好心人收留你的
Don't worry, kid. Someone good'll find you.

140
00:14:20,19 --> 00:14:21,98
噢，我的天，快来看
Oh, my god, look at this.

141
00:14:23,32 --> 00:14:25,88
有人忘了他的孩子
Someone left a baby.

142
00:14:32,07 --> 00:14:33,03
歪了！
Oops.

143
00:15:04,03 --> 00:15:05,62

欢迎回来，Smith先生
Welcome back, mr. Smith.

145
00:15:35,53 --> 00:15:37,00
Quintana在哪儿？
Where's quintana?

146
00:15:37,06 --> 00:15:40,13
等一下，Smith   Donna小姐有客人
Wait, smith, mistress donna's with a customer.

147
00:15:40,13 --> 00:15:41,12
等一下，你不能就这么上去
Wait, you can't go up there.

148
00:15:41,20 --> 00:15:42,53
哦耶，宝贝
Oh, yeah, baby.

149
00:15:42,57 --> 00:15:44,33
- Smith？  - 这种感觉不错，是吧？
- Smith? - You like that, huh?

150
00:15:44,37 --> 00:15:46,40
而且，我觉得Mary小姐更适合你
Besides, i thought mistress mary was more your type.

151
00:15:46,44 --> 00:15:48,24
你不能上去
You can't go up there.

152

161
00:16:28,22 --> 00:16:32,05
抱歉，老兄 酒吧关门了

162
00:16:32,05 --> 00:16:33,64
∮如果你渴望黄金和白银∮

165
00:16:39,66 --> 00:16:41,36
还没轮到你呢，Smith
wait your turn, smith.

166
00:16:41,40 --> 00:16:42,69
还有很多人在排队
There's plenty to go around.

167
00:16:42,76 --> 00:16:45,73
我不排队，谢谢  我乳糖过敏
Not for me, thanks. I'm lactose intolerant.

168
00:16:45,77 --> 00:16:48,17
那你告诉我你想要什么，Smith
Just tell me what you want, smith.

169
00:16:53,71 --> 00:16:55,40
∮如果你寻求庇护∮

172
00:17:00,11 --> 00:17:01,10
太奇怪了

173
00:17:01,15 --> 00:17:03,95
我想让你照顾这个孩子一段时间
I want you to take care of this baby for a while.

174
00:17:03,98 --> 00:17:05,25
五千美金
Five grand.

175
00:17:05,29 --> 00:17:07,34
应该能让你几个星期不用接客
That should keep you off your back for a couple of weeks.

176
00:17:10,19 --> 00:17:11,49
你有污点记录吗？
Are you clean?

177
00:17:11,53 --> 00:17:14,36
要知道，我可是一名优秀的“女童子军”  （世界青少年组织）
You know i'm a good girl scout.

178
00:17:14,40 --> 00:17:15,45
这么说你答应了？
So you'll do it.

179
00:17:15,50 --> 00:17:18,59
见你的鬼  你自己搞定，Smith
Vaffanculo. Screw yourself, smith.

180
00:17:18,67 --> 00:17:21,13
我猜这个孩子肯定是你抢来的
For all i know, you snatched the kid.

181
00:17:21,17 --> 00:17:23,07
我可不想成为绑架犯的帮凶
I don't want to be an accessory for kidnapping.

182
00:17:23,10 --> 00:17:24,83
这孩子不是我偷来的  相信我
I didn't steal the kid, trust me.

183
00:17:24,87 --> 00:17:27,03
相信你？
Trust you?

184
00:17:27,07 --> 00:17:30,24
我甚至连你的真名都不知道
I don't even know your real name.

185
00:17:30,28 --> 00:17:31,87
你到底是谁，Smith？
Who are you really, smith?

186
00:17:32,85 --> 00:17:34,84
我是位英国保姆...
I'm a british nanny...

187
00:17:34,88 --> 00:17:36,18
而且我是个危险人物
and i'm dangerous.

188
00:17:46,09 --> 00:17:50,09
只需照顾这个孩子一天  你就能留下那捆钱
Just keep the baby for one day and you can keep the whole roll.

189
00:18:03,74 --> 00:18:04,87
别做梦了，老兄
Forget it, dad.

190
00:18:08,72 --> 00:18:09,98
好吧
Fine.

191
00:18:12,49 --> 00:18:14,42
再见
Ciao.

192
00:19:09,41 --> 00:19:10,97
奶水
Breast milk.

193
00:19:14,52 --> 00:19:15,64
我们走
Let's go.

194
00:19:15,95 --> 00:19:18,25
那个孩子肯定需要喝奶
This lady's baby needs to be fed.

195
00:19:18,29 --> 00:19:21,08
把这个城市所有的奶妈  能喂奶的妓女…
Find me every wet nurse, lactating hooker...

196
00:19:21,12 --> 00:19:23,56
以及所有能喂奶的女人  都给我找出来
and mammary on tap in the city.

197
00:19:25,99 --> 00:19:28,86
我已经跟你说了，Smith
I already told you, smith, you're not welcome...

198
00:19:28,90 --> 00:19:30,80
蜂蜜牛奶小屋不欢迎你
in the land of milk and honey.

199
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:37,40
我需要往咖啡里加点奶油  顺便打听点消息
I need a little cream for my coffee and some answers.

200
00:19:40,07 --> 00:19:43,04
对不起
I'm sorry.

201
00:19:44,81 --> 00:19:46,68
你们先回避一下
Scram, fellas.

202
00:19:46,71 --> 00:19:50,08
让我和这位咖啡妈妈…
Give me a moment alone here with, uh...

203
00:19:50,12 --> 00:19:52,28
单独谈谈
caffe la mamma.

204
00:19:52,32 --> 00:19:56,02
放松，放松
Relax. Relax.

205
00:19:58,06 --> 00:20:00,55
我的小蜜糖
Mia piccola troietta.

206
00:20:05,30 --> 00:20:10,46
一个抱着婴儿的男人  曾经来过这里
There was a man here with a baby not too long ago.

207
00:20:10,50 --> 00:20:12,56
对，一个十足的蠢蛋
Yes. A real jerk.

208
00:20:13,27 --> 00:20:17,74
他想让我照顾那孩子
He wanted me to take care of the kid.

209
00:20:17,74 --> 00:20:20,11
那么这男的叫什么名字？
And what is this man's name?

210
00:20:20,91 --> 00:20:22,68
Smith
Smith.

211
00:20:22,72 --> 00:20:24,65
Smith先生
Mr. Smith.

212
00:20:29,79 --> 00:20:32,05
我怎么知道他的真名？
How the hell do i know his real name?

213
00:20:32,09 --> 00:20:34,22
他来找过我几次…
He saw me a couple of times...

214
00:20:34,26 --> 00:20:36,39
每次我都耍花招推诿他
when i was pulling straight tricks.

215
00:20:36,46 --> 00:20:38,90
他也一直用Smith这个名字
He always used the same name... smith.

216
00:20:40,27 --> 00:20:42,74
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

217
00:20:45,77 --> 00:20:48,94
我想你知道的应该不止这些
I think you know more about this man.

218
00:20:52,85 --> 00:20:54,31
他给小费很吝啬
He was a lousy tipper.

219
00:20:58,19 --> 00:21:05,66
开枪次数越多枪管越热
It gets hotter the more times it's fired.

220
00:21:05,66 --> 00:21:08,42
如果我知道的话  我一定会告诉你的
If i had anything on him, i'd tell you.

221
00:21:14,97 --> 00:21:19,67
我放得越近就会越痛
And it gets a lot more painful the closer i get.

222
00:21:24,81 --> 00:21:26,61
你好，老兄！
What's up, doc?

223
00:21:26,65 --> 00:21:30,17
哦，你以为自己是只“长耳兔”  （卡通形象，聪明顽皮）
Oh, you're a "wascally wabbit."

224
00:21:33,12 --> 00:21:35,35
可惜你的耳朵还不够“长”
But you're not "wascally" enough.

225
00:21:35,39 --> 00:21:37,48
是吗？
Yeah?

226
00:21:37,52 --> 00:21:39,46
你的枪是六发装
That's a six-shooter.

227
00:21:40,19 --> 00:21:42,29
我听到你已经开完了六枪
I just counted six shots.

228
00:21:43,76 --> 00:21:46,16
你现在已经没子弹了
You've blown your load.

229
00:21:52,37 --> 00:21:53,84
那你的呢？
Yeah, well, what about you?

230
00:21:53,91 --> 00:21:56,74
你那把9毫米手枪还不是一样也空了
Your 9-millimeter is empty too.

231
00:21:56,78 --> 00:21:59,97
你在屋顶上开了八枪  在厕所开了一枪...
Yeah, you fired 8 on the rooftop, one in the men's room...

232
00:22:00,01 --> 00:22:02,98
而且你的备用弹夹在广场上时  就已经用完
and your second cartridge was expended at the playground.

233
00:22:02,98 --> 00:22:05,68
要是你抢了我手下的枪  那也发射不了
And you won't be getting it up with that gun you took off my man.

234
00:22:05,72 --> 00:22:07,88
你知道的，像我们用的这种枪…
Oh, no. Well, you see, like my weapon...

235
00:22:07,92 --> 00:22:11,02
都有指纹识别装置
it also has the thumbprint safety device.

236
00:22:11,06 --> 00:22:12,86
哦，是吗？
Oh, really?

237
00:22:13,83 --> 00:22:15,09
要赌一把吗？
Wanna bet?

238
00:22:34,72 --> 00:22:36,81
这手还真不错  （语意双关：没有什么比手淫更好了）
Nothin' like a good hand job.

239
00:22:46,76 --> 00:22:49,99
收拾行李，我们离开这里
Get your things. We're goin'.

240
00:22:57,74 --> 00:22:59,40
虽然我不懂你说的是什么...
I don't understand a word you're going on about...

241
00:22:59,44 --> 00:23:02,34
但是我知道你的意思 我拒绝道歉
but i know exactly what you're saying and i refuse to apologize.

242
00:23:02,38 --> 00:23:05,35
你去死吧，Smith  我刚才差点就玩完了
Damn you, smith. I could have been snuffed back there.

243
00:23:05,38 --> 00:23:08,04
是啊，你该感谢我  保住了你漂亮的后门
Yeah, you should be thanking me for saving your sweet back door.

244
00:23:08,08 --> 00:23:10,24
你为什么等那么久才进来？
Why did you wait so goddamn long?

245
00:23:10,28 --> 00:23:12,31
你是个坏女人  坏女人应该被惩罚一下
You're a bad girl, you deserve to be punished.

246
00:23:12,35 --> 00:23:14,32
你想要哪辆车？
Which car do you want?

247
00:23:14,35 --> 00:23:16,55
- 什么意思？  - 我走累了
- What? - I'm tired of walking.

248
00:23:18,63 --> 00:23:20,39
瞧那边  （残障人士专用停车位）
Look at this.

249
00:23:25,07 --> 00:23:26,33
你想知道…
You wanna know the difference...

250
00:23:26,40 --> 00:23:29,23
这辆豪华轿车和豪猪  有什么不同吗？
between this luxury car and a porcupine?

251
00:23:29,27 --> 00:23:30,29
不知道
I give up.

252
00:23:31,77 --> 00:23:34,04
对于车来说  “刺”是隐藏在里面的
With the car, the pricks are on the inside.

253
00:23:35,38 --> 00:23:37,37
你真有材
Tell me about it.

254
00:23:54,39 --> 00:23:56,16
嗨，宝贝
Hello, honey.

255
00:23:57,83 --> 00:23:59,30
噢，好，好，很高兴...
Oh, good, good, i'm glad...

256
00:23:59,33 --> 00:24:01,49
很高兴你喜欢那些花
i'm glad you liked the flowers. Good.

257
00:24:02,34 --> 00:24:04,30
听着，宝贝...
Listen, sweetie...

258
00:24:04,34 --> 00:24:06,74
我这边遇到了点小麻烦
i've run into a small hitch.

259
00:24:08,71 --> 00:24:11,40
恐怕我得多耽搁些时间
I think i'm gonna have to be out here for a while longer.

260
00:24:11,45 --> 00:24:13,74
不过别担心
But don't worry.

261
00:24:13,78 --> 00:24:16,08
Timmy的生日聚会  我肯定会到场的...
I will be back in time for timmy's birthday party...

262
00:24:16,12 --> 00:24:17,74
我发誓
i swear to you.

263
00:24:17,78 --> 00:24:19,51
拥抱亲吻你
Hugs and kisses.

264
00:24:19,55 --> 00:24:21,21
拜拜
Bye-bye.

265
00:24:22,36 --> 00:24:24,08
那我该怎么办？
So, what was i supposed to do?

266
00:24:24,12 --> 00:24:26,22
那些人在追那个孕妇
These guys were stalking this pregnant lady.

267
00:24:26,26 --> 00:24:27,42
我不能袖手旁观
I couldn't just stand there.

268
00:24:29,93 --> 00:24:32,52
你看到没有  我他妈就讨厌这种人
Did you see that? I fuckin' hate that.

269
00:24:32,60 --> 00:24:34,29
- 怎么了？  - 这种人随便变道
- What? - This guy, changin' lanes...

270
00:24:34,37 --> 00:24:35,56
也不打转向灯
without signaling.

271
00:24:35,64 --> 00:24:37,57
我的意思是  打个转向灯能有多难？
I mean, how hard is it to use your signal?

272
00:24:39,37 --> 00:24:41,81
然后你开始朝他们开枪？
So you started shooting at them?

273
00:24:41,84 --> 00:24:44,17
不是，我身上没有枪
No, i don't carry a piece.

274
00:24:44,21 --> 00:24:46,15
我朝那个女人走去  她有枪
I went to the woman. She had a gun.

275
00:24:46,18 --> 00:24:48,31
他们开枪，我还击
They started firing, i shot back.

276
00:24:48,35 --> 00:24:50,44
他又来了
He's done it again.

277
00:24:50,48 --> 00:24:52,48
我只需移动手指一寸...
I move my finger one inch...

278
00:24:52,52 --> 00:24:53,99
就能按转向灯
to use my turn signal.

279
00:24:54,02 --> 00:24:55,51
为什么这帮混蛋这么懒…
Why are these assholes so lazy...

280
00:24:55,56 --> 00:24:58,49
只需他妈的移动手指一寸  就能驾驶得更安全
they can't move their finger one fucking measly inch...

281
00:24:58,53 --> 00:24:59,89
他们都懒得动？
to drive more safely?

282
00:25:00,86 --> 00:25:02,95
- 想知道为什么吗？  - 不是特别想
- You wanna know why? - Not particularly.

283
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:04,33
因为这帮纨绔子弟  为了赚钱…
Because these rich bastards have to...

284
00:25:04,36 --> 00:25:05,92
已经变得冷漠无情  丝毫不顾及他人了
be callous and inconsiderate in the first place...

285
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:07,66
所以他们开车时…
to make all that money, so when they get on the road...

286
00:25:07,73 --> 00:25:09,13
也很难控制自己…
they can't help themselves. They've gotta be...

287
00:25:09,17 --> 00:25:11,33
丝毫不顾及他人
callous and inconsiderate drivers too.

288
00:25:11,37 --> 00:25:12,40
这是他们的本性
It's in their nature.

289
00:25:12,47 --> 00:25:14,20
你为什么不把这孩子交给警察？
Why don't you take the baby to the police?

290
00:25:14,24 --> 00:25:16,97
- 我不能去警察局  - 为什么不能？
- I can't go to the police. - Why not?

291
00:25:17,01 --> 00:25:18,53
我就是那个“炸弹人”
I'm the unabomber.

292
00:25:18,58 --> 00:25:20,51
他们已经抓到他了
They caught the unabomber.

293
00:25:20,55 --> 00:25:21,64
他们也希望这样
That's what they think.

294
00:25:22,82 --> 00:25:24,72
这个蠢蛋…
Stupid...

295
00:25:24,75 --> 00:25:26,38
好吧，给你点颜色看看
right. That's it.

296
00:25:36,76 --> 00:25:38,99
你是世界上最暴躁的人
You are the angriest man in the world.

297
00:25:39,07 --> 00:25:42,40
如果我没记错的话  你过去非常喜欢这种感觉
If i remember right, you used to like it like that.

298
00:25:45,77 --> 00:25:48,10
你一共找了多少人？
Well, how many freelancers have you got?

299
00:25:49,41 --> 00:25:51,64
就这些？有多少本地人？
Yeah? How many local boys?

300
00:25:52,71 --> 00:25:54,41
我需要人手，明白吗？
I need men, you understand?

301
00:25:56,25 --> 00:25:57,84
我需要更多的人
I need a lot more men.

302
00:26:11,03 --> 00:26:12,56
∮听我唱歌∮
## Listen to my song ##

303

我要四个弹夹

304
00:26:15,30 --> 00:26:18,20
一盒9毫米147型中空子弹...
a box of 9-millimeter 147 hollow-points...

305
00:26:19,67 --> 00:26:21,54
...还有50发全披甲弹
...and give me 50 fmjs.

306
00:26:28,11 --> 00:26:29,81
你的钱不够
You're a little short.

307
00:26:29,85 --> 00:26:33,75
你骗人，你说你有5000美元的
You lied. You said you had $5,000.

308
00:26:33,79 --> 00:26:36,12
不够的用粮食券替代怎么样？
How about we make up the difference with food stamps?

309
00:26:36,16 --> 00:26:38,65
你想用粮食券买子弹？
You wanna buy bullets with food stamps?

310
00:26:38,69 --> 00:26:39,72
这个跟现金没什么区别
It's as good as cash.

311
00:26:39,76 --> 00:26:41,39
你真可怜，Smith
You're pathetic, smith.

312
00:26:41,43 --> 00:26:43,95
我们在外面等你
We'll wait for you outside.

313
00:26:44,03 --> 00:26:46,97
这张从献血站得来的支票怎么样？
Look, why don't i sign over this check i got at the blood bank to you?

314
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:49,03
已经有余了
Lt'll more than cover it.

315
00:26:49,10 --> 00:26:51,26
如果再加上那张你从  精子捐献中心得到的支票...
Throw in that check you got from the sperm bank...

316
00:26:51,30 --> 00:26:52,79
就差不多了
and got yourself a deal.

317
00:26:52,87 --> 00:26:54,81
周三前我是拿不到那张支票的
I don't get that check till wednesday.

318
00:26:55,44 --> 00:26:57,64
这样吧  你可以先拿走半盒子弹
Listen, why don't you take a half-a box of shells...

319
00:26:57,68 --> 00:26:58,87
如果你在周三能把钱补齐的话
and i'll give you the other half...

320
00:26:58,91 --> 00:27:00,74
我会给你剩下的半盒

00:27:00,85 --> 00:27:02,41
成交

322
00:27:28,34 --> 00:27:30,40
见鬼，Smith！
Damn it, smith!

323
00:27:30,44 --> 00:27:31,81
你这是他妈的干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:27:31,85 --> 00:27:33,11
赚点外快

325
00:27:33,15 --> 00:27:34,67
- 赚点外快？  - 对

326

得给孩子买点东西
To buy something for the baby.

327
00:27:36,78 --> 00:27:38,48
给孩子买东西？
Something for the baby?

328
00:27:42,86 --> 00:27:46,26
防弹背心看起来  比婴儿床更值得投资
A bulletproof vest is a better investment than a crib.

329
00:27:47,36 --> 00:27:50,92
让我想到了你会怎么做  才能让他上个好学校
Makes me think what you'd do to get him in the right school.

330
00:27:53,43 --> 00:27:54,42
就是这儿了
So this is it.

331
00:27:55,50 --> 00:27:58,06
虽然不是很华丽  但至少能算个家
It's not the ritz but it's home.

332
00:27:59,37 --> 00:28:01,17
看上去都那么的古老
Same old smith.

333
00:28:01,27 --> 00:28:02,50
破旧不堪
Down and dirty.

334
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:04,70
很高兴你喜欢这儿

335
00:28:12,82 --> 00:28:14,01
跟米奇打个招呼
Say hello to mickey.

336
00:28:23,13 --> 00:28:25,36
也许我该把孩子交给警察
Maybe i should take the baby to the police.

337
00:28:25,43 --> 00:28:26,99
不行，你办不到
No, you'd never make it.

338
00:28:27,07 --> 00:28:28,53
他们会在整个辖区  布下天罗地网
They'll be watching all the precincts...

339
00:28:28,60 --> 00:28:30,90
同时收买些穿蓝制服的手下
probably got some of the boys in blue on payola too.

340
00:28:45,42 --> 00:28:46,98
我已经叫来了50个人
I've rounded up 50 guys.

341
00:28:47,02 --> 00:28:48,72
这也是逼不得已的选择，是吧？
Well, i guess that's just gonna have to do, huh?

342
00:28:57,96 --> 00:29:00,33
停车，他在那边
Stop the car. He was here.

343
00:29:00,37 --> 00:29:02,23
别逗了，你怎么知道他在那边？
Come on, what makes you think he was here?

344
00:29:02,27 --> 00:29:05,03
相信我  我知道人们脑子里都在想什么
Trust me. I know what people do and i know what people think.

345
00:29:05,07 --> 00:29:08,53
自从小时候就一向如此  这是天赋
I always have. Even as a kid, i had this gift.

346
00:29:08,58 --> 00:29:10,84
你要是跟过我玩过石头剪子布
Yeah, you shoulda seen the playground hurt i laid down...

347
00:29:10,88 --> 00:29:12,85
就知道有多么痛苦了，老兄

348
00:29:12,88 --> 00:29:15,04
现在给我停车
Now stop the car.

349
00:29:16,15 --> 00:29:18,34
到底谁要杀这个孩子？
Who do you think wants this baby dead?

350
00:29:18,38 --> 00:29:20,68
我也不清楚谁要杀它
I've no idea who's tryin' to kill it.

351
00:29:20,72 --> 00:29:22,55
别用“它”这个字
Don't call him an "it."

352
00:29:22,59 --> 00:29:24,25
在我看来就是“它”
It's an "it" to me.

353
00:29:28,26 --> 00:29:31,23
告诉我，Smith  这个世界上有你喜欢的东西吗？
Tell me, smith, is there anything you like?

354
00:29:31,26 --> 00:29:33,36
有，我的隐私
Yeah, my privacy.

355
00:29:38,14 --> 00:29:40,80
除了这个你还会说什么
Tell me something i don't know per una volta...

356
00:29:40,84 --> 00:29:42,24
你这个狗娘养的混蛋
brutto figlio di puttana bastardo.

357
00:29:42,28 --> 00:29:44,80
我喜欢你这样说话的口气

358

胡萝卜？
Carrot?

360
00:29:52,15 --> 00:29:54,09
对视力有好处
It's good for your eyesight.

361
00:29:58,96 --> 00:30:00,48
这个城市这么多废弃的房子...
Of all the squats in the city...

362
00:30:00,53 --> 00:30:02,39
他怎么确定就是这座楼？
how does he know smith's in this one?

363
00:30:02,43 --> 00:30:04,02
又是幸运的猜测？
Another lucky guess?

364
00:30:04,10 --> 00:30:05,83
他可不是靠猜的
Nah, he doesn't guess.

365
00:30:05,90 --> 00:30:07,83
他能看到我们看不到的东西
He sees things we don't.

366
00:30:07,87 --> 00:30:10,84
他曾经是联邦调查局的  行为分析专家

法医行为顾问

372
00:30:25,85 --> 00:30:27,95
你不认为你最好走在后面吗，先生？
don't... you think you should hang back, sir?

373
00:30:27,99 --> 00:30:30,92
躲在后面的领导只能吃残羹冷滞
The leader who stays in the rear, takes it in the rear.

374
00:30:35,73 --> 00:30:37,59
而且
Besides...

375
00:30:42,00 --> 00:30:44,73
暴力是这个世界上  最有趣，值得一看的东西
violence is one of the most fun things to watch.

376
00:30:45,77 --> 00:30:47,07
别哭了，宝贝 别哭了
No, no, no, baby, no.

377
00:30:47,11 --> 00:30:48,77
我们可以叫他“Oliver”
We could call him oliver.

378
00:30:48,81 --> 00:30:51,37
- Oliver？  - 就像OliverTwist  （狄更斯小说《雾都孤儿》的主人公）
- Oliver? - Yeah, like oliver twist.

379
00:30:51,41 --> 00:30:53,11
因为他是个孤儿？
Because he's an orphan?

380
00:30:53,15 --> 00:30:54,27
因为我喜欢那本书
'Cause i like the book.

381
00:30:54,31 --> 00:30:56,41
- 你喜欢那本书？  - 我不讨厌那书
- You like the book. - I didn't hate it.

382
00:30:56,45 --> 00:30:58,14
这是第一次你用“喜欢”这个词
That's a first.

383
00:31:03,26 --> 00:31:05,95
你们觉得我应该选哪张生日卡片？

384
00:31:06,96 --> 00:31:08,52
让人想拥抱的可爱卡通？

00:31:09,10 --> 00:31:12,12
或是这个写的：  “你正成长为男人，儿子”
Or the one that says, "you're becomin' a man now, son"?

386
00:31:15,87 --> 00:31:17,53

So, mr. Hertz?

387
00:31:17,57 --> 00:31:18,97

（这已经演变成一场重量级的...）
Then it had to be large and powerful and...

390
00:31:23,91 --> 00:31:25,54
真不敢相信？

391
00:31:25,58 --> 00:31:26,67
电视上...
There's nothing on the tv...

392
00:31:26,71 --> 00:31:28,37
根本没有报道此事

你看
Look.

398
00:31:43,46 --> 00:31:47,90
听喋喋不休的政客畅谈枪支管制  他会一直哭
Lame-ass politician rants about gun control, he cries.

399

00:31:56,44 --> 00:31:57,88
太奇怪了
That's so weird.

403
00:32:01,18 --> 00:32:03,84
他肯定很喜欢这音乐
He must find it comforting.

404
00:32:03,88 --> 00:32:05,35
- 先生？  - 什么事？

00:32:05,39 --> 00:32:09,01
- 屋顶上的人已经就绪  - 很好
- Men are in place on the roof. - That's good.

406

如果这出戏也是这样…

443
00:35:15,24 --> 00:35:17,47
还是这家伙真的很强？
or is this guy really that good?

444
00:35:17,51 --> 00:35:17,94
快给我追！
Come on, boys!

445
00:35:19,15 --> 00:35:21,05
他还在我的掌心之中！
He ain't out of the briar patch yet!

446
00:35:40,13 --> 00:35:42,00
射死那条狗，快射死那条狗
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.

447
00:35:42,03 --> 00:35:43,30
不
No.

448
00:35:44,74 --> 00:35:46,73
- 为什么不？  - 我喜欢狗
- Why not? - I like dogs.

449
00:36:08,19 --> 00:36:09,92
等一下
Wait a minute.

450
00:36:12,87 --> 00:36:15,77
是只该死的老鼠
Oh, that rat bastard.

451
00:36:31,08 --> 00:36:32,21
那是什么？
What is it?

452
00:36:32,89 --> 00:36:34,25
婴儿尿布
It's the baby's diaper.

453
00:36:39,26 --> 00:36:41,66
你的想法太荒谬了，Smith
This idea blows, smith.

454
00:36:41,69 --> 00:36:43,18
我们只能这么办了
It's the only idea we got.

455
00:36:43,26 --> 00:36:45,73
你真的认为Oliver的妈妈
You actually think that oliver's mother...

456
00:36:45,80 --> 00:36:47,86
住在重金属俱乐部的附近
lived near a heavy metal club...

457
00:36:47,93 --> 00:36:51,37
所以他还在子宫里时  就在听那种音乐？
...and that he could hear the music while he was still inside the womb?

458
00:36:51,40 --> 00:36:52,80
对，这也是他为什么
Yep. That's why he doesn't cry...

459
00:36:52,84 --> 00:36:54,70
听到金属打击声不哭
when he's listenin' to some headbanger's bash.

460
00:36:54,74 --> 00:36:56,04
真荒谬
Ridiculous.

461
00:36:56,71 --> 00:36:58,07
瞧，他现在不是没哭吗！
Well, he isn't cryin' now.

462
00:37:01,65 --> 00:37:05,31
我遇到他妈妈的地方附近  只有这家俱乐部
So this is the only club near where i encountered the baby's mother.

463
00:37:05,35 --> 00:37:07,82
我坚持这只是你疯狂的预感
I still say this is a wild hunch.

464
00:37:07,85 --> 00:37:10,19
是吗？那你怎么解释这么多尿布盒子？
Yeah? So how do you explain all these boxes of diapers?

465
00:37:10,22 --> 00:37:12,09
一定是有人买了很多来备用
Somebody's been stocking up.

466
00:37:12,12 --> 00:37:13,89
让我们看看到底是谁
Let's find out who.

467
00:37:16,06 --> 00:37:19,23
∮你燃烧我的大腿  像鸟叫一样愉快∮
## You sear my legs, song birds cheer ##

468
00:37:19,30 --> 00:37:21,20
∮啃我的脖子∮
## eat my neck ##

469
00:37:21,23 --> 00:37:23,20
∮我不能  我不能让气氛下去∮
## i can't, i can't let it go grey ##

470
00:37:23,24 --> 00:37:26,14
∮我挣脱不开，我挣脱不开∮
## i can't break, i can't break ##

471
00:37:26,17 --> 00:37:31,13
∮我挣脱不开，我挣脱不开 我挣脱不开∮
## i can't break, i can't break, i can't break ##

472
00:37:31,18 --> 00:37:34,04
- 你是这儿的老板？  - 谁叫我？
- you the owner of this place? - Who's askin'?

473
00:37:34,08 --> 00:37:35,64
我叫的
I am.

474
00:37:37,85 --> 00:37:40,28
- 能请你喝一杯吗？  - 免了
- Can i buy you a drink? - No.

475
00:37:42,82 --> 00:37:45,09
不出我所料
Just as i suspected.

476
00:37:45,12 --> 00:37:47,52
它真的穿了环
He really is into jewelry.

477
00:37:51,13 --> 00:37:52,62
谁住在楼上？
Who occupies the room upstairs?

478
00:37:52,70 --> 00:37:54,10
去死吧
Go to hell.

479
00:37:54,13 --> 00:37:55,60
别惹怒我
Don't mess with me.

480
00:37:55,67 --> 00:37:57,50
你扯不下那环的
You ain't got the cojones.

481
00:38:00,27 --> 00:38:01,80
噢，上帝
Oh, god.

482
00:38:03,31 --> 00:38:05,14
这些都是什么人？
So who were these guys?

483
00:38:05,18 --> 00:38:09,08
11个月前我把这地方租给了  一个西装革履的家伙
I rented the place to some suit 11 months ago.

484
00:38:09,12 --> 00:38:11,64
他用现金付了一年的租金
He paid the whole year in cash.

485
00:38:11,68 --> 00:38:13,15
但后来就一直没再见过他
I never saw him again.

486
00:38:13,19 --> 00:38:15,55
我猜他们可能只走后门
I just figured they were usin' the back way.

487
00:38:21,83 --> 00:38:23,52
你可以走了
Beat it.

488
00:38:38,91 --> 00:38:40,31
哦，我的天
Oh, madonna.

489
00:38:41,71 --> 00:38:42,81
太恐怖了！
Che orrore!

490
00:38:43,45 --> 00:38:45,31
真是一团糟
This is pretty fucked up.

491
00:39:15,25 --> 00:39:17,41
先生，我是执行者
Sir, it's your go-to guy.

492
00:39:18,12 --> 00:39:19,98
所有的孕妇都被杀了
All the mothers have been killed.

493
00:39:20,02 --> 00:39:22,45
只有一个跑掉，暂时的
Only one escaped, temporarily.

494
00:39:22,49 --> 00:39:25,92
因为我们找到了她的尸体  并且确认她已经生了个孩子
We found her body and confirmed that she did deliver a child.

495
00:39:27,23 --> 00:39:28,85
孩子本应该秘密的生产
The babies were supposed to be delivered covertly.

496
00:39:28,89 --> 00:39:30,59
但我认为把产房建在  重金属俱乐部的上面
I guess setting up this maternity factory...

497
00:39:30,66 --> 00:39:33,63
并不是很隐蔽
on top of a heavy metal club wasn't particularly secret.

498
00:39:33,70 --> 00:39:36,50
所以我们需要更多的“保姆”
What a fine lot of babysitters we turned out to be.

499
00:39:36,54 --> 00:39:39,27
当执行者过去后，往左边走
When mr. Go-to guy passes, head to the left.

500
00:39:39,31 --> 00:39:40,90
是的，先生  我已经汇报了
Yes, sir, i already made the call.

501
00:39:40,94 --> 00:39:43,60
增援马上就到
Backup should be arriving any minute.

502
00:39:43,64 --> 00:39:45,41
我们要清理现场  还要把这里发生的细节
We'll clean this mess up and try to piece together...

503
00:39:45,44 --> 00:39:46,64
尽量拼凑起来
everything that happened.

504
00:39:47,81 --> 00:39:50,91
谢谢，先生  感谢您对我的信任
Thank you, sir. I appreciate your confidence.

505
00:39:52,08 --> 00:39:54,58
先生们，让我们找到答案
Gentlemen, let's find some answers.

506
00:39:58,72 --> 00:40:01,16
注意脚下
Watch where you step.

507
00:40:01,26 --> 00:40:04,39
- 冰淇淋正在融化  - 什么？
- The ice cream is melting. - What?

508
00:40:04,43 --> 00:40:06,83
我还以为捐献精子是在你们部门呢！  （影射她是妓女）
I thought donor sperm was your department.

509
00:40:07,33 --> 00:40:09,20
冷藏柜里全是精子样品
These freezers are full of samples.

510
00:40:10,90 --> 00:40:12,73
奇怪了
This is weird.

511
00:40:12,77 --> 00:40:14,57
似乎只有一个人在捐献
There seems to be only one donor.

512
00:40:14,61 --> 00:40:16,13
一个人？
One donor?

513
00:40:16,18 --> 00:40:18,54
是的，他对此可真是慷慨
Yeah. And a generous one at that.

514
00:40:27,35 --> 00:40:29,12
这是骨髓血
This is bone marrow blood.

515
00:40:29,16 --> 00:40:31,18
一定是用来治某种病的
It must be for some kind of cure.

516
00:40:33,23 --> 00:40:34,66
你怎么知道，Smith？
How do you know that, smith?

517
00:40:34,69 --> 00:40:36,59
你没听说我得过诺贝尔奖吗？
You didn't hear about my nobel prize?

518
00:40:44,40 --> 00:40:48,13
很难找到与受捐者一致的骨髓
See, what it is, it's hard to find marrow that matches that of the recipient.

519
00:40:48,17 --> 00:40:50,54
但如果捐献者与受捐者
The odds are much better if the donor marrow shares...

520
00:40:50,58 --> 00:40:53,14
有相同的DNA  那一致的机率就会大很多
the same dna with the person receiving it.

521
00:40:54,58 --> 00:40:57,45
你是说这些人培育婴儿
You mean these people were harvesting babies...

522
00:40:57,48 --> 00:40:59,82
是为了给某人做骨髓移植？
for some guy's bone marrow transplant?

523
00:40:59,85 --> 00:41:02,98
没错，但还有某些人  不想让他得到骨髓
Exactly. And somebody wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

524
00:41:03,49 --> 00:41:05,75
所以他们要杀掉Oliver
That's why they want oliver dead.

525
00:41:31,48 --> 00:41:33,28
不哭，宝贝，不哭
No, my baby, no.

526
00:41:34,85 --> 00:41:37,25
我已经给国家广播电台（NBC）  的熟人打了电话
So i called that guy i know at nbc.

527
00:41:37,29 --> 00:41:38,88
很好
That's good.

528
00:41:39,73 --> 00:41:41,12
然后我又想
And then i got to thinking.

529
00:41:41,16 --> 00:41:43,99
- 你知道我讨厌什么吗？ - 又来了
- You know what i hate? - Here we go again.

530
00:41:44,06 --> 00:41:45,69
我讨厌那些蹩脚的动作片里
I hate those lame action movies...

531
00:41:45,76 --> 00:41:48,36
好人只给一个人打电话  而他因为被出卖以死告终
where the good guy calls just one person who ends up betrayin' him.

532
00:41:49,07 --> 00:41:52,77
是呀，他们会来杀这孩子的
Yeah. That's right up there with killing baby seals.

533
00:41:52,81 --> 00:41:56,67
所以我打电话给美国广播公司  哥伦比亚比亚广播公司、邮报、泰晤士报
I called abc, cbs, the post, the times...

534
00:41:56,71 --> 00:41:59,18
地方新闻频道，还有联邦调查局
the local news channel, and the fbi.

535
00:42:00,88 --> 00:42:02,87
那我们下一步怎么办？
So, what do we do next?

536
00:42:02,92 --> 00:42:04,91
暂时待在这儿看新闻
I figure we hang here and watch the news.

537
00:42:04,95 --> 00:42:07,68
如果事情暴光  我们或许就安全了
Once the story goes public, maybe we'll be safe.

538
00:42:09,02 --> 00:42:12,12
看，他终于睡着了
Look. He finally went to sleep.

539
00:42:12,16 --> 00:42:13,78
你等着看
Yeah, you just wait.

540
00:42:13,83 --> 00:42:17,42
只要你一闭眼休息  他就又会大哭大叫了
The moment you close your eyes for a nap, he'll start screaming.

541
00:42:17,50 --> 00:42:20,93
你对什么事情都没有兴趣，对吧？
You can't take a little pleasure in anything, can you?

542
00:42:20,97 --> 00:42:22,96
你讨厌所有的事情
You just hate everything.

543
00:42:23,60 --> 00:42:24,63
我不讨厌你
I don't hate you.

544
00:42:25,50 --> 00:42:26,97
这就是为什么你选中了我？
Is that why you picked me?

545
00:42:27,04 --> 00:42:28,20
你知道我为什么选你
You know why i picked you.

546
00:42:29,11 --> 00:42:31,54
但你不知道  你对我做了什么
You have no idea what you've done to me.

547
00:42:31,58 --> 00:42:33,81
相信我，我们会脱身的
We're gonna get out of this, trust me.

548
00:42:33,85 --> 00:42:36,78
- 你根本就不明白  - 什么？
- You just don't get it. - What?

549
00:42:38,42 --> 00:42:44,58
你把这个婴儿交给我  让我喂养他，照顾他
You bring me this child so i can feed him, take care of him.

550
00:42:44,62 --> 00:42:47,79
但他随时都有可能被杀死
A baby that could be dead at any moment.

551
00:42:47,83 --> 00:42:50,09
而你从来没有问过我
And you never even think to ask me...

552
00:42:50,16 --> 00:42:52,06
我自己的孩子怎么了？
what happened to my own child.

553
00:42:57,14 --> 00:42:58,73
你说得对
You're right.

554
00:43:01,21 --> 00:43:02,64
这是不可原谅的
It's unforgivable.

555
00:43:05,54 --> 00:43:08,10
不，是我的错
No. It's my fault.

556
00:43:08,88 --> 00:43:11,91
就像我妈妈常说的
It's like what my mamma always said...

557
00:43:11,95 --> 00:43:15,75
“le uova non devono  ballare con le pietre.”
"le uova non devono ballare con le pietre."

558
00:43:15,79 --> 00:43:18,85
如果我向你道歉  你能告诉我那是什么意思吗？
If i say i'm sorry will you tell me what that means?

559
00:43:19,99 --> 00:43:23,39
永远不要拿鸡蛋碰石头
Eggs have no business dancing with stones.

560
00:43:47,79 --> 00:43:49,65
你知道吗，Smith
You know, smith...

561
00:43:49,69 --> 00:43:52,99
我终于知道你最讨厌什么了
i figured out what you hate most...

562
00:43:53,03 --> 00:43:54,62
你自己
yourself.

563
00:43:57,66 --> 00:43:59,46
你的孩子怎么了？
What happened to your baby?

564
00:43:59,53 --> 00:44:01,19
忘了吧！
Forget about it.

565
00:44:01,33 --> 00:44:02,89
告诉我
Tell me.

566
00:44:03,74 --> 00:44:06,30
我的嫖客撞我的肚子
My pimp hit me in the stomach.

567
00:44:07,54 --> 00:44:09,40
我的孩子...
My baby...

568
00:44:09,44 --> 00:44:11,47
流产夭折了
was delivered stillborn.

569
00:44:16,15 --> 00:44:17,78
- 放开我  - 嘿
- Get off of me! - Hey.

570
00:44:34,90 --> 00:44:36,42
你喜欢这个，是吗？
You like this, do ya?

571
00:44:40,77 --> 00:44:43,74
这叫枪
It's called a gun.

572
00:44:43,78 --> 00:44:49,31
枪托、套筒、后膛、枪管、板机
Grip, slide, breech, barrel, trigger.

573
00:44:49,35 --> 00:44:52,22
这是枪口
Now, this is the business end.

574
00:44:52,25 --> 00:44:55,85
永远不要把枪口指向  任何你不想杀死的东西
You should never point this at anything you don't intend to kill.

575
00:44:57,22 --> 00:45:01,28
这个很重要，这是保险
Now, this is important. This is called your safety.

576
00:45:01,39 --> 00:45:05,35
你要一直开着它  以确保枪不会走火
You have to keep this on to make sure the gun doesn't go off accidentally.

577
00:45:05,40 --> 00:45:10,33
但实际上，这个才是你的一号保险
But really, this is your number one safety.

578
00:45:15,74 --> 00:45:17,61
你饿吗？
Are you hungry?

579
00:45:55,41 --> 00:46:03,01
∮我看着这些年轻迷离的双眼∮
## I watched those youthful paisley eyes ##

580
00:46:03,06 --> 00:46:09,72
∮他们像孩子一样盯着荧幕∮
## they drink the screen just like a child ##

581
00:47:18,26 --> 00:47:20,49
下面的“枪”法怎样？
talk about shootin' your load.

582
00:47:27,14 --> 00:47:28,27
看看这个
Look at this.

583
00:47:29,11 --> 00:47:31,27
这是Hammerson公司的Nite tac型手枪
This is a hammerson nite tac.

584
00:47:31,31 --> 00:47:33,54
它们应该在六个月后才上市
These aren't supposed to hit the streets for 6 months.

585
00:47:35,78 --> 00:47:37,84
有点奇怪
This is weird.

586
00:47:37,88 --> 00:47:39,82
这些人都用这种枪
All these guys have got 'em.

587
00:47:44,82 --> 00:47:46,35
不用说了
Don't even tell me.

588
00:47:46,39 --> 00:47:48,95
你知道他杀了我们多少人吗？
Do you know how many of our men he's body-bagged now?

589
00:47:48,99 --> 00:47:53,06
我为什么要  浪费我的聪明才智去想这种事？
Why should i waste my beautiful mind on something like that?

590
00:47:53,13 --> 00:47:54,93
你一点也不生气？
Doesn't it piss you off a little?

591
00:47:55,00 --> 00:47:57,03
生气会让你产生一种酶
Getting angry releases an enzyme...

592
00:47:57,10 --> 00:47:58,54
色氨酸羟化酶
tryptophan hydroxylase...

593
00:47:58,57 --> 00:48:01,20
它会让智商暂时性降低
which can temporarily reduce the i.q.

594
00:48:01,24 --> 00:48:03,47
这可是我现在负担不起的
That's something i can't afford to do right now.

595
00:48:03,51 --> 00:48:05,70
你怎么会懂这些？
How do you know all that?

596
00:48:05,74 --> 00:48:07,84
我儿子整天看探索频道
My boy's hooked on the discovery channel.

597
00:48:07,88 --> 00:48:10,37
带我回总部，我得向上面汇报
Take me westside. I need to report in.

598
00:48:10,42 --> 00:48:12,91
我们的英雄有线索了
I got a bead on who our mr. Hero is.

599
00:48:16,72 --> 00:48:17,95
不要再争了
No more arguments.

600
00:48:17,99 --> 00:48:20,02
我必须一个人去  只有确保你们俩的安全后
I have to do this alone, and the only way i can do it...

601
00:48:20,06 --> 00:48:22,19
我才能大胆去干
is if i'm positive you two are ok.

602
00:48:24,26 --> 00:48:26,96
这是唯一我认为安全的地方
This is the only place i know you'll be safe.

603
00:48:27,03 --> 00:48:30,00
- 坦克？  - 一辆M24型坦克
- A tank? - An m24 tank.

604
00:48:30,07 --> 00:48:32,43
在里面你能躲避子弹  和绝大多数的爆炸
You'll be safe from gunfire and most explosives.

605
00:48:32,47 --> 00:48:35,27
- 你疯了  - 没错
- You're whacked. - I am.

606
00:48:35,31 --> 00:48:36,93
我是说真的
I'm also serious.

607
00:48:36,98 --> 00:48:39,07
但任何人都不被允许进去
But nobody's allowed to get in it.

608
00:48:39,11 --> 00:48:42,38
别担心，我吸引他们的注意力  你趁机爬进去
Don't worry. When i create a diversion, you climb inside.

609
00:48:43,68 --> 00:48:44,91
你应该有足够
You should have enough of that baby food...

610
00:48:44,95 --> 00:48:46,82
让婴儿喝几天的奶吧！
to last you a couple of days.

611
00:48:46,85 --> 00:48:49,34
生吃胡萝卜是最好的
The pureed carrots are the best.

612
00:48:50,49 --> 00:48:52,29
你知道怎么用这个，对吧？
Well, you know how to use this, right?

613
00:48:54,09 --> 00:48:56,25
是的，但如果你回不来怎么办？
Yes, but what if you don't come back?

614
00:48:57,00 --> 00:48:58,66
那不可能
That's not gonna happen.

615
00:48:58,73 --> 00:49:00,39
你没办法百分之百保证
There is no way to be sure.

616
00:49:02,30 --> 00:49:03,79
我能保证
Yes, there is.

617
00:49:18,68 --> 00:49:22,05
你是英雄，是我的英雄
Tu sei una stella, la mia stella.

618
00:49:23,66 --> 00:49:26,72
- 妈妈，我要回家  - 别闹了
- But, mom, i wanna go home! - Stop whining!

619
00:49:26,76 --> 00:49:29,25
你要是再不老实  我就打你屁股
If you don't behave, i am going to spank you.

620
00:49:29,29 --> 00:49:31,85
- 妈妈，我要回家  - 别闹了
- But, mom, i wanna go home! - Stop whining.

621
00:49:31,93 --> 00:49:33,16
不要再闹了
Stop it!

622
00:49:33,23 --> 00:49:34,32
我最讨厌父母…
I hate it when parents...

623
00:49:34,40 --> 00:49:36,26
- 打他们的孩子  - 放开我的胳膊！
- hit their children. - Let go of my arm!

624
00:49:36,30 --> 00:49:37,96
除非你不再打他
Not until you stop hittin' your kid.

625
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:39,99
怎么管教小孩是我自己的事
I will discipline my child as i see fit.

626
00:49:40,07 --> 00:49:42,23
那你喜不喜欢我打你屁股？
How would you like it if i spanked you?

627
00:49:42,27 --> 00:49:43,26
什么？
What?

628
00:49:44,14 --> 00:49:45,77
- 怎样？  - 救命！
- See? - Help!

629
00:49:45,81 --> 00:49:48,11
感觉不好，是吧？
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

630
00:49:49,08 --> 00:49:50,28
救命！
Help!

631
00:49:50,32 --> 00:49:51,51
救命！
Help!

632
00:49:52,52 --> 00:49:54,88
你他妈的这是在干什吗？
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

633
00:49:57,82 --> 00:49:59,15
这不好笑！
It's not funny.

634
00:50:14,51 --> 00:50:18,37
有查到关于那个硬汉的什么吗？
So, what you got on this all-star ground pounder?

635
00:50:18,41 --> 00:50:21,11
那么厉害的人  通常是自小就很出色
Well, anybody this good had to start out young.

636
00:50:21,15 --> 00:50:24,51
通常也是因为他们的父亲  非常厉害
And it's usually because their pop was good at it too.

637
00:50:24,55 --> 00:50:26,78
就像Macarthur（麦克阿瑟：美五星上将）  的父亲是个将军...
You know, like macarthur's dad was a general...

638
00:50:26,82 --> 00:50:28,84
Mickey Mantle（美职业棒球员） 的父亲是职业棒球手
and mickey mantle's father played pro ball.

639
00:50:28,89 --> 00:50:30,38
我儿子是个电子游戏高手...
My son is a video game whiz...

640
00:50:30,42 --> 00:50:32,86
而我玩得也不差
and i wasn't too bad at pong myself.

641
00:50:33,76 --> 00:50:36,46
请继续听我说  如果你愿意，Hammerson先生
Just follow me, if you will, mr. Hammerson.

642
00:50:36,50 --> 00:50:40,49
1967年，英国实施严厉的枪支管制
In '67, the limeys got hard-ass on gun control.

643
00:50:40,57 --> 00:50:44,26
所以很多造枪的英国人  来到美国
So a lot of brit gunsmiths moved to the states.

644
00:50:44,30 --> 00:50:46,53
我在移民局的一个线人...
Now, i've got an inside man at lmmigration...

645
00:50:46,57 --> 00:50:49,54
正在查这些人中...
working on which of these guys had sons...

646
00:50:49,57 --> 00:50:51,63
谁的儿子是个神枪手
and if any of the boys were crack shots.

647
00:50:51,68 --> 00:50:54,04
你想的这都是什么狗屁东西
I think the pucker factor's gettin' to you.

648
00:50:54,71 --> 00:50:56,24
你真能扯淡！
You got diddly!

649
00:50:58,25 --> 00:51:01,95
好的，公爵夫人  好女孩，坐下
Yes, duchess, you a good girl. Sit.

650
00:51:01,99 --> 00:51:04,79
现在是你享受的时刻了
Yes. Now's your treat. Now you get your treat.

651
00:51:04,82 --> 00:51:06,52
我的人逐个追查这些人...
My man has been running the name down...

652
00:51:06,56 --> 00:51:10,49
并发现其中一个造枪人的儿子
and he recalled one of these gunsmith kids, actually.

653
00:51:11,93 --> 00:51:14,36
十岁时获得全国运动会射击冠军...
National sports pistol champion at age 10...

654
00:51:14,40 --> 00:51:17,30
有望参加奥运会  却被征招入伍
olympic hopeful, recruited by the army.

655
00:51:19,60 --> 00:51:20,57
- 但从那以后，这个孩子...  - 亲亲，亲亲
- But after that, the kid is... - kisses, kisses, kisses.

656
00:51:20,64 --> 00:51:22,61
...就消失了
...never heard from again.

657
00:51:22,64 --> 00:51:25,51
看起来像是秘密特工组织  找到他，并培训他
Well, that sounds like black ops got him, trained him.

658
00:51:25,54 --> 00:51:28,74
- 于是我总结出一个理论  - 理论？
- This leads me to a theory. - A theory?

659
00:51:28,78 --> 00:51:30,71
理论就是狗屁
A theory is bull-noogies.

660
00:51:30,75 --> 00:51:34,45
你找到的只是一个无名小卒
All you got is a man with no name...

661
00:51:34,49 --> 00:51:37,28
骑着一匹瘦马冲进城堡
ridin' into town on a pale horse...

662
00:51:37,32 --> 00:51:39,95
宣扬自己标榜的正义
dispensin' his own brand o' justice.

663
00:52:11,29 --> 00:52:14,66
Hertz，你知道这个国家的人  为什么这么喜欢枪吗？
Hertz, you know why people in this country love guns?

664
00:52:14,69 --> 00:52:16,82
这和生殖器崇拜
And it's got nothin' to do with all that...

665
00:52:16,86 --> 00:52:20,82
比如“武装阳具”的没什么关系
phallic mumbo jumbo, like "cockin' your gun."

666
00:52:20,90 --> 00:52:23,13
Hertz，人们喜欢枪...
No, hertz, people love guns...

667
00:52:23,17 --> 00:52:27,16
因为美国是机遇的天堂
because america is a land of opportunity...

668
00:52:27,24 --> 00:52:29,87
这里穷人能够变得富有...
where a poor man can become rich...

669
00:52:31,31 --> 00:52:34,34
胆小鬼也能变成硬汉
...and a pussy can become a tough guy...

670
00:52:34,38 --> 00:52:37,14
只要他手里有把枪
if he's got a gun in his hand.

671
00:52:39,68 --> 00:52:43,64
我希望你不是  手里拿着枪的胆小鬼
I'm hopin' you're not just a pussy with a gun in your hand.

672
00:52:43,69 --> 00:52:46,85
哦，不不，先生  我不是
Oh, no, sir, no. No, i'm not.

673
00:52:46,89 --> 00:52:49,62
我是一个手握胆小鬼的硬汉
I'm a tough guy with a pussy in my hand.

674
00:52:54,77 --> 00:52:57,10
我要你杀了这个家伙
I want you to give this guy...

675
00:52:57,14 --> 00:53:00,04
还有那个婴儿
and the kid a dirt nap.

676
00:53:00,14 --> 00:53:02,66
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

677
00:53:05,21 --> 00:53:06,80
机会来了，先生
Right away, sir.

678
00:53:09,21 --> 00:53:10,51
我的小宝贝
Amore mio.

679
00:53:12,18 --> 00:53:13,52
别担心
Don't worry.

680
00:53:13,55 --> 00:53:15,42
爸爸一会儿就会回来
Daddy will be back soon.

681
00:53:33,91 --> 00:53:35,37
停一下，停一下
Hold it! Hold it!

682
00:53:39,21 --> 00:53:40,58
哦，哦，兔子先生
Well, well, well, mr. Bunny.

683
00:53:40,61 --> 00:53:43,41
你还在不断地蹦来蹦去，是吧？
You just keep goin', goin', goin', don't ya?

684
00:53:43,45 --> 00:53:46,51
- 你也是  - 我保证...
- So do you. - I promise to, uh...

685
00:53:46,55 --> 00:53:48,02
保证不杀你，只要你告诉我...
to spare your life if you tell me where...

686
00:53:48,05 --> 00:53:49,49
那个女人和婴儿在哪儿
the woman and child are.

687
00:53:49,52 --> 00:53:51,28
做梦吧
Forget it.

688
00:54:02,20 --> 00:54:04,50
哦，伙计
Oh, boy.

689
00:54:04,54 --> 00:54:06,94
谁训练你的
'Ey, who trained you?

690
00:54:06,97 --> 00:54:11,00
国家安全局的秘密特工组织？  中央情报局？还是军队？
N.s.a. Black ops? Cia? The army?

691
00:54:11,04 --> 00:54:14,41
不管是谁，你枪法很准，冠军
Well, whoever. It seems you haven't lost your aim, champ.

692
00:54:14,75 --> 00:54:17,77
这就很好吗？  你还没看到我在雪地里射出我的名字！
You think that's good, you should see me spell my name in the snow.

693
00:54:21,29 --> 00:54:22,95
我的老板也在这里
'Ey, you know, my boss here...

694
00:54:22,99 --> 00:54:26,52
他认为你是个孤独战士或什么的
thinks that you're the lone ranger or something.

695
00:54:26,56 --> 00:54:30,05
不过，我觉得我更了解你
Well, i believe i have a better idea about who you are.

696
00:54:31,36 --> 00:54:34,73
我查到你的老婆和儿子  是怎么死的
I found out how your wife and son were killed.

697
00:54:34,77 --> 00:54:37,06
哦，天呐！ 太悲惨了
My god, what a tragedy.

698
00:54:37,10 --> 00:54:39,50
有人走进汉堡店
Some guy walks into a burger joint...

699
00:54:39,54 --> 00:54:41,90
然后开始开枪扫射
he starts shooting up the place.

700
00:54:41,94 --> 00:54:43,81
哦，天呀！ 太遗憾了
Oh, my god, what a shame...

701
00:54:43,84 --> 00:54:45,71
当时你的老婆和儿子
that your wife and son were there...

702
00:54:45,74 --> 00:54:49,24
正在那儿吃鸡块
having their... chicken nuggets.

703
00:54:55,42 --> 00:54:57,65
怎么了，你不喜欢这个故事？
What's the matter, ya don't like that story?

704
00:55:00,79 --> 00:55:02,92
好，那你给我讲一个吧
Well, then why don't ya tell me one, hm?

705
00:55:02,96 --> 00:55:05,33
来个少儿故事
Children's story, please.

706
00:55:05,87 --> 00:55:07,61
说一个你感兴趣的故事吧

707
00:55:08,27 --> 00:55:10,17
告诉我关于那个婴儿的故事
Tell me the one about the baby.

708
00:55:11,44 --> 00:55:13,30
或许等一会...
Maybe later...

709
00:55:13,34 --> 00:55:14,81
等我让你们都睡下再讲
when i put you to sleep.

710
00:55:19,21 --> 00:55:20,34
上，上!
Go, go!

711
00:56:30,52 --> 00:56:32,51
你觉得我这进一步的改进如何？
So, what do you think of this second amendment now?

712
00:56:32,95 --> 00:56:34,04
操你妈！
Fuck you!

713
00:56:35,49 --> 00:56:38,08
好了，伙计 把枪放下
Ok, buddy, drop your weapon.

714
00:56:48,83 --> 00:56:50,60
抓住他了？
Think we got him?

715
00:57:14,69 --> 00:57:18,09
真他妈见鬼，Smith！
God damn it, smith!

716
00:57:18,30 --> 00:57:20,23
我查出了是谁想杀死这个婴儿
So i found out who's tryin' to kill our baby.

717
00:57:20,30 --> 00:57:22,36
- 谁？  - 一个叫Hammerson的家伙
- Who? - A man named hammerson.

718
00:57:23,50 --> 00:57:25,70
出生时屁股就夹一把金勺子  （讽：出生于有钱人家）
Born with a silver spoon up his ass.

719
00:57:25,74 --> 00:57:27,71
从他老爸那里继承了Hammer武器公司...
Inherited the hammer firearms corporation...

720
00:57:27,74 --> 00:57:30,61
靠制造武器发了大财
from his old man and makes millions manufacturing weapons.

721
00:57:30,64 --> 00:57:32,74
那这些能让你想到是谁
Does this give you any new ideas...

722
00:57:32,78 --> 00:57:35,04
想要Oliver的骨髓吗？
about who needs oliver's bone marrow?

723
00:57:35,08 --> 00:57:36,41
还不能
No.

724
00:57:37,18 --> 00:57:39,21
没关系，小Oliver
It's ok, little oliver.

725
00:57:42,92 --> 00:57:45,58
狗屎！是他
Shit. It's him.

726
00:57:45,62 --> 00:57:48,42
Rutledge议员
Senator rutledge.

727
00:57:48,46 --> 00:57:51,55
如果他当选总统  他会让Hammerson公司停业破产
If he's elected president, he'll put hammerson out of business.

728
00:57:51,63 --> 00:57:53,65
有道理，但你怎么这么确定？
It makes sense, but how can you be sure?

729
00:57:53,73 --> 00:57:56,53
那个执行者打电话时说  需要更多的“保姆”
Mr. Go-to guy called his men a fine lot of babysitters.

730
00:57:56,57 --> 00:58:00,80
情报局也让他们的特工  去保护那些“保姆”
The secret service calls their agents who guard vips babysitters.

731
00:58:00,84 --> 00:58:02,40
就是他，Rutledge议员
It's him, senator rutledge.

732
00:58:02,44 --> 00:58:04,00
就是他需要这个婴儿
He's the guy that needs this baby.

733
00:58:04,04 --> 00:58:06,98
那我们联系上他  我们就安全了
So we contact this man and then we're safe.

734
00:58:07,01 --> 00:58:08,77
- 就结束了  - 你疯了吗？
- It's over. - Are you crazy?

735
00:58:08,81 --> 00:58:10,11
这样的话不仅是Hammerson...
This means that we've got hammerson...

736
00:58:10,15 --> 00:58:12,41
还有整个美国政府都会来追杀我们
and the whole of the u.s. Government after us.

737
00:58:12,45 --> 00:58:14,08
你们俩得离开这里
I think you two have gotta get out of town.

738
00:58:14,79 --> 00:58:16,58
直到我解决完这件事  你们俩才能安全
Until i get the answers, you'll never be safe.

739
00:58:16,62 --> 00:58:20,22
他们会监视火车站  汽车站和飞机场
They'll be watchin' the trains, the bus stations and the airports...

740
00:58:20,26 --> 00:58:22,73
所以这是你们离开的最安全办法
so i think this is the safest way to get out of town.

741
00:58:24,23 --> 00:58:26,25
我要去把这件事做个了结  如果一切顺利
I'm gonna check all of this out, and if everything's ok...

742
00:58:26,33 --> 00:58:28,13
我会在你们上车离开前和你们碰面
i'll get you before you board the bus.

743
00:58:28,20 --> 00:58:31,60
但是…如果在我们走之前  你没来怎么办？
But... what if you don't get to us before we leave?

744
00:58:31,64 --> 00:58:33,43
那我应该在哪里下车？
Where should i get off?

745
00:58:34,54 --> 00:58:35,87
我想我不知道为好
I think it's better if i don't know.

746
00:58:35,91 --> 00:58:37,34
- 什么？  - 相信我
- What? - Trust me.

747
00:58:38,61 --> 00:58:40,34
我不能知道
I can't know.

748
00:58:47,05 --> 00:58:49,78
Smith，你认为这样真的能行吗？
Smith, do you really think this is gonna work?

749
00:58:49,82 --> 00:58:53,02
如果一切按计划行事  应该没有问题
Just stick to the plan and everything will be all right.

750
00:58:54,36 --> 00:58:56,02
快跑！
Run!

751
01:01:21,57 --> 01:01:23,90
你们的安全带系得太紧了
So much for wearin' your seat belt.

752
01:01:50,17 --> 01:01:52,03
那是什么鬼东西？
What in the hell is that?

753
01:01:53,60 --> 01:01:56,63
哦，天哪! 是个陷阱
Oh, my god, that is twisted.

754
01:01:56,67 --> 01:01:58,64
那个婊子养的混蛋
That sick son of a bitch.

755
01:01:59,51 --> 01:02:02,48
哦，那个婊子养的混蛋  又把我们给耍了
Oh, that sick son of a bitch suckered us again!

756
01:02:07,69 --> 01:02:09,98
小宝贝，我们该走了
It's time to go, little boy.

757
01:02:13,93 --> 01:02:16,76
帮我接通任何一个  Rutledge议员的保镖
Put me through to whoever's protecting senator rutledge.

758
01:02:19,10 --> 01:02:21,57
告诉他是个带着婴儿的人打来的
Just tell him there's a man with a baby calling.

759
01:02:24,14 --> 01:02:26,30
你好，是Smith吗？
Hello, is this smith?

760
01:02:26,34 --> 01:02:28,93
你们在市区培育婴儿的事情  掩盖的不错
That was a nice job coverin' up your baby hatchery downtown.

761
01:02:28,97 --> 01:02:31,53
新闻里一点没提
Not a word about it anywhere.

762
01:02:31,58 --> 01:02:33,94
只有你们这些在华盛顿的人  才有这种能耐
Only you guys in washington have that kind of pull.

763
01:02:33,98 --> 01:02:36,78
我想告诉你，我们是一条船上的
I'm telling you, we're on the same side.

764
01:02:36,81 --> 01:02:40,22
听着，这件事可以很简单  也可以很复杂
Now, listen, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

765
01:02:40,25 --> 01:02:41,74
我想见议员
I wanna see the senator.

766
01:02:43,35 --> 01:02:46,59
好的，他也想见你
All right. He wants to see you too.

767
01:02:46,62 --> 01:02:49,75
他正要去North Carolina州  初选将在三天后进行
He's leaving for north carolina. The primary's in three days.

768
01:02:49,79 --> 01:02:53,73
你可以和他乘同一架飞机  七号跑道，两个小时后起飞
You can fly with him. Runway 7, two hours.

769
01:02:53,77 --> 01:02:58,13
如果你们搞花样  我就把事情闹大
I see anythin' i don't like, i'm blowin' this big time.

770
01:03:11,62 --> 01:03:12,74
你在里面做什么？
What were you doing in there?

771
01:03:15,19 --> 01:03:18,49
- 擦枪  - 真的？
- Cleaning my gun. - Really?

772
01:03:19,86 --> 01:03:21,92
你知道，我们从来  没想过要真的杀你
You know, we were never really trying to kill you.

773
01:03:21,96 --> 01:03:24,12
我们只是想逼你投降而已
We only wanted to scare you into surrendering.

774
01:03:24,16 --> 01:03:27,33
这倒可以解释  为什么你们总打不中我
Well, that's one way to explain why you can't shoot straight.

775
01:03:27,40 --> 01:03:28,96
最新的民意调查显示，Rutledge议员
In the latest poll, senator rutledge...

776
01:03:29,03 --> 01:03:30,93
继续领先于其它民主党候选人
continues to be the democratic frontrunner...

777
01:03:30,97 --> 01:03:33,16
到下周二的大选
heading into next week's super tuesday primary.

778
01:03:33,20 --> 01:03:35,64
他会领先对手至少十个百分点
He leads his rival by at least 10 points...

779
01:03:38,94 --> 01:03:40,04
我欠你一条命
i owe you my life.

780
01:03:40,08 --> 01:03:42,27
这就是你处理那些妓女的地方？
So this is where you get to do all those hookers.

781
01:03:44,78 --> 01:03:47,65
- 我听说过你  - 你看起来没有电视里精神
- I heard about you. - You look worse than you do on tv.

782
01:03:47,69 --> 01:03:51,78
是的，很神奇吧  化妆的效果不同凡想
Yes, it's amazing what a little makeup can do.

783
01:03:51,82 --> 01:03:53,52
还有大量的吗啡
And a lot of morphine.

784
01:03:56,86 --> 01:04:00,32
你已经把所有细节都拼凑起来了
So, you've pieced the whole thing together.

785
01:04:01,43 --> 01:04:04,33
非常聪明，Smith先生  非常聪明
Very clever, mr. Smith. Very clever.

786
01:04:04,37 --> 01:04:06,10
很简单
Simple.

787
01:04:06,14 --> 01:04:08,11
你是民主党的头号候选人
You're the democratic frontrunner for president...

788
01:04:08,17 --> 01:04:10,44
你的对枪支管制的提议
and your sweeping gun control proposals...

789
01:04:10,47 --> 01:04:13,31
惹恼了不该惹的人
are pissing the wrong people off.

790
01:04:13,34 --> 01:04:17,34
如果他们现在已经生气  等我当上总统他们就更有得瞧了
Yes, well, if they're pissed now, wait until i'm elected president.

791
01:04:17,38 --> 01:04:18,81
我们有太多该死的
We got so many goddamn...

792
01:04:18,85 --> 01:04:20,01
枪械店
gun lobbies out there...

793
01:04:20,05 --> 01:04:22,85
所以我们要提出很多议案
that we're gonna have to set up just as many commissions.

794
01:04:22,89 --> 01:04:25,25
或许我们的议案第一年就能通过
Then maybe we'll get our bill passed in the first year.

795
01:04:25,29 --> 01:04:27,85
不幸的是，那些生产枪械的疯子  发现了你的病情
Unfortunately, you're sick and the gun nazis found out.

796
01:04:27,89 --> 01:04:31,69
他们找到了你的婴儿培育所  认为杀光他们，问题就解决了
They discovered your baby hatchery and, boom, problem solved.

797
01:04:31,73 --> 01:04:35,13
- 杀了婴儿也就相当于杀了你  - 正确
- They kill you by killin' the babies. - Correct.

798
01:04:35,83 --> 01:04:36,96
那我的救星在哪？
So, where's my savior?

799
01:04:38,50 --> 01:04:40,06
哦，天呀，枪！
Oh, my god! Gun!

800
01:04:40,10 --> 01:04:43,04
镇静，镇静
Easy, easy.

801
01:04:43,07 --> 01:04:44,84
你知道我最讨厌什么吗？
You know what i hate most?

802
01:04:44,88 --> 01:04:46,28
- 骗子  - 你他妈的想干什么？
- Liars. - What the hell you doin'?

803
01:04:46,31 --> 01:04:47,74
你和Hammerson是串通好的
You made a deal with hammerson.

804
01:04:47,78 --> 01:04:48,94
- 没有，你疯了  - 是吗？
- No, you're crazy. - Am i?

805
01:04:48,98 --> 01:04:50,35
- 你...  - 你和他穷搞的时候...
- Y... - when you got into bed with him...

806
01:04:50,38 --> 01:04:52,21
他的狗也上了你们的床
you also let his dog up on the mattress.

807
01:04:52,25 --> 01:04:53,72
看看你裤子上的那些狗毛...
Lookin' at those dog hairs on your trousers...

808
01:04:53,75 --> 01:04:55,72
我敢说“老公爵夫人”  肯定喜欢上你了
i'd say old duchess took a likin' to you.

809
01:04:55,75 --> 01:04:57,05
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

810
01:04:57,09 --> 01:04:59,28
你的计划留着  你当上总统再说吧，Rutledge
Save the line for when you're in office, rutledge.

811
01:04:59,32 --> 01:05:00,59
如果他还能当总统
If he ever makes it there.

812
01:05:00,63 --> 01:05:02,25
你知道我还讨厌什么吗？
Do you know what else i hate?

813
01:05:02,29 --> 01:05:03,85
伪君子
Hypocrites.

814
01:05:03,90 --> 01:05:05,39
而你是他们当中最大的一个
And you're the biggest one of all.

815
01:05:05,46 --> 01:05:07,49
你能怪他出卖你吗？
Can you blame him for sellin' out?

816
01:05:07,57 --> 01:05:09,80
他要找到婴儿的计划
His operation to find the baby...

817
01:05:09,87 --> 01:05:12,17
从一开始就被破坏了
had been tits up from the get-go.

818
01:05:12,20 --> 01:05:14,47
Rutledge主动找我们，并提出
You see, rutledge called us and he offered us...

819
01:05:14,51 --> 01:05:18,03
一些我们做梦都想不到的好建议
a proposition that we had never dreamed was possible.

820
01:05:18,88 --> 01:05:20,10
以此来交换他的性命
In exchange for his life...

821
01:05:20,14 --> 01:05:22,08
议员答应要维护我们的权力  让我们……
the senator promised to protect our right...

822
01:05:22,11 --> 01:05:23,84
拿着冲锋枪去打猎？
to go deer hunting with an uzi.

823
01:05:23,88 --> 01:05:26,51
哦，拜托  Smith，拜托
Oh, come on, smith. Come on.

824
01:05:26,55 --> 01:05:28,11
枪不会杀人
Guns don't kill people.

825
01:05:28,15 --> 01:05:29,62
它只是帮忙
But they sure help.

826
01:05:30,69 --> 01:05:31,55
退后！
Back off!

827
01:05:31,59 --> 01:05:32,95
退后
Back off.

828
01:05:32,99 --> 01:05:35,15
- 退后，不然我就杀了他  - 哦，不要
- Back off or i'll kill him! - Oh, please.

829
01:05:35,19 --> 01:05:37,02
我没有选择
Pi... i had to do it.

830
01:05:37,06 --> 01:05:39,62
我不想死  我要当总统
I want to live. I am meant to be president.

831
01:05:39,70 --> 01:05:42,63
是吗？你明白那意味着什么？  意味着你的利益高于人民的利益
Yeah? Well, you got what it takes. You put yourself before the people.

832
01:05:42,67 --> 01:05:44,97
我会在其它方面弥补
I can still do good in other areas.

833
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:46,40
你如何在公众面前改过自新？
How you gonna square it with the public?

834
01:05:46,44 --> 01:05:49,17
宪法里有规定
It is a constitutional right.

835
01:05:49,21 --> 01:05:50,67
退后！退后！
Back off! Get back!

836
01:05:50,71 --> 01:05:52,40
我经常为人民着想
I've come around to their way of thinking.

837
01:05:52,44 --> 01:05:54,67
经常？  他们只听到你说“你好”
Come around? They had you at "hello."

838
01:05:55,95 --> 01:05:57,81
让我给你个建议...
Let me give you a piece of advice...

839
01:05:57,85 --> 01:06:00,51
永远不要相信唯利是图的人  简单明了
never trust the people who stand to profit, plain and simple.

840
01:06:00,62 --> 01:06:03,28
- 他们都是坏人  - 行了，Smith，别逞强了
- They're the bad guys. - Come on, smith, don't be a fool.

841
01:06:03,32 --> 01:06:05,88
游戏结束  你已经掷了骰子，你输了
Go-to guy: The game is over. You rolled the dice, you lost.

842
01:06:34,85 --> 01:06:36,95
放了他，Smith！  你逃不掉的！
Let him go, smith! There's no escape!

843
01:06:36,99 --> 01:06:39,96
也许我真的逃不掉了  不过那个女人和孩子可以
Maybe not for me, but there is for the woman and baby.

844
01:06:39,99 --> 01:06:44,09
如果我杀了Rutledge  就没有人再想去杀他们
If i kill rutledge, no one will need to find them.

845
01:06:44,13 --> 01:06:45,86
她们也就安全了
They'll be saved.

846
01:06:45,93 --> 01:06:49,89
你被暗杀后，Rutledge  人民将愤怒而起
Your assassination, rutledge, will create a public outrage...

847
01:06:49,97 --> 01:06:52,83
你的提议将会得到广大民众的支持
and trigger immense support for your proposals.

848
01:06:52,87 --> 01:06:56,31
出于同情，国会将对你的禁枪议案...
The sympathy vote in the congress will give your anti-gun bills...

849
01:06:56,37 --> 01:06:59,54
给予一致支持
passage by a landslide.

850
01:06:59,58 --> 01:07:02,44
你的遗愿也将实现
Your legacy... will live on.

851
01:07:02,55 --> 01:07:03,98
别开枪！
Don't do it!

852
01:07:04,95 --> 01:07:06,58
那就开枪吧
Then do it.

853
01:07:06,62 --> 01:07:09,42
希望能挽回我的声望…
Let me regain some honor with my...

854
01:07:15,53 --> 01:07:17,49
狗娘养的！
that son of a bitch.

855
01:07:17,53 --> 01:07:18,93
狗娘养的！
Son of a bitch!

856
01:07:23,53 --> 01:07:25,33

Looks like you and i have finally traded places, huh, sport?

The circle-a jerk of life.

哦，你总是这样说话
Oh, you have such a way with words.

892
01:10:39,70 --> 01:10:41,72
现在...
Now...

893
01:10:45,80 --> 01:10:48,60

i want you to tell me...

相信我...
Believe me...

没有什么比听你不停的叽哩咕噜  更痛苦了
nothing could be more painful than listenin' to you jabberin' on and on.

899
01:11:06,92 --> 01:11:09,12
我再问一遍
Again, i ask...

900
01:11:09,16 --> 01:11:10,82
那个女人和小孩在哪？
where are the woman and child?

901
01:11:13,80 --> 01:11:15,73
这是你最后一次做这个动作了
That's the last time you'll be doin' that.

902
01:11:18,70 --> 01:11:20,53
只要告诉我，我想要知道的
Just tell me what i wanna hear.

903
01:11:20,57 --> 01:11:22,94
你自己选择什么时候结束
It's your choice when the pain stops.

904
01:11:22,97 --> 01:11:25,34
你为什么要这么做？
Why are you doin' this?

905
01:11:25,38 --> 01:11:28,44
- 都结束了  - 对，很快就会结束了
- It's over. - It shortly will be, yeah.

906
01:11:30,35 --> 01:11:32,82
我真应该好好谢谢你
No, i really should thank you.

907
01:11:32,85 --> 01:11:36,98
因为你，我刚得到一笔大合同
I just got a bigger contract because of you.

908
01:11:37,02 --> 01:11:40,32
你知道吗，我不仅为Hammerson工作
I mean, i wasn't just on hammerson's payroll, you know.

909
01:11:40,36 --> 01:11:43,05
你现在又在咕噜些什么？
What are you babbling on about now?

910
01:11:43,09 --> 01:11:46,03
你真的认为雇佣我的人...
Do you really think the people that employ me...

911
01:11:46,10 --> 01:11:48,53
会因为你杀了议员...
were just gonna bend over and take your little stunt...

912
01:11:48,57 --> 01:11:49,79
就放过你们？
killing the senator?

913
01:11:49,87 --> 01:11:52,20
你不可能掩盖整个事件
There's no way that you can cover up this whole thing.

914
01:11:52,24 --> 01:11:55,64
不可能？你没看新闻吗？
No? Haven't you heard the news?

915
01:11:55,67 --> 01:11:58,01
议员的飞机坠入东河
The senator's plane crashed into the east river.

916
01:11:58,04 --> 01:12:00,70
他们甚至都找不到Rutledge议员的尸体
They haven't been able to find the body of senator rutledge.

917
01:12:00,74 --> 01:12:02,84
所以，一旦我杀了你  还有那个女人...
So, you see, once i silence you and the woman...

918
01:12:02,88 --> 01:12:04,78
就没有人会知道这件事了
the cover-up will be complete.

919
01:12:04,82 --> 01:12:07,11
我再问你一次...
So, once again, i ask you...

920
01:12:07,15 --> 01:12:08,91
女人和小孩在哪？
where are the woman and child?

921
01:12:08,95 --> 01:12:10,89
你知道我会怎么弄断你的手指吗？
You know how i'd break your finger?

922
01:12:12,29 --> 01:12:13,55
我的手下曾告诉我
My boy told me this one.

923
01:12:13,59 --> 01:12:14,78
你会撞我的鼻子
You'd punch me in the nose.

924
01:12:14,83 --> 01:12:16,32
我会踢烂你的屁股
I'd kick you in the ass.

925
01:12:17,49 --> 01:12:19,36
太有趣了
Very amusing.

926
01:12:19,43 --> 01:12:22,49
我再弄断你的拇指
I give that one the ol' thumbs up!

927
01:12:24,80 --> 01:12:26,70
如果我们离开之前  你没赶来怎么办？
What if you don't get to us before we leave?

928
01:12:26,74 --> 01:12:29,26
我知道你的一切
Oh, i know your whole story.

929
01:12:29,31 --> 01:12:32,33
那个在餐馆里疯狂扫射的家伙
That man who went on the shooting spree in the restaurant.

930
01:12:32,38 --> 01:12:35,44
他的枪就是在你继承的枪店里买的
He visited the little gun shop that you inherited from your dad.

931
01:12:35,48 --> 01:12:36,71
我知道你老婆和儿子是怎么死的
I found out how your wife and son were killed.

932
01:12:36,75 --> 01:12:38,98
是你卖给他一把双管散弹猎枪...
You sold him the pair of shotguns...

933
01:12:39,02 --> 01:12:40,01
散弹猎枪
shotguns.

934
01:12:40,05 --> 01:12:41,92
就是那把枪杀了你老婆和儿子
...that killed your own wife and boy.

935
01:12:42,82 --> 01:12:45,08
我不会告诉你任何事情
I'm not telling you... a goddamn thing.

936
01:12:48,13 --> 01:12:50,82
你在哪儿，Smith？
Where are you, smith?

937
01:12:53,40 --> 01:12:55,30
好的，好的
Well, well, well, well, well.

938
01:12:55,33 --> 01:12:59,56
看来我们得用些更厉害的东西了
We're gonna need somethin' a little more invasive.

939
01:13:14,75 --> 01:13:16,22
就这里
That's it.

940
01:13:37,54 --> 01:13:40,24
你的枪真他妈不错  不是吗，Hammerson？
