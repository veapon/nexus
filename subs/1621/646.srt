1
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,258
- 这个开了吗？ - 就这样
- Is this on? - [interviewer] That's fine.

2
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,598
我会穿墙破壁，却不会...
I can break through walls, I just can't...

3
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,137
- 就这样 - 却不会玩这个
- [interviewer] That's fine. - I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,333
神奇超人... 你有保密的身份吗？
[interviewer] Mr. Incredible... Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,572
每个超级英雄都有保密的身份 我还不知道有谁不是这样
Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:50,843
谁愿意一直承担当超人的压力呢？
Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,786
我当然有保密的身份啦
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:58,152
你以为会在超市里看见我穿成这样？得了
Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,056
谁愿意用弹力女侠的身份去买东西， 明白我的意思吗？
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,689
那些女超人，总是想把自己的 保密身份告诉你
Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,098
她们觉得可以这样来套近乎
Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,540
我就说：“姑娘， 我不想知道你那温柔的另一面”
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:20,170
我是说，你告诉我你是 宇宙无敌超级霹雳小甜甜
I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,273
那就行了，我很满意，很满意
that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,681
不管你多少次拯救世界
No matter how many times you save the world,

16
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:30,050
它总是又会陷入危机
it always manages to get back in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:33,580
有时候我真想叫它消停一下，明白吗？
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know?

18
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,026
只要一会儿，我觉得自己像女佣一样 “我刚刚把这里收拾好
For a little bit. I feel like the maid. "l just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,462
咱们就不能让它干净个十分钟吗？”
Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,499
我能理解
[interviewer] I could get to that point.

21
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,469
- “劳驾？” - 还没结束呢
- "Please?" - [interviewer] We're not finished.

22
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,904
有时我觉得我就喜欢平平淡淡 的生活，你明白吗？
Sometimes I think I'd just like the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,463
稍微休息一下，安心养家
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,773
退隐江湖？你开玩笑吧？ 我正在兴头上呢！
Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:56,439
我可是跻身大人物的行列！ 姑娘们，来吧
I'm up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on.

26
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,916
把拯救世界的工作让给男人？ 我可不同意
Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,480
我可不同意
I don't think so.

28
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,237
现在插播一条新闻
[over radio] We interrupt for a bulletin.

29
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,538
警方正在飞车追捕持枪歹徒
A high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,045
他们沿圣帕布洛大道向北行驶
traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,777
单独追捕

32
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,278
好啊，我有时间
Y eah, I've got time.

33
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:39,278
合作追捕 自动驾驶

34
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,778
拦截模式 转换

35
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,906
神奇超人，神奇超人
Mr. Incredible.

36
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,452
- 怎么了，太太？ - 我的猫，小喳喳，不肯下来
- What is it, ma'am? - My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

37
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,458
好的，建议您站远点，可能有麻烦
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble.

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,052
不会，他很乖的
No, he's quite tame.

39
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,141
快放手
Let go now.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,188
谢谢你，神奇超人，你又成功了
Thank you, Mr. Incredible. You've done it again.

41
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:53,356
- 你是最棒的 - 不，只是刚好来这儿帮忙
- You're the best. - No, I'm just here to help.

42
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,992
各单位注意，发生了观光巴士抢劫案...
[over radio] All units. We have a tour bus robbery...

43
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,593
观光巴士抢劫案，我还有时间
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

44
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,900
警官，太太，小喳喳
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

45
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,704
- 酷！准备出动！ - 这是...？
- Cool! Ready for take-off! - What the...?

46
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,437
- 你到底是谁？ - 我是神奇小子
- Who are you supposed to be? - I'm lncrediBoy.

47
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,035
什么？不对
What? No.

48
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,343
你是那个追星族俱乐部的孩子
You're that kid from the fan club.

49
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,350
布洛菲、布洛迪，巴迪！你叫巴迪！
[stammering] Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,283
我叫神奇小子
My name is lncrediBoy.

51
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,447
我一直对你们很和气，跟你们合影
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

52
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,116
在你们给我的每张纸上签名，可这...
signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me...

53
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,820
啊，不用费心训练我，我知道你的动作
No, don't worry about training me. I know your moves,

54
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,864
打击犯罪的风格，最喜欢的口头禅 我全知道！
crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything!

55
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,660
我是你的头号崇拜者！
I'm your number one fan!

56
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,767
喂，喂，等一下！
[Buddy] Hey! Hey, wait!

57
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,078
你知道...
[lncredible] You know...

58
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,141
...看一个女人钱包里的东西 就可以对她了解许多
...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse,

59
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,983
不过这也许不是你的目的
but maybe that's not what you had in mind.

60
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,387
- 嘿，你瞧...
- Hey, look... - [grunts]

61
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,157
弹力女侠
Elastigirl.

62
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,289
神奇超人
Mr. Incredible.

63
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,793
- 那没关系，我已经逮到他了 - 当然啦，你已经逮到他了
- It's all right. I've got him. - Sure, you've got him.

64
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,962
- 我只不过替你制住他 - 没错，你干的
- I just took him out for you. - Sure, you did.

65
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,767
- 他的注意力都在我身上 - 我利用了这一点来做我的工作
- His attention was on me. - A fact I exploited to do my job.

66
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,742
- 你是说我的工作吧 - 你说声谢谢总可以吧
- My job, you mean. - A simple thank you will suffice.

67
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,971
谢了，可我不需要帮忙
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

68
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,036
那“女士优先”怎么说？
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

69
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,310
那“男女平等”又怎么说？
Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?

70
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,977
喂，是这个小姐先逮到我的
Look, the lady got me first.

71
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:24,249
- 好吧，我们可以分摊 - 我是单干的
- Well, we could share, you know. - I work alone.

72
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,813
哦，那么我觉得你应该再多点...
Well, I think you need to be more...

73
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,952
...弹性
...flexible.

74
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,359
你待会儿有事吗？
Are you doing anything later?

75
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,830
我已经和人约好了
I have a previous engagement.

76
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,305
现在，你就呆在这儿吧
Now, you just stay here.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,280
他们一般会在一小时内收拾垃圾的
They usually pick up the garbage in an hour.

78
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,976
- 嘿，神奇超人！ - 嘿，寒冰侠！
- [Frozone] Hey, lncredible! - Hey, Frozone!

79
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,488
- 你还没准备好吗？ - 我还有时间呢
- Shouldn't you be getting ready? - I still got time.

80
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,054
他要跳了
[woman] He's gonna jump!

81
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,331
你把我的骨头弄断了
[Sansweet] I think you broke something.

82
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,241
等你接受心理治疗后，会原谅我的
With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me.

83
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,108
等一下
Wait a minute.

84
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,210
炸弹魔
[coughing] Bomb Voyage.

85
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:54,710
神奇超人

86
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,614
还有神奇小子！
[Buddy] And lncrediBoy!

87
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,206
神奇小子？
[Voyage] lncrediBoy?

88
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,221
你不想知道我为什么来得这么快吗？ 因为我穿了火箭靴
Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? I have rocket boots.

89
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,881
- 回家去，巴迪，快点 - 什么？
- Go home, Buddy. Now. - What?

90
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:06,992
蠢小子...

91
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,354
我们能谈谈吗？
Can we talk?

92
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,552
你总说要坦诚面对你自己
You always say be true to yourself,

93
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,461
可你没说过是对哪一部分
but you never say which part to be true to.

94
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:18,333
好了，现在我终于想明白我是谁了 我是你的卫兵... 神奇小子！
Well, I've finally figured out who I am. I am your ward... IncrediBoy!

95
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,463
可你现在走得太远了，巴迪
And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,906
因为我没有超能力，对吗？
This is because I don't have powers, isn't it?

97
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,001
你知道，不是每个超级英雄都有超能力的
Not every superhero has powers, you know.

98
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,942
没有超能力也可以当超人
You can be super without them.

99
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:31,504
我发明了这些东西 我能飞，你能飞吗？
I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?

100
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,847
那就飞回家去，巴迪，我是单干的
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

101
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,747
而且你的那套行头可笑至极！

102
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,086
给我一次机会就行！ 我会让你瞧瞧，我去找警察来
Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

103
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,648
- 巴迪，不要！ - 一会儿就行，真的
- Buddy, don't! - lt'll only take a second, really.

104
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,591
停下！有炸弹！
No, stop! There's a bomb!

105
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,830
放开，你把我的飞行模式搅乱了
Let go, you're wrecking my flight pattern.

106
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,766
- 你要是放手我就能飞好！ - 你就不能...？
- I can do this if you let go! - Will you just...?

107
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,066
- 我是想帮你！停下！ - 别抓着我的披风！
- I'm trying to help! Stop! - Let go of my cape!

108
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,943
送这小子回家，一定要让她妈妈 知道他干的好事
Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's been doing.

109
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,921
我能帮你，你是在铸成大...
I can help you. You're making a mist...

110
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,082
那个跳楼者受伤了，你们派 医护人员了吗？
The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?

111
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,146
他们把他带走了
They picked him up.

112
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,989
大楼里的爆炸是炸弹魔干的
The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage

113
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,619
他抢劫金库时被我撞上了
who I caught robbing the vault.

114
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,926
要是我们封锁这一带，也许能逮住他
We might nab him if we set up a perimeter.

115
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,967
- 他逃掉了？ - 嗯，是的
- He got away? - Well, yeah.

116
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,559
- 都是因为这小淘气 - 是神奇小子！
- Skippy here made sure of that. - lncrediBoy.

117
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:01,868
我跟你可没关系！ 糟糕，我迟到了
You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late.

118
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,136
听着，我得马上到别处去
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

119
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,441
- 那么炸弹魔呢？ - 以后再说，我会去抓他的
- What about Bomb Voyage? - Any other night, I'd go after him,

120
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,610
不过现在我真得走了，别担心 我们会逮到他的！总有一天！
but I really gotta go. Don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually!

121
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,021
- 今晚还有时间吧？ - 你迟到很久了
- Is the night still young? - You're very late.

122
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:24,492
- 我看起来怎样？还行吧？ - 面具，你还戴着面具呢
- How do I look? Good? - The mask. You still got the mask.

123
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,897
好戏开场
Showtime.

124
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,306
罗伯特・帕尔，您愿意让这女子 成为你的合法妻子吗？
Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?

125
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:39,468
你迟到了 你那时问我待会儿有没有事
You're late. When you asked if I was doing anything later,

126
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,878
我还没想到是你忘记了 我以为你是在和我开玩笑呢
I didn't realize you'd forgotten. I thought it was playful banter.

127
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:45,347
- 真的是玩笑 - 你不觉得你把时间留得太紧了吗？
- It was. - Cutting it close, don't you think?

128
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,942
你需要再多点... 弹性
You need to be more... flexible.

129
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,419
我爱你，可要是我们想让这婚姻美满
I love you, but if we're gonna make this work,

130
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,683
你就不能光顾着当神奇超人
you've gotta be more than Mr. Incredible.

131
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,816
你愿意吗？
You know that. Don't you?

132
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,384
-...只要你们二人仍然在世？ - 我愿意
-...so long as you both shall live? - I do.

133
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,364
我宣布这对新人结为夫妻
I pronounce this couple husband and wife.

134
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,663
只要我们都还在世 不管发生了什么事
As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens.

135
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,902
嘿，别逗了，我们是超级英雄啊 还能发生什么事？
Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen?

136
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:17,010
经过一连串令人眼花缭乱的事件 一位超级英雄遭到起诉
[announcer] In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued

137
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,415
原因是他救了显然不想被搭救的人
for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved.

138
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,544
原告奥利弗・桑斯维特
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

139
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,783
在企图自杀时被神奇超人阻止

140
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,885

has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court.

141
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,329
桑斯维特先生并没有呼救 他不想被人救
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. He didn't want to be saved.

142
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,390
由于神奇超人的“行动”导致的伤害
The injury received from Mr. Incredible's "actions",

143
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,800
- 令他终日生活在痛苦中 - 我救了你的命！
- causes him daily pain. - I saved your life!

144
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,168
你不是救了我的命！ 你是让我求死不能！
You didn't save my life! You ruined my death.

145
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,934
我的当事人没有意见
[lawyer] My client has no comment.

146
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,341
五天以后，高架铁路事故的受害者 又提出了另一起诉讼
[announcer] Another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident.

147
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,849
神奇超人的败诉令政府付出了数百万元
Incredible's court losses cost the government millions.

148
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:55,284
同时也引发了世界各地数十起 超级英雄诉讼案的风潮
And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over.

149
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:00,313
现在该让他们的保密身份 成为他们唯一的身份了
It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity.

150
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,360
他们现在要选择是加入我们，还是离开
Time for them to join us, or go away.

151
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,363
迫于巨大的公众压力和没完没了的诉讼
[announcer] Under public pressure, and the financial burden

152
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,899
带来的巨额财政负担

153
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,870
政府悄悄启动了超级英雄重新安置案
the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program.

154
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:16,566
超人们以往的过失得到了特赦
The supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions,

155
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,011
作为交换条件，他们承诺 再也不充当英雄的角色
in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work.

156
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,774
昔日英雄今何在？
Where are they now?

157
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:27,146
他们就生活在我们中间 平凡的公民，平凡的英雄
They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes.

158
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:32,519
默默无闻，隐姓埋名 继续为世界作着贡献
Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.

159
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,486
拒绝？你拒绝我的索赔要求？
Denied? You're denying my claim?

160
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,128
（十五年后） 我不明白，我买了全保的
I don't understand. I have full coverage.

161
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,632
很抱歉，霍根森太太
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

162
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:44,896
但是我们的义务在第17段已经写明了
but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 1 7.

163
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,870
- 上面讲得很清楚... - 这、这个我付不起
- It states clearly... - [stammering] I can't pay for this.

164
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,737
不好意思，理赔科，鲍勃・帕尔
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

165
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,402
我是要告诉你一个重大喜讯
I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion.

166
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,775
我们现在算是正式住进来了
We're now officially moved in.

167
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,644
哦，好啊，棒极了，亲爱的
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

168
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:59,080
那么过去三年不算是因为...
The last three years don't count because...

169
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,143
因为我终于拆开了最后一个箱子 现在是正式的了，哈哈哈
Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

170
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,281
- 我们怎么有这么多垃圾？ - 听着，我在接待一个客户
- [Helen] Why do we have so much junk? - Listen, I've got a client.

171
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,383
不用说了，拯救世界去吧 一次一张保单，亲爱的
Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey.

172
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,860
哦！我该去接孩子了，晚上见
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids. See you tonight.

173
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,093
再见，亲爱的 不好意思，我们说到哪儿了？
Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?

174
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,159
我是靠固定收入过日子的 要是你不能帮我
[sobbing] I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me,

175
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,502
我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'll do.

176
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:32,610
好吧，听好了 我是想帮你，可我办不到
All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I can't.

177
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,347
我很想告诉你拿一份保单的复印件 去找诺玛・威尔考克斯...
I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

178
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:41,723
诺玛・威尔考克斯，W-l-L-C-O-X 在三楼，可我办不到
[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't.

179
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,456
我也不会建议你填写WS2475表格
I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form

180
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,897
然后交到二楼的法律部门
with our legal department on the second floor.

181
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,595
我估计也不会有什么人 能很快帮你解决问题的
I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter.

182
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,159
我很想帮你，但是我什么也做不了
I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do.

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,868
- 哦，谢谢你，年轻人 - 对不起，太太，我知道你很苦恼！
- Oh, thank you, young man. - [shouting] Sorry. I know you're upset!

184
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,809
- 装作很苦恼
- [whispering] Pretend to be upset. - [sobbing]

185
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,313
帕尔！
Parr!

186
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,851
你批准了沃克那份保单的赔款！
You authorized payment on the Walker policy!

187
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,184
哈夫先生，有人闯进了他们家
Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph.

188
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,190
- 他们的保单包含了... - 这个我不想知道
- Their policy covers... - I don't wanna know about it.

189
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,092
别跟我说这个，跟我说说你是怎么 让咱们公司一直赔钱的
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how you're keeping lnsuricare in the black.

190
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,721
告诉我你怎么会给每一个
Tell me how that's possible, with you writing checks

191
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,825
给你打电话的霉运先生 和苦命小姐写支票的！
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

192
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,996
上午休息时间结束 上午休息时间结束
[over PA] Morning break is over. Morning break is over.

193
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,611
很高兴你能来，帕尔太太
I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr.

194
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:40,044
这是怎么了？达什做错什么了？
What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong?

195
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,282
他是害群之马，他公然在全班 面前嘲弄我
He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class.

196
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,755
- 他说的 - 我知道是你干的！
- He says. - Look, I know it's you!

197
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,884
- 他在我的椅子上放图钉 - 你看见是他干的？
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool. - You saw him do this?

198
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,760
哦... 没有亲眼看见
Well... not really. No.

199
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,956
说实话，没有
Actually, not.

200
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,091
哦，那你怎么知道是他干的？
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

201
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,727
我藏了一台摄像机 对，这一次我算是逮到他了
I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

202
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,805
看见吗？你们看见吗？
See? You see?

203
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,507
你们没看见？
You don't see it?

204
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,814
他动了！就在那儿！
He moves! Right there!

205
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,480
等等，等等！就在那儿！
Wait, wait! Right there!

206
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,250
就在我坐下去的时候！
Right as I'm sitting down!

207
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,087
我不知道他是怎么干的
I don't know how he does it,

208
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,457
可就在他动以前，那里没有钉子
but there's no tack before he moves

209
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,658
他一动，就有钉子了 是巧合吗？我不信！
and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not!

210
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,332
- 伯尼... - 别叫我“伯尼”
- Bernie... - Don't "Bernie" me.

211
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,497
这个小鬼头是坏蛋！
[screaming] This little rat is guilty!

212
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:40,033
帕尔太太，您和您的儿子可以走了 抱歉给您添麻烦了
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

213
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,080
你又放他走了？他是坏蛋！
You're letting him go again? He's guilty!

214
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,776
看他小脸的得意样就知道 坏蛋，我说了，坏蛋！
You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!

215
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:55,290
达什，今年你是第三次 给叫到办公室了
Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office.

216
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,888
我们得找个更好的办法 更有建设性的办法
We need to find a better outlet. A more... constructive outlet.

217
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,956
要是你让我去参加运动会，没准就行
Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports.

218
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,161
亲爱的，你知道我们为什么 不能那么做
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

219
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:09,866
我保证会有分寸的 我只会赢他们一点点
I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

220
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,206
达什尔・罗伯特・帕尔
Dashiell Robert Parr,

221
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,439
你是个特别争强好胜的孩子 还有一点爱卖弄
you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff.

222
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,639
你最禁不起诱惑
The last thing you need is temptation.

223
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:21,116
你老是说“尽力而为” 可你从来就不是那个意思
You always say, "Do your best." But you don't really mean it.

224
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,415
我能尽力的，为什么不让我尽力？
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

225
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,820
亲爱的，如今的世界只要我们 溶入其中
Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in,

226
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,620
为了溶入其中，我们就得 像其他所有人一样
and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.

227
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,390
爸爸常说我们有超能力 没什么好难为情的
Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,398
- 我们的超能力让我们很特别 - 人人都很特别，达什
- Our powers made us special. - Everyone's special, Dash.

229
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,094
那也就是说没什么人是特别的
Which is another way of saying no one is.

230
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,109
莱丁杰，你上哪儿去？
[boy] Rydinger, where you headed?

231
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,747
- 嗨，托尼 - 嘿
- [girl] Hi, Tony. - Hey.

232
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,946
- 嘿，托尼，可以帮你拿书吗？ - 那可有点好笑
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books? - That's kind of funny.

233
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,317
嘿，托尼，你打橄榄球吗？
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

234
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,328
托尼，我们去游泳吧
[boy] Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming.

235
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,068
他看了我一眼
He looked at me.

236
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,329
- 快点，薇奥莱特！
- [car horn honking] - [Dash] Come on, Violet!

237
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,263
可恶的孩子，在车道上放这个...
[muttering] Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway...

238
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,693
哦，好极了
Oh, great.

239
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,701
妈妈
Mom.

240
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,469
- 你又在做鬼脸 - 才没有
- You're making weird faces again. - No, I'm not.

241
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,978
你做鬼脸了，亲爱的
You make weird faces, honey.

242
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,608
- 你非得在饭桌上看吗？ - 啊哈，是的
- Do you have to read at the table? - Uh-huh. Yeah.

243
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,585
小口咬，达什，呀！
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

244
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,554
鲍勃，帮这个小肉桶把肉切一下吧？
Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat.

245
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:44,120
达什，有什么学校里的事 要跟爸爸说吗？
Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school?

246
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:47,995
- 哦，我们解剖了一只青蛙 - 达什又给叫到办公室去了
- [nervously] Well, we dissected a frog. - Dash got sent to the office again.

247
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,626
- 很好，很好 - 不，鲍勃，这不好
- [distracted] Good. Good. - No, Bob, that's bad.

248
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,864
- 什么？ - 达什又给叫到办公室去了
- What? - Dash got sent to the office again.

249
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,803
- 什么？为什么？ - 没什么
- What?! What for? - Nothing.

250
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,808
他在老师的椅子上放图钉... 是在上课的时候
He put a tack on the teacher's chair... during class.

251
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,538
没人看见，你在录像带上 都很难看出来
Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.

252
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,810
他们给你拍了录像带可还是 让你逃过了？哇！
They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa!

253
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,373
你准是一直在练，你的动作有多快？
You must have been booking. How fast were you going?

254
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,043
我们不是要鼓励他这么干
We are not encouraging this.

255
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,214
没有啊，我只是问有多快...
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

256
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,985
- 亲爱的！
- Honey! - [crash]

257
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,228
好极了，先是汽车，现在又要 花钱修饭桌...
Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table...

258
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,992
汽车怎么了？
What happened to the car?

259
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:24,030
给，我去拿个新盘子
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

260
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,361
那么你怎么样，小薇？学校里怎样？
So, how about you, Vi? How was school?

261
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,236
- 没什么好说的 - 你的饭都没动过
- Nothing to report. - You've hardly touched your food.

262
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,971
- 我不想吃肉糕 - 哦，今晚又要留下剩饭了
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf. - Well, it is leftover night.

263
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,015
我们还有肉排、意大利面... 你想要什么？
We have steak, pasta... What are you hungry for?

264
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,811
- 托尼・莱丁杰 - 闭嘴
- Tony Rydinger. - Shut up.

265
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,876
- 好，你真的在想他 - 我说了闭嘴，你这小臭虫
- Well, you are. - I said, shut up, you little insect.

266
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,480
- 她是在想他 - 别在饭桌上大喊大叫
- Well, she is. - Do not shout at the table.

267
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,957
- 亲爱的！ - 孩子们！听妈妈的话！
- Honey! - [Bob] Kids! Listen to your mother.

268
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,719
假如我们有托尼糕，她就会吃了
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

269
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,322
好啊！
That's it!

270
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,593
住手！
Stop it!

271
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,166
- 你会变成吐司面包！ - 别在家里乱跑
- [Dash] You're gonna be toast! - [Helen] Stop running in the house.

272
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,066
坐下！
[Helen] Sit down!

273
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,703
- 嘿，不准用超能力场！ - 是你起的头
- Hey, no force fields! - You started it.

274
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,370
你坐下！你也坐下！
You sit down! You sit down!

275
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,812
薇奥莱特！
Violet!

276
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,686
“西蒙・J・帕拉蒂诺
"Simon J. Paladino,

277
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,852
超级英雄权利的长期鼓吹者，失踪了”？
Iongtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing"?

278
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:27,694
- 激光眼 - 鲍勃！你该来管管了
- Gazerbeam. - [Helen] Bob! It's time to engage.

279
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,131
做点什么！别光站着！
Do something! Don't just stand there!

280
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,795
- 我要你插手！ - 你要我插手？
- I need you to intervene! - You want me to intervene?

281
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,031
好的，我插手了！我插手了！
Okay. I'm intervening!

282
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,837
薇奥莱特，放开你弟弟
Violet, let go of your brother.

283
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,468
哈？
[Jack-Jack] Hello?

284
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,075
去开门
[Bob] Get the door.

285
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,243
- 嘿，卢修斯！ - 嘿，飞毛腿、海伦、小薇、杰杰
- Hey, Lucius! - Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

286
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:50,947
- 真是贵“冰”来访 - 哈！这话可真新鲜
- lce of you to drop by. - Ha! Never heard that one before.

287
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,490
- 卢修斯！ - 哇！
- [gargling] Lucius! - [Lucius] Whoa!

288
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,721
- 哈哈 - 噢！
- [Lucius] Ha, ha. - [Dash] Oh!

289
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,390
- 我喜欢它碎掉的时候 - 我会晚点回来
- I like it when it shatters. - I'll be back later.

290
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,990
- 你们两个去哪？ - 今天星期三
- Where are you two going? - It's Wednesday.

291
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,299
保龄球之夜 替我向汉妮问好，卢修斯
Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

292
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,067
会的，晚安，海伦，晚安，孩子们
Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids.

293
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,143
别以为你去校长室的事 就这么了结了
Don't think you've avoided talking about the principal's office.

294
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,444
你爸爸和我还会找你谈话的
Your father and l are still gonna discuss it.

295
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,451
又不是只有我一个人给叫到 办公室去
I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office.

296
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,453
别的孩子没有超能力
Other kids don't have superpowers.

297
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:28,049
- 现在，绝对正常... - 你知道什么是正常？
- Now, it's perfectly normal... - What do you know about normal?

298
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,821
这个家里有人知道什么是正常吗？
What does anyone in this family know about normal?

299
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,853
- 等一下，小姑娘 - 我们都装得很正常，我也想做正常人
- Now, wait a minute, young lady. - We act normal. I wanna be normal.

300
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,891
可唯一正常的人就是杰杰，他 还不会自己用马桶
The only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained.

301
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,097
- 真好运
- [Jack-Jack laughing] - [Dash] Lucky.

302
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,663
我是说做正常人真好
I meant about being normal.

303
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,070
所以我就有大麻烦了
[Lucius] So now I'm in deep trouble.

304
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,241
我是说，要是再来上一道死光 我就要进棺材了
I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph.

305
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,547
好在我总算找到了躲的地方 然后无情男爵怎么做？
Somehow I managed to find cover. What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

306
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,612
- 他开始长篇大论 - 他开始长篇大论
- He starts monologuing. - He starts monologuing.

307
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,592
他开始发表早就准备好的演讲 说我跟他比起来怎么怎么弱
He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him.

308
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,960
说我的失败怎么怎么不可避免 世界很快就是他的了，怎样怎样...
How inevitable my defeat is, the world will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

309
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,464
- 没完没了 - 没完没了
- Yammering. - Yammering.

310
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,696
这家伙打得我没脾气，而且还说个没完
[Lucius] I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up.

311
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,364
- 穆尼西堡，我们接到23-56... - 23-56，那是什么？
- [radio] Municiberg, we have a 23-56... - 23-56, what is that?

312
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,704
- 抢劫？ - 真是倒霉
- Robbery? - This is just sad.

313
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,709
- 想去抓强盗吗？ - 不想
- Want to catch a robber? - No.

314
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,302
实话跟你说吧，我宁可去打保龄球
Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling.

315
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,874
你说，要是我们真的去干我们的 老婆以为我们在干的事情，那不好吗？
Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing?

316
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,509
就算是平衡一下
Just to shake things up.

317
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:33,249
他不是一个人 那个大块头还和他在一起
[Mirage] He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him.

318
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,690
他们一直在说话
They're just talking.

319
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,888
- 我们在这里算是干什么？ - 保护别人
- What are we doing here? - Protecting people.

320
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,260
- 没人求我们保护 - 你想要别人请你？
- Nobody asked us. - You need an invitation?

321
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:44,927
想啊，对，我们一直偷偷摸摸 地干这种事...
I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...

322
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,494
- 你记得激光眼吗？ - 报上提到过他
- You remember Gazerbeam? - There was something in the paper.

323
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,770
- 他也过不惯小老百姓的生活 - 你什么时候看见他的？
- He had trouble with civilian life. - When did you see him?

324
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,404
以前的老伙计我都没看见 只有你
I don't see anyone from the old days. Just you.

325
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,709
- 现在我们又是这样来赌运气 - 得了
- And we're pushing our luck as it is. - Come on.

326
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,581
第一次是很好玩，可要是我们 一直这么干...
It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this...

327
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,052
- 我们接到火灾报告... - 火灾，我们离那儿很近！
- [radio] We have a report on a fire... - A fire. We're close!

328
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,750
- 好啊，宝贝！ - 我们会给逮住的
- [yelling] Yeah, baby! - We're gonna get caught.

329
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,184
火灾！好啊！
[Bob] Fire! Yeah!

330
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,466
- 所有人都在这儿了？ - 对
- [Lucius] Is that everybody? - [Bob] Yeah.

331
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,273
- 最好是这样 - 你就不能把这火灭了吗？
- It better be. - Can't you put this out?

332
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:30,643
我做不出足够厚的冰！ 它蒸发得太快了！
I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast!

333
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,841
- 这是什么意思？ - 意思是这里太热了
- What's that mean? - It means it's hot.

334
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,249
- 我都给烤干了，鲍勃 - 你的冰用完了？
- I'm dehydrated, Bob. - You're out of ice?

335
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,719
你不可能用完的 你连空气里的水都能用
You can't run out. You can use water in the air.

336
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,589
这种空气里没有水！ 你又有什么借口，把肌肉用完了？
There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

337
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,594
我不能把墙打破 这幢楼快撑不住了
I can't smash walls. The building's getting weaker.

338
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:47,790
- 它会砸到我们头顶上的 - 我想去打保龄球的！
- It's gonna come down on top of us. - I wanted to go bowling!

339
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:54,197
好吧！跟紧了！会很热的！
All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!

340
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,382
好
[Bob] Yeah. [coughing]

341
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,949
哦，很好
Oh, good.

342
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,651
不对劲啊
That ain't right.

343
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,458
- 我们看起来就像三流坏蛋！ - 你可以从空气里取水了
- We look like incompetent bad guys! - You can get water out of the air.

344
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,025
别动！
Freeze!

345
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,967
别动！
Freeze!

346
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,875
- 我口渴 - 我说了别动！
- I'm thirsty. - I said freeze!

347
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,812
我只是喝点水
I'm just getting a drink.

348
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,816
- 你已经喝过了，现在... - 我知道，我知道，冰冻！
- You've had your drink. Now... - I know. I know. Freeze.

349
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,385
警察！
Police officers!

350
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,203
这次真是太险了
[Lucius] That was way too close.

351
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,972
咱们再也不能这么干了
We are not doing that again.

352
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,745
你确认要换目标吗？完毕
[over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over.

353
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:17,379
相信我，这就是他一直在找的人
Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for.

354
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,614
- 我以为你最晚11点能回来 - 我说了会晚点回来
- I thought you'd be back by 1 1. - I said I'd be back later.

355
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,345
我是以为你会晚一点回来 只要你最后还是回来了...
I assumed you'd be back later. If you came back at all...

356
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,413
-...就算是“晚点回来” - 好了，我已经回来了，行了吧？
-...you'd be "back later". - Well, I'm back, okay?

357
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,191
这是碎石吧？
Is this rubble?

358
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,758
稍微练习一下而已 免得身体僵掉了
[with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose.

359
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,363
你知道我是怎么想的 真是的！我们不能再暴露身份了
You know how I feel about that. Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

360
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,534
- 总之是因为那幢楼塌了 - 什么？
- The building was coming down anyway. - What?

361
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,270
你把一幢楼弄塌了？
You knocked down a building?

362
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:17,246
它着火了，结构不牢了 所以就塌了
It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down.

363
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,805
你又在偷听警方频道？
Have you been listening to the police scanner again?

364
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:23,047
我是在为人民服务 你好像觉得那是坏事一样
I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing.

365
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,554
那就是坏事，鲍勃！
It is a bad thing, Bob!

366
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:28,752
为了你能重新体验那些光辉岁月 就害得我们搬家，这就是坏事
Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing.

367
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,761
总比假装那些事没有发生过要强！
It's better than acting like they didn't happen!

368
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,229
对！它们是发生过！ 可是我们家里的事
Yes! They happened! But this, our family,

369
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,927
才是正在发生的事，鲍勃 你却一点不关心！
is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this!

370
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:41,165
我真是不敢相信你不想参加 儿子的毕业典礼
I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation.

371
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,800
那不算毕业 他只是从四年级升五年级
It's not a graduation. He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

372
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,776
- 那也是一次典礼！ - 那是有病！
- It's a ceremony! - It's psychotic!

373
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,574
他们一直在变着法子表扬平庸之才
They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity

374
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,581
可要是出了什么不同寻常的人...
but if someone is exceptional...

375
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,913
这不是你自己的事，鲍勃 是达什的事
This is not about you, Bob. It's about Dash.

376
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,817
你想替达什做点事吗？ 那就让他真正去竞争
You want to do something for Dash? Let him actually compete.

377
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,686
- 让他去参加运动会！ - 我也不想当恶人！
- Let him go out for sports! - I will not be made the enemy!

378
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,624
- 你知道我们为什么不能那样做 - 因为他会大获成功
- You know why we can't do that. - Because he'd be great.

379
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,719
这不是你自己的事！
This is not about you!

380
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,823
好吧，达什 我知道你在听，出来吧
All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out.

381
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,198
小薇，你也是，出来吧，小姑娘
Vi? You, too, young lady.

382
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,636
快点，出来吧
Come on. Come on out.

383
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,402
没什么，孩子们 我们只不过在讨论
It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion.

384
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,238
讨论得很大声
[Vi] Pretty loud discussion.

385
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,939
不过那没关系，重要的是 妈妈和我一直是战友
But that's okay. What's important is that Mommy and I are a team.

386
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:29,885
- 我们团结一致，共同对抗... - 老顽固？
- We're united, uh, against forces of... - Pigheadedness?

387
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:32,513
- 我想说邪恶来着 - 对不起，把你们吵醒了
- I was gonna say evil. - We're sorry we woke you.

388
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,922
没什么事，去睡觉吧，已经很晚了
Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late.

389
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,119
- 晚安，妈妈，晚安，爸爸 - 晚安
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. - Good night.

390
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,653
其实我们都该去睡了
In fact, we should all be in bed.

391
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,710
索赔请求，索赔号158183...
[on phone] Request claim on claim numbers 1 58 183...

392
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:58,341
索赔请求，索赔号158183...

393
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,077
你还没把他找来？他在哪儿？
[Huph] Haven't you got him yet? Where is he?

394
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,745
哈夫先生要你到他办公室谈谈
[PA] Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office.

395
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,914
- 现在？ - 现在
- Now? - Now.

396
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,705
坐，鲍勃
Sit down, Bob.

397
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,408
我很不开心，鲍勃，很不开心
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

398
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,917
- 问我为什么呀 - 好吧，为什么？
- Ask me why. - Okay. Why?

399
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,958
什么为什么？说具体点，鲍勃
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

400
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,684
为什么你不开心？
Why are you unhappy?

401
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,592
你的客户让我不开心
Your customers make me unhappy.

402
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:46,390
什么，你接到投诉了？
What, you've gotten complaints?

403
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,953
投诉我倒能应付
Complaints I can handle.

404
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,660
可我不能应付的是你的客户 对我们公司内部运作方式
What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge

405
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,694
竟然了如指掌！ 他们都是专家，专家！
of lnsuricare's inner workings! They're experts. Experts, Bob!

406
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,901
他们会利用每一个漏洞，绕开 每一个障碍！
Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle!

407
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,444
他们完全看穿了我们的制度！
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

408
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,242
- 我做了什么不合规定的事吗？ - 没有
- Did I do something illegal? - No.

409
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:08,648
- 你能说我们不该帮助客户吗？ - 法律要求我对此回答“否”
- We shouldn't help our customers? - The law requires that I answer no.

410
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,950
- 我们应该帮助人们 - 应该帮助我们的人！
- We're supposed to help people. - [yelling] Help our people!

411
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,887
从我们的股东开始
Starting with our stockholders.

412
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:16,357
谁在帮他们解决困难呢，唔？
Who's helping them out, huh?

413
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,626
你知道，鲍勃，一家公司...
[Huph] You know, Bob, a company...

414
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:24,326
就好比一台巨大的时钟
Is like an enormous clock.

415
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:28,429
...就好比一台... 说得对，非常正确
...is like an enormous... Yes. Precisely.

416
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:33,169
只有当每一个小齿轮都紧密咬合 它才能工作
[Huph] It only works if all the little cogs mesh together.

417
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:38,648
那么，时钟需要清洗，加润滑油 和上紧发条
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight.

418
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:44,415
一流的时钟有着按设计 密切配合的轴承和齿轮
The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

419
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,858
我是在打比方，鲍勃 知道我在用齿轮比喻什么？
[chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob. Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

420
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,621
鲍勃？
Bob?

421
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,890
鲍勃？我跟你说话的时候 你要看着我，帕尔
Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr.

422
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,059
- 外面那个人，他需要帮助 - 不要改变话题
- That man out there, he needs help. - Don't change the subject.

423
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,001
- 我们现在讨论的是你的态度 - 他正被人抢！
- We're discussing your attitude. - He is getting mugged!

424
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,801
- 哦，那么但愿我们不用赔他钱 - 我马上回来
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him. - I'll be right back.

425
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,400
给我站住，要不就解雇你！
Stop right now or you're fired!

426
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,073

429
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,394
- 他跑了 - 那也很好嘛
- He got away. - Good thing, too.

430
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,093
你差一点就丢了你的...
You were this close to losing your...

431
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,500
哦
Uh-oh.

432
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,642
请立刻前往722手术室报到
[over PA] Please report to operating room 722 immediately.

433
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,023

- How is he? - He'll live.

434
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,752
- 我被解雇了，是吗？ - 你说呢？
- I'm fired, aren't l? - You think?

435
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,590
- 我还能说什么，瑞克？ - 能说的你以前都说过了
- What can I say, Rick? - Nothing you haven't said before.

436
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,654
- 有个人遇到麻烦了 - 有个人总是遇到麻烦
- Someone was in trouble. - Always.

437
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,359
- 我不得不做一些事 - 每次你说这话
- I had to do something. - Every time you say that,

438
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,594
我就要忙上一个半月
it's a month and a half of trouble for me.

439
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,002
用掉纳税人的几十万块钱
Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars.

440
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:10,665
- 我知道 - 我们花钱封住这些公司的嘴
- I know. - We pay to keep the company quiet.

441
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,869
我们赔偿损失、消除记忆 重新安置你的家人

Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money.

443
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,608
我们也不能老这么干，我们很 感激你在当年做的事
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate what you did in the old days,

444
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,018
可那种时候已经过去了 从现在起，你得自力更生了
but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own.

445
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,752
听着鲍勃，也许我还能再安置你一次 你知道，看在过去的份上
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old times' sake.

446
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,956
我不能对我的家人那样做 他们都刚刚安顿下来
I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got settled.

447
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,262
我能解决的，谢谢
I'll make it work. Thanks.

448

449
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,744

00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,934
他们以前从来没派你去开过会 这是好事，对吗？
They've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it?

493
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:38,998
对、是的
[hesitating] Yes.

494
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,443
你瞧，他们终于承认你的能力了
You see? They're finally recognizing your talents.

495
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,945
- 你要高升了 - 是啊
- You're moving up. - Yes.

496
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,142
- 亲爱的！这可太好了！ - 对，太好了
- Honey! This is wonderful! - Yes, it is.

497
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,482
喂？
[over phone] Hello?

498
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,523
我是神奇超人
This is Mr. Incredible.

499
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,518
我接受
I'm in.

500
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,697
万能机器人9000 是一台绝密的战斗机器人原型机
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot.

501
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,330
它的人工智能使它能够解决
Its artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem

502
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,307
遇到的任何问题，不幸的是...
it's confronted with. And, unfortunately...

503
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,969
让我猜一下，它已经聪明到 不肯服从命令了
Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders.

504
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,675
我们失去了对它的控制，现在它就在 丛林里游荡，威胁着我们的设施
We lost control. Now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility.

505
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:22,310
为了安全，我们只好撤走岛上所有人
We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety.

506
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,374
我要怎么进入？
How am I going in?

507
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,389
考虑到万能机器人的防御能力 我们只能从5000英尺空投
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet.

508
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,984
它的隐形装置使我们很难跟踪它
Its cloaking devices make it difficult to track.

509
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,360
可以肯定的是它正在岛的南半部份
We're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island.

510
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:38,197
还有一点，显然我们对它投资很大
One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.

511
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,601
你要我在不摧毁它的情况下把他关掉
You want me to shut it down without destroying it.

512
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,195
你是神奇超人嘛
You are Mr. Incredible.

513
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,992
我必须警告你，它是学习型机器人
I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot.

514
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,690
你和它战斗的时间越长 它就越能了解该怎样击败你
Every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you.

515
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:11,029
关掉它，动作要快，不能摧毁它
Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it.

516
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,663
- 还有，不要死 - 好极了，谢谢
- And don't die. - Great. Thanks.

517
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,231
好戏开场
Showtime.

518
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,715
唔？
Huh?

519
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,387
啊，我的腰！
Oh, my back!

520
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:07,031
出乎意料，我们一定要把他带回来
Surprising. We must bring him back.

521
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,937
解除警报，请他来吃晚餐
Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner.

522
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:32,553
最要紧的是不要让他看出来
[Syndrome, barely audible] Most important, keep things light.

523
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,532
夸他一下，让他感到我们 很欣赏他的能力
Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities.

524
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,195
我是不是穿得太正式了？
Am I overdressed?

525
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,864
说实话，你穿得很时髦
Actually, you look rather dashing.

526
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,969
- 我想我们的雇主... - 抱歉
- [Bob] I take it our host is... - [Mirage] I'm sorry.

527
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,374
他不想和我们共进晚餐 他希望你能理解
He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll understand.

528
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:52,039
当然，但我通常比较想知道为谁工作
Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm working for.

529
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,016
他喜欢保持一点神秘感
He prefers a certain amount of anonymity.

530
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,645
当然了，你是能理解的
Surely, you of all people understand that.

531
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:02,420
我只是不明白，有那么多地方可以 住，为什么偏偏选择住在...
I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live...

532
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,792
火山边？他迷恋力量，我也是
With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am l.

533
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,663
- 这是我们共有的弱点 - 看来有点不牢靠
- It's a weakness we share. - Seems a bit unstable.

534
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,931
我希望你这种看法是因为误解
I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.

535
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,595
我们不都这样吗？
[chuckling] Aren't we all?

536
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,403
火山土是地球上最肥沃的土壤之一
Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth.

537
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:21,602
这桌上的东西都是这里长的
Everything at the table was grown right here.

538
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,945
- 你觉得怎样？ - 全都很可口
- How does it compare? - Everything's delicious.

539
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,129
- 天啊 - 快点，亲爱的
- Jeez. - [Helen] Hurry, honey.

540
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,260
你上班要迟到了
Or you'll be late for work.

541
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,863
- 祝你工作顺利，亲爱的 - 谢谢
- Have a great day, honey. - Thanks.

542
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,841
- 伺候好客户，努力往上爬... - 还要养好家
- Help customers, climb ladders... - Bring bacon.

543
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,468
就是这样
All that jazz.

544
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:10,985
你预约了吗？
You have an appointment?

545
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,285
我是老朋友，我只想...
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

546
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,814
- 所有访客都必须... - 走开，检查电网去
- All visitors are required... - [E] Go check the electric fence.

547
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,986
怎么回事？你是谁？想干什么？
What is it? Who are you? What do you want?

548
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,266
天啊，你发福了，进来吧，快，快
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come.

549
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:36,208
是啊，一切都很好，都很好 上帝啊，没什么可抱怨的
Y es, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints.

550
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,682
不过你知道，和以前不一样了 完全不一样了
But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all.

551
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,548
你不是还上过电视吗？ 是什么演出，在布拉... 布拉格？
Weren't you in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague?

552
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,713
米兰，亲爱的，是米兰
Milan, darling. Milan.

553
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,747
超级名模，她们根本 没什么超级的地方
[E] Supermodels. Nothing super about them.

554
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,260
任性、愚蠢、瘦得像火柴棒
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

555
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,853
总是浓妆艳抹，只会为自己着想的家伙
with poofy lips who think only about themselves.

556
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,833
切！我以前可是为诸神设计服装的
Feh! I used to design for gods.

557
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:04,772
不过也许你要来求我？ 接到你的电话我可是吃了一惊呢
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call.

558
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,708
E，我只要你帮我补一下
E, I just need a patch job.

559
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:11,008
唔，这是超网眼式的，过时了 不过很结实
Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy.

560
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:15,415
你却把它扯破了！ 你到底在干什么，罗伯特？
And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert?

561
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,851
月下扮英雄？
Moonlighting hero work?

562
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,946
那肯定是很久以前的事了
Must have happened a long time ago.

563
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:23,151
明白了，这是叫花子穿的
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

564
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,956
你可不能穿这个出门，我不允许！
You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it!

565
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:30,056
- 十五年前可能允许，可现在嘛―― - 你是什么意思？这可是你设计的
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? - What do you mean? You designed it.

566
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,296
我永远不看从前的作品 那只会影响现在的工作
I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now.

567
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,066
你需要一套新衣服，这是可以肯定的
You need a new suit. That much is certain.

568
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,630
新衣服？我到底上哪儿能弄到新衣服？
A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit?

569
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,176
你弄不到的！不可能！我又太忙了
You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy.

570
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,440
所以快点求我吧，趁我还没有恢复理智
So ask me now, before I again become sane.

571
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,414
等等，你想给我做套新衣服？
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

572
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,816
你也太过分了，亲爱的！ 不过我接受
You push too hard, darling! But I accept.

573
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,982
- 它的设计会很大胆，很惹眼！ - 好
- [E] It will be bold. Dramatic! - Yeah.

574
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:58,323
- 很高雅！ - 对，经典的衣服，就像劲爆侠！
- Heroic! - Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

575
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,693
哦！他可真帅！那披风，还有靴子...
Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots...

576
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:02,789
不能加披风！
[E] No capes!

577
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:08,000
- 不是该听我的吗？ - 你记得霹雳头吗？
- lsn't that my decision? - Do you remember Thunderhead?

578
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,903
高个子，能驾驭暴风雨，是个好人 跟孩子们很合得来
[E] Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids.

579
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,841
- 听我说，E... - 58年11月15号
- Listen, E... - November 1 5th of '58.

580
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:20,647
本来一切顺利，可是他的披风却被 导弹尾翼挂住了
[E] All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

581
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,049
霹雳头不是很聪明...
Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb...

582
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,144
风云女！
Stratogale!

583
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:29,522
57年4月23号，披风被 吸进发动机叶片里
[E] April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine.

584
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,857
你不能以偏概全
You can't generalize about these things.

585
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,261
中元侠，在高速电梯上出事 劲爆侠，起飞时被钩住
[E] Meta-man. Express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

586
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,495
天外飞降，被卷进旋风里 不能加披风！
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes!

587
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,664
好了，你的新衣服会在下次任务 以前做好的
Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment.

588
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,764
你知道我已经不当英雄了
You know I'm retired from hero work.

589
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,641
和我一样，罗伯特，可你 还不是又来找我了？
As am l, Robert. Yet, here we are.

590
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,545
E，我只需要把衣服补一下，为了怀旧
E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons.

591
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,712
好吧，我也会把叫花子衣服补好的
[sighs] Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

592
00:45:56,787 --> 00:46:01,280
- 你是绝顶高手，E - 对，我知道，亲爱的，我知道
- You're the best of the best, E. - Yes, I know, darling. I know.

593
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,670
别接，亲爱的，我来听！
[Bob] Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

594
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,572
- 喂？ - 我们有新任务要给你
- Hello? - We have a new assignment for you.

595
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,473
- 你什么时候能到这儿？ - 我明天早上动身
- [Mirage] How soon can you get here? - [Bob] I'll leave tomorrow morning.

596
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,279
- 那就到时候见 - 再见
- [Mirage] See you there. - Goodbye.

597
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,884
谁打来的？是...公司的人吗？
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

598
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,824
又要开会，时间很赶，不过你也知道...
Another conference. Short notice, but you know...

599
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,725
...工作需要嘛
...duty calls. [nervous laugh]

600
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:48,696
- 鲍勃？ - 唔，什么事，亲爱的？
- [Helen] Bob? - Yeah, what's up, honey?

601
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,271
- 祝你... 祝你旅途愉快 - 谢谢，甜心
- Ha... have a great trip. - Thanks, sweetie.

602
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,777
- 我到的时候会给你打电话的 - 我爱你
- I'll call you when I get there. - I love you.

603
00:46:55,846 --> 00:47:00,179
- 很爱很爱 - 我也爱你啊
- So much. - I love you too.

604
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,353
我是您的自动机长
[ship's computer] This is your automated Captain.

605
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,662
您还想要香槟加橙汁吗？
Would you care for more mimosa?

606
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,898
- 我要是想的话，你可别介意，谢谢 - 别客气
- [Bob] Don't mind if I do. Thanks. - You're welcome.

607
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,003
当前岛上气温为78度 天气良好，适合飞行
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying.

608
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,782
请系好安全带，我们要降落了
Please fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent.

609
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,575
你好，神奇超人，衣服很不错
[Mirage] Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit.

610
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,706
谢谢
Thanks.

611
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:10,241
回到这里很高兴
Nice to be back, Mirage.

612
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,309
两点钟会在会议室给你听任务简报
You'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two.

613
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,819
- D座，A-113号房 - 两点，知道了
- D Wing, room A-1 1 3. - 2:00. Got it.

614
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,513
会议室见
See you there.

615
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,653
埃德娜
[gasps] Edna.

616
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,485
- 请让我和埃德娜通话 - 我是埃德娜
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please. - [E] This is Edna.

617
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,288
- E？我是海伦 - 哪个海伦？
- E? This is Helen. - Helen who?

618
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,626
海伦・帕尔，你知道的...
Helen Parr? You know...

619
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:29,586
弹力女侠
Elastigirl?

620
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,898
亲爱的！都过去这么多年了！ 真是太久了！
Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long!

621
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,630
是有段日子了
[stammering] It's been a while.

622
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:39,367
鲍勃只会放心让一个人给他补 超人服，那个人就是你
There's only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit. That's you.

623
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,536
对，对，对，很棒吧，是吗？
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

624
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,374
比他从前穿的那些难看睡衣强多了
Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear.

625
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,143
我已经都做好了，你什么时候过来看？
They are finished. When are you coming to see?

626
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,651
- 我打电话来是为了... - 不要让我求你
- [Helen] I'm calling about... - Don't make me beg.

627
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:53,621
- 我不会求人的，你知道 - 求你？不，我打电话来是为了衣服的事
- I won't do it, you know. - Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

628
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,591
是、是为了鲍勃的衣服！ 我打电话来是为了鲍勃的衣服
[stammering] Bob's suit! I'm calling about Bob's suit.

629
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,493
你一小时以内来吧，亲爱的 说定了，好吗？好的，再见
You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

630
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,490
它更大！
[Syndrome] It's bigger!

631
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,321
它更坏！
It's badder!

632
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:42,734
女士们先生们，神奇超人打不过它！
Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

633
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,535
终于可以了
It's finally ready.

634
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,638
你知道吗，我用好多超级英雄磨炼它 好让它能够跟你打
You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you,

635
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,774
可是，它还是不够强！
but man, it wasn't good enough!

636
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:58,912
在你打坏上一个以后，我只好 再对它做一些大修改
After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications.

637
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,254
当然这很困难，不过为了你 值得这么干
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

638
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:06,488
再怎么说，我也是你的头号崇拜者
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

639
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,125
- 巴迪？ - 我不叫巴迪！
- Buddy? - My name is not Buddy!

640
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,427
也不叫神奇小子！
And it's not lncrediBoy either!

641
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:17,132
那已经过去了 那时候我心里想的只是帮你
That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you.

642
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,801
我只想要帮忙！ 可你对我说了什么呢？
I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me?

643
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,505
那就飞回家去，巴迪，我是单干的
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

644
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,107
我的心都被撕碎了 不过我也学到了重要的一课
[Syndrome] It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson.

645
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,448
不能相信任何人
You can't count on anyone.

646
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,453
尤其是你的英雄
Especially your heroes.

647
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,615
我那样对你是错了，我很抱歉
I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry.

648
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:38,024
瞧见了吗？现在你知道尊重我了 因为我对你是威胁
See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

649
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,720
天下的事情就是这样
That's the way it works.

650
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:42,526
世上有许多人想得到尊重
There's a lot of people, whole countries who want respect.

651
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,431
可他们要付出很高的代价才能得到
And they will pay through the nose to get it.

652
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,198
你知道我是怎么发财的？我发明武器
How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons.

653
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,469
现在我有了一部只有我自己才能 打败的武器，如果我开动它，就会...
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I'll get...

654
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,109
你这老狐狸！你引诱我发表长篇大论
[laughing] You sly dog! You got me monologuing.

655
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:59,148
我真是不能相信
I can't believe it.

656
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:03,675
很酷吧？是零点能
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

657
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,846
我把最好的发明留给自己用
I save the best inventions for myself.

658
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,685
我现在够强了吧？
Am I good enough now?

659
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,751
现在谁才是超人？
Who's super now?

660
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,763
我是万恶霸王！是你的冤家对头和...
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

661
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,392
哦，很好！
Oh, brilliant!

662
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,952
好吧，试试这个是不是够劲
All right, try this one on for size, big boy.

663
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,416
激光眼
Gazerbeam.

664
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,700
Kronos？…
[Bob] "Kronos?"

665
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:58,328
生命读数为负，神奇超人已被消灭
[scanner] Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated.

666
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:06,501
这个项目耗费了我毕生的精力
[E] This project has completely confiscated my life, darling.

667
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:10,842
只有英雄的工作才能这样吸引我 我得承认，这是我最好的作品
Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit.

668
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,816
简洁、优雅、又大胆 你会非常喜欢的
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

669
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,977
- E，我只要... - 我做好了罗伯特的衣服
- E, I just... - I did Robert's suit,

670
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,647
因为它实在太美了，我只好接着做下去
and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue.

671
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:24,682
见到你真是很高兴，可我不 明白你在说什么
It's great to see you, but I have no idea what you're talking about.

672
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,956
- 我只要... - 对，语言是无用的
- I just... - Yes, words are useless.

673
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,999
真要说起来话就太长了，亲爱的 太长了！
Gobble, gobble, gobble. Too much of it, darling. Too much!

674
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,158
所以才要让你亲眼看我的作品
That is why I show you my work.

675
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,032
所以你才会来这儿
That is why you are here.

676
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,807
埃德娜模式
Edna Mode.

677
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,236
还有客人
And guest.

678
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,992
来，坐
Come. Sit.

679
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,168
- 加奶油和糖？ - 谢谢
- Cream and sugar? - Thanks.

680
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,902
- 我就从小宝宝开始 - 开始？
- I started with the baby. - Started?

681
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,970
安静点，亲爱的！我把它裁得稍微 宽松点，好让他能自由活动
[E] Shh! Darling! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement.

682
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:21,141
这种布料可以让娇嫩的皮肤感到 非常舒适
The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin,

683
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:25,921
还能经受住1000度以上的高温
[E] and can also withstand a temperature of over 1 000 degrees.

684
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,054
绝对防弹
Completely bulletproof.

685
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,923
而且可以机洗，亲爱的 这可是新增加的特性
And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature.

686
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,865
你到底以为小宝宝会去干什么？
What on earth do you think the baby will be doing?

687
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:42,268
哦，可以肯定的是我不知道 有备无患嘛
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared.

688
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:45,603
我不知道小宝宝的超能力是什么 所以只包含了基本功能
I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics.

689
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,006
- 杰杰根本没有超能力 - 没有吗？
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers. - No?

690
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,135
反正他穿上以后会让你大吃一惊
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

691
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,809
我把你儿子的衣服设计为可以 承受巨大的摩擦
Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction

692
00:55:55,885 --> 00:56:00,218
同时不会升温或破损，很有用的功能
without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature.

693
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,850
你女儿的衣服很巧妙
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

694
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:08,489
我终于开发出一种耐用的材料 可以在她隐身时和她一起消失
I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does.

695
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:16,196
你的衣服可以在不伤到你自己 的情况下，尽可能地伸长
Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself,

696
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,206
而且还能恢复原状
and still retain its shape.

697
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,504
几乎是坚不可摧...
Virtually indestructible...

698
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:25,475
...但又和埃及棉一样透气
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

699
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:29,006
每套衣服都附带了导航设备
As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device,

700
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:33,351
你只要按一下按钮就可以知道 穿戴者的精确地理坐标
giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button.

701
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,091
好了，亲爱的，你怎么想？
Well, darling? What do you think?

702
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:42,097
我怎么想？鲍勃已经洗手不干了！ 我也不干了！
What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired!

703
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,860
我们全家都在隐居
Our family is underground.

704
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,333
你又背着我让我丈夫重操旧业？
You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?

705
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,598
哦，我还以为你知道呢，亲爱的
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

706
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,573
为什么他会对你保密？
Why would he keep secrets from you?

707
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,633
他不会，以前没有，现在也没有
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

708
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:59,307
男人在罗伯特这个年纪总是 很不牢靠
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

709
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,713
容易产生弱点
Prone to weakness.

710
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:05,184
- 你在说什么？ - 你知道他在哪儿吗？
- What are you saying? - Do you know where he is?

711
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:09,055
- 当然 - 你知道他在哪儿吗？
- Of course. - Do you know where he is?

712
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:43,317
- 嘿，我们有人受伤了！ - 快点，咱们过去
- [guard] Hey, hey. We got a man down! - [guard 2] Come on, let's go.

713
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,455
你还好吧？出什么事了？
[guard 2] Are you okay? What happened?

714
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,859
暂停监视和跟踪，继续清查...
[over radio] Break surveillance and engage. Continuing sweep...

715
01:00:22,128 --> 01:00:23,659

- [over phone] Insuricare. - Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

717
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:42,462
鲍勃・帕尔是我丈夫 能不能请你把他住的宾馆
Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me

718
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,702
电话号码告诉我？我手上的号码不对
the number of the hotel he's staying at? The number I have is no good.

719
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,642
- 帕尔先生已经不在这里工作了 - 你说什么？
- Mr. Parr no longer works here. - What do you mean?

720
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,305
他正在出差呀，公司派他去的
He's on a business trip. A company retreat.

721
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:55,316
我的记录显示大约两个月前 他已经被辞退了
My records say he was terminated almost two months ago.

748
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,027
我真是个大傻瓜
[sobbing] I am such an idiot.

749
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,435
是我没有看好他
I let this happen, you know.

750
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,498
新跑车、减肥、那根金发、他的谎话
The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

751
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,841
他是在想方设法重温旧事
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

752
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:07,644
现在我要失去他了！我该怎么办？ 我该怎么办？
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do? What'll I do?

753
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,480
你说的这叫什么话？
What are you talking about?

754
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:16,088
你是弹力女侠啊！上帝呀！ 给我振作起来！
You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together.

755
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,251
你该怎么办？这还用问吗？
What will you do? Is this a question?

756
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,794
让他知道你还记得他是神奇超人
Show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible,

757
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,889
还要提醒他你是什么人！
and you will remind him who you are!

758
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:28,528
好了，你已经知道他在哪儿了 去吧！勇敢面对问题！战斗！赢！
Well, you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

759
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:32,437
回来时候给我打电话，亲爱的 和你见面我很开心
And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits.

760
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,998
还有很多剩饭菜，热一下就行了
There's lots of leftovers that you can reheat.

761
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:39,104
一定要叫达什做作业 还有，你们两个都要准时睡觉
Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time.

762
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,046
我今天晚上会回来的，会晚点
I should be back tonight. Late.

763
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,210
这段时间你可以看好家的，对吗？
You can be in charge that long, can't you?

764
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:46,016
对，可是为什么又要我看家？
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

765
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,555
没什么，只不过你爸爸有点麻烦
Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.

766
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:53,027
你是说爸爸遇上麻烦了？ 还是说爸爸就是麻烦？
You mean Dad's in trouble, or Dad is the trouble?

767
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:56,997
我是说他遇上麻烦了，或者他 也会变成麻烦
I mean either he's in trouble, or he's going to be.

768
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,800
那是什么？那里搞来的，妈妈？
What's that? Where'd you get that, Mom?

769
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,104
你做了一套酷衣服？ 嘿，那是给我们的吧？
You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us?

770
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,702
我们都有酷衣服？
We all get cool outfits?

771
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,441
- 达什！你马上给我回来！
- Dash! You come back here this moment! - [phone rings]

772
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,317
喂，斯纳格，谢谢你给我回电
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

773
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,947
我知道这么说很突然，可我还是 希望能...
I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could...

774
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,992
- 这是什么？ - 瞧，我是达速侠！
- What are these? - Look, I'm The Dash!

775
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,823
- 达速侠很喜欢 - 稍等
- The Dash likes. - [Helen] Just a second.

776
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:30,729
- 马上脱下来，别让人看见 - 你自己还要带上一样的衣服呢
- Take that off before somebody sees. - You're packing one just like it.

777
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,791
- 你是不是有什么事情瞒着我？ - 别闹了，我还在接电话呢...
- Are you hiding something? - Please. I'm on the phone...

778
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,030
- 达什！ - 这是你的，特制的
- Dash! - This is yours. It's specially made.

779
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,472
- 这是怎么回事？ - 你们都不许进来！我要准备行李！
- What's going on? - You're not coming! I gotta pack!

780
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,635
你从哪里看出来这是特制的？
What makes you think it's special?

781
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,648
我不知道，可你想 妈妈干吗要藏着它呢？
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

782
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:58,615
斯纳格，我是要你还我一个人情
Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me.

783
01:04:58,685 --> 01:05:02,176
- 你想要什么？ - 一架飞机，你有这么快的东西吗？
- [over phone] What do you need? - A jet. What do you got that's fast?

784
01:05:02,254 --> 01:05:04,744
让我想想
Let me think.

785
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:15,965
接近目的地，IG99请求准入
Island approach. India Golf niner-niner checking in.

786
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:19,596
- 在上方作目视飞行，完毕
- VFR on top. Over. - [radio static]

788
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:27,666
- 请求引导，完毕

789
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:39,246
别紧张，海伦，放松，姑娘
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

790
01:05:39,323 --> 01:05:43,918
你反应过头了，一切都很顺利 他们只是都去喝咖啡了
You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee.

791
01:05:44,662 --> 01:05:49,063
正好一起去的，对
At the same time. Yeah.

792
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:05,748
你，先生，真是“神奇超人”
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

793
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:07,750
我以前崇拜你是对的
I was right to idolize you.

794
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:10,343
我早就知道你是硬汉 可你居然会躲在另一个超人的骨头后面
I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe

795
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:14,355
骗过探测器？哦，老兄！
by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man!

796
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:17,824
我现在想起来还是觉得佩服！
I'm still geeking out about it! [sighs]

797
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:21,696
可接下来你就不够意思了
And then you had to just go and ruin the ride.

798
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:26,759
神奇超人居然呼救？ “救救我，救救我”
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? [mocking] "Help me, help me."

799
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:29,237
丢脸，丢脸，丢脸
Lame, lame, lame.

800
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:34,005
- 好吧，你找的是谁？ - 找谁？你在说什么？
- All right, who did you contact? - Contact? What are you talking about?

801
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:41,513
我说的是昨晚23:07
I am referring to last night at 2307 hours

802
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:44,713
在你到处偷窥的时候，你发出了一个 导航信号
while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.

803
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:47,883
我不知道导航装置的事
I didn't know about the homing device.

804
01:06:52,363 --> 01:06:56,731
现在有一架政府的飞机请求在这里降落
And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here.

805
01:06:56,802 --> 01:06:59,928
- 你找的是谁？ - 我没有叫飞机来
- Who did you contact? - I didn't send for a plane.

806
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:01,834
把通话录音放给他听
Play the transmission.

807
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:06,641
- IG99请求准入 - 海伦！
- [Helen] India golf checking in. - Helen!

808
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:09,908
这么说你认识这帮人
So you do know these people.

809
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:12,744
好吧，那我就小小地问候他们一下
Well, then, I'll send them a little greeting.

810
01:07:15,486 --> 01:07:17,350
- 噢！ - 薇奥莱特！
- [Violet] Ow! - Violet!

811
01:07:17,422 --> 01:07:18,648
不是我的错
It's not my fault.

812
01:07:18,724 --> 01:07:21,089
是达什偷跑出来，我知道 你肯定要为这事骂我
Dash ran away, I knew I'd get blamed for it.

813
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,716
不是这样的！
That's not true!

814
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:25,761
是你说：“妈妈好像有点事 我们一定要弄明白，”
You said, "Something's up with Mom. We have to find out what.

815
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:29,424
-...这不是我的错！ - 百分之百都是你的主意！
-...and it's not my fault! - Hundred percent all-yours idea!

816
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,491
等一下，你们把杰杰一个人扔下了？
Wait a minute. You left Jack-Jack alone?

817
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:35,368
- 我们当然找人代看了 - 我们找了人的，妈妈
- Of course we got a sitter. - We got someone, Mom.

818
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,804
- 我们不会让他一人在家的 - 多谢了！
- We wouldn't do that. - Thanks a lot!

819
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:41,001
好吧，你们找的是谁？
All right, well, who'd you get?

820
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:43,443
你什么也不用担心
You don't have to worry about one thing.

821
01:07:43,514 --> 01:07:46,913
我天生就会带孩子，还上过课 学过心肺复苏术
I've got baby-sitting wired. I've taken courses, learned CPR,

822
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:50,316
- 成绩优秀，还拿了证书 - 凯莉
- excellent marks and certificates. - Kari.

823
01:07:50,389 --> 01:07:52,548
我带了莫扎特的音乐，在他睡觉时放
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

824
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:55,648
因为专家说莫扎特的音乐能让 宝宝更聪明
because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter.

825
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:56,817
凯莉...
Kari...

826
01:07:56,894 --> 01:07:59,794
妙就妙在他们不一定要听 因为他们是睡着的！
The beauty is they don't have to listen 'cause they're asleep!

827
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:01,728
要是我爸妈当年放过莫扎特就好了
I wish my parents played Mozart

828
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:04,995
因为不管什么人说话，我总有一半 时间听不懂他们说什么
because half the time I don't know what anyone's talking about.

829
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:08,468
凯莉，这事我真觉得不太好
Kari, I really don't feel comfortable with this.

830
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:11,701
给你惹的麻烦我会补偿的，不过 我还是想叫服务公司来
I'll pay you for your trouble, but I'd rather call a service.

831
01:08:11,777 --> 01:08:13,607
真的没有必要，帕尔太太
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

832
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:16,373
宝宝有什么事我全能对付
I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out.

833
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:19,209
对不对，小宝宝？我能对付的
[cooing] Can't l, little baby? I can handle it.

834
01:08:19,283 --> 01:08:21,273
- 谁能对付呀？
- [Kari] Who can handle it? - [beeping]

835
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,659
IG99报告误击

838
01:09:06,465 --> 01:09:08,728
不！快取消导弹攻击，要我 做什么都行
No! Call off the missiles. I'll do anything.

839
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,735
太晚了，晚了整整十五年
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

840
01:09:13,805 --> 01:09:16,772
在你西南偏南方向20英里的是友机
Friendlies two-zero miles south-southwest of your position.

841
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:19,332
高度10，航向正东，取消攻击
Angels 1 0. Track east. Disengage.

842
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:22,105
小薇！在飞机周围造一个力场出来
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

843
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,873
你说过我们不能用超能力
You said not to use our powers.

844
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:26,280
我知道我说过，照我现在说的做！
I know what I said. Listen to what I'm saying now!

845
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,510
取消攻击，重复，取消攻击！
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

846
01:09:33,191 --> 01:09:35,953
- 妈妈？ - 薇奥莱特
- Mom? - [Helen] Violet!

847
01:09:36,028 --> 01:09:39,086
呼救，IG99被友方锁定，取消！
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked. Abort!

848
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:40,652
飞机上有小孩
There are children aboard.

849
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:44,723
- 飞机上有小孩 - 不！
- [Helen] There are children aboard! - No!

850
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:47,770
- 快给我们造个力场！ - 我从来没做过这么大的
- Put a field around us now! - I've never done one that big.

851
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:48,826
快做！
Do it now!

852
01:09:50,475 --> 01:09:51,565
取消，取消，取消！
Abort, abort, abort!

853
01:09:54,046 --> 01:09:55,511
取消，取消，取消！
Abort, abort, abort!

854
01:10:26,844 --> 01:10:28,605
振作点！
Brace yourselves!

855
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,878
- 妈妈！ - 大家都冷静点
- [kids] Mom! - Everybody calm down.

856
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,945
我要告诉你们不该怎样
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

857
01:10:40,025 --> 01:10:42,491
我们不该慌张，我们不该... 当心！
We're not gonna panic, we're not... Look out!

858
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:56,637
- 哦，天哪！这是谁的主意啊？ - 我们该怎么办？
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this? - What are we gonna do?

859
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:58,901
我们死定了！我们死定了！
We're dead! We're dead!

860
01:10:58,976 --> 01:11:01,671
- 飞机爆炸了！ - 我们捡了一条命，可还是死定了！
- It blew up! - We survived but we're dead!

861
01:11:01,747 --> 01:11:04,043
够了！
Stop it!

862
01:11:04,116 --> 01:11:05,979
我们不会死的！
We are not gonna die!

863
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,878
你们两个都给我精神点
Both of you will get a grip.

864
01:11:07,953 --> 01:11:10,386
否则就关你们一个月！
Or so help me I will ground you for a month!

865
01:11:10,555 --> 01:11:12,282
明白吗？
Understand?

866
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:16,847
已经确认命中，目标被摧毁
We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed.

867
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:18,860
啊，你会挺过来的
Ah, you'll get over it.

868
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,728
我好像记得你是喜欢“单干”的
I seem to recall you prefer to "work alone".

869
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:34,909
快放了我！
Release me. Now!

870
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:38,172
- 不然怎样？ - 我就捏碎她
- Or what? - I'll crush her.

871
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,944
你这话听起来可有点邪恶 好，你就捏吧
That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead.

872
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:43,952
这很容易的，就像折断牙签一样
It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.

873
01:11:44,021 --> 01:11:45,715
那就让我看看
[laughing] Show me.

874
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,466
我就知道你做不到
[Syndrome] I knew you couldn't do it.

875
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:03,735
即使你已经没什么可失去了
Even when you have nothing to lose.

876
01:12:03,809 --> 01:12:05,469
你很弱
You're weak.

877
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:07,601
我对你已经没兴趣了
And I've outgrown you.

878
01:12:17,355 --> 01:12:21,619
那是近程导弹，陆基的
Those were short-range missiles. Land-based.

879
01:12:21,692 --> 01:12:23,386
往那个方向去希望最大
That way is our best bet.

880
01:12:23,462 --> 01:12:26,395
你要去想杀我们的人呆的地方？？
You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?

881
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:30,560
- 假如那里是陆地，那你说得对 - 你希望我们游过去？
- If it means land, yes. - Do you expect us to swim there?

882
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:33,864
我希望你们相信我
I expect you to trust me.

883
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:36,725
真是个好兵
What a trooper.

884
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:38,926
你太让我自豪了
I'm so proud of you.

885
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:41,094
谢谢，妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

886
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:49,801
我想你们的爸爸是遇到麻烦了
I think your father is in trouble.

887
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:52,710
你大概没注意到，我 们现在也好不到哪儿去
If you haven't noticed, we're not doing so hot either.

888
01:13:52,884 --> 01:13:54,110
我要去找他
I'm going to look for him.

889
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:56,947
也就是说在我回来以前 这里就交给你了，薇奥莱特
And that means you're in charge until I get back, Violet.

890
01:13:57,022 --> 01:13:59,250
- 什么？ - 你听见她说了
- What? - You heard her.

891
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:05,227
把这戴上，你们的身份是你 们最重要的东西
Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable possession.

892
01:14:05,297 --> 01:14:06,388
要保护好
Protect it.

893
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:09,296
要是出了什么事，就用你们的超能力吧
And if anything goes wrong, use your powers.

894
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:12,028
- 可你说过永远不要用... - 我知道我说过！
- But you said never to use... - I know what I said!

895
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:19,843
你们还记得星期六上午节目 里的那些坏蛋吗？
Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

896
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:23,402
这些家伙可跟他们不一样
Well, these guys are not like those guys.

897
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:27,006
他们不会因为你们是小孩就手下留情
They won't exercise restraint because you're children.

898
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:30,280
他们一有机会就会杀了你们
They will kill you if they get the chance.

899
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:32,479
不要给他们机会
Do not give them that chance.

900
01:14:32,557 --> 01:14:34,716
- 妈妈？ - 小薇，我就全靠你了
- Mom? - Vi, I'm counting on you.

901
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:38,726
- 有些... - 我就全靠你了，坚强点
- There's... - I'm counting on you. Be strong.

902
01:14:38,796 --> 01:14:43,129
达什，要是出了什么事 我要你能跑多快就跑多快
Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can.

903
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:45,724
- 能跑多快就跑多快？ - 能跑多快就跑多快
- As fast as I can? - As fast as you can.

904
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:50,204
躲在这里，互相保护 天亮前我会回来的
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I'll be back by morning.

905
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:55,167
妈妈！
[Violet] Mom!

906
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,938
妈妈，飞机上的事，我很抱歉
Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry.

907
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:02,416
我想帮忙的，可你要我帮的时候... 我很抱歉
[stammering] I wanted to help. When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

908
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:04,248
这不是你的错
Shh. It isn't your fault.

909
01:15:04,322 --> 01:15:08,188
我一下子对你要求这么高也不公平
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you.

910
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,624
可现在情况不同了
But things are different now.

911
01:15:10,795 --> 01:15:13,820
你要是再缺少信心 后果我们大家都经受不起
And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

912
01:15:13,898 --> 01:15:16,388
你的力量要比你意识到的更大
You have more power than you realize.

913
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:18,991
不要多想，也不要担心
Don't think. And don't worry.

914
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:21,629
到时候你会知道怎么做的
If the time comes, you'll know what to do.

915
01:15:21,706 --> 01:15:24,104
这是你天生的
[laughs] It's in your blood.

916
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:03,839
他不是软弱，你知道的
He's not weak, you know.

917
01:16:03,915 --> 01:16:05,005
什么？
What?

918
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,379
珍视生命不是弱点
Valuing life is not weakness.

919
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:11,079
嘿，假如你说的是牢房里的事
Hey. Look, if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit,

920
01:16:11,155 --> 01:16:13,145
那时一切都在我掌握之中
I had everything under control.

921
01:16:13,224 --> 01:16:15,953
漠视生命也不是力量
And disregarding it is not strength.

922
01:16:16,027 --> 01:16:18,756
他虚张声势，我就拆穿了他 亲爱的，就是这样
I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all.

923
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:21,320
我知道他不会真那么...
I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually...

924
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:24,366
下次你要是想赌博的话，拿你 自己的命去赌吧！
Next time you gamble, bet your own life!

925
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:37,638
火箭？
A rocket?

926
01:19:30,855 --> 01:19:35,813
不是说这不好玩，不过我 还是想到别处看看
Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around.

927
01:19:35,893 --> 01:19:39,850
你以为这里是什么地方？ 你以为我们在度假？
What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation?

928
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:42,796
妈妈和爸爸可能有生命危险
Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy.

929
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:45,357
或者更糟，他们的婚姻也有危险
Or worse, [whispering] their marriage.

930
01:19:45,436 --> 01:19:47,426
他们的婚姻？
Their marriage?

931
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:52,066
这么说那些坏蛋是想拆散 爸爸和妈妈
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage.

932
01:19:52,143 --> 01:19:54,302
当我没说吧，你还太小
Forget it. You're so immature.

933
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:57,540
- 我要去走走看看 - 妈妈说了要躲在这里
- I'm gonna go look around. - Mom said to stay hidden.

934
01:19:57,615 --> 01:20:01,845
我不会走出山洞的
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.

935
01:20:39,824 --> 01:20:41,949
酷！
[echoing] Cool!

936
01:20:42,026 --> 01:20:45,323
酷！
[echoing] Cool!

937
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:47,727
明白，我们已经可以发射
[over radio] Roger. We are ready for launch.

938
01:20:57,842 --> 01:21:01,537
- 小薇！小薇！ - 你干了什么？
- [Dash] Vi, Vi! - What did you do?

939
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:17,182
ETA 29，完毕

941
01:21:24,969 --> 01:21:26,730
IFF没有反应
Not responding to IFF.

942
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:29,100
IRCM读数为负
IRCM reads negative.

943
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:32,101
- 鲍勃 - 什么？
- Bob. - What?

944
01:21:32,176 --> 01:21:33,402
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

945
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,036
请出示身份证明
[robot] Identification, please.

946
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:08,009
- 嘿！薇奥莱特！过来，瞧 - 什么？
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look. - What?

947

- 它会说话！ - 什么？
- It talks! - What?

948
01:22:09,247 --> 01:22:10,576
在那儿，那只

- 求你... - 你为什么会在这里？
- Please... - Why are you here?

958
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:07,192
你怎么可能把我放下来？ 你还能从我这里夺走什么？
How can you possibly bring me lower? What more can you take away from me?

959
01:23:07,271 --> 01:23:11,070
你的家人在坠机时没有死

- 她正在帮我逃走 - 不对
- She was helping me to escape. - No.

964
01:23:35,466 --> 01:23:36,989

965
01:23:37,068 --> 01:23:38,465
放开我！
Let go of me!

Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep!

967
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,499
我怎么可能背叛这么完美的女人？
How could I betray the perfect woman?

968

- 哦，你这是在说我？ - 孩子们呢？

- Security's in the jungle. Get going. - Our kids are in danger?

971
01:23:54,152 --> 01:23:56,448
要是你担心有危险，干吗还带他们出来？
If you suspected danger, why'd you bring them?

972
01:23:56,521 --> 01:23:59,613
他们是偷偷跟来的 你也没资格这样说话
They stowed away. You're not striking the proper tone.

973
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:11,128
- 你觉得他们是超人？ - 达什，记住妈妈说的话

978
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:24,036
给我出来！

979
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:26,138

哈哈
[Dash] Ha, ha!

981
01:25:50,868 --> 01:25:53,062
我还活着
I'm alive. Yeah!

982
01:27:05,775 --> 01:27:08,470
我早该告诉你我被解雇了，我承认
I should've told you I was fired, I admit it.

983
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:10,274
可我不想让你担心

984
01:27:10,348 --> 01:27:11,712
你不想让我担心？
You didn't want me to worry?

985
01:27:11,781 --> 01:27:14,681
可我们现在却在荒无人烟 的树林里奔命
We're running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle.

986
01:27:14,752 --> 01:27:17,948
你老是想和我吵 可我只是很高兴你还活着
You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm just happy you're alive.

987
01:27:20,024 --> 01:27:22,889
我知道你在那里，隐身小姐
[guard] I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear.

988
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:37,338
你躲不过我的
You can't hide from me.

989
01:27:43,647 --> 01:27:45,909
- 你在那里 - 嘿！

Don't touch my sister!

991
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:02,089
- 你怎么做到的？ - 我不知道
- How are you doing that? - I don't know!

992
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:03,756
不管怎样，千万别停啊！
Whatever you do, don't stop!

993
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:22,010
妈妈！爸爸！
Mom! Dad! Hey!

994
01:28:23,921 --> 01:28:25,251
孩子们
[Helen] Kids.

995
01:28:25,322 --> 01:28:27,185
- 你们都没事 - 你们都没事
- You're all right. - You're all right.

996
01:28:27,258 --> 01:28:30,020
- 我们担心死了 - 我以为再也见不到你们了
- We were so worried. - I thought I'd never see you again.

997
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:49,907
我爱你
[both] I love you.

998
01:29:05,463 --> 01:29:07,123
时间到！
Time out!

999
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:12,092
这算什么？一样的制服？
What have we here? Matching uniforms?

1000
01:29:12,937 --> 01:29:17,634
哦，不！弹力女侠？
Oh, no! Elastigirl? [laughs]

1001
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:21,635
你娶了弹力女侠？哇！
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

1002
01:29:22,346 --> 01:29:24,711
还干得很卖力！
And got busy!

1003
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:27,511
这是超人一家啊
It's a whole family of supers.

1004
01:29:27,585 --> 01:29:29,813
看来我是中大奖了！
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

1005
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:32,286
哦，这真是太好了！
Oh, this is just too good!

1006
01:29:32,356 --> 01:29:35,847
- 这艘船的设计很独特... - 事故中无人死亡...
- [on TV] The ship's unique design... - [on TV] There were no fatalities...

1007
01:29:35,926 --> 01:29:40,918
哈？哈？哦，快点！你得承认这很酷
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool.

1008
01:29:40,998 --> 01:29:44,228
就像电影一样！ 机器人会戏剧性地出现
[Syndrome] Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically,

1009
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,200
造成一些破坏，到处是尖叫的人群！
do some damage. Throngs of screaming people!

1010
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:52,139
就在一切希望都落空的时候 万恶霸王会拯救世界！
And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day!

1011
01:29:52,209 --> 01:29:54,767
我会成为比从前的你还伟大的英雄！
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!

1012
01:29:54,845 --> 01:29:58,779
你是说你杀光真的英雄 好让自己假冒英雄？
You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one?

1013
01:29:58,849 --> 01:30:02,340
我是真的，真到足可以打败你！
Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you!

1014
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:06,149
而且我不是依靠你那种罕见的 天赋，你那种特殊的超能力
And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

1015
01:30:06,223 --> 01:30:07,586
我会让他们看到英雄的壮举
I'll give them heroics.

1016
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:10,820
我会让他们看到有史以来 最震撼人心的英雄壮举！
I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen!

1017
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:14,294
然后等我老了，也玩够了 我就会卖掉我的发明
And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions

1018
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:18,824
这样所有人都能成为超级英雄 所有人都能当超人
so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super.

1019
01:30:18,903 --> 01:30:21,768
要是所有人都是超人...
[chuckling] And when everyone's super...

1020
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:25,902
...那也就没有超人了
...no one will be.

1021
01:30:51,502 --> 01:30:53,469
自由射击！
Fire at will!

1022
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,703
它打得坦克毫无还手之力
[on TV] It's overwhelming the tanks.

1023
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:05,338
我很抱歉
[Bob] I'm sorry.

1024
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:09,442
这是我的错，我是一个糟糕的父亲
This is my fault. I've been a lousy father.

1025
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,216
对自己拥有的东西视而不见 因为自己被低估而耿耿于怀
Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued

1026
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,315
- 却低估了你们所有人 - 爸爸？
- that I undervalued all of you. - Dad?

1027
01:31:16,393 --> 01:31:17,586
嘘，别打岔
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1028
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,355
我太沉缅于过去...
So caught up in the past that l...

1029
01:31:21,932 --> 01:31:25,798
你们是我最重要的冒险，可我 却差一点忘记你们
You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it.

1030
01:31:25,869 --> 01:31:28,962
我发誓，我要把大家安全地带出去 假如我...
I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if l...

1031
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:32,872
我看爸爸今天进步非常大
Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today

1032
01:31:32,943 --> 01:31:35,604
不过现在我们该下来了
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1033
01:31:38,382 --> 01:31:40,281
我们得回大陆去
We need to get back to the mainland.

1034
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:42,943
我在来的路上看见过一个飞机库 笔直走就到
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead.

1035
01:31:52,896 --> 01:31:54,556
卫兵都去哪儿了？
Where are all the guards?

1036
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:56,097
上，上！
Go, go!

1037
01:32:00,037 --> 01:32:03,130
他们每跑一次，你就开一瓶酒
[guard] Hey, every time they run, you take a shot.

1038
01:32:19,323 --> 01:32:21,984
就是这个机库，可我没看见飞机
[Helen] This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets.

1039
01:32:22,059 --> 01:32:25,084
- 飞机不够快 - 什么东西比飞机还快？
- A jet's not fast enough. - What's faster than a jet?

1040
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:27,094
坐火箭怎样？
How about a rocket?

1041
01:32:30,034 --> 01:32:34,197
- 好主意！我可不会开火箭 - 没必要
- Great! I can't fly a rocket. - [Violet] You don't have to.

1042
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:36,932
用他们上次发射时的坐标就行
Use the coordinates from the last launch.

1043
01:32:38,776 --> 01:32:42,438
等一下，我敢肯定万恶霸王 现在已经改过密码了
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now.

1044
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:45,275
- 该怎么登录电脑呢？ - 来求我吧？
- How do I get into the computer? - [Mirage] Say please.

1045
01:33:01,031 --> 01:33:03,020
- 汉妮？ - 怎么？
- Honey? - [Honey] What?

1046
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:05,067
- 我的超人服在哪？ - 什么？
- Where is my supersuit? - [Honey] What?

1047
01:33:05,135 --> 01:33:08,660
我的超人服在哪？
Where is my supersuit?

1048
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:11,730
- 我把它放到别处了 - 在哪？
- [Honey] I put it away. - Where?

1049
01:33:11,809 --> 01:33:14,207
你为什么想知道？
[Honey] Why do you need to know?

1050
01:33:14,278 --> 01:33:15,335
我要用它！
I need it!

1051
01:33:15,412 --> 01:33:18,470
你别想溜出去逞英雄
[Honey] Don't you think about running off doing no derrin'-do.

1052
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:21,108
为这次宴会我们都筹划两个月了！
We've been planning this dinner for two months!

1053
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:23,982
- 现在公众有危险！ - 我的晚会才有危险！
- The public is in danger! - [Honey] My evening's in danger!

1054
01:33:24,054 --> 01:33:27,647
告诉我衣服在哪儿，你这娘们！ 我是在跟你谈大事！
Tell me where my suit is, woman! We are talking about the greater good.

1055
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:29,817
“大事”？我是你老婆！
[Honey] "Greater good"? I am your wife!

1056
01:33:29,893 --> 01:33:32,986
你的头等大事就是我！
I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get!

1057
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:37,831
快跑！
Run!

1058
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:40,965
我的宝宝！
My baby!

1059
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:47,699
- 超级英雄回来了！ - 那是钢火侠吗？
- [man] The supers have returned! - Is that Fironic?

1060
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:51,338
- 钢火侠？ - 不对，钢火侠的衣服不是这样的
- [man] Fironic? - No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1061
01:33:51,415 --> 01:33:56,113
不是，不是，我是新的超级英雄！ 我是万恶霸王！
No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome!

1062
01:33:59,189 --> 01:34:00,553
好了，退后吧
All right, stand back.

1063
01:34:04,928 --> 01:34:09,557
有人要教这个铁球懂点礼貌
Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners.

1064
01:34:11,169 --> 01:34:12,361
哈哈！
Ha, ha!

1065
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:43,094
- 我们还没到吗？ - 该到的时候总会到的
- Are we there yet? - We get there when we get there.

1066
01:34:45,235 --> 01:34:47,394
你怎么样，亲爱的？
[Bob] How you doing, honey?

1067
01:34:47,472 --> 01:34:50,268
我非得回答吗？
[Helen] Do I have to answer?

1068
01:34:52,409 --> 01:34:55,570
孩子们，照我说的系好安全带
Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you.

1069
01:34:59,484 --> 01:35:01,507
我们要去了，亲爱的
[Bob] Here we go, honey.

1070
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:05,613
准备好了吗，薇奥莱特？预备――
Ready, Violet? Ready?

1071
01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:06,779
走！
Now!

1072
01:35:09,827 --> 01:35:11,350
落地会很重
This is gonna be rough.

1073
01:35:18,936 --> 01:35:21,165
机器人在金融区，走那个出口？
Robot's in the financial district. Which exit?

1074
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:23,534
- 特拉克生大道 - 那样就到市中心了
- Traction Avenue. - That'll take me downtown.

1075
01:35:23,607 --> 01:35:26,130
- 我走第七大道吧，怎样？ - 别走第七大道！
- I take Seventh, don't l? - Don't take Seventh!

1076
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,871
- 很好，已经开过头了 - 你问我怎么走，我已经告诉你了
- Great, we missed it. - Ask how to get there, I told you.

1077
01:35:28,946 --> 01:35:30,810
- 特拉克生大道 - 那就去市中心了
- Traction. - That'll take me downtown.

1078
01:35:30,881 --> 01:35:32,574
进右车道！亮灯！
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1079
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:34,808
- 不能走特拉克生大道！ - 你要开过头了！
- Not Traction! - You're gonna miss it!

1080
01:36:01,411 --> 01:36:04,173
后面的人都好吗？
Is everybody okay back there?

1081
01:36:04,248 --> 01:36:07,808
- 好极了，爸爸！ - 咱们再来一次吧
- Super-duper, Dad! - [laughing] Let's do that again.

1082
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:13,650
在这里等着，藏好了，我这就去
Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in.

1083
01:36:14,459 --> 01:36:17,153
什么？让我在边上当看客？
While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1084
01:36:17,227 --> 01:36:19,989
- 我不同意 - 我要你和孩子们一起等着我
- I don't think so. - I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1085
01:36:20,063 --> 01:36:22,496
我告诉你，想都别想，你是我丈夫
And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband.

1086
01:36:22,566 --> 01:36:24,396
是好是坏我都和你在一起
I'm with you for better or worse.

1087
01:36:24,469 --> 01:36:26,492
我非得一个人干不可
I have to do this alone.

1088
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:28,365
- 你把这当什么？做游戏吗？ - 不是
- What is this to you? Playtime? - No.

1089
01:36:28,438 --> 01:36:30,495
- 为了让你再成为神奇超人？ - 不是！
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again? - No!

1090
01:36:30,574 --> 01:36:32,130
- 那是为什么？ - 我不...
- Then what? - I'm not...

1091
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:33,970
- 不什么？ - 我不够强
- Not what? - I'm not strong enough.

1092
01:36:34,044 --> 01:36:36,010
- 这样你就能更强？ - 对，不是的！
- This will make you stronger? - Yes. No!

1093
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:38,171
那这算什么？是你的锻炼方式？
That's what this is? Some sort of workout?

1094
01:36:38,248 --> 01:36:40,714
我不能再失去你了！
I can't lose you again!

1095
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:44,618
不能，不能有第二次
I can't. Not again.

1096
01:36:44,688 --> 01:36:47,053
我... 不够强
I'm not... strong enough.

1097
01:36:55,532 --> 01:36:58,465
要是我们合作，你就不用有多强
If we work together, you won't have to be.

1098
01:36:58,535 --> 01:37:00,365
我不知道会发生什么事
I don't know what'll happen.

1099
01:37:00,437 --> 01:37:03,271
我们是超级英雄啊 还能发生什么事？
We're superheroes. What can happen?

1100
01:37:07,444 --> 01:37:09,172
小薇！达什！不！
Vi! Dash! No!

1101
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:20,210
薇奥莱特！
Violet?

1102
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:26,127
- 爸爸！ - 快走！
- Dad! - Go, go!

1103
01:37:35,807 --> 01:37:39,241
- 我没事，妈妈，真的 - 呆在这儿，好吗？
- I'm okay, Mom. Really. - Stay here, okay?

1104
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,417
寒冰侠来也！
Frozone!

1105
01:37:51,488 --> 01:37:55,650
好啊！
[Bob] Yeah!

1106
01:37:55,726 --> 01:37:56,783
鲍勃！
Bob!

1107
01:38:15,213 --> 01:38:16,405
万恶霸王的遥控器！
Syndrome's remote!

1108
01:38:26,156 --> 01:38:28,486
那个遥控器能控制机器人！
The remote controls the robot!

1109
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:33,727
- 扔过来！扔过来！ - 跑吧！
- Throw it, throw it! - Go long!

1110
01:38:44,908 --> 01:38:46,032
接住了！
Got it!

1111
01:38:50,947 --> 01:38:53,005
亲爱的，打掉他的枪！
Honey, take out its guns!

1112
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:01,917
接住你了！
[Frozone] Gotcha!

1113
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:49,160
妈妈，我拿到了！我拿到遥控器了！
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1114
01:39:50,874 --> 01:39:53,239
遥控器！控制什么的？
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1115
01:39:56,646 --> 01:39:57,634
机器人？
The robot?

1116
01:40:05,822 --> 01:40:09,348
- 它又来了！
- It's coming back! - [Bob yells]

1117
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,485
- 那样不对 - 给我！
- That wasn't right. - Give me that!

1118
01:40:13,363 --> 01:40:16,695
我们阻止不了它，唯一硬到 可以打穿它的东西是...
We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is...

1119
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:21,498
...它自己
...itself.

1120
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:23,060
它越走越近了！
It's getting closer!

1121
01:40:23,141 --> 01:40:25,232
- 没有用啊！ - 孩子们！
- It doesn't work! - [Helen] Kids!

1122
01:40:26,878 --> 01:40:28,605
它没起什么作用
[Frozone] It's not doing anything.

1123
01:40:28,678 --> 01:40:30,941
- 给我们争取点时间 - 试试旁边那个按钮
- Try to buy us some time. - Try the one next to it.

1124
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:36,976
亲爱的！
Honey!

1125
01:40:43,093 --> 01:40:45,491
等一下 再按一下那个按钮！
Wait a minute. Press that button again!

1126
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:51,095
- 不对，是另一个！第一个！ - 第一个按钮！明白了！
- No, the other one! The first one! - First button! Got it!

1127
01:40:51,169 --> 01:40:53,499
- 它越走越近了！ - 当心！
- It's getting closer! - Look out!

1128
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:56,299
- 快离开这里！ - 我们哪儿也不去
- Get out of here! - We're not going anywhere.

1129
01:40:56,373 --> 01:40:58,101
- 按按钮呀！ - 还不行！
- [Bob] Press the button! - Not yet!

1130
01:40:58,176 --> 01:41:00,666
- 顶住！ - 你在等什么？
- [Frozone] Hang on! - What are you waiting for?

1131
01:41:00,744 --> 01:41:02,972
等目标再近点！你只有一发炮弹！
A closer target! You got one shot!

1132
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,015
全都趴下！
Everybody duck!

1133
01:41:30,974 --> 01:41:32,098
嘿，冰老弟
Hey, Zone.

1134
01:41:38,281 --> 01:41:40,544
啊？不！
Huh? No!

1135
01:41:40,617 --> 01:41:44,676
你看见了吗？就是要这样
Did you see that? That's the way to do it.

1136
01:41:44,754 --> 01:41:48,917
- 那是老套路了. - 对，没什么套路比得上老套路
- That's old school. - Yeah. No school like the old school.

1137
01:41:51,828 --> 01:41:55,092
- 就像当年一样，啊！ - 就像当年一样
- Just like old times. Oh! - Just like old times.

1138
01:41:55,165 --> 01:41:57,461
对，那时候也是这么疼
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1139
01:42:00,403 --> 01:42:02,869
我们已经冻结了万恶霸王的全部财产
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1140
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:06,532
哪怕他打一个喷嚏，我们也会 带着手帕和手铐找到他
If he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1141
01:42:06,611 --> 01:42:09,009
这个国家的人民都很感激你们
The people of this country are indebted to you.

1142
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:10,978
这是不是说我们 可以不用躲躲藏藏了？
Does this mean we can come out of hiding?

1143
01:42:11,047 --> 01:42:13,014
让政客们去考虑吧
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1144
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:16,608
他们要我向你们保证 我们会把其他事都安排好的
I've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else.

1145
01:42:16,686 --> 01:42:17,879
你干得很好，鲍勃
You did good, Bob.

1146
01:42:17,954 --> 01:42:19,853
- 嗨，我是凯莉
- [phone beeps] - Hi, this is Kari.

1147
01:42:19,923 --> 01:42:22,823
我有个和杰杰有关的问题...
I have a question about Jack-Jack...

1148
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:24,688
好啦，我们坐的可是豪华轿车
Come on. We're in a limo.

1149
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:27,627
你把头发梳到后面去了？
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1150
01:42:27,697 --> 01:42:30,563
- 是啊，我只是... 是啊 - 很漂亮
- [stammering] Yeah, I just... yeah. - It looks good.

1151
01:42:30,635 --> 01:42:33,296
- 谢谢，爸爸 - 你扔那车的时候真是酷！
- Thanks, Dad. - That was cool when you threw that car!

1152
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:35,893
不如你在水上跑的时候酷
Not as cool as you running on water.

1153
01:42:35,972 --> 01:42:39,498
那时候你用手臂钩住那个坏蛋
That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm

1154
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:42,441
又把他甩到另一个家伙身上，真是痛快！
and whiplashed him into the other guy. Sweet!

1155
01:42:42,512 --> 01:42:45,344
- 我在听电话呢 - 是我
- I'm trying to listen to messages. - [Kari] It's me.

1156
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:48,975
杰杰很好，可是出了点怪事
Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things are happening.

1157
01:42:49,052 --> 01:42:52,612
当然杰杰还是很好，可我 真是见了鬼了！
Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm getting really weirded out!

1158
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:54,279
你们什么时候回来？
When are you coming back?

1159
01:42:54,357 --> 01:42:56,756
...干掉了那些想杀我们的家伙！
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!

1160
01:42:56,827 --> 01:43:00,886
从来没见过这么棒的假日！ 我爱我们一家
That was the best vacation ever! I love our family.

1161
01:43:00,964 --> 01:43:03,829
我感觉不太好，帕尔太太！
[Kari] I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1162
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,662
把那个放下！停下！ 你要给我打电话
Put that down! Stop it! You need to call me.

1163
01:43:06,736 --> 01:43:08,965
我需要帮忙，太太...
I need help, Mrs...

1164
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:10,699
鲍勃，你听听
Bob, listen to this.

1165
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:12,798
我要叫警察了...
[Kari] I'm gonna call the police...

1166
01:43:12,876 --> 01:43:14,365
嗨，我是凯莉
Hi, this is Kari.

1167
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:18,641
刚才说了些胡话，我很抱歉 不过你们的宝宝有些特别的要求
Sorry for freaking out, but your baby has special needs.

1168
01:43:18,715 --> 01:43:20,739
谢谢你们派人接我的班
Thanks for sending a replacement.

1169
01:43:20,817 --> 01:43:23,546
我没有叫人替她
I didn't call a replacement.

1170
01:43:27,691 --> 01:43:31,318
嘘，宝宝在睡觉
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1171
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:35,993
你们夺走了我的未来
You took away my future.

1172
01:43:36,066 --> 01:43:39,500
我这是知恩图报 别担心，我会当个好师傅的
I'm simply returning the favor. Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1173
01:43:39,569 --> 01:43:42,866
会支持他，鼓励他 你做不到的事我都能做
Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't.

1174
01:43:42,939 --> 01:43:46,873
过些时候，谁知道呢 说不定他会变成我的好伙伴
And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick.

1175
01:43:51,014 --> 01:43:54,311
他要逃了，鲍勃！ 我们得赶紧做点什么
He's getting away, Bob! We have to do something now.

1176
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,365
出什么事了？
What's happening?

1177
01:44:17,274 --> 01:44:20,435
- 快拦下他！扔点东西上去！ - 不行，会打到杰杰的
- Stop him! Throw something! - I might hit Jack-Jack.

1178
01:44:24,648 --> 01:44:26,113
扔我上去
Throw me.

1179
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,685
鲍勃，扔我上去！
Bob, throw me!

1180
01:44:37,894 --> 01:44:38,985
不！
No!

1181
01:44:41,598 --> 01:44:45,158
这事还没完！总有一天我会抓到你儿子的
This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually.

1182
01:44:45,235 --> 01:44:46,564
我会抓到你儿子的！
I'll get your son!

1183
01:44:48,305 --> 01:44:49,498
哦，不
Oh, no.

1184
01:45:00,817 --> 01:45:04,684
看着妈妈，宝贝 别朝下看，妈妈接住你了
Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1185
01:45:04,754 --> 01:45:07,313
没事了
Everything is all right.

1186
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:23,864
不愧是我女儿
That's my girl.

1187
01:45:24,508 --> 01:45:27,270
是不是我们又得搬家了？
Does this mean we have to move again?

1188
01:45:30,413 --> 01:45:31,811
哦，老大
[little boy] Oh, man.

1189
01:45:31,882 --> 01:45:34,678
真是帅呆了！
That was totally wicked!

1190
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:43,214
三个月以后
[PA announcements]

1191
01:45:51,668 --> 01:45:54,568
田径运动会上一定要有啦啦队长吗？
Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet?

1192
01:45:54,638 --> 01:45:57,696
- 那有什么意思吗？ - 我总觉得那样更...
- What is that all about? - I always thought it was more...

1193
01:45:57,774 --> 01:45:59,297
- 嘿 - 嘿

- You're, uh, Violet, right? - That's me.

1195
01:46:02,045 --> 01:46:03,944
- 回见，小薇 - 你看起来不一样了
- See you, Vi. - You look different.

1196
01:46:04,014 --> 01:46:07,345
我觉得是不一样了，“不一样”好吗？
I feel different. Is different okay?

1197
01:46:07,417 --> 01:46:10,646
“不一样”么... “不一样”真是太好了
Hey, different is... [clears throat] Different is great.

1198
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,016
你可以...

- 你是不是...
- Do you... - Shh.

1202
01:46:18,127 --> 01:46:20,923
我喜欢看电影，我来买爆米花，怎样？
I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1203
01:46:20,997 --> 01:46:24,830
看电影，听你的，好
[stammering] A movie. There you go. Yeah.

快点，跑啊！加速
[Bob] Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1207
01:46:37,447 --> 01:46:38,777
跑啊！
[all] Run!

1208
01:46:38,849 --> 01:46:40,212
慢点，慢点
Move it, move it!

1209
01:46:40,283 --> 01:46:43,115
稍微慢一点
[Bob] Pace it. Slow down just a little bit.

1210
01:46:43,186 --> 01:46:46,052
- 别放弃啊，跟上去！ - 跑第二
- Make it close! - Second.

1211
01:46:46,122 --> 01:46:48,419
第二名，耶！
[Bob and Helen] Close second, yeah!

1212
01:46:51,995 --> 01:46:54,325
不愧是我儿子！
[Bob] That's my boy!

1213
01:46:54,397 --> 01:46:56,626
达什，你真是太让我自豪了
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1214
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,292
我都搞不明白你到底要我干什么
[Dash] I didn't know what the heck you wanted me to do.

1215
01:47:11,081 --> 01:47:14,048
看哪！我是钻地狂人！
Behold the Underminer!

1216
01:47:14,584 --> 01:47:17,050
我一直在你们下面
[Underminer] I am always beneath you,

1217
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:20,680
可是没人在我下面！
but nothing is beneath me!

1218
01:47:20,757 --> 01:47:26,661
我现在对和平和幸福宣战！
[Underminer] I hereby declare war on peace and happiness!

1219
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:31,325
要不了多久，一切都会在我面前发抖！
Soon all will tremble before me!
