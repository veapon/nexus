嗯，我知道
Yeah, no, I know,

6
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,049
可是我正要按你說的去做的
but when you tell me to do something, I'm gonna do it,

7
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,453
我馬上給他發郵件

00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,469
嗯，我不知道他什麼時候回復
Well, I don't know how quick he's gonna get back

9
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,679
有時他並不查看郵箱，所以…
'cause you know sometimes he doesn't check, so...

10
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,260
好，詩朗誦會結束
Yeah, and after the poetry reading,

11
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,183
我不回家
I'm not going home.

12
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,372
我是說，今天我生日
I mean, it's my birthday,

13
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,479
我想去夜總會

14
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,235
不，西蒙，我不想對她撒謊
No, Simon, I'm not gonna lie to her.

15
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,404
我不告訴她就行了呀
I'm just not gonna tell her.

16
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,660
我來停車
Let me go park the truck.

17
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,621
- 等會見，好嗎？  - 好

18
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,927
喂，多蘿西，你好嗎？
Hi, Dorothea, how are you?

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,474
好吧，我很好，謝了
I'm good, thanks for asking.

20
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,144
我去打電話，多要張門票
So I'll just call, I guess, and get extra tickets.

21
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,603
好，就這樣
Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,355
- 我馬上做  - 你好
- I'll do it right now. - Hey, you.

23
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,523

Yeah.

25

你好，西蒙
Hi, Simon.

26
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,195
他說：「會打電話給我」
He says, "Call me."

27
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,323
是啊，是啊，我媽回來了
Yeah, yeah, she just got home.

28
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,993
她肯定聽得到，她就站在這兒
I'm sure she can hear you, she's standing right here.

29
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,370
- 你好，盧克  - 你好，克拉蕾
- Hey, Luke. - How's it going, Clary?

30
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,816
沒，我馬上換衣服
No, I'll get dressed quick.

31
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,998
要咖啡嗎？
Do you want some coffee?

32
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,416
你再講我就得遲到了
If we keep talking, I'm gonna be late.

33
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,710
就那兒見，拜拜
Yeah, I'll meet you there. Bye.

34
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,061
你是不是用了…
Did you just use the...

35
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,771
你覺得呢？
How are you feeling?

36
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,190
好吧，為什麼？
Fine, why?

37
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,028
記得晚上直接回來
You make sure you come straight home tonight.

38
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,114
拜託，媽媽 只是個詩歌朗誦會
Mom, come on. Just a poetry reading.

39
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,741
我懂的
I know.

40
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,248
拜拜
Bye.

41
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,170
喬絲琳，你需要跟她談談
You need to talk to her, Jocelyn.

42
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,425
不行，她還沒準備好
She's not ready, not yet.

43
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,927
不，她準備好了
Yes, she is.

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,428
沒好的是你
You're not.

45
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,519
另外，謝謝你能來
By the way, thanks for doing this.

46
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,060
他很在意詩朗誦會
His poetry means a lot to him.

47
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,394
誰叫我們是朋友
That's what friends are for.

48
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,563

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,290
我聽不下去了，要再來杯咖啡嗎？
I can't listen to this. You want another coffee?

57
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,750
好
Yeah.

58
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,504
「包裹著的藏紅花瓣，低聲訴說死亡…」
"Like tiny crocus petals whisper death"

59
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,588
卡布奇諾和濃咖啡

「雨落大地」

61
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,595
「寒風穿過致病的壁毯」
"Shivering breezes weave through a morbid tapestry

62
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,055
「潰爛化膿」

63
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,850
「我痛苦，全身腫脹」
"Turgid is my torment"

64
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,310
好了
There you go.

65
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,104
謝謝
Thank you.

66
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,648
「雨落大地…」
"Rain drowns the earth..."

67
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,776
剛才那金髮女孩蠻喜歡你啊
That blonde girl over there was totally flirting with you.

68
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,986
約她出來
Ask her out.

69
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,697
- 不，那不公平  - 為什麼？
- Nah, it wouldn't be fair. - Why?

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,365
嗯，因為…
Well, because...

71
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,243
為了某人，我得空著自己
Because I'm saving myself for someone else.

72
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,286
誰？
Who?

我覺得更不好
Think he's getting worse.

77
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,596
你是他好友，得跟他講
As his friend, you should probably tell him.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,443
也許他詩歌很棒
Maybe his poetry is great,

79
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,142
我們不懂欣賞吧
we just don't know it yet.

80
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,146
進去看看
Let's go in here.

81
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,064
我想問下這符號的意思
I want to ask what that symbol means.

82
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,774
克拉蕾，我們不該進去
Clary, we'll never get in.

83
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,985
你個擔心鬼
Such the eternal optimist.

84
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,070
這可不像你
This is so not like you.

85
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,239
就去這一次啦
Just go with it for once.

86
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,077
這符號代表什麼？
What does that symbol mean?

87
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,500
- 什麼符號？  - 嗯，哪埵陴顫飽H
- What symbol? - Yeah, what symbol?

88
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,288
就在那兒 你沒… 你沒看見嗎？
It's right there. You don't... You don't see it?

89
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:36,295
沒
No.

90
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,384
酷斃了
Hey, that was cool.

91
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,895
嘿，我們進來了
Yeah, we're fitting in.

92
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,772
跟著跳 跟著跳
Move it, go with it.

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,983
克拉蕾，要來一杯嗎？
Clary, you want a drink?

94
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,151
好
Yeah.

95
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,085
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，那是什麼
Clary, Clary, what is it?

96
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,217
你沒看到嗎？
You didn't see that?

97
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,563
我真的看到
I know what I saw.

98
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,224
讓我們進去的那個男孩被殺了
They killed the guy that let us in the club.

99
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,226
- 你是喝迷幻藥了？  - 天啦，我沒喝，西蒙
- Did you drink something? - Yeah... No, Simon.

100
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,457
你知道，以前我就聽說過
You know, I've heard sometimes

101
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,271
有人把迷幻藥注射到他們鼻子
they pump hallucinogenic stuff into the air vents

102
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,647
這樣玩會很刺激
to make sure people have a good time.

103
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,730
好了，那你怎會沒事？
Okay, then how come you're fine?

104
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,608
我倆呼吸的是不同的空氣？
Did we breathe different air?

105
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,568
我不懂，回家好了
I don't know. Let's just go home.

106
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,367
- 你沒事吧？  - 沒事
- You okay?   - Yeah, fine.

107
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,245
你整整睡了一天
You've been sleeping all day.

108
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,539
而且你昨晚很遲回來
And you didn't come home till late last night.

109
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,749
是的，不過我有回來，對吧？
Yeah, well, I'm home, okay?

110
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,919
不准走
Well, you can't go.

111
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,066
我賣了另一幅畫
Well, I sold another painting.

112
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,130
一塊去慶祝一下
I wanted to celebrate with you.

113
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,631
慶祝你唯一的買家？
To what, your one buyer?

114
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,651
好吧，他是誰？
Who is this guy anyway?

115
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,759
他買你畫估計是愛上你了
He probably just buys your stuff 'cause he's into you.

116
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,095
你肯定像哄盧克那樣哄他的吧
I'm sure you'll just string him along like you do with Luke.

117
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,301
你幹嘛非得那樣說？
You really want to have that conversation?

118
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,765
那什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

119
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,934
- 西蒙  - 他就像我哥
- Simon. - He's like my brother.

120
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,352
我可不認為他這麼想
I doubt he feels that way.

121
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,563
好吧，不過我要走了
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

122
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,940
- 不，不，別走  - 別犯傻了
- No, no, you can't. - This is ridiculous.

123
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,568
- 你去哪堙H  - 我只是去加瓦-瓊斯咖啡廳
- Where are you going? - I'm just going to Java Jones.

124
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,695
- 我的天！  - 不，是我
- Jesus!     - No, just me.

125
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,863
走吧，西蒙
Come on, Simon.

126
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,657
克拉蕾 我有些事想告訴你，好嗎？
Clary. There's something I want to tell you, okay?

127
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,952
以後再說啦
We can talk about this later.

128
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,537
拜拜，弗蕾夫人
Bye, Mrs. Fray.

129
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,757
看，我突然畫了很多這些東西
Look, suddenly I'm drawing hundreds of these things,

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,634
我不懂怎麼搞的
and I have no idea what they are.

131
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,720
我不知道… 我想我快瘋了
I don't know. I think I'm going out of my mind.

132
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,139
也許你是《第三類接觸中》的那個主角
You know, maybe you're like the guy in Close Encounters.

133
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,604
大家認為他是妄想狂
Everybody thought he was paranoid,

134
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:42,184
但結果居然是…
and then there turned out to be, well...

135
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,811
幽浮，挺合理的，就像…
UFO, reasonable, like...

136
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,105
哎，天了，這怎麼可能發生
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

137
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,068
- 怎麼了？  - 這不可能
- What? - This isn't happening.

138
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,736
嘿，現在我被你嚇到了
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

139
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,324
克拉蕾，你是…
Clary, are you...

140
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,540
你在看什麼？
What are you looking at?

141
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,668
在這等我
Wait here.

142
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,485
喬絲，聖盃在哪？
Where's the Cup, Jocie?

143
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,452
你怎麼找到我？
How did you find me?

144
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,247
這得謝你女兒
You can thank your daughter for that.

145
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,624
為何我能看見你而別人不行？
Why can I see you and no one else can?

146
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,168
我還想問你呢？
I was going to ask you the same question.

147
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,019
我怎麼會跟你說話
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.

148
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,505
一個殺人狂，一個冷血殺手
You're a killer, a cold-blooded killer.

149
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,507
有這麼溫和的殺手？
As opposed to a peace-loving killer?

150
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,758
我很明白所看到的
I know what I saw.

151
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,135
你以為你明白
You think you know.

152
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,306
為什麼我會畫這些？
Why am I drawing this?

153
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,437
我猜對了，你不是凡人
So I was right, you're not a mundane.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,689
等等，凡人？
Excuse me? What's a mundane?

155
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,331
就是人類
Someone from the human world.

156
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,151
我要不是人類，那我是什麼？
If I'm not a human, then what am I?

157
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,488
去找聖盃
Go find the Cup.

158
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,213
- 什麼時候發生的？  - 不，不
- When did this start? - No, no.

159
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,448
為什麼我會畫這些？
Why am I drawing this?

160
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,493
回答我！
Answer me!

161
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,751
西蒙
Simon.

162
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,314
你或許得接下，可能是你男友
Maybe you should answer that. Could be your boyfriend.

163
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,691
- 他不是我男友  - 那他知道嗎？
- He's not my boyfriend. - Does he know that?

164
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,571
拜託，這很吵
Please. It's annoying.

165
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,075
媽，我要回來了
Mom, I'm coming home.

166
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,362
不，不，不 你不能回家
No, no, no. You can't come home.

167
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:47,786
聽到了嗎？別回來
You understand me? You don't come home.

168
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,514
告訴盧克
You call Luke.

169
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,580
說瓦倫丁復活了，他會找到我
Tell him Valentine's alive and that he found me.

170
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,707
我愛你
I love you.

171
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,167
- 媽！ - 不，不！
- Mom!    - No, no!

172
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,460
媽！
Mom!

173
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,719
告訴瓦倫丁他不可能拿到聖盃
You tell Valentine he'll never have the Cup.

174
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,016
別喝… 別喝…
Don't you... Don't drink...

175
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,767
過來！別… 什麼？
Come here! Don't... What?

176
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,065
快點！
Come on.

177
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,255
對不起 對不起 你還好嗎？
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

178
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,507
沒事，別動，好嗎？
All right, look, don't move, all right?

179
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,529
媽？
Mom?

180
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,118
媽？
Mom?

181
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,153
來，起來
Come on. Come on.

182
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,660
夠了！夠了！夠了！
That's enough! That's enough. That's enough.

183
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,413
它死了
It's dead.

184
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,250
那該死的到底是什麼？
What the hell was that?

185
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,004
我說了你肯定不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

186
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,297
說說看
Try me.

187
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,593
它是邪靈
It was a demon.

188
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,555
你說得對
You're right.

189
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,058
我不信你
I don't believe you.

190
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,602
而那個東西
And that thing,

191
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,188
你在夜總會看到我殺死的那個…
that you saw me kill at the club, that...

192
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,066
也是一隻邪靈
That was also a demon.

193
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,152
邪靈會附身任何活物
Demons can take possession of any living creature.

194
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,154
你誰都不能信
You can't trust anyone.

195
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,573
即使那人你很熟悉
Even people you think you know.

196
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,742
那我幹嘛要信你？
So, why should I trust you?

197
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,666
因為我剛才救過你
I did just save your life.

198
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,338
多蘿西，快開開門
Dorothea, open up, please.

199
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,425
你能…
Can you...

200
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,890
你知道我媽發生了什麼嗎？
Do you know what happened to my mom?

201
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,895
你知道嗎？
Do you?

202
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,946
等等，你可以看到他？
Wait, you can see this guy?

203
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,608
當然可以 她是女巫
Of course she can. She's a witch.

204
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,699
從姜餅套房降級到了單臥室？
Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one-bedroom?

205
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,659
你知道我媽在哪媔隉H
Do you know where my mom is?

206
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,327
對不起，我不清楚
Sorry. I have no idea.

207
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,080
嗯，她曾提到一個名字… 瓦倫丁
Well, she mentioned a name... Valentine.

208
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,041
- 你最好離開  - 不，請不要這樣
- You better leave. - No, please.

209
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,961
你不告訴我，我就不走
Not until you tell me something, anything.

210
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,492
看看骨牌占卜到什麼
Let's see what the cards have to say.

211
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,037
對不起，我不信這些…
I'm sorry, but you know that I don't believe in any of...

212
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,246
坐下
Sit.

213
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
把手在牌上過一遍
Run your hands over the cards.

214
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,090
我媽媽畫過這些
My mom painted these.

215
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,842
是的，你媽媽送的
Yes. They were a gift.

216
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,888
看看你拿到哪一張牌
Let's see which card gets picked.

217
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,166
大金盃
The Ace of Cups.

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,919
- 那是聖盃  - 那？
- That's the Mortal Cup. - So?

219
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,087
別理他
Ignore him.

220
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,081
這是聖盃神器
It's a Mortal Instrument,

221
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,589
我們族人三大聖物之一
one of the three holy objects of my people.

222
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,757
它怎麼在這兒？
What's it doing here?

223
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,093
我不明白這跟我媽有什麼關聯
I don't understand what any of this has to do with my mom.

224
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,096
你母親是暗影獵人，跟他一樣
Your mother was a Shadowhunter, like him.

225
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,473
不，我媽是個畫家
No, my mom is a painter.

226
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,725
她從沒跟你說過，對吧？
She never told you any of this, did she?

227
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,277
我只知道的是她消失了
All I know is that she's gone,

228
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:11,646
然後我不知道去哪塈鉿o
and I have no idea where to start looking for her.

229
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,526
讓我給你讀心
Let me read you.

230
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,135
有東西封印了你的回憶
There's something blocking your mind.

231
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,805
我猜是你媽媽僱請了高人來保護你
My guess is your mother hired someone very skilled to protect you.

232
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,932
- 保護什麼？  - 你的回憶
- From what? - Your own memories.

233
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,226
為什麼？
Why?

234
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,271
我不懂她要我忘記什麼
I don't remember anything she'd want me to forget.

235
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,876
等等
Wait.

236
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,420
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

237
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,851
搞什麼？
What the hell?

238
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,978
你嚇到我了
You scared me.

239
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,189
這究竟發生過什麼？
What the hell happened here?

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,025
- 我媽媽不見了  - 什麼？
- My mom's missing. - What?

241
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,944
有人抓了她，還毀了這
Someone took her and destroyed the place.

242
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,577
他正幫我找她
This guy is helping me find her,

243
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,121
你看不到他，而且他…
but you can't see him, and he...

244
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,457
克拉蕾
Clary.

245
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,501
好吧
Great.

246
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,461
好吧，現在我也看不到他了
Okay, now I can't see him, either.

247
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,215
傑斯·維蘭德，邪靈獵手
Jace Wayland, demon hunter.

248
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,345
西蒙·盧易斯，解鎖師
Simon Lewis, Keymaster.

249
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,475
你是門衛嗎？
Are you the Gatekeeper?

250
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,264
我不懂你在說什麼
I have no idea what you're talking about.

251
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,059
等等 什麼，你現在可以看到他了？
Wait. What, so you can see him now?

252
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,019
- 什麼？我當然能看到他  - 可我以為…
- What? Of course I can see him. - But I thought...

253
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,771
- 不…  - 你說什麼呢？
- No... - What are you talking about?

254
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,398
我被搞糊塗了
This is so confusing.

255
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,316
這是誰？
Who's this?

256
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,860
我爸爸，我兩歲時他就死了
That's my dad. He died when I was two.

257
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,035
克拉蕾，等等
Clary, a moment.

258
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,278
等等，你媽消失了
So, wait, your mom is gone,

259
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:38,000
你卻跟這染金髮的追星小伙在一起？
and you're hanging around with some dyed-blond wannabe Goth weirdo?

260
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,294
你在哪兒遇到他的？
Where'd you come across this guy?

261
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,840
- 不，我沒有 是他找我的  - 什麼？他找你
- No, I didn't. He found me. - What? He found you?

262
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,217
- 不，我知道這聽起來…  - 看看這個
- No, I know it sounds... - You should check this.

263
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,469
鄭重聲明，我頭髮金色是天生的
And for the record, my hair is naturally blond.

264
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,350
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，克拉蕾… 西蒙？
Clary, Clary, Clary... Simon?

265
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,144
她打過電話？
She called you?

266
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,980
你為什麼不接？
Why didn't you pick up?

267
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,691
要是知道這麼嚴重，我早接了
If I'd known it was serious, I would have picked up.

268
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,860
你都沒接怎麼會知道？
Well, how would you know if you didn't pick it up?

269
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,281
那是什麼？
What's that?

270
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,618
沒好事
Nothing good.

271
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,121
你懂她哪兒弄來這個的嗎？
Do you have any idea where she got this?

272
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,998
我得找盧克
I've got to find Luke.

273
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,136
太奇怪了，他車在這兒
It's so weird. His truck's here.

274
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,762
來吧 這邊
Come on. This way.

275
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,316
不，你在這等
No, you wait here.

276
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,851
幹嘛要聽你的？
Who made you the boss?

277
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,396
沒關係，這樣有人來能通知我們
It's okay. Just let us know if anyone comes.

278
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,305
我認識盧克好多年
I've known Luke all these years,

279
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,193
但我都沒下來過
but I've never been down here.

280
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,995
什麼？
What?

281
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,080
快點，夥計！
Come on, mate!

282
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,511
夥計，聽好…
Now, listen...

283
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,847
你要做的就是說真話
All you got to do, mate, is tell me the truth.

284
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,350
我說了，不知道聖盃在哪兒
I'm telling you, I don't know where the Cup is.

285
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,560
我知道你和喬絲關繫好
I know you and Jocie are close.

286
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,437
我可不是傻子？
I'm not stupid, am I?

287
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,564
別這樣回答
Don't answer that.

288
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,141
聽我說，夥計
Listen to me, mate.

289
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,443
只要告訴我聖盃在哪兒
Just tell me where the Mortal Cup is.

290
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,029
喬絲就會沒事
And then Jocie will be fine.

291
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,664
盧克，說啊，告訴我
Lukey, tell me. Tell me the truth.

292
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,699
我不知道
I don't know.

293
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,868
你可別惹我生氣
You don't want to make me angry.

294
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,162
- 我說了…  - 是嗎？
- I'm telling you... - Do you?

295
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,698
我再問一遍，夥計
I'm going to ask you again, mate,

296
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,084
聖盃在哪兒？
where's the Cup, huh?

297
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,669
我不知道
I don't know.

298
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,339
我們都需要它，盧克，不是嗎？
We all want the same thing, Lukey boy, don't we?

299
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:52,009
不同之處，我覺得你知道它在哪兒
Difference is, I think you know where it is.

300
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,386
不是嗎？
Don't you?

301
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,471
快點 快點 說啊！
Come on. Come on. Talk!

302
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,307
- 我們得走了  - 不，求你了，你要幫他
- We need to go. - No, please, you have to help him.

303
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,684
你不懂
You don't understand.

304
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,061
他們是瓦倫丁的人
They work for Valentine.

305
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,804
他是個死人 我幫不了他
He's a dead man. I can't help him.

306
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:05,773
他是我家人
He's like family.

307
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,567
奇了怪
You know what's really amazing

308
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,570
你看上去還挺像人類
is how much you actually look like a human.

309
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,697
很棒啊？
Isn't it great?

310
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,328
求你了
Please.

311
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,205
你要發狂了？你要變身了？
Are you gonna get mad? You're going to change?

312
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,665
我要看你變身
I want to see you change.

313
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,168
給我露露你怎麼變身的？
Show me how you can change. Huh?

314
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,504
看看 看看
Look at that. Look at that.

315
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,674
狼人來了
Dog boy's coming on.

316
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,925
你想搞我腿？
You want to hump my leg?

317
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,678
你搞我腿？喜歡這樣？
You hump legs? You like that?

318
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,097
要嗅我屁股嗎？
You want to smell my derriere?

319
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,603
我要看你　變身
I want to see you change!

320
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,939
告訴我喬絲琳把聖盃藏哪兒
You just got to tell me where Jocelyn hid the Cup.

321
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,941
然後你可以平安帶回她
Then you can have her back.

322
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,693
她會平安無事的
She'll be safe and sound.

323
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,489
我沒要她回來
I don't want her back.

324
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,158
我一點不在乎
I couldn't care less.

325
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,600
我這麼多年
I have spent years

326
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,580
一直在討好她和她的倔女兒，就是為聖盃
cozying up to that woman and her brat for the Mortal Cup.

327
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,333
潘伯恩，聽我說
Pangborn, listen to me.

328
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,002
我也想把聖盃給瓦倫丁
I want to be the one to give her to Valentine.

329
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,545
呀，對
Yeah, right.

330
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,217
你在犯大錯
You are making a big mistake.

331
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,428
我不信，你信他嗎？
I don't believe you. Do you believe him?

332
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,646
- 克拉蕾，快跑！  - 克拉蕾，聽我說！
- Clary, run!          - Clary, listen!

333
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,534
勞駕 警官？
Excuse me. Officer?

334
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,204
我要報案，有人闖入
I'd like to report a break-in.

335
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,206
一人失蹤
And a missing person.

336
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,623
有人闖入我朋友的家…
My friend's house got broken into, and...

337
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,419
- 她媽媽失蹤了  - 哦，不
- Her mom's missing. - Oh, no.

338
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,295
快跑！
Run!

339
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,267
- 你殺了兩個警察！  - 他們不是警察
- You killed two cops! - They weren't cops.

340
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,560
快走！
Let's go!

341
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,322
克拉蕾
Clary.

342
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,325
你不能留在這兒 他們會抓到你的
You can't stay here. They'll find you.

343
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,288
盧克怎麼會說他不在乎？
How could Luke say that he didn't care?

344
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,040
我從記事起就認識他了
I've known him for as long as I can remember.

345
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,805
他曾每晚都為我讀故事
He used to read to me every night.

346
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,919
他天天來校接我好幾年了
He's been picking me up at school for years.

347
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,672
也許這記憶不真實
Look, maybe those memories aren't real.

348
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,341
你不記得我說的了嗎？
Do you remember what I told you?

349
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,343
誰都不能相信
You can't trust anyone.

350
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,221
不，我要找回媽媽，我要回家
No, I need to find my mom. I have to go home.

351
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,432
- 我肯定漏了什麼！  - 聽我說，好嗎？
- There must be something that I missed! - Listen to me, okay?

352
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,517
我們會弄清的，但不是此時此地
We'll figure this out, but not here and not now.

353
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,228
你得到一個安全的地方
We need to get you to a safe place.

354
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,878
我是暗影獵人，克拉蕾
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary,

355
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,857
我會誓死保護你
and I will protect you with my life.

356
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,319
你們在這兒，我以為你們緊跟著
There you guys are. I thought you were right behind me.

357
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,904
我丟了你們
I thought I'd lost you.

358
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,448
好吧，我跟著你
Okay. I'll follow you.

359
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,742
你確定嗎？他剛殺了兩個警察
Are you sure about that? 'Cause he just killed two cops.

360
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,035
呀，他們不是警察
Yeah, they weren't cops.

361
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,121
我覺得他們就是
They looked like real cops to me.

362
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,540
- 他們不是真警察  - 好吧
- They weren't real cops. - Okay.

363
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,461
那他們那兒弄來的警車？
So, where did they get the car?

364
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,591
他們不是真警察
They weren't real cops.

365
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,520
在這我們會很安全
We'll be safe in here.

366
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,396
這鬼地方是哪堙H
What is this dump?

367
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,273
這不是鬼地方
This isn't a dump.

368
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,443
只不過你看不見
You just can't see it.

369
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,813
到底怎麼了？他們做了什麼？
What the hell is going on? What are they doing in here?

370
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,773
- 這是被邪靈咬傷  - 克拉蕾
- It's a demon bite. - Clary.

371
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,775
傑斯，做點什麼！
Jace, do something!

372
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,243
接下來是不是你該撕掉你的襯衣
Is this the part when you start tearing off pieces of your shirt

373
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:03,779
包紮我的傷口呢？
to bind my wounds?

374
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,021
如果你要我把這身衣服脫下來
If you wanted me to take my clothes off,

375
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:07,449
只要你發話就行
you should've just asked.

376
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,419
只是有點發燒
It's just a fever.

377
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,637
她醒了
She's waking up.

378
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,114
我昏倒後你們給紋的？
I passed out, and you guys tattooed me?

379
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:53,913
我以為這只在賭城才會發生
Thought that only happened in Vegas.

380
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,664
- 這不是紋身  - 是圖符
- It's not a tattoo. - It's a rune.

381
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,233
它讓你擁有一切：
They have them for everything,

382
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,293
隱身術，強健之軀和自愈術
they make you invisible, strong, they heal.

383
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,708
它讓你可見
They also make you visible.

384
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,421
所以我突然可以看到他
That's why I could suddenly see him.

385
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,590
- 即使你不吃飯…  - 不
- Even if you're hungry... - No.

386
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,887
事實上，這圖符是讓你可以看到我們
The fact that the rune had an effect on you explains why you can see us.

387
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,096
我沒弄懂
I don't get it.

388
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,918
凡人是挺不過來的
Mundanes can't survive the process.

389
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:14,850
他們無法承受這圖符的力量，所以…
The runes are too strong for them, so...

390
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,977
現在，我們很確定你有暗影獵人的血脈
Now we definitely know you have Shadowhunter blood.

391
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,771
等等，那之前就不確定了？
Wait, it wasn't definite before?

392
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,398
她沒死，才讓我們更確定，是這樣的
Well, it became definite when she didn't die. Yes.

393
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,068
看看合不合身
Here, see if these fit.

394
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,070
我們這不是天天有貴客的
It's not every day we get guests in here.

395
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,947
尤其少見女客人
Especially not girls.

396
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,700
是啊
Yeah.

397
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,251
我們要叫警察來嗎？
Shouldn't we call the cops?

398
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,212
我指的是真警察
I mean, the real ones.

399
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,408
好主意
That's a great idea.

400
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:46,382
我只是不懂我們為何沒想到過
I just don't know why we haven't thought of that

401
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,592
在過去的這幾千年中
for the past thousand years.

402
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,845
霍奇在等她
Hodge is ready for her.

403
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,265
他想在藏書館單獨見她
He wants to see her alone in the library.

404
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,768
霍奇是誰？
Who's Hodge?

405
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,895
他是這堛瑰Y
He's in charge of the Institute.

406
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,814
好吧，我們走
Okay, let's go.

407
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,275
無數的暗影獵人曾來此尋求庇護
Hundreds of Shadowhunters used to seek asylum here.

408
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,111
但你也看到了
But, as you can see,

409
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,655
現在只剩我們這幾個了
right now, we're the only ones.

410
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,658
沒有聖盃，我們只能等死
Without the Mortal Cup, we're a dying breed.

411
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,369
要麼你是暗影獵人的後代
Either you're born of a Shadowhunter,

412
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,913
要麼你有喝過聖盃之水
or you have to drink from the Mortal Cup.

413
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,422
你來自
You coming?

414
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,177
遙遠的布魯克林，對吧？
Pretty far from Brooklyn, isn't it?

415
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,972
離傑斯遠點
Stay away from Jace.

416
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,521
你可能覺得霍奇有點古怪
You may find Hodge a little eccentric,

417
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,899
但他曾是最出色的暗影獵人之一
but he's one of the greatest Shadowhunters that's ever lived.

418
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,693
這給我
Here, give me that.

419
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,233
你不覺得這有點冒險
Don't you think it's a bit risky

420
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,863
讓一個完全陌生的人
inviting a complete stranger

421
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,570
闖進神院中心？
into the heart of the Institute?

422
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,239
不，我們可以相信她
No. I think we can trust her.

423
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,866
那她的凡人朋友呢？
And what about her mundane friend?

424
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,409
嗯，這是一時疏忽
Well, that was impulsive.

425
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,745
你一時疏忽，會弄砸事
When you're impulsive, things go badly.

426
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,175
當心
Just be careful,

427
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:49,171
自愈心碎的圖符是最疼的
the rune to fix a broken heart is the most painful one.

428
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,549
我保證適時讓他們離開
They'll be out of here in a day, I promise.

429
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,682
傑斯
Jace.

430
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,440
她曾是最出色的獵人之一
She was one of the best,

431
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,025
你的母親
your mum.

432
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,277
但我不明白為什麼她…
But I don't understand why...

433
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,572
昨天你還只是個普通的女孩
Yesterday you were just a normal girl.

434
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,241
今天彷彿感覺到
Today you feel as though

435
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,202
你的世界徹底翻天覆地改變了
your whole world has been turned upside down.

436
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,209
你必須知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

437
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,046
那是你小時候聽到的故事
The stories you were told as a little girl

438
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,048
怪獸和夢魘
about monsters, nightmares,

439
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,426
篝火旁低訴的傳說…
legends whispered around campfires...

440
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,054
他們都是真的
They're all true.

441
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,225
- 邪靈？  - 對
- Demon?    - Yes.

442
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,814
邪靈？
Demon?

443
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,482
不，狼人不是邪靈
No. Werewolves aren't demons.

444
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,985
我們和地下生物有過停戰協議
We have a truce with Downworlders.

445
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,319
地下生物？
Downworlders?

446
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:57,197
是什麼？14號街以下的人？
What is that, like people below 14th Street?

447
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,616
嗯，「地下生物」包括很多
Well, "Downworlders" pretty much sums everything up,

448
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,327
吸血鬼，狼人和術士
vampires, werewolves, Warlocks.

449
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,163
術士，很酷啊
Warlocks. Cool.

450
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,832
你怎麼殺死一隻殭屍的？
So, how do you kill a zombie?

451
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,000
我們沒殺
We don't.

452
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,835
當然他們已經死了
Of course, they're already dead.

453
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,712
不，他們不存在
No. They don't exist.

454
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,508
那麼這就是大家所說的聖盃吧
So, that's the famous Cup everyone's talking about.

455
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,719
只是個模型，不過也對
A replica. But yes.

456
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,183
那你知道傑斯敏感易怒咯
You know, Jace has got a real chip on his shoulder.

457
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:24,933
你也一樣的
You would, too,

458
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,186
如果你小時候親眼看到你父親被殺
if you saw your father murdered when you were a child.

459
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,021
要不是他，我們全死了
If it weren't for him, we'd be dead.

460
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,357
我都說不清他救了我們多少次了
He saved our lives more times than I care to admit.

461
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,526
好吧
Right.

462
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,950
據傳說
The legend goes,

463
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,621
十字軍曾召喚過一位天使
the Crusaders summoned an angel,

464
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,123
天使拉齊爾
the Angel Raziel.

465
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,251
拉齊爾將自己的鮮血倒入聖盃
Raziel poured his blood into a cup,

466
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,151
那些喝過其血的人
and those who drank from it

467
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,963
變成半天使，半凡人
became half angel, half human.

468
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,798
暗影獵人
Shadowhunters.

469
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,427
這會遺傳給他們的子子孫孫
As did their children and their children's children.

470
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,638
有強大力量的族群
Beings of immense power,

471
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,098
足以恢復和平
strong enough to restore balance

472
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,560
保護世界，抵禦邪靈
and protect the world in a war against evil.

473
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,896
這是無贏家的鬥爭
A war that can never be won,

474
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,316
但永無休止
but must always be fought.

475
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,403
因為邪靈永生不息
Demons don't die easily.

476
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,659
但我們卻終有一死
Whereas we, we remained all too mortal.

477
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,870
你們幹嘛不用聖盃
Why didn't they just use the Cup

478
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,412
繁衍出更多的暗影獵人？
to create more Shadowhunters?

479
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,122
瓦倫丁也這麼說過
Valentine's exact words.

480
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,750
克拉夫－聖盃守護者
The Clave, the keepers of the Cup,

481
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,752
他們害怕其力量
they were afraid of using its power.

482
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,797
他們知道沒人能承受住聖盃的力量而存活
They knew that hardly anyone who drank from it survived.

483
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,343
瓦倫丁·摩根斯坦召集了一群朋友
Valentine Morgenstern drew a circle of friends together,

484
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,596
一群年輕妄想的暗影獵人
young, idealistic Shadowhunters,

485
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,686
幫他從克拉夫手堸膘鴗F聖盃
to help him steal the Mortal Cup from the Clave.

486
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,816
但瓦倫丁並不想保護人類
But he didn't want to protect humanity.

487
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,445
他相信暗影獵人可以進化
He believed there had to be an evolution of Shadowhunters,

488
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,197
變得更具力量
something more powerful.

489
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,033
他開始試著使用聖盃
He began experimenting, using the Mortal Cup.

490
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,453
並學會了召喚邪靈
He learned how to summon demons.

491
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,896
他甚至給自己注射過邪靈的鮮血
He even injected himself with demon blood

492
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,251
以此來控制他們
so he could control them.

493
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,254
他想統治一切
He wanted to rule.

494
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,258
為了阻止他，你媽媽
Your mother, to prevent that,

495
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,635
偷走了聖盃
stole the Cup from him,

496
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,387
而後消失不見
and vanished into thin air.

497
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,432
但要是只有她知道聖盃在哪堙A那麼…
But if she's the only one that knows where the Cup is, then...

498
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,225
也許不只她
Maybe she isn't.

499
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,477
她可能告訴某人了
Maybe she told someone else.

500
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,231
一個沒有人猜到她知道的人
Someone who doesn't know she knows.

501
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,904
賽任兄弟們在等她
The Silent Brothers are ready for her.

502
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,160
為什麼霍奇不一塊來？
Why didn't Hodge come with us?

503
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,162
他好多年沒離開神院了
He hasn't left the Institute in years.

504
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,747
有人說是詛咒
Some say it's a spell.

505
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,999
他有恐曠癥吧
He's agoraphobic.

506
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,214
是他嗎？
Is that him?

507
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,258
不，那是哈羅德，掃地工
No, that's Harold, the groundskeeper.

508
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,635
是他
That's him.

509
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,902
你想好要經歷這些了嗎？
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

510
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,115
我們會幫你解開回憶
We will help you to remember.

511
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,872
你會吵醒亡靈的
You'll wake the dead.

512
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,296
難以置信，這地方就在城市外
I can't believe this place is just outside the city.

513
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,689
歡迎來到　骸骨之城
Welcome to the City of Bones.

514
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,115
這是賽任兄弟汲取力量的源泉
This is where the Silent Brothers draw their power,

515
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,034
暗影獵人的骸骨和骨灰
from the bones and ashes of Shadowhunters.

516
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,745
他們都埋在這堙H
All of them are buried here?

517
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,914
對，有一天
Yes. One day,

518
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,709
我會在這
that's gonna be me.

519
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,845
我只能跟到這兒了
This is as far as I go.

520
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,472
你不會有事的
You'll be fine.

521
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,726
你之前試過嗎？
So you've done this before?

522
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,687
沒
No.

523
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,911
你必須傾聽自己的內心
You must listen with your mind.

524
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,216
媽？
Mom?

525
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,135
媽？
Mom?

526
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,686
去，去
Go. Go.

527
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,819
克拉蕾，這是盧克
Clary, this is Luke,

528
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,696
我最好的朋友
my dearest friend.

529
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,656
你可以信任他
You can trust him.

530
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,283
你好，克拉蕾
Hi, Clary.

531
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,495
別說
Don't tell.

532
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,717
別碰那老東西
Don't touch that old thing.

533
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,512
只是個舊杯子，克拉蕾
It's just an old cup, Clary.

534
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,896
克拉蕾！克拉蕾，你還好嗎？
Clary! Clary, are you okay?

535
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,149
克拉蕾？
Clary?

536
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,616
封印比預想的要強
Your block is stronger than I anticipated.

537
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,368
解鈴還須繫鈴人了
It can only be undone by the one who put it there.

538
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,495
我不清楚繫鈴人是誰
I have no idea who put it there.

539
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,289
你寫出來了
You wrote it.

540
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,965
你記得是相反的印象
Your mind remembers the inverted image.

541
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,343
要換個角度看
Just have to look at it differently.

542
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,554
「貝恩」
"B-A-N-E."

543
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,932
- 貝恩  - 是誰？
- Bane.    - Who?

544
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,810
馬格努斯·貝恩，我記得他是個術士
Magnus Bane. He's a warlock. I should have known.

545
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,896
好，那找他去
Well, let's go talk to him then.

546
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,481
不能這樣去
Not like that.

547
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,776
你需要伊莎貝爾的協助
We're gonna need some help from Isabelle.

548
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,653
這是上衣
This is a top.

549
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,237
是連衣裙
It's a dress.

550
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,991
我穿不了
I can't pull this off.

551
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,826
就差雙合適的鞋子…
Well, actually, with the right shoes...

552
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
不，我是說…
No, I mean...

553
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,164
這衣服太緊，像包了一層皮一樣
This dress is so tight, it's like a second skin.

554
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,001
你難道沒有別的了嗎？
Don't you have anything else?

555
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,671
要是你穿得像凡人那樣去的話
If you go out looking like your mundane self,

556
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,048
我們接近不了馬格努斯·貝恩
we won't get within a hundred feet of Magnus Bane.

557
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,300
他是布魯克林的高級術士
He's the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

558
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,469
別抱怨了，過來
Now, stop complaining, come over here.

559
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:43,932
拿著
Hold this.

560
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,396
亞力克好像很討厭我
That guy Alec doesn't like me very much.

561
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,690
亞力克是我的兄弟
That guy Alec is my brother.

562
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,945
傑斯知道亞力克對他的感覺嗎？
Does Jace know how Alec feels about him?

563
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,740
很明顯嗎？
Is it that obvious?

564
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,034
這真沒什麼大不了的
It's really not that big of a deal.

565
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,994
對我也一樣
It isn't to me either.

566
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,214
但對克拉夫不同
But it is to the Clave.

567
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:08,623
規則不是我定的
I don't make the rules.

568
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,628
看，現在多漂亮
See? You look pretty.

569
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,500
幹嘛要穿得這麼妖艷
How is being dressed like a hooker

570
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,549
會幫我找到媽媽？
gonna help me find my mom?

571
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,009
放鬆點，那些只是我的衣服而已
Easy now, those are my clothes.

572
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,220
亞力克，她看上去漂亮吧？
Doesn't she look great, Alec?

573
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,451
她看上去就像
She looks like someone

574
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,849
留電話號碼在浴室牆上的人
whose phone number should be on a bathroom wall.

575
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,981
我覺得你很漂亮
I think you look great.

576
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,831
等等，我來過這
Wait, I've been here.

577
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,738
- 等等  - 怎麼了？
- Wait.     - What?

578
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,539
這樣更好點？
Is that better?

579
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,957
更好了
It's better.

580
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,015
嘿，嘿，嘿
Well, well, well.

581
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,433
瞧瞧這兒
Look-a here.

582
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,228
什麼風把人神的孩子們吹到這兒
I don't remember inviting any children of the Nephilim.

583
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,105
馬格努斯·貝恩，我們要談談
Magnus Bane. We need to talk.

584
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,982
我不喜歡你們
You know I don't like you guys.

585
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,408
但我還讓你們待在這兒
But I'll let you stay,

586
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:01,277
只是因為這火辣寶貝
but only because of the hot one.

587
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,946
- 謝謝  - 謝謝
- Thanks. - Thank you.

588
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,113
什麼？
What?

589
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,741
我說的是他
I meant him.

590
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,660
藍眼睛的那位
The one with the blue eyes.

591
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,498
還有克拉蕾
And because of Clary.

592
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,708
等等，你怎麼知道她名字？
Wait. How do you know her name?

593
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,252
跟我來
Come with me.

594
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,049
- 你媽媽呢？  - 她失蹤了
- Where's your mother? - She's missing.

595
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,052
原來如此
That explains it.

596
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,440
她每年都帶你來這兒
Every year, she brought you here.

597
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,099
從來沒有漏過一次
She never missed an appointment.

598
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,728
我在你身上下的咒語是最成功的
Not every spell turns out as perfect as the one I did on you.

599
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,025
一旦你開始畫天使圖符
As soon as you started drawing the angelic rune,

600
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,528
說明你的記憶又回來了
it was a sign your memory was surfacing.

601
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,196
我將此咒深藏在你記憶中
I had built that into your mind

602
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,740
她就能適時帶你回來封印
so that she knew when to bring you back.

603
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,993
暗影世界堛漱@切，你都會忘記
What you saw from the shadow world,

604
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,245
即使你看過
you would forget, even as you saw it.

605
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,122
可你越長大
But as you grew older,

606
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,082
你需要封印的次數也越來越多
you needed my treatment more frequently.

607
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,543
她知道有一天非得告訴你
She knew she had to tell you one day,

608
00:47:58,626 --> 00:47:59,794
但想等你準備好後
but until you were ready,

609
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,204
她想封印回憶
she wanted to keep the block on your mind.

610
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,798
這就是她想做的
It was exactly how she wanted it.

611
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,057
我們要在這兒待多久？
How long do you think we're gonna be here?

612
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,350
西蒙，放鬆點，好嗎？
Relax, Simon, okay?

613
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
別喝！
Don't drink that!

614
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,070
西蒙！西蒙！
Simon! Simon!

615
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,158
時間會消磨封印
It'll wear off over time.

616
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,744
現在已經磨去了，要麼你不會來這兒
It's already wearing off, or you wouldn't be here.

617
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,329
我還是記不起來
I need to remember.

618
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,826
我媽沒有多少時間了
My mom doesn't have time.

619
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,166
求你了，你肯定能做點什麼
Please, there must be something you can do.

620
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,509
你就是買我母親畫的人
You're the one who's been buying all my mom's paintings.

621
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,513
你為什麼每幅都買？
Why did you buy all of them?

622
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:53,973
我清楚她需要錢
I knew she needed the money.

623
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,475
你甚至有我爸爸的畫像
You even have a portrait of my dad.

624
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,520
那不是你爸
That's not your dad.

625
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,356
他只是戰死在伊朗的一名士兵
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

626
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,358
喬絲琳從沒見過他
Jocelyn never even met the guy.

627
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,109
有人請她畫的
She was asked to paint his portrait,

628
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,778
但這對一位寡婦來說太痛苦了
but it was too painful for the widow.

629
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,473
她保留著畫，所以…
She kept the picture so...

630
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,365
她就能假裝他是我爸爸
She could pretend he was my dad.

631
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,285
她做的一切都是為了你
Everything she did, she did for you.

632
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,954
你媽媽生命中的一切：
Your mother's whole existence,

633
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,997
逃跑，躲藏，謊言
the running, the hiding, the lies,

634
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,958
都是為了你的安全
were to keep you safe.

635
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,127
她有跟我說過什麼真話嗎？
Was anything she ever told me true?

636
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,216
你頭腦娷繭菑@幅寶藏圖，克拉蕾
There's a treasure map inside your head, Clary.

637
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,969
找到聖盃，它能帶你找到你媽媽
Find the Cup, and it will lead you to your mother.

638
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,595
他們把西蒙帶走了
They've taken Simon.

639
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,347
- 誰？  - 吸血鬼
- Who?   - Vampires.

640
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,059
別忘了
Just remember,

641
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:41,270
你媽媽躲避的正是暗影獵人
it was Shadowhunters your mother was running from.

642
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,482
我們去找西蒙
Let's go find Simon.

643
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,030
我們不能闖進吸血鬼的老巢，我們從沒試過
We can't break into a vampire's lair, we never learned.

644
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,700
- 又開始了你  - 傑斯，這你知道的
- Don't start again. - Jace, you know the rules.

645
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:54,943
夥計，我們來這幹嘛？
Guys, what are we doing here?

646
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,452
我們不是要找西蒙嗎？
I thought we were trying to find Simon.

647
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,955
我們知道他在哪，只是需要先拿些東西
We know where he is. We just need to pick up a few things.

648
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,543
這是什麼？你們和教堂有某種約定？
What is this, some kind of deal you have with the church?

649
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,858
邪靈在世界各地都有
Demons exist all across the world

650
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:08,589
而且外形各異
in their varying, different forms.

651
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,676
暗影獵人從不單信某個宗教
Shadowhunters cling to no particular religion,

652
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,345
因此，所有宗教都能協助我們作戰
and in turn all religions assist us in our battle.

653
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,432
我們自如穿梭在猶太教堂
We could have as easily gone to a Jewish synagogue

654
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,017
或神道教塔…
or a Shinto temple or...

655
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,979
在這
Here it is.

656
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,613
在每個教堂的祭壇底下…
Beneath every altar in every church...

657
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,159
都能找到這個
you'll find this.

658
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,465
那你們信仰什麼？
So, what do you believe in?

659
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,216
我信仰自己
I believe in myself.

660
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,676
我知道殺死邪靈是我的職責
I know my job is to kill demons.

661
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,386
其它我一概不信
I don't have to believe in anything else.

662
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,721
那天使拉齊爾呢？
What about the Angel Raziel?

663
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,972
那是美麗的傳說
Yeah, makes for a nice story.

664
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,807
- 但霍奇說…  - 是啊，霍奇
- But Hodge thinks... - Yeah, Hodge.

665
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,559
他還有很多沒說
He needs to get out more.

666
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,312
- 我原以為…  - 聽著，我一直在獵殺邪靈
- I thought... - Listen, I've been hunting demons

667
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,688
已經花掉了我三分之一的生命
for over a third of my life,

668
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,399
到目前為止，從未見過天使
and in all that time, I've never seen an angel.

669
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,776
這兒
Here.

670
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,820
這，你拿這個
Here, you take this one.

671
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,865
我不會…
I don't...

672
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,658
這，我教你
Here, let me show you.

673
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,536
這是一把殺吸血鬼的槍，必須瞄準他們的心臟
It's a vampire gun. Must pierce the heart.

674
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,081
推上來，對著胸膛
Push it up against the chest.

675
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,499
開火
Fire.

676
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,670
再裝槍 重發
Recharge. Then you're good to go again.

677
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,097
死人客棧？
Hotel of Death?

678
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,140
他們也有幽默感
You can't say they don't have a sense of humor.

679
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,350
快點
Come on.

680
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,606
- 她怎麼辦？  - 她很勇敢
- What is it about her? - She's brave.

681
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,566
我們暗影獵人都勇敢
We're Shadowhunters, we're all brave.

682
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,401
她不像我們那樣撫養長大，她不同
She wasn't raised like us, she's different.

683
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,029
她會連累我們被殺
She's gonna get us all killed.

684
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,092
是西蒙的襯衫
Simon's shirt.

685
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,667
他在上面
He's up here.

686
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:38,799
西蒙
Simon.

687
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,854
- 我的天，我的天，西蒙  - 克拉蕾
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, Simon. - Clary.

688
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,820
不，我能觸到他了！
No, I can feel him!

689
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,699
搭把手 快點，快點
Give me a hand. Come on, come on.

690
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,661
這該死的靴子！
These damn boots!

691
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,414
這兒
Here.

692
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,624
好
Here you go.

693
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,961
- 快點  - 夥計，穩住
- Come on. - Guys, steady.

694
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,925
慢點
Slowly.

695
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,062
他還活著！
He's alive!

696
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,313
小心
Careful.

697
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,610
快走，他們要的不是我
Go on. Get out. They don't want me.

698
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,696
要的是你，他們要的是聖盃
They want you, they want the Cup.

699
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,088
- 快點，走  - 天啊
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh, God.

700
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,756
快！
Let's go!

701
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,136
不，這兒
No, here.

702
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,148
- 這兒！  - 走！
- In here! - Go!

703
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,874
傑斯
Jace.

704
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,208
你身後！
Behind you!

705
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,692
快點！快點！
Come on! Come on!

706
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,685
克拉蕾！
Clary!

707
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,795
他們人數太多
There's too many of them.

708
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:46,630
抱點信念
Have a little faith.

709
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,119
跑！
Run!

710
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:32,843
傑斯，給我把短刀
Jace, I need a knife.

711
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,431
- 日出  - 快走
- The sun. - Let's go.

712
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,276
幫西蒙
You help Simon.

713
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,375
克拉蕾！
Clary!

714
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,046
抓住！
Hold on!

715
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,298
克拉蕾！
Clary!

716
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,019
謝謝
Thank you.

717
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,899
你救了西蒙
For saving Simon.

718
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,499
- 還好嗎？  - 我沒事，我沒事
- Are you okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay.

719
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,936
克拉蕾
Clary.

720
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,731
能和你談談嗎？
Can I talk to you?

721
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,525
行，我正要去看西蒙
Yeah, I was just gonna go see Simon.

722
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:16,238
- 我希望你離開這兒  - 什麼？
- I want you to leave here. - What?

723
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:17,740
你差點讓我們送死
You almost got us killed.

724
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,409
對不起，我們別無選擇
I'm sorry, we didn't have a choice.

725
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,036
要救西蒙，而傑斯…
I mean, we had to save Simon, and Jace...

726
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,204
傑斯應該拯救世界
Jace thinks he needs to save the world.

727
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,750
但你沒鼓勵他這麼做
But you don't need to encourage him to do it.

728
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,800
這就是你們要做的
But that's what you guys do.

729
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:32,671
對，我們　要做的
Yes, us. What we do.

730
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,090
我們是團隊，你是累贅
We're a team, you're deadweight.

731
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,302
- 凡人  - 我不是凡人
- A mundane. - I'm not a mundane.

732
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,535
你要是表現得有半點勇敢
And if you were half as brave as you pretend to be,

733
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:42,306
就得承認…
you'd admit that...

734
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,724
什麼？
What?

735
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,886
你承認你愛上了傑斯
You'd admit that you're in love with Jace,

736
01:00:45,886 --> 01:00:47,353
這才是千真萬確的
and that's what this is really about.

737
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:52,066
你敢再這樣說一下…
If you ever say anything like that again...

738
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,027
我定殺死你
I'll kill you.

739
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,806
- 我暈了多久？  - 一整天
- How long was I out? - All day.

740
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,391
你的眼鏡
Found your glasses.

741
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,434
- 有一邊鏡片裂了  - 嗯
- One of the lenses cracked. - Yeah.

742
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:38,195
好神奇
How weird.

743
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,908
我似乎不需要它了
I don't seem to need them anymore.

744
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:48,539
那你在畫什麼？
So, what are you drawing?

745
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,208
沒什麼
Nothing.

746
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,387
- 你還好嗎？  - 還好
- You okay?     - Yeah.

747
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,805
這太瘋狂了
It was crazy.

748
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,811
對不起之前我不相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you before.

749
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,396
現在我信了
Now I get it.

750
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,649
還有…
And...

751
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,403
當時我昏倒了
And I must have passed out,

752
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,655
接著你就出現
and then you showed up.

753
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,116
聽著
Listen,

754
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,703
我知道我總是那個要被依賴的人
I know I've always been the one who needed you

755
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,121
比起你依賴我來
more than you needed me.

756
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,748
- 不是真的  - 是真的
- That's not true. - Yes, it is,

757
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,332
但我不在乎
but I never cared.

758
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,676
我只有媽媽，盧克和你了
I've only ever had my mom, Luke and you.

759
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:46,430
別亂想你對我來說不重要
Don't ever imagine that you weren't important to me.

760
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,099
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay.   - Okay.

761
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,603
你跟鋼琴有仇嗎？
What did that piano ever do to you?

762
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,064
好像失去唯一真愛一樣
You play it like you've lost your only love.

763
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,817
不幸的是我唯一真愛就是自己
Unfortunately, my one true love remains myself.

764
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,652
至少你不用愁遭拒絕
Well, at least you don't have to worry about rejection.

765
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,591
那也不一定
Not necessarily.

766
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,614
我有時會自我分裂，尋求刺激
I turn myself down occasionally just to keep it interesting.

767
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,658
你彈得很有熱情
You do play that with a lot of passion.

768
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,919
這才有問題
Well, that's the problem.

769
01:03:48,919 --> 01:03:50,369
我不該投入太多感情
I play it with too much emotion.

770
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,696
本應該只是簡單地音符重現
It's supposed to be played with a simple representation of notes,

771
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,581
而不是詮釋
no interpretation.

772
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,754
音樂就該有感情
Music is supposed to have emotion.

773
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:06,844
邪靈對交錯的音調才有反應
Demons react to certain frequencies when two tones cross.

774
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,137
才能使他們癲狂
Drives them crazy.

775
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,310
看，巴赫發現這點並構建了一個體系
See, Bach discovered this and put it into a system using

776
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:18,188
用數字序列融合音調
a mathematical progression of tonal combinations

777
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,107
可以顯現邪靈
that allows us to expose demons.

778
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,864
那巴赫也是個暗影獵人咯？
So Bach was a Shadowhunter?

779
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,991
- 是的  - 這麼說…
- Yes.        - So...

780
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:34,204
巴赫對於邪靈們就像大蒜對於吸血鬼
Bach is to demons what garlic is to vampires.

781
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,623
也對吧
Kind of.

782
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,709
我是說：大蒜會被用盡
I mean, you can run out of garlic.

783
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,627
但音樂卻無止境
You can't really run out of music.

784
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:46,633
那堜騊菃A的玩意嗎？
Is that where you keep all your toys?

785
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,970
有趣得多
It's way more fun.

786
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:51,597
來吧
Come on.

787
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,348
這是穿梭門
It's a portal.

788
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,684
像百慕大一樣的自然現象
Like the Bermuda Triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.

789
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,644
神院圍繞它而建
The Institute was built around it.

790
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,315
據說神院是紐約最早的建築
Some say that the Institute was the first building in New York.

791
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:03,775
所以它…
So it's...

792
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:06,194
空間不都只是直線型的
Dimensions aren't all just straight lines.

793
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,905
也會有彎曲
There's bends,

794
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:09,573
折疊，凹角
folds and nooks.

795
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,868
有點難以解釋，不過
It's a little bit difficult to explain, but

796
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:16,663
穿梭門能帶你到任何你想去的地方
the Portal can take you wherever you want to go in this dimension.

797
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,001
一旦穿過表面
So, as soon as you break that surface,

798
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,503
你就會被送到你心底最深處
you're transported to wherever your deepest thoughts lie.

799
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,630
那意味著…
So that means...

800
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,423
- 我媽媽…  - 等下
- My mom... - Wait.

801
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,927
我們訓練一生才懂得使用它
We spend our entire lives training how to use it,

802
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,512
進入前要先想像一下所去之處
visualizing where it will take us before we step into it,

803
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,932
那必須要非常集中精力
and that takes incredible focus.

804
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,104
如果沒有經過正確訓練而進入的話
If you were to step into it without the proper training,

805
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,966
你將永無安定
you could end up in limbo,

806
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,942
永生困在記憶之中
lost in your own mind forever.

807
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,237
這兒
Here.

808
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,114
我做給你看
Let me show you.

809
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,491
快點
Come on.

810
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:56,536
別偷看
No peeking.

811
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,075
很酷吧，對吧？
Pretty cool, isn't it?

812
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,577
現在…
Now...

813
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:40,789
你和我…
You and I...

814
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,958
要慶祝你的生日
Have a birthday to celebrate.

815
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,376
你怎麼知道？
How did you know?

816
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,170
我之前找你，就查到過
Research. When I was trying to find you.

817
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,635
不會有人來這兒
No one comes up here anymore.

818
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,429
這媊搣顜畯
We have the place to ourselves.

819
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,390
美得窒息了
This is breathtaking.

820
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,830
抱歉，沒有蛋糕
Sorry there's no cake.

821
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,166
我原本就沒期望
Well, I was expecting nothing,

822
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,917
這已很棒了
so this is great.

823
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,504
不過，每個人都該在生日那天得到些什麼
Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.

824
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,677
你生日得到什麼？
What did you get?

825
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,763
大多數是武器
Weapons mostly.

826
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,891
希望沒讓你吃驚
I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.

827
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,809
現在沒有什麼會讓我吃驚
At this point, nothing really does.

828
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,231
當我九歲時…
When I was nine...

829
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,318
我父親送了我一隻隼
My father gave me a falcon.

830
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,278
他要我讓它聽話
He told me to make it obedient.

831
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,489
我本該弄瞎那隻鳥
I was supposed to keep the bird blind,

832
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,657
但我做不到
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

833
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,747
相反的是，我撫摸它的翅膀
Instead, I touched and stroked its wings

834
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:01,828
直到它信任我
until it trusted me.

835
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,081
我以為完美地馴服了它
I tamed it to perfection.

836
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,763
我把它帶給父親
I took it to my father,

837
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,628
希望父親為我所做的感到驕傲
expecting him to be proud of what I'd done.

838
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,755
他說：
He said,

839
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,091
「我是要你讓他聽話」
"I told you to make it obedient.

840
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,052
「不是要你教它愛你」
"Instead, you taught it to love you.

841
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,304
「你沒有馴服它，你毀了它」
"You didn't tame it, you broke it."

842
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,974
他帶走鳥，並割了它的脖子
Then he took the bird and he broke its neck.

843
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,937
我當時哭了整整一夜，此後再沒哭過
I cried all night and I never cried again.

844
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,272
你原諒他嗎？
Did you ever forgive him?

845
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,692
他這麼做是要我強大
He did it to make me stronger.

846
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,741
那是你名字維蘭德的意義嗎？
Does that stand for Wayland?

847
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,833
午夜
Midnight.

848
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,793
瞧瞧這些
Watch this.

849
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,438
一個女孩說要一顆大寶石
When a girl says she wants a big rock,

850
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:12,774
但她並非就是這個意思
she doesn't literally mean a big rock.

851
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:15,610
每個暗影獵人都有屬於自己的魔石
Every Shadowhunter should have their own witchlight.

852
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,163
有人在
We have company.

853
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,915
那只是霍奇的鳥
That's Hodge's bird.

854
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,044
我們得走了
We should probably go.

855
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,504
是啊
Yeah.

856
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:18,798
我們真得走了
We should definitely go.

857
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,945
抱歉忘記告訴你會定時噴水
Sorry about the sprinkler system.

858
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,655
別提它了
I forgot about that.

859
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,284
要去睡了嗎？
You going to sleep?

860
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:47,827
累了嗎？
Well, aren't you tired?

861
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,996
我從沒這樣清醒
I've never been more awake.

862
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,171
- 西蒙，我以為你…  - 睡了？
- Simon, I thought you were... - Asleep?

863
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,506
之前是的
Yeah, I was.

864
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,132
我們只不過…
We were just...

865
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,658
下次，最好是
Next time, it might be a nice idea

866
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,761
你得說你已經有個男人在床上
to mention that you already have a man in your bed,

867
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,513
我們才不會這麼尷尬了
so we can avoid such uncomfortable situations.

868
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,558
你讓他到你床上？
You invited him to bed?

869
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:08,890
我知道這挺荒唐的，是不是？
I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

870
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,183
不可能一切合心意
We would never have all fit.

871
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,143
我沒有讓他到我床上
I didn't invite him into bed.

872
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:14,020
只是接吻而已
We were just kissing.

873
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,274
你太快丟掉我倆的愛了
How swiftly you dismiss our love.

874
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,858
傑斯…
Jace...

875
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,652
西蒙，很晚了，對不起吵醒你
Simon, it's late, and I'm sorry we woke you.

876
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,028
我也是
So am I.

877
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,511
去吧，去找他，去向他道歉
Go ahead. Go after him, go apologize to him,

878
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:28,827
去跟他說他才是特別的
go tell him just how special he really is.

879
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,745
- 別這樣！  - 哪樣了？
- Stop acting like that! - Like what?

880
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:32,151
好像你沒受傷一樣
Like nothing ever hurts you.

881
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,494
嗯，也許你應該想清楚的
Well, maybe you should have thought about that

882
01:11:34,494 --> 01:11:35,542
在你親我之前
before you kissed me.

883
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,960
是我親你？
I kissed you?

884
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,380
別擔心，這對我也沒什麼了不起
Don't worry, it wasn't that special for me either.

885
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,138
西蒙，真的很抱歉，我還以為你在…
I'm really sorry, Simon, but weren't you just in the...

886
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,889
我只是在找你
I was just looking for you.

887
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,309
- 你要去哪兒？  - 回家
- Where are you going? - Home.

888
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,227
顯然我在這太久，不受歡迎了
It's clear I overstayed my welcome.

889
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,604
對不起，這對我也太突然了
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It wasn't like it was planned.

890
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,232
但就是發生了，拜託
Let me guess, it just happened. Please.

891
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,984
聽著，我知道你不喜歡他，但是…
Look, I know you don't like him, but...

892
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,236
其實我恨他
Actually, I hate the guy.

893
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,738
為什麼？
Why?

894
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,114
我以為你不至於愛上他
I thought you were better than that.

895
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,949
那這又說明什麼？
What's that supposed to mean?

896
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,369
我才是一直等你的人，不是他
I'm the one who's always been there for you, not him.

897
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,547
我早愛上你了
I'm in love with you.

898
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,977
不過顯然你沒有同感
And it's clear that you don't feel the same way.

899
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,272
- 這…  - 不
- It's... - Don't.

900
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,483
沒什麼好說了
There's nothing to say.

901
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,488
還有，克拉蕾
And, Clary,

902
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,740
他只是利用你獲得聖盃
he's just using you to get the Cup.

903
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:55,997
西蒙…
Simon...

904
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,490
你母親也能這麼做
Your mother was the only other person who could do that.

905
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,409
但我之前從沒這麼做過
But I've never been able to do this before.

906
01:14:57,202 --> 01:15:00,663
說明封印住的不僅是你的回憶
Apparently the block wasn't just repressing your memories,

907
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:02,624
還有你的能力
but your abilities as well.

908
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,063
- 傑斯，我…  - 別跟我說
- Jace, I... - Don't tell me.

909
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,815
你急需一個裸模來畫畫
You have a drawing emergency and you need a nude model.

910
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,151
- 沒那個心情  - 聽著！
- I'm not in the mood. - Listen!

911
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:33,112
我知道我媽媽將聖盃藏哪兒了
I know where my mom hid the Cup.

912
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,377
克拉蕾…
Clary...

913
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,420
你看上去很不同
Wow, you look different.

914
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,673
嗯，這只是我借來的
Yeah, it's just something I borrowed.

915
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,885
我是說，你穿得很漂亮
I mean, nice outfit. It's good.

916
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,804
好吧，現在我沒空聊 抱歉
Yeah, I can't talk now. Sorry.

917
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,870
（西蒙，克拉蕾剛進她家）

918
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,755
- 克拉蕾  - 我來拿塔羅牌
- Clary. - I came for the tarot cards.

919
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,382
- 為什麼？  - 我需要他們
- Why?          - I need them.

920
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,426
你懂的，就是我媽媽畫的那些？
You know, the ones that Mom painted?

921
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,646
我就想快點看看
I just need to look at them really quickly,

922
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:40,346
然後就還你，我發誓
and I'll give them back, I promise.

923
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,348
武器別帶進來
Those can't come in here.

924
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,517
這是和平之地
This is a peaceful house.

925
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,686
放那兒
Put them in there.

926
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,526
今天感覺怎麼樣？
How are you feeling today?

927
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,199
很好，很好
Fine. Just fine.

928
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:10,019
小伙子，走調了
Young man, that piano is out of tune.

929
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,064
拜託別彈了
Please don't.

930
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,744
小伙子
Young man.

931
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,624
別彈！
Stop!

932
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:44,971
那首曲
That song.

933
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,391
不是我的最愛
Not one of my favorites.

934
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,789
停下來！
Stop!

935
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:13,750
拿來看看
Let's have a look.

936
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:04,550
快跑！
Get out!

937
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,322
你好，多蘿西夫人
Hey, Madame Dorothea.

938
01:20:38,322 --> 01:20:39,752
有看見克拉蕾嗎？
Have you seen Clary?

939
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,671
我剛收到短信說她在這兒
I just got a text that said she was here.

940
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,005
沒有
No.

941
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,924
好吧，我只是…
Okay. Well, I'll just...

942
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:46,509
西蒙！
Simon!

943
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,928
西蒙！
Simon!

944
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,013
西蒙！
Simon!

945
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:53,099
西蒙，這不是真的她！
Simon, it's not really her!

946
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:55,685
西蒙！
Simon!

947
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,104
西蒙！
Simon!

948
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,777
我來照顧他
I'll take care of him.

949
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:06,946
西蒙！
Simon!

950
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,906
她拿走了聖盃！
She's got the Cup!

951
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:23,921
西蒙！
Simon!

952
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:11,636
對不起
I'm sorry.

953
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:13,429
對不起
I'm sorry.

954
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,026
傑斯！
Jace!

955
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,199
圖符不起作用
The runes aren't working.

956
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:40,831
西蒙，跟著我
Simon, you follow me.

957
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,549
把他們切碎
You cut these up.

958
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,409
不要 夠了
Don't. You've done enough.

959
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:56,472
別這樣對她 這不是她的錯
Don't talk to her like that. This isn't her fault.

960
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,432
- 不，你說的對，是你的錯  - 伊莎貝爾！
- No, you're right. This is your fault. - Isabelle!

961
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,393
亞力克一直都告誡你你會受傷
Alec kept telling you that you were going to get hurt.

962
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,288
你會讓我們都受傷
You were going to get us all hurt.

963
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:03,479
現在他卻快死了
Now he's the one dying.

964
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,939
我們需要找到聖盃
Well, we needed to get the Mortal Cup.

965
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,461
但還有別的辦法
But there were other ways to do it

966
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:07,984
沒必要為此傷害你的摯友
than getting your best friend killed.

967
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,904
去找霍奇
Why don't you go get Hodge.

968
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,241
我從沒想讓亞力克這樣
I never wanted anything to happen to Alec.

969
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,742
對不起
I'm sorry.

970
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:24,208
我們同意一起做的，我們一個團隊
We agreed to do this together. We're a team.

971
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,711
有了克拉蕾，我們就不是一個團隊了
Since Clary got here, we haven't been a team.

972
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:32,717
霍奇
Hodge!

973
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:34,677
霍奇
Hodge!

974
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,013
亞力克受傷了
Alec's getting worse.

975
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:38,264
我知道
I know.

976
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,308
我已經叫人來了
I've already sent for someone.

977
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,729
你得到聖盃了嗎？
Did you get the Cup?

978
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,795
然後呢？
What now?

979
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,093
霍奇？
Hodge?

980
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,061
你根本不知道
You have no idea what it's like

981
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:27,646
克拉夫的詛咒是什麼滋味
living with the Clave's curse,

982
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,483
不能從這兒踏出一步
unable to set so much as a foot outside,

983
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,819
連開窗戶都害怕
afraid to even open a window.

984
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,741
克拉蕾，別太怪我
Try not to judge me too harshly, Clary.

985
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,169
霍奇，你要做什麼？
Hodge, what have you done?

986
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,278
我知道你終將把聖盃給我
I always knew you would bring me the Cup.

987
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,114
只是時間問題而已
It was only a matter of time.

988
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,993
我媽媽在哪兒？
Where is she?

989
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,955
她很好
She's fine.

990
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,169
你得到了想要的，現在放她走
You got what you want. Now let her go.

991
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:34,839
我得看看這是不是真的
I have to make sure you gave me the real one.

992
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,885
每個人為了聖盃都會不擇手段
Everybody wants the Cup for the wrong reason.

993
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:43,973
那你沒有嗎？
And you don't?

994
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,432
擁有它
With this Cup,

995
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,144
我才能淨化我的血統
I can cleanse our bloodlines,

996
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,312
拯救我們的種族
Save our race.

997
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:53,983
你也許不太瞭解人類歷史
You might not know much about mundane history,

998
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:58,002
聽著，當人們談論保護種族時
but I can tell you when people start talking about preserving a race,

999
01:25:58,002 --> 01:25:59,071
從沒好事發生
it never goes well.

1000
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:03,909
這就是為何我媽媽要用一生時間隱瞞你
That's why my mom spent her whole life hiding it from you.

1001
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,244
不
No.

1002
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:08,581
她不是要藏聖盃
She wasn't hiding the Cup.

1003
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,833
她是要藏著你
She was hiding you.

1004
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:13,961
喝下去
Drink.

1005
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,921
我不會喝的
I'm not gonna drink that.

1006
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:17,423
你為什麼這麼害怕？
Why are you so afraid?

1007
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:20,176
你還沒出生就已經喝過它了
You've been drinking this since before you were born.

1008
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:23,345
我在你媽媽懷孕時就給她喝過
I fed it to your mother while you were in her womb.

1009
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:27,516
快點，克拉蕾
Come on, Clary.

1010
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,351
你現在應該猜到
You must have guessed by now.

1011
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,020
你所有神奇的天賦
All these amazing talents

1012
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,689
都是你母親一直想要壓制的
that your mother so desperately tried to suppress,

1013
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,774
你覺得它從何而來？
where do you think they came from?

1014
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,612
你是我女兒
You're my daughter.

1015
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,324
我的血液流淌在你的身上
My blood runs in your veins.

1016
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:45,284
現在…
Now...

1017
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:47,536
喝
Drink.

1018
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,041
快喝！
Drink!

1019
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,803
把它拿出來！
Take that out!

1020
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,020
不！
No!

1021
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,909
有人進入穿梭門了
Someone just went through the Portal.

1022
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,661
我去看看
I'll go check.

1023
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:04,965
抱歉
Sorry.

1024
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,342
我有點太激動了
I got a bit carried away.

1025
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:07,634
盧克，你是…
Luke, you're a...

1026
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,304
克拉蕾，聽我說，聽著 別害怕
Clary, listen to me, listen. Don't be afraid.

1027
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:11,722
- 聽著，好嗎？  - 別碰我！
- Listen, right? - Don't touch me!

1028
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:14,308
嘿，別這樣
Hey, there's no need for that.

1029
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,268
那東西還會回來
That thing will be back.

1030
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,229
這兒不安全
We are not safe out here.

1031
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:24,693
我跳進穿梭門，為了躲瓦倫丁
I jumped through the Portal to get away from Valentine.

1032
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,029
我以為會到我媽媽那兒
I thought I'd end up with my mom.

1033
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:34,203
但是我卻到了最不想來的地方
Instead, I ended up in the last place I wanted to be.

1034
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,122
聽著，穿梭門帶你來
Listen, the Portal brought you here

1035
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,375
說明你一定想到我了
because you must have been thinking of me.

1036
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,377
你內心深處仍信任我
Deep inside, you know you can trust me.

1037
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,731
你說過一點都不在乎
You said you couldn't care

1038
01:29:42,731 --> 01:29:44,380
我們發生什麼事情
less what happened to either of us.

1039
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,090
你跟別人一樣，只是想要聖盃
You just want the Cup, like everyone else.

1040
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:48,133
我說過要保護你，我還能怎麼做？
I said that to protect you. What else could I do?

1041
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,511
這次我得一直照看你
Been keeping an eye on you this whole time.

1042
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,229
在旅店那兒的是你
That was you at the hotel.

1043
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,066
話說投的好啊
Good throw, by the way.

1044
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,030
我怎麼辦？
What about me?

1045
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,490
你怎麼辦？
What about you?

1046
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,866
我們說好的
We had a deal.

1047
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,327
我仍然沒得到聖盃，不是嗎？
Well, I still don't have my Cup, do I?

1048
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,252
我一直信守諾言
I held up my end of the bargain.

1049
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,588
不，你沒有
No, you didn't.

1050
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,757
我把聖盃給你了
I gave you the Cup.

1051
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,343
是你給克拉蕾的 不是我的錯
You handed it to Clary. That's not my fault.

1052
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,553
幫我解咒
Now lift it.

1053
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:37,516
聽著，這都是你腦子想的
Listen, it's all in your head.

1054
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,351
不，不！
No. No!

1055
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,897
有詛咒
There's a spell.

1056
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,024
真的？詛咒？
Really? A spell?

1057
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,027
這只是問題的借口
That's just an excuse for a real problem

1058
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:50,696
在這兒
in there.

1059
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:54,324
你以為我真的可以解決嗎？
Do you really think I can fix that?

1060
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,952
我給你聖盃了，你幫我帶走恐懼
I give you the Cup, you take away the fear.

1061
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:03,750
沒有聖盃我也一樣寸步難行
Without the Cup, I'm as stuck as you are.

1062
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,712
我的恐懼才是真的
Except my fear is real.

1063
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,672
每個地下生物
Every Downworlder,

1064
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,507
每個守護者
every member of the Clave,

1065
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:13,302
每個暗影獵人都在穿梭門另一側
every Shadowhunter on both sides of the Portal

1066
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,137
找我
is looking for me right now.

1067
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,514
我才需要一切幫助
I'm going to need all the help I can get.

1068
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,101
瓦倫丁，你不必這樣的
You don't have to go through with this, Valentine.

1069
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:24,188
邪靈從來沒到過神院
A demon has never set foot in the Institute.

1070
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,274
現在是時候讓他們來了
Well, maybe it's time they did.

1071
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,323
我等這等好多年了
I've been waiting all these years to do this.

1072
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,327
我別無選擇
Clary's given me no choice.

1073
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:43,123
她會回來的
She'll come back.

1074
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,043
真的嗎？
Really?

1075
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:48,420
你敢確定？
And what makes you so sure?

1076
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:51,423
這兒有她需要的人，像她需要她媽媽一樣
There's someone here she wants as much as her mother.

1077
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:54,069
你可以騙他們
If you lie and tell them

1078
01:31:54,069 --> 01:31:56,386
說他們都是你的孩子
they're both your children,

1079
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,597
你這樣就能讓他們心碎
you'll break their hearts.

1080
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,265
那又怎麼樣？
What can I say?

1081
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,643
心碎的人最聽話
The broken make the best followers.

1082
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,728
看看你
Look at you.

1083
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:08,106
愛就是滅亡
To love is to destroy.

1084
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,747
霍奇到底在哪堙H
Where the hell is Hodge?

1085
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,541
我們沒多少時間了
We don't have much time.

1086
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:11,795
- 這弄對了嗎？  - 不
- Does this look right to you? - No.

1087
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:15,674
快看
Hey, look.

1088
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:20,012
馬格努斯？
Magnus?

1089
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:25,350
我需要這些，要很多
I'm going to need all of this. Lots of it.

1090
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,854
拿著
Take this.

1091
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,222
封鎖此地
Lock this place down.

1092
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,976
殺死一切異族
Those who are not allies must be killed.

1093
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,993
別動 它們
Don't do that!

1094
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:27,996
瓦倫丁
Valentine.

1095
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:29,998
喬納森
Jonathan.

1096
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,710
你怎麼知道我的真名？
How do you know my real name?

1097
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,213
沒人這樣叫過我
Nobody calls me that.

1098
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,674
是真的嗎？
Is it true?

1099
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,927
瓦倫丁是我父親？
Is Valentine my father?

1100
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,519
他曾是個好人
You know, he was a great man,

1101
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,104
在和守護者衝突之前
until his conflict with the Clave.

1102
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:54,356
但你媽媽偷走聖盃後
But when your mother ran away with the Cup,

1103
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,609
他害怕遭守護者懲罰
he was just so afraid of retribution from the Clave,

1104
01:34:57,693 --> 01:34:59,945
他燒燬了住處
he burned their house down to the ground.

1105
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:05,409
他要世人相信他死了
He wanted the world to believe he was dead.

1106
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:09,538
我們在灰燼塈鋮鴗@個男人
In the ashes, we found the remains of a man

1107
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,707
和小孩
and a child.

1108
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:13,458
等等，一個小孩？
Wait a second, there was a child?

1109
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,627
瓦倫丁怒火中燒
Valentine was so enraged, he wanted her to believe

1110
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:18,213
他想要她相信他和他兒子都死了
he killed himself and their son,

1111
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,382
你的哥哥
your brother.

1112
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:22,884
我有個哥哥？
I have a brother?

1113
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:30,016
喬納森·克奡策咱情P摩根斯坦
Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern.

1114
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,644
你撒謊
You're lying.

1115
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,522
我姓名是傑斯·維蘭德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1116
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,150
我是維蘭德家族的
And my family are the Waylands.

1117
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:43,321
你以為只有克拉蕾被封存了記憶嗎？
You think Clary is the only one with a block in her mind?

1118
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:46,241
讓你看看什麼是真相
Let me show you the truth.

1119
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:53,415
你沒有馴服它，你毀了它
You didn't tame him. You broke him.

1120
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:55,751
不！你…
No! You...

1121
01:35:57,461 --> 01:35:59,463
你不是我父親
You are not my father.

1122
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:04,259
我來是要讓你知道自己到底是誰
I came back to help you understand who you really are.

1123
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:07,512
我懂你在這不開心
I know you're unhappy here.

1124
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,431
要守很多規矩
Plagued by rules.

1125
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:15,353
你的名字輩分僅次於我
Your place is next to me.

1126
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:18,106
你是摩根斯坦家族一員
You're a Morgenstern.

1127
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:20,859
你是我兒子
And you're my son.

1128
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,707
我叫傑斯·維蘭德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1129
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:40,545
我是維蘭德家族的
I'm a Wayland.

1130
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:43,298
抱歉告訴你這個消息
Sorry to break this to you,

1131
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,675
但也是時候該知道了
but it's time you heard the truth.

1132
01:36:45,926 --> 01:36:46,927
不
Don't.

1133
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,432
只是理解方式的問題
It's all a matter of perception.

1134
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:57,062
看到了嗎？摩根斯坦
You see, Morgenstern.

1135
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,377
- 拿著  - 好
- Take this. - Okay.

1136
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:21,920
好
Okay.

1137
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,641
伊莎貝爾
Isabelle.

1138
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:53,743
克拉蕾？
Clary?

1139
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:54,995
我們找到你媽媽了
Yeah, we found your mom.

1140
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,496
他們找到她了
They found her.

1141
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,456
在神院
She's at the Institute.

1142
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,044
阿拉塈J
Alaric.

1143
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,005
我是盧克，你看到了嗎？
It's Luke. Can you see it?

1144
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,590
是的，我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1145
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,218
兄弟們，得走了
Hey, guys, we have to go.

1146
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:11,803
盧克需要咱們
Luke needs us.

1147
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,430
我們去哪？
Where are we headed?

1148
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:14,556
神院
The Institute.

1149
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,391
我們這是在破壞協議
We'd be breaking the accords.

1150
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,268
不變身就沒關係
Not if we stay human.

1151
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:20,228
走，兄弟們！
Let's go, guys!

1152
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:21,605
快走，快走！
Go, go, go, go!

1153
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:22,939
快，動起來！
Come on, move it!

1154
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,366
準備就緒！
Ready to go!

1155
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,492
一切聽指揮
They've all been briefed.

1156
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,870
他是阿拉塈J，我們的人
This is Alaric. He's one of us.

1157
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,918
走吧
Go ahead.

1158
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,670
如果需要可以將頭伸出窗外
You can hang your head out the window if you need to.

1159
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:47,672
我是狼人
I'm a werewolf

1160
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:49,674
不是金毛犬
not a golden retriever.

1161
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,847
西蒙！
Simon!

1162
01:38:59,017 --> 01:38:59,976
在這等，我會回來
Just wait here, I'll be back.

1163
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,270
啥？不 伊莎貝爾，我不能…
What? No. Isabelle, I can't just...

1164
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,022
不，伊莎貝爾！
No. Isabelle!

1165
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,028
回來，伊莎貝爾，你去哪？
Come on, Isabelle, where are you?

1166
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:16,451
好，上！
All right, move it!

1167
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,203
快點，上！
Come on, move it!

1168
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,628
好吧
All right.

1169
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:29,214
狼人來救我們了
The werewolves are here to save us.

1170
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,675
難以置信我這麼說
Never thought I'd say that.

1171
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,932
伊莎貝爾
Finally! Isabelle.

1172
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,811
打開
Hey, open up the door.

1173
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:15,010
起作用了
It looks like he's responding.

1174
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,594
他能挺過來
He'll survive.

1175
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,058
小心
And be careful.

1176
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:26,104
有人入侵
You're being invaded.

1177
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,945
召集所有邪靈…
Summoning all these bloody demons...

1178
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,643
跑！
Run!

1179
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:15,320
快跑！
Run!

1180
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:18,323
- 走哪堙H  - 那有另一個出口！
- Where are we going? - There's another exit!

1181
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,867
等等
Wait.

1182
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,091
伊莎貝爾！
Isabelle!

1183
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:39,177
- 我差點殺死你了  - 是啊
- I almost killed you. - Yeah.

1184
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:41,346
你還好嗎？
You okay?

1185
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,389
- 沒事，我沒事  - 來吧
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - Come on.

1186
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:44,766
這破地方全是邪靈
This place is full of demons.

1187
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,518
這不可能
That's impossible.

1188
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,228
神院是聖地
The Institute is hallowed ground.

1189
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:50,772
他們還不知情
Yeah, no one seems to have told them that.

1190
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,191
肯定有內鬼放他們進來
Someone on the inside must have let them in.

1191
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:02,075
原是救援行動
This is a rescue mission.

1192
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,244
我們可沒裝備作戰
We are not equipped to fight demons.

1193
01:42:15,672 --> 01:42:17,423
- 分開！  - 這邊！這邊！
- Spread out! - That way! That way!

1194
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:20,844
後退！快！
Move back! Come on!

1195
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,236
阿拉塈J，我們需要支援！
We could use some help here, Alaric!

1196
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,906
阿拉塈J！
Alaric!

1197
01:42:44,576 --> 01:42:46,578
振作點，這肯定還有別的出入，是吧？
Come on, there must be some other way out of here, right?

1198
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:47,871
不，這堥S有，西蒙！
No, there isn't, Simon!

1199
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,122
我們撐不了多久！
We can't hold them much longer!

1200
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:39,464
讓開
Step away.

1201
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:42,800
讓開！
Step away!

1202
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:15,750
克拉蕾，這是什麼圖符？
Clary, which rune is that?

1203
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:17,919
我也不知道，它是…
I don't know, it's just...

1204
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,754
- 我從沒見過  - 真的嗎？
- I've never seen it before. - Really?

1205
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:21,172
不在書上
It's not in the book.

1206
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,261
它在消退
It's fading.

1207
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,451
肯定有地方放他們進來
Here, they're coming in through somewhere.

1208
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:52,412
我得去阻止他們
I'm going to stop them.

1209
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:57,500
快點
Come on.

1210
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:58,751
你們現走
You guys go.

1211
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:00,461
我們墊後
We'll catch up.

1212
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:29,157
不！
No!

1213
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:50,428
他們從屋頂下來的，跟上
They're coming from the dome. Come on.

1214
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,442
喬絲琳
Jocelyn,

1215
01:46:05,485 --> 01:46:07,445
我一直惦記你
you never left my heart.

1216
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,947
我現在帶你回家
I've come to take you home.

1217
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:14,535
她哪兒也不去
She's not going anywhere.

1218
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,498
你怎麼上來的
How did you get up here?

1219
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:26,297
你比我想像的更強大
You're even more powerful than I anticipated.

1220
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,299
離她遠點
Get away from her.

1221
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:35,223
幹嘛？
What the hell?

1222
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,100
聽他說
Just listen to what he has to say.

1223
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,686
不是你想的那樣
It's not what you think.

1224
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:44,941
終於…
Finally...

1225
01:46:46,651 --> 01:46:48,820
我的兩個孩子團聚了
Both my children together.

1226
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:51,239
我女兒
My daughter

1227
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,698
和我兒子
and my son.

1228
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:56,035
對不起，克拉蕾
I'm so sorry, Clary.

1229
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:59,372
我原先不知道
I didn't know.

1230
01:47:00,832 --> 01:47:02,500
瓦倫丁在撒謊
Valentine's lying.

1231
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,585
你是邁克爾·維蘭德的兒子
You're Michael Wayland's son.

1232
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:06,128
盧克說我哥哥已經死了
Luke said my brother is dead.

1233
01:47:06,128 --> 01:47:07,004
他死於火災
He died in a fire,

1234
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:09,173
他們在灰燼塈鋮鴠L遺骸
and they found his remains in the ashes.

1235
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,426
我帶喬納森一起逃跑的
I took Jonathan with me when I ran.

1236
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:14,303
那孩子遺骨是狼人所為
The bones were of a child killed by wolves.

1237
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:19,058
但願這不是真的
I wish it wasn't true.

1238
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:24,439
她不願意相信
She doesn't want to believe you

1239
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:29,277
因為她愛上你了，喬納森
because she is in love with you, Jonathan.

1240
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,654
我以為你叫傑斯
I thought your name was Jace.

1241
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:34,866
傑斯是小名
Jace is a nickname.

1242
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:41,581
喬納森·克奡策咱情K
Jonathan Christopher...

1243
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,334
J.C.

1244
01:47:48,254 --> 01:47:49,589
傑斯
Jace.

1245
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:28,753
把手在這
There's the lever.

1246
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,838
你進去，我阻止他們
You go close the dome and I'll hold them off.

1247
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:41,599
把聖盃拿出來，克拉蕾
Take out the Cup, Clary.

1248
01:48:46,312 --> 01:48:47,647
拿出聖盃！
Take out my Cup!

1249
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,232
我要你拿！
I want that Cup!

1250
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:50,942
你說過不傷害她！
You said you wouldn't hurt her!

1251
01:48:53,194 --> 01:48:54,195
夠了！
Enough!

1252
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,036
說夠了
That's enough.

1253
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:04,872
現在！
Now!

1254
01:49:10,378 --> 01:49:11,504
卡住了！
It's stuck!

1255
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:12,797
關掉它！
Close it!

1256
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,298
不行！
I can't!

1257
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,968
好像少了一塊！
I think there's a piece missing!

1258
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:24,725
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1259
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:46,372
我非常需要它
I really need this.

1260
01:50:10,021 --> 01:50:11,188
媽媽？
Mom?

1261
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:09,914
- 去找其他人  - 好
- Find the others. - All right.

1262
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:15,044
好吧，你是要上還是下呢？
All right, you want to take the upstairs or the down?

1263
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:19,715
我對底下不感冒
I'm not too crazy about the basement.

1264
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:28,140
我撐不了太久！
I can't hold them back any longer!

1265
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:31,936
西蒙，快點！
Simon, hurry!

1266
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,364
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1267
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,498
嗨，盧克先生
Hello, Mr. Garroway.

1268
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:55,960
看起來今天你很悲劇，嗯？
Looks like you're having a rough day, eh?

1269
01:51:56,794 --> 01:52:01,424
我覺得這種情況下直接殺了你
I guess the humane thing to do in this situation

1270
01:52:01,507 --> 01:52:03,592
會仁慈點
would be to put you down.

1271
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:05,761
你想看我變身嗎？
But you wanted to see me change.

1272
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:07,138
是的
I do.

1273
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:18,566
起來！
Get up!

1274
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:22,903
那麼，你到底要反抗到什麼時候？
So, boy, how far do you want to take this?

1275
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,866
到死為止
To the end.

1276
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,140
西蒙！
Simon!

1277
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,845
伊莎貝爾！
Isabelle!

1278
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:40,064
靠著我
Lean on me.

1279
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,667
出去！快！
Get out! Go on!

1280
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,335
離開這兒
Get out of here.

1281
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,589
快跑！
Come on!

1282
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:10,052
走！
Go!

1283
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:17,351
聽說你喜歡彈琴
Somebody told me that you like to play music.

1284
01:54:20,688 --> 01:54:22,398
歌德會為此驕傲的
Johann would be very proud.

1285
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:35,411
你該死在拉齊爾劍下
Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.

1286
01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:37,621
住手！
Stop!

1287
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:39,665
要麼我就丟了它！
Or I'll drop it!

1288
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,667
你不會那麼做的
You don't want to do that.

1289
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:43,627
克拉蕾，別給他
Don't give it to him, Clary.

1290
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:53,304
你先聽我說
I need you to listen to me.

1291
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:55,639
我是你爸爸
As your father,

1292
01:54:55,723 --> 01:54:57,349
我求你了
I'm begging you.

1293
01:55:03,272 --> 01:55:05,107
要是我爸爸就一定懂我
If you'd been a real dad,

1294
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:07,818
懂得聖盃在哪
you'd know me well enough to imagine where the Cup is,

1295
01:55:07,902 --> 01:55:10,529
知道我心底想的地方
where my deepest thoughts are taking it.

1296
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:14,617
你一點都不懂我
You don't know the first thing about me.

1297
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:17,328
你不是我爸…
You're not my dad...

1298
01:55:18,704 --> 01:55:20,539
永遠不是
And you never will be.

1299
01:55:20,623 --> 01:55:22,875
我保證你不會再見到我
I promise, you'll never have to see me again.

1300
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:30,633
克拉蕾，謝謝
Thank you, Clary.

1301
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:38,307
沒有聖盃，我們會輸的
Without this Cup, we are lost.

1302
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:40,517
不是「我們」
Not "we."

1303
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:43,854
是你
You.

1304
01:56:08,796 --> 01:56:09,964
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1305
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,177
- 不！抓住我！  - 決不！
- No! Don't let go! - Never!

1306
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:19,390
這兒！
Here!

1307
01:57:18,323 --> 01:57:19,783
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

1308
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:22,119
我不知道
I don't know.

1309
01:58:01,784 --> 01:58:04,411
我知道你之前為什麼那樣做了
I understand why you did what you did.

1310
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,332
我原諒你
And I forgive you.

1311
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:11,668
我要你知道
I want you to know,

1312
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:15,881
我會為你保密
your secret's safe with me.

1313
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:12,187
她怎麼樣了？
So, how's she doing?

1314
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,064
情況穩定了
Stable.

1315
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:16,775
醫生不知道她喝過什麼
The doctors don't know what she took,

1316
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:19,069
只能等
so we just have to wait.

1317
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:24,491
對不起
I'm sorry.

1318
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:26,535
我覺得我只是一個老古董
I guess I'm an old romantic.

1319
01:59:26,618 --> 01:59:28,829
我總希望當我向某人說
I always hoped that when I finally said

1320
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:32,082
「我愛你」時，她會說同樣的話
"I love you" to someone, she'd say the same thing back.

1321
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:34,334
那個人會的
And that someone will.

1322
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:35,752
但願吧
Yeah, I know.

1323
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:46,597
你很累了
Hey, you're tired.

1324
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,099
去休息吧，我們會照看好她
Go sleep, we'll take care of her.

1325
01:59:50,267 --> 01:59:51,768
好，抱一個
Yeah, come on.

1326
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,280
我喜歡你收拾這
I like what you've done with the place.

1327
02:00:45,364 --> 02:00:47,824
我只是耍了些把戲
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

1328
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:51,787
克拉蕾，我們真怕你不會回來了
Clary, we're afraid you're not coming back.

1329
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:54,915
只是現在跟你作伴真的很難
It's just really hard to be around you right now.

1330
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,000
對我來說也一樣
It's hard for me as well.

1331
02:00:58,335 --> 02:01:00,671
但是這不僅僅是我們
But this is about more than us.

1332
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:04,883
你有不可思議的天賦，我們需要你
You have an incredible gift, and we need you.

1333
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,346
我需要你
I need you.

1334
02:01:10,514 --> 02:01:12,182
我不知道
I just don't know.

1335
02:01:12,849 --> 02:01:15,018
還記得我說過從沒見過天使？
Remember when I said I'd never seen an angel?

1336
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:20,691
我撒謊了
Well, I lied.

1337
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:32,244
你是我見過最勇敢的凡人
You're still the bravest mundane I've ever met.

1338
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:38,375
我可不是凡人
I'm not a mundane.

1339
02:01:41,003 --> 02:01:42,170
等等，傑斯！
Wait, Jace!

1340
02:01:46,508 --> 02:01:47,759
慢慢來啊
You took your time.

1341
02:01:54,725 --> 02:01:56,643
你說過你需要我
You said you needed me.

1342
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:03,066
你該好好保存它
You should keep that safe.

1343
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:04,276
我會的
Yeah.

1344
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,612
我可以抱著你嗎…
Is it okay if I...

1345
02:02:08,572 --> 02:02:09,990
我能…
Do I...

1346
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:12,242
- 這樣可以嗎…  - 沒關係
- Is it okay if I... - Yeah.

1347
02:02:15,495 --> 02:02:17,748
聽著，克拉蕾，我不相信它
Look, Clary, I don't believe it.

1348
02:02:17,831 --> 02:02:19,541
這似乎不是真的，不在我的心
It doesn't feel like the truth, not in my heart.

1349
02:02:21,168 --> 02:02:24,254
我只是不懂如何去面對這個世界
I just don't know how to look at the world anymore.

1350
02:02:24,338 --> 02:02:27,132
我看不到街道，紅綠燈和車
I don't see streets and traffic lights and cars.

1351
02:02:27,215 --> 02:02:29,176
眼前只是邪靈和天使
I see demons and angels.

1352
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,136
一切都變了
Everything's different.

1353
02:02:31,219 --> 02:02:33,013
世界還是一樣的
The world's the same.

1354
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:36,224
你才是變了的那個
You're the one who's different.

1355
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:44,066
你還記得霍奇說的嗎？
Don't you remember what Hodge said?

1356
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:45,359
什麼？
What?

1357
02:02:45,442 --> 02:02:47,110
所以故事都是真的
All the stories are true.

1358
02:03:00,587 --> 02:03:03,158
感謝觀影
