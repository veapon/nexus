1
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,910
你在仔细看吗?
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,260
每一场魔术表演都有三个步骤
Every magic trick consists of three parts,or acts.

3
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,790
第一个步骤是"以虚代实"
The first part is called "the pledge."

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,190
魔术师秀出一个真实的东西
The magician shows you something ordinary.

5
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,700
一副牌  一只鸟或一个人
A deck of cards,a bird or a man.

6
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,740
让你看这样东西
He shows you this object.

7
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,900
叫你检视它
Perhaps he asks you to inspect it

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,710
看它的确是真的
to see that it is indeed real

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,010
平常的不得了
unaltered  normal.

10
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,230
但是  其中一定有假
But,of course,it probably isn't.

11
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,490
-你想去哪里? -我是表演的一部分  猪头
-Where do you think you're going? -I'm part of the bloody act you fool.

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,910
第二个步骤是"偷天换日"
The second act is called "the turn."

13
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,360
魔术师利用这个普通的东西
The magician takes the ordinary something

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,170
做出令人叹为观止的表演
and makes it do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,540
现在你很想找出秘诀 但是绝对找不到
Now you're looking for the secret,but you won't find it

16
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,010
因为你根本没有真正在看
because,of course,you're not really looking.

17
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,280
你并不是真的想知道
You don't really want to know.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,890
你想要被骗
You want to be...fooled.

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
但是你还不会鼓掌
But you wouldn't clap yet

20
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,290
因为把东西变不见还不够
because making something disappear isn't enough.

21
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,230
你必须把它变回来
You have to bring it back.

22
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,230
所以魔术都有第三个步骤
That's why every magic trick has a third act.

23
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,970
最难的部分
The hardest part.

24
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,980
我们称之为"化腐朽为神奇"
The part we call "the prestige."

25
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,890
化腐朽为神奇?  劳勃安杰 你的雇主丹顿大师
The prestige? And did Robert Angier,the Great Danton,your employer

26
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,690
那晚有完成表演吗?
get to that final part of his trick that night?

27
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,530
-并没有  出了状况 -出了什么状况?
-No sir. Something went wrong. -What went wrong?

28
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,330
我看到有个人跑到舞台下方
I saw someone making their way below stage.

29
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,230
我跟踪他
I followed him.

30
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,640
那是波登  眼睁睁看着安先生溺死
It was Borden,watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,040
柯特先生  请向陪审团说明你的职业
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury,Mr. Cutter.

32
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,310
我是机关师
I'm an ingueieur

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,850
设计魔术表演 打造需要的道具和机关
I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,010
柯先生
So Mr. Cutter

35
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,350
舞台下方的水箱
was this water-filled tank beneath the stage

36
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,290
也是这个魔术的道具吗?
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,590
不  那是...
No. The tank...

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,890
水箱是第一个表演用的 然后就被搬下台
was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage.

39
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,260
一定是波登把它移到机关门底下了
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,840
水箱有多大?
How large was this tank?

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,600
表演水底脱逃的一般大小 大约四五百加仑吧
It's a normal tank for escape under water about 400 or 500 gallons.

42
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,140
波登怎么能一个人移动水箱
How do you think he was able to move the tank

43
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,770
而没有让任何人发现?
under the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,710
他是魔术师  你去问他
He's a magician,ask him.

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,450
我要求你为我解释 安先生的魔术机关
I ask again would this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,110
真正的遁移术
The Real Transported Man

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,260
是这一行最抢手的魔术
is one of the most sought after illusions in this business.

48
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,920
出售秘诀的权利在我手中
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,690
如果被揭穿就不值钱了
If I reveal the method here,the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,890
我们怎么知道  水箱不只是单纯出错?
How can we know that the tank wasn't simply some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,730
我了解你的处境
Mr. Cutter I see your predicament.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,170
但是这攸关波登的生死
But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,480
如果你私底下向我透露细节
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,200
我就能对此案做出中肯的判决
I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,970
你能接受这种妥协吗?
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,560
麻烦你掏出口袋里的东西
I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,140
我不是故意找你碴
Not my idea sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year

58
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,300
典狱长看过他凭空消失的表演
where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,450
他觉得他会企图逃狱
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,120
我说他能逃走的唯一机会
I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear

61
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,450
就是和其它囚犯混在一起
is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

62
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,790
检查手铐的锁...
Check the locks...

63
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,630
检查两次
...twice.

64
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,680
我叫欧文
My name is Owens.

65
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,040
我是一名律师
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,850
代表卡德洛爵士 一位业余魔术师兼历史学家
I represent Lord Caldlow,an accomplished amateur magician and...

67
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,750
多少钱?
How much?

68
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,920
-卡爵士有兴趣...  -他出多少钱买我的魔术?
-He is interested... -How much for my tricks?

69
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,390
五千英镑
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,050
跟我的机关师法隆说钱归他
Talk to Fallon,my ingueieur. Money's for him.

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,860
我说了  他答应出售你的秘诀
Yes,I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,760
除了最值钱的遁移术外
All except the most valuable one,The Transported Man.

73
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,100
我绝不会出售我最伟大的魔术
Well I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,570
即使是为了你女儿?
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,940
如果报纸没料错...
If you are for the drop...

76
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,480
-你女儿就需要别人照顾 -法隆会照顾她
-your daughter is going to need looking after. -Fallon will take care of her.

77
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,050
伯纳法隆? 他这个人跟你一样神秘
Perfect,Fallon. A man with a past as obscure as your own.

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,850
法院一定会剥夺他的监护权
The courts have motioned she be removed from his care.

79
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,460
你女儿就会变成孤儿
She will be an orphan.

80
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,500
你应该对童工工厂很熟吧 会比监狱好吗?
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse. It's better than here?

81
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,690
我给你一个机会维护尊严
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

82
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,730
也给你女儿一个未来
I'm offering your daughter a future.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,530
她被卡爵士领养 保证要什么就有什么
As Lord Caldlow's ward,she will want for nothing ever.

84
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,630
好好考虑吧
Well. think it over.

85
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,780
爵士给你这本日记以表诚意
And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith.

86
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,320
也许你会有兴趣 这是劳勃安杰的日记
It might be of interest. Robert Angier's diary.

87
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,220
包括他在科罗拉多学会你的魔术
including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick.

88
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,950
-他没学会我的魔术 -真的吗?
-He never learned it. -Really?

89
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,580
他回来以后表演全新的遁移术
On his return,he mounted a version of The Transported Man

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,600
报纸说比你的原版更棒
that the papers said was better even than your original.

91
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,170
你想知道安杰的秘密 得把他从坟墓挖出来问
If you want Angier's secrets you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

92
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,270
我想要你的秘密  波登
I want your secret,Mr. Borden.

93
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,770
为你的女儿着想吧!
Consider your daughter.

94
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,360
字谜  一个大谜团
A cipher  An enigma...

95
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,560
寻找  我要寻找答案
a search  a search for answers.

96
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,600
就算科罗拉多是我的终点站
Even if Colorado is the end of my journey

97
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,470
要解开波登的谜要花更久的时间
it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets.

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,640
他笔记的密码只有一个字
See,the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word

99
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,620
但也得要花好几个月翻译 才能了解他的想法
but it will still take months to translate his writing. And to know his mind.

100
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,800
我的执着经得起这场考验
Well,my passion is equal to the task.

101
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,640
(科罗拉多泉镇)

102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,640
安先生?  欢迎光临泉镇
Mr. Angier? welcome to Colorado Springs.

103
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,260
-整座小镇都有供电吗? -是的
-The whole town has electricity. -Yes sir.

104
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
好隆重的欢迎
Well. quite a reception.

105
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,520
您是本季第一位客人  安先生
You're our first guest of the season,Mr. Angier.

106
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,060
您的电报没提到您会待多久
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.

107
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,750
能待多久就待多久
As long as it takes.

108
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,090
我明天需要马车载我上山
I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.

109
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,790
山顶关闭了  为了科学实验
Well  the peak's closed,sir. For scientific experimentation.

110
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,200
我知道  这就是我来的目的
Yes,I know. That's why I'm here.

111
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,820
先生  接下来您得自己走路了
You'll have to walk the rest,I'm afraid,sir.

112
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,830
(电击危险)

113
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,690
令人惊讶 你们记者都看不懂我的标志吗?
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.

114
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,590
看来我并不受欢迎
Not the welcome I was expecting.

115
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,600
我认得你
I know you.

116
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,140
你是魔术大师丹顿 我在伦敦看了你七场表演
You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London Seven times

117
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,620
你猜中观众口袋里的每样东西
You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.

118
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,150
我是艾利
I'm Alley.

119
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,790
围栏的事真抱歉  太多人来干扰
Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,490
-我来见泰斯拉 -为什么?
-I've come to see Tesla. -Why?

121
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,530
他为我的同行打造一架机器
He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.

122
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,190
-你能安排我们见面吗? -恐怕是不太可能
-Can you get me a meeting with him? -Impossible,I'm afraid.

123
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,530
我带了很多钱来
I've brought a lot of money.

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,230
很抱歉  安先生
I'm sorry,Mr. Angier.

125
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,270
我帮不上忙
I simply can't help.

126
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,740
我会一直待在旅馆
I'll be staying at the hotel,indefinitely.

127
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,810
我现在握着什么?
Hey,what am I holding?

128
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,990
你的怀表
Your watch.

129
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,500
波登的日记  1897年4月3日 记录了奥芬大剧院的演出
Borden's journal entry for April 3 1897 describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

130
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,500
那时我们才刚认识
That was just days after he first met me.

131
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,530
当时我们都是刚出道的魔术师
We were two young men at the start of a great career

132
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,240
我们完全献身于魔术
two young men devoted to an illusion

133
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,570
从没有想要伤害任何人
two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

134
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,210
谁有胆量上台绑住这位美女
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

135
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,900
绑住她的手腕
If you would tie her wrists

136
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,540
绑住她的腿 脚踝也要绑紧
bind her feet  around the ankle.

137
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,700
你们是水手吗?
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

138
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,570
-不是 -不是
-No. -No.

139
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,880
我想你们打的结应该都很紧
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

140
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,250
他太自满  毫无创意 又无趣
He's complacent,he's predictable,he's boring.

141
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,010
米尔顿很成功
Milton has gotten success,whatever that means

142
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,950
但现在他很没种 不敢再冒任何风险
so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

143
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,850
他耍二流把戏
He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired

144
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,960
-糟蹋观众的热情 -大家爱看这些把戏
-second-rate tricks...-They're all favorites.

145
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,670
拜托  让我试些新魔术吧 他甚至不敢尝试"接子弹"
Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

146
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,260
"接子弹"是自杀
A bullet catch is suicide.

147
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,340
要是志愿者放钮扣进去就死定了
All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

148
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,870
-那就用暗桩 -不能每个魔术都用暗桩
-Use a plant. -You can't for every trick.

149
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,840
-不然客人就没位置坐了 -好吧  不表演"接子弹"
-No seats left for the punters. -All right,no bullet catch

150
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,380
重点是好魔术师会不断创新戏法
whatever,but the point is a real magician tries to invent something new

151
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,310
让其他魔术师想破脑袋
that other magicians will scratch their heads over.

152
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,650
然后你就能靠它小赚一笔
Then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

153
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,820
-什么  -我猜你有惊人绝技?
-What? -I suppose you have such a trick?

154
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,420
-没错 -你能卖给我吗?
-I sure do. -Would you care to sell it to me?

155
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,120
不行  只有我做得到
No. No one else can do my trick.

156
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,320
-每个魔术都能被模仿  对吧? -错了
-Any trick can be duplicated. -Wrong.

157
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,400
如果波登发明了他的杰作
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece

158
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,730
大概只有他有办法演出
he's prepared to do it.

159
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,260
米尔顿很会作秀  但波登说得对
Milton is a showman,but Borden is right

160
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
米尔顿不肯冒险
he won't get his hands dirty.

161
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,570
想看真正的魔术就去天利剧院
If you want to see what it takes to make real magic go to the Tenley.

162
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,440
有位中国魔术师很厉害
There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.

163
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,840
-他叫钟林苏 -门票太贵  我看不起
-Chung Ling Soo. -I can't afford that.

164
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,580
我认识看门的家伙
I know the bloke run the door.

165
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,050
你们俩去看吧
You two go and see that show,

166
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,120
谁看出他的金鱼缸戏法窍门
and whichever one of you can tell me

167
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,160
就有奖赏
how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.

168
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,460
-什么奖赏? -在我的老朋友艾克曼面前
-Which is? -Ten minutes onstage

169
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,430
试演一段魔术
with my old friend,Mr. Ackerman.

170
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,930
-真的假的? -艾克曼是谁?
-Really? -Who's Ackerman?

171
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,190
伦敦的顶尖经纪人
The top theatrical agent in London.

172
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,300
我看到你绳结没打好
I saw you drop the knot again.

173
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,810
-我的手腕动了一下 -你一直没搞懂  是吧?
-I turned my wrists. -Some nights you just don't get it,do you?

174
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,930
要是绳结松掉 茱莉亚就会摔断腿
I mean,if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist she'll break her leg.

175
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,450
你教的绳结有问题 我说过  蓝氏结比较牢固
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,the Langford double will hold tighter.

176
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,210
蓝氏结不能碰到水  太危险了
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

177
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,480
要是绳子膨胀她就无法松绑
If the rope swells,she can't slip it.

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,780
-我可以在水底松脱蓝氏结 -她做得到  可以练习
-I can slip a Langford underwater. -We can practice.

179
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,290
波登  他说不行
Borden,he said no.

180
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,790
你对绳结懂得比我多吗?
You know knots better than me?

181
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,860
听好  不准再出错
Listen,no more mistakes.

182
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,630
是吗?  你想取代我?
All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?

183
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
-你走吧 -想都别想
-Just leave. -I didn't think so.

184
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,670
-柯特  他打哪儿来的? -你打哪儿来的?
-Hey,Cutter,where's he from? -Where are you from?

185
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,110
-他以前帮魔术师佛吉搬道具 -你不担心他偷学你的魔术?
-He shifts props for Virgil at the hall. -Worried he'll steal your tricks?

186
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,580
-他只想创造全新魔术 -你怎么知道?
-Doesn't deal in methods. -How do you know?

187
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,850
我雇他去偷学佛吉的柳橙戏法
Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.

188
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,360
-我不信任他 -他是天生魔术师
-I don't trust him. -He's a natural magician.

189
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,960
当然不能信任
'Course you can't trust him.

190
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,860
我觉得波登没问题
I think he's all right.

191
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,360
-你觉得大家都没问题 -连你也一样
-You think everyone's all right. -Even you.

192
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,230
安杰  注意一点 就连我都看得到你亲老婆的腿
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night

193
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,930
前排的观众一定也看得到
so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!

194
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,510
-你错了  不可能 -错不了
You're wrong. It can't be.

195
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,130
-你看看他 -这就是他的秘诀
-Look at the man. -This is the trick.

196
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,840
这是他的表演 难怪没人看穿他的秘密
This is the performance. Right here. This is why no one can detect his method.

197
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,220
他对魔术完全奉献
Total devotion to his art.

198
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,390
彻底自我牺牲  你懂吗?
A lot of self-sacrifice. You know?

199
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,160
这是扬名立万的唯一方法
It's the only way to escape all this

200
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,320
好吧
you know

201
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,440
这很难夹起来  而且还没有装水
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.

202
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,110
也没有金鱼  你看
Or fish,look.

203
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,400
我不确定行不行  等一下
I don't know. Hang on a second.

204
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,510
他一定壮得跟条牛一样
He must be strong as an ox.

205
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,620
这么多年来他一直假装跛脚?
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.

206
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,050
每次他出门面对大众都得装
Any time he's in public,any time he goes out.

207
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,220
不可思议
It's unthinkable.

208
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,360
有一次波登看到他露出马脚 我没办法这样
Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it.

209
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,130
很难想像花一辈子去假装别人
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.

210
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,960
-你是在假装啊 -换个名字并不算吧
-You are pretending. -I don't think changing a name compares.

211
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,610
你也换了身分和来历
Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.

212
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,010
因为我答应不能败坏家人名声
I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.

213
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,410
我帮你想到一个艺名
I thought of a name for you.

214
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,820
魔术大师丹顿
The Great Danton.

215
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,440
你喜欢吗?
Do you like it?

216
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,790
-这名字很炫 -那是法国人名
-But it's sophisticated. -It's French.

217
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,920
波登觉得只有他了解魔术的本质
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.

218
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,640
但是他不了解自我牺牲
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

219
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,650
你这笨蛋
You bloody fool.

220
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,610
-他杀了小鸟 -怎么了?
-He killed it. -It's OK.

221
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,610
-小鸟死了 -没有啦
-He killed it. -He didn't.

222
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,380
瞧  他会把他变回来
Look,now he'll bring it back.

223
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,530
不  他杀了小鸟
No,he killed it.

224
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,860
不
No,he didn't.

225
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,870
看到没?  他没事  他很好
Look,see,he's all right. He's fine.

226
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,040
-看到没 -那他的兄弟呢?
-Look at him. -But where's his brother?

227
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,940
你儿子真是聪明
He's a sharp lad,your son.

228
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,680
他是我外甥
Oh,he's my nephew.

229
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,000
算你今天走运
You're the lucky one today.

230
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,880
你在仔细看吗?
Are you watching closely?

231
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
看清楚了
Look closer.

232
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,890
绝对不要揭穿谜底
Never show anyone.

233
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,700
他们会求你  奉承你 一旦你说出来
They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret,but as soon as you give it up

234
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,340
你就没有利用价值了
you'll be nothing to them.

235
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,700
懂吗?  一文不值
You understand? Nothing.

236
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,400
魔术的秘密没啥了不起 变魔术的技巧才重要
The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything.

237
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,220
-谢谢你请客  波登先生 -不客气
-Well,thank you for lunch,Mr. Borden. -You're welcome.

238
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,920
-艾佛  叫我艾佛 -艾佛
-Alfred,it's Alfred. -Alfred.

239
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,960
我很想进去喝杯茶
So I could use a cup of tea.

240
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,460
我怕房东说闲话  最好不要
I can't allow...It's the landlord. It's not...

241
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,070
你以为这样我就进不去?
You think that's...Is that enough to keep me out?

242
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,470
我想是吧
I think so.

243
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,240
我们会再见面吧?
So I'll see you again?

244
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,820
牛奶或糖?
Milk and sugar?

245
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,950
-那是什么东西? -安杰的机关
-What's in there? -Angier's machine.

246
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,090
这是你打造的吗?
You built this,Mr. Cutter?

247
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,060
不  这不是魔术师打造的
Oh,no,sir. This wasn't built by a magician.

248
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,160
这是天才的杰作
This was built by a wizard.

249
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,960
他能让魔术师的戏法成真
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.

250
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,510
法官大人  这些道具会怎么处理?
Tell me,Your Honor,what happens with these things after the trial?

251
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,400
卖给卡德洛爵士
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

252
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,370
他对这案子很有兴趣
An avid collector,very interested in the case.

253
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,980
千万别让他拿走这样东西
Yeah. Well,don't let him take this.

254
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,910
-为什么? -太危险了
-Why ever not? -It's too dangerous.

255
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,480
它只是造型很炫  但功能很简单
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

256
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,560
的确是简单得令人失望
The most disappointing of all,sir.

257
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,090
因为这不是魔术
It has no trick.

258
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,830
这是真的
It's real.

259
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,370
-这就是淹死安杰的水箱? -是的
-This is the tank Angier drowned in? -Yes.

260
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,910
这就是机关 魔术师的手穿过这里打开假锁
This is the place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

261
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,410
标准的魔术脱逃机关?
A standard magical apparatus for escapes?

262
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,950
对  但是有一个地方不同
Yeah,with one important difference.

263
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,020
这不是假锁
This isn't a trick lock.

264
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,120
它被换成真锁
It's been switched for a real one.

265
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,190
真是杀人的好方法
What a way to kill someone.

266
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,200
他们是魔术师  法官大人 表演者...
They're magicians,Your Honor Showmen...

267
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,390
他们利用普通事物掩盖残酷真相
men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths

268
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,460
让人感到惊奇...震撼
to amaze... to shock.

269
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,000
就算没有观众?
Even without an audience?

270
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,910
有一个观众
There was an audience.

271
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,900
这座水箱
You see,this water tank

272
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,280
对他们有特别的意义
was of particular significance to these two men.

273
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,350
很可怕的意义
Particularly awful significance.

274
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,080
谁有胆量上台绑住这位美女?
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

275
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,000
绑住她的手腕
If you would tie her wrists

276
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,330
还有她的腿和脚踝
bind her feet around the ankle.

277
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,610
你们是水手吗?
Are either of you gentlemen sailors?

278
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,810
不是
No.

279
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,190
我想你们应该都会打的很紧
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

280
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,700
劳勃!
Robert!

281
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,600
不!  不!
No,no.

282
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,840
茱莉亚...茱莉亚...
Julia. Julia!

283
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,320
我认识一名老水手
I knew an old sailor once.

284
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,490
他说他曾经落水  被船帆缠住
They told me he went overboard tangled in the sails.

285
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:18,300
他们整整花了五分钟救活他
They pulled him out but it took him five minutes to cough.

286
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,410
他说感觉好像回到家
He said it was like going home.

287
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,010
波登  你想干什么?
What do you want,Borden?

288
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,860
请你节哀顺变  安杰
I'm sorry for your loss,Angier.

289
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,760
你到底绑了什么结?
Which knot did you tie?

290
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,430
我一直问我自己这件事
I keep asking myself that.

291
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,670
结果呢?
And?

292
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,500
抱歉 我...我真的不知道
I'm sorry,I just don't know.

293
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,110
你不知道?
You don't know?

294
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,610
对不起
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,720
你不知道?
You don't know?

296
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,190
你不知道?
You don't know?!

297
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,790
艾佛?
Alfred?

298
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,770
好消息  我们今天有表演了
Good news. We got our first booking.

299
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,370
-我们没见过面吧 -法隆是我的机关师
-I don't think we've had the pleasure. -Mr. Fallon is my ingueieur.

300
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,030
-你从哪里拿到这些...? -求来的 借来的  别问了
-Where did you get all...? -I had to borrow and...don't ask.

301
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,310
这位法隆先生很有办法
He's a very enterprising soul is...is Mr. Fallon. So...

302
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,850
我们没钱支付他
We can't afford to pay him.

303
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,880
有观众就会有钱
The money will come with the audience.

304
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,550
那现在呢?我赚的钱只够养活我们俩
But what about until then? What I earn,it's barely enough for us.

305
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,850
别担心  我的食物分他一半
Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.

306
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,660
你得先分给另一个人
You're going to be doing that with someone else.

307
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,930
-不会吧?  你...? -我要生宝宝了
-No. You're...? -Having a baby.

308
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,870
天啊  我们应该告诉法隆
Oh,my God. We should have told Fallon.

309
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,840
棒呆了
That is great.

310
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,710
过来
Oh,come here. Oh.

311
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,010
艾佛  这是什么?
Alfred,what is this?

312
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,210
这是用来吸引经纪人的戏法
Oh,this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.

313
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,020
这就是你所谓的伟大魔术?
Is it the masterpiece,the great trick?

314
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,750
不是  市场还不够成熟
No,no,no,the world is not ready for that one yet.

315
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,230
这只是一般的"接子弹"把戏
This is just your run-of-the-mill,daring,spectacular bullet catch.

316
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,200
-接子弹 -对  很安全  我保证  你看
-A bullet catch. -Yeah,but it's safe. I promise. Look.

317
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,870
-向我开枪 -向你开枪?
-Shoot me. -Shoot you?

318
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,100
来吧  开枪
Go on,shoot me.

319
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,710
-射这里 -我办不到
-Right there. -No,I can't.

320
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,750
不是射那里  射我胸口
No,no,not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

321
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,080
-怎么样? -太神了
-How's that? -That's very good.

322
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,950
-你是怎么做到的? -我不能告诉你
-Tell me how you do it. -No  I can't do that.

323
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,030
-那你就不准表演 -不准表演?
-Well,then you can't do it. -I can't do it?

324
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
对不起  我不能一个人养孩子
I'm sorry,but I can't raise a child on my own.

325
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,270
-那你不能告诉任何人 -好
-You don't tell anybody that I told you. -OK.

326
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,170
火药
Gunpowder.

327
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,830
填弹塞
Wadding.

328
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,340
子弹
Then the bullet.

329
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,050
推弹杆
Ramrod.

330
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,680
伸出你的手
Hold out your hand.

331
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,660
点燃火药时枪管并没有子弹
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.

332
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,460
知道了就没什么了不起
Once you know,it's actually very obvious.

333
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,530
不过还是会...
Well,I mean,you still get...

334
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,640
还是很危险  会出人命的
It's dangerous. People still get killed doing that.

335
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,040
怎么会?
How?

336
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,180
有些笨蛋搞不好把铜板放进去
You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button

337
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,710
甚至把子弹放进去
or,God forbid,Sarah,somebody could put a bullet down there.

338
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
别担心  别担心
Don't worry. Don't worry

339
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,320
我不会让任何意外发生
because I'm not gonna let anything happen.

340
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,080
一切都不会有事
Everything's gonna be all right

341
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,420
因为我非常爱你
because I love you very much.

342
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,830
-再说一次 -我爱你
-Say it again. -I love you.

343
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,340
-今天你不爱我 -什么?
-Not today. -What?

344
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,630
有时你不真诚  今天你不是真心的
Well,some days it's not true,and today you don't mean it.

345
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,900
也许今天你比较爱魔术
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.

346
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,410
我能分辨个中的差别
I like being able to tell the difference.

347
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,480
如果真心说爱我今天就更有意义
It makes the days it is true mean something.

348
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,250
好吧
All right.

349
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,370
各位  这是钢圈
Metal rings,ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,180
现场有绅士淑女吗?
If there are any ladies and gentlemen here.

351
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,620
-这是实心的 -这表演我看过了
-Solid metal. -Seen that already.

352
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,460
把枪拿出来吧!  小子

353
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,190
-是谁丢的? -是我!
Who threw that?

354
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,800
把枪拿出来  魔术师 你会需要的

355
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,250
拿出枪吧!

356
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,150
你们是想看这个  对吧?
This is what you came for,is it?

357
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,580
那么...谁要当志愿者?
So... who wants to volunteer?

358
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,630
-我要! -我!  我!
-I do! -Me! Me!

359
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,970
我!
Me.

360
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,260
你够种吗? 先生
Are you man enough,sir?

361
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,920
是的
Yes.

362
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,940
你到底绑什么结?
Which knot did you tie,Borden?

363
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,380
你到底绑什么结?
Which knot did you tie,Borden?

364
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,280
我不知道
I don't know.

365
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,500
他要我回答  我说了实话
He came in to demand an answer,and I told him the truth.

366
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,670
我为了那件事天人交战
That I have fought with myself over that night

367
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,310
一半的我发誓绑了简单的绳结
one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot

368
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,720
另一半的我记得我绑了蓝氏结
the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.

369
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,080
我永远都无法确定
I can never know for sure.

370
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,860
他怎么会不知道?
How can he not know!

371
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,360
他怎么会不知道?
How can he not know?

372
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,330
他一定知道自己做了什么 一定的
He must know what he did. He must.

373
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,010
莎拉  很痛耶
Sarah,that bloody hurts.

374
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,340
我不懂  怎么又流血了?
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

375
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,840
根本就没有治好
It's as bad as the day it happened.

376
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,880
-我去请大夫来 -我们请不起大夫
-We have to get a doctor back. -We can't afford the doctor back.

377
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,820
-你吵醒她了 -太好了
-You've woken her. -Great.

378
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,420
伤口愈合了我才能回去表演
I'm sorry,I need this to heal so I can get back to work.

379
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,290
面对现实吧  伤成这样不能表演
You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?

380
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,960
我能耍扑克牌  用道具表演
I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks.

381
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,430
我还是能表演我说的那个绝招
I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about.

382
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,600
千古留名的伟大表演
The one that they're gonna remember me for.

383
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,870
相信我
Come on.

384
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,400
没想到答案就在酒杯底下
I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.

385
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,100
你随时都在找答案
Hasn't stopped your looking.

386
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,580
听说有一场表演
Heard about a booking.

387
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,380
不错的小戏院 要魔术界的年轻新秀
Nice little theater. Young,up-and-coming magician.

388
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,950
-要找谁? -你
-Who?  -You.

389
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,820
你替我找表演机会?  为什么?
Me? Booking? Why?

390
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,890
我想继续工作
I want to keep on working.

391
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,090
谁会雇用害死女助手的机关师?
Who's going to hire the ingueieur that killed Julia McCullough

392
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,490
还是在满座的奥芬大剧院
in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?

393
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,490
那并不是你的错
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

394
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,040
波登绑错结  害死茱莉亚
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.

395
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,660
我听说他表演接子弹出了差错
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.

396
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,240
那一招本来就很危险
That's a dangerous trick,that one.

397
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,710
我们得把窗户刷白
We'll have to whitewash the windows

398
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,290
不要让好奇的行人看进来
confound the more curious members of the public,but it will do.

399
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,860
-我们先得找一名助手 -我已经找到了
-We should see about an assistant. -I've made some arrangements.

400
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,420
你想好艺名了吗?
You settled on a name?

401
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,040
想好了  魔术大师丹顿
Yes  I have. The Great Danton.

402
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,670
似乎有点老派?
It's a bit old-fashioned,isn't it?

403
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,330
不  这对我意义非凡
No,it's sophisticated.

404
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,940
大家都看过这招鸟笼魔术
The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

405
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,640
-他们没看过这一招 -我不想杀鸽子
-Not like this. -I don't want to kill doves.

406
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,340
那就别干这行 魔术师不是巫师
Then stay off the stage. You're a magician,not a wizard.

407
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,390
你想成功  就得杀生
You got to get your hands dirty,if you're going to achieve the impossible.

408
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,160
这边请  温小姐
In here,Miss Wenscombe.

409
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,690
要是塞不进去你就白来了
No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit.

410
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,830
站右边
On the right.

411
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,100
这有什么难?
What's so hard about this?

412
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,500
并不难  你要躺在下面
Nothing.You're going...down here.

413
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,210
握住它  这要绕到另一边

414
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,470
-这样就能隐藏鸟笼? -没错  当然
-And this will conceal,right? -Oh,sure.

415
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,910
-好了吗? -好了

416
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,520
把这个别在下面
-Tighten up on there. -Yep.

417
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,150
这绑在这里?
This ties up here?

418
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,120
-这绑在前面 -很好
-Ties in the back. -Good.

419
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,090
尽量憋住气
Breathe as little as possible.

420
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,570
看到没?  它会被压扁
Now,you see?

421
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,040
-我懂了 -好
-That's it. -OK.

422
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,880
她没经验  不过很会秀自己
She's not experienced,but she knows how to present herself.

423
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,850
美丽的女助手最能转移注意力
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.

424
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,380
谢谢大家
Thank you.

425
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,550
各位  最后的魔术表演
Ladies and gentlemen,for my final trick

426
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,390
需要两名志愿者
I will require the assistance of two volunteers.

427
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,890
梅老板  麻烦你
Mr. Merrit,if you would oblige me?

428
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,860
用手盖住
Yep.

429
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,630
底下?
Under?

430
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,570
绕住他的脚
Under,yeah. Come around his foot.

431
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,970
-小心点 -他没问题
-Careful. -It's all right.

432
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,800
一名志愿者把手放这里
-Your volunteer,put their hand there. -Yeah?

433
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,020
另一名放在那里
And another one here.

434
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,860
梅老板  把手放在鸟笼的两侧
If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage,please.

435
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,030
谢谢你  奥莉薇雅
Thank you,Olivia.

436
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,000
你最好别...
You best not...

437
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,640
-伤害小动物  安杰 -当然不会
-be intending to hurt this animal,Mr. Angier. -Of course not.

438
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,040
准备好了吗?
Ready? Right.

439
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,770
一...
One...

440
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,010
二...
Two...

441
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
-三...  -变
-Three.

442
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,650
太惊人了
That's bloody marvelous,Cutter.

443
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,880
太棒了
Very nice.

444
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,190
最棒的是...
And the best part is...

445
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,590
我以为我得杀生
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.

446
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,170
将来也许  我只想确定你行不行
Someday,perhaps you will. I just had to know that you can.

447
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,070
很不错  真的很棒
Very nice. Very nice,indeed.

448
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,080
谢谢你  你的剧院也很棒
I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.

449
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,580
坐满了观众会更棒
It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.

450
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,580
-别担心 -你们都这么说
-Don't worry. -You all say that. Why should I worry?

451
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,550
我才不担心 你不行我换人就是了
If your tricks don't get them in,somebody else's will.

452
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,890
或许有人愿意接子弹或水底脱逃
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

453
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,420
那是洒狗血的技俩
Cheap thrills,Mr. Merrit.

454
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,220
大家只想看发生意外
People hoping for an accident,likely to see one too.

455
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,920
那对你的生意有什么好处?
What would that do for your business?

456
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,340
-给你一个星期  约翰 -谢谢你  梅老板
-You got a week,John. -Thank you,Mr. Merrit.

457
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,080
(魔术大师丹顿)

458
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,720
谢谢
Thank you.

459
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,410
那位先生  第三排
Uh...Sir,in the third row there.

460
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,390
请站起来让大家看你的手帕
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.

461
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
这不是我的
This isn't mine.

462
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,290
请你把手帕还给第二排的女士
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.

463
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,760
我相信她有你的手帕
I believe she has yours.

464
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,960
谢谢
Thank you

465
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,540
抱歉  我一直出错
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes.

466
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,540
我好紧张
I'm so nervous.

467
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,240
观众好像没什么反应
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.

468
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,220
我保证下一个魔术他们从没看过
They've seen a lot of tricks before but not this next one.

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,190
拿一块布遮住
Cloth over.

470
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,160
-祝我好运 -我会准备香槟庆祝
-Keep your fingers crossed. -I'll have the champagne ready.

471
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,450
-你们看过这一招? -老套了
-You've seen this one before? -We've seen them all before.

472
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,050
那我就让它更具挑战性
I'll make it a little harder then,shall I?

473
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,660
我要两位志愿者 一男一女跟我一起握住鸟笼
Two volunteers,please. A lady and a gentlemen To hold this cage with me.

474
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,030
我要表演前所未有  世界首创
I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves

475
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,030
无人见识过的全新魔术
or any other audience anywhere in the world.

476
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,730
一只手放后面  另一只放前面
Madame,place one hand on the back of the cage one hand on the front

477
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,780
先生  一只手放底下 另一只放上面
Sir,one hand on the bottom of the cage one hand on the top.

478
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,790
-我早该认出他来 -你忙着表演
-I should've spotted him. -You had a lot of plates going.

479
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,230
-他们不会让我再秀这一招了 -没错
-Don't suppose we can do this again. -No.

480
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,200
-那要用哪一招当压轴? -压轴? 你没得表演了
-So,what's the climax of our show? -Show? You don't have a show.

481
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,960
梅老板  我们的合约是一星期
We have a week's engagement.

482
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,770
我要你变魔术 不是杀小鸟或折断客人手指
To perform magic  not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.

483
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,380
卷铺盖滚蛋  不然就全烧掉
Clear out,anything here in the morning gets burned.

484
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,880
没得谈了
It's done,John.

485
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,680
我找了个谐星 你知道我最讨厌谐星
I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.

486
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,380
好吧  好剧院多得是
Well,there's plenty of good theaters.

487
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,550
我们找个新魔术  换个艺名...
If we can come up with a new trick,change the name of the act.

488
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,590
我不换艺名
The name stays.

489
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,560
好吧  不过新魔术一定要很炫
Right,well,then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.

490
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,500
我还有好几招可以试
I have a couple of methods to try out.

491
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,970
但要有新的表现方式
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.

492
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,940
如果你要找灵感
And if you need some inspiration

493
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,100
皇家亚伯厅本周有个科技展
there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

494
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,940
工程师  科学家都会去
Engineers,scientists,you know?

495
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,280
这些事物吸引大众的好奇心
That sort of thing captures the public's imagination.

496
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,740
我能坐这儿吗? 泰斯拉在暴风雨时派我来
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

497
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,030
是陪丹顿大师喝一杯的好借口
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

498
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,040
来两杯
Two of them.

499
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,110
这雨下得真好  我好想念纽约
Beautiful,isn't it? God,I miss New York,though.

500
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,650
-你来这里干嘛? -这里有闪电  而且人烟稀少
-Why are you here? -The lightning lives here And not much else.

501
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,910
我们的工作是秘密
Our work is secret.

502
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,450
这是字谜吗?
That a cipher?

503
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,630
这本日记每天都换字母密码
A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

504
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,630
看似简单  就算有字母密码 解码也会花很多时间
Simple but time-consuming to translate,even with the five-letter keyword.

505
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
密码是什么?
Which is?

506
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,640
我们魔术师有道义要保密
We magicians have a circle of trust.

507
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,740
你偷别人的日记也叫道义?
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

508
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,930
搞不好我是用买的
Maybe I bought it.

509
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,440
你想从里面找出秘密
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there?

510
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,280
我找到了  所以才来这里
I've already found it. That's why I'm here.

511
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,580
泰斯拉替一名魔术师做了机关
Tesla built one for another magician.

512
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,030
-你干嘛要同样的东西? -这是同行间的较劲
-Why would you want the same thing? -Call it a professional rivalry.

513
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,830
泰斯拉专门帮怪人做古怪的机关
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

514
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,590
但我们不会说出去的
But he would never talk about it.

515
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,710
没问题  我只想要那台机关
I understand discretion. I just want the machine.

516
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,910
把酒干了
Finish your drink.

517
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,240
我带你去看样东西
I want to show you something.

518
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,650
你会很佩服我们的工作
I think you'll have a special appreciation for our work.

519
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,220
-我以为那是秘密 -你是魔术师
-I thought it was a secret. -You're a magician.

520
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,050
谁会相信你说的话?
Who's gonna believe you?

521
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,380
就快到了
Not long now.

522
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,960
我们的装备需要大量的电力
Our equipment requires a great deal of current.

523
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,960
泰斯拉替全镇提供电力 交换条件是使用发电机的权利
Tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need them.

524
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,230
我们趁镇民睡着时做实验
We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

525
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,000
泰斯拉不想吓到大家
Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.

526
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,890
电线在哪里?
Where are the wires?

527
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,520
问得好
Exactly.

528
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,940
-发电机呢? -就是你上星期看到的那台
-Where's the generator? -You saw it last week.

529
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,080
-离这里有十英里 -十五英里
-That must be ten miles from here. -Fifteen.

530
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,240
每天都要骑这么远才能回家睡觉
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.

531
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,050
过几天我会给你消息
I'll send word for you in a few days,Mr. Angier.

532
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,250
魔法  真正的魔法
Magic. Real magic.

533
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,360
这一切都只在皇家亚伯厅展出
Now appearing,only here at London's Royal Albert Hall

534
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,730
这个时代的奇迹

535
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,030
科技的惊奇
A technological marvel.

536
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,430
你这辈子从来没看过
You've never seen anything like it in your lives.

537
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,970
就算亲眼目睹也不敢相信
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.

538
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,200
各位先生女士  泰斯拉的奇迹
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,ladies and gentlemen.

零污染的免费电力 你想看到未来吗?

Come one,come all. Immediate seating,no waiting.

各位女士先生们
Ladies and gentlemen

543
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,780
有些观众有意见担心安全的问题
objections have been raised...

544
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,040
是应该有意见  你认为安全吗?
They should be raised. Does that look safe to you?

545
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,740
这是爱迪生的毁谤行动
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

546
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,780
故意中伤泰斯拉的交流电研究
against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.

547
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,360
我们要求泰斯拉放弃展出
We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.

548
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,990
但是他不会
Which he will not!

549
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,360
不过他拒绝在受限情况下现身
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.

550
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,830
快走  这东西快爆炸了
This thing's gonna blow.

551
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,600
拜托大家别紧张
Ladies and gentlemen,please.

552
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,310
开关在哪里?

553
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,480
这百分之百安全

554
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,310
你今天跟妈妈过得好吗?
Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?

555
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,550
莎拉  我爱你
Sarah. I love you.

556
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,100
你今天是真心说爱我
See,today it's true.

557
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,270
我看见了幸福
I saw happiness.

558
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,570
应该属于我的幸福
Happiness that should have been mine.

559
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,070
但是我错了
But I was wrong.

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,800
笔记中透露 他没有我所羡慕的生活
His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.

561
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,510
前一刻他渴望的家庭生活
The family life that he craves one minute

562
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,780
下一刻就想反抗  追求自由
he rails against the next,demanding freedom.

563
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,820
他的精神分裂...
His mind...his mind is a divided one.

564
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,820
心灵无法平静
His soul is restless.

565
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:20,190
易变和矛盾的天性折磨着妻女
His wife and child,tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature.

566
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,370
你要叫洋娃娃什么名字?
So,what do you think you'll call her?

567
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,800
不知道
I don't know.

568
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,200
大家都有名字啊  她呢?
Everybody needs a name,so,what's hers?

569
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,870
那就叫莎拉吧
Maybe Sarah.

570
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,650
很美的名字 很美的名字
That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.

571
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,950
你们聊聊今天想做的事
Well,you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.

572
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,880
去跟她说吧
All right,go on,you talk with her.

573
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,420
他们要把她带走?
Are they taking her away?

574
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,620
送到童工工厂?
To the workhouse?

575
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,890
来  你们继续说话
You keep talking.

576
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,800
告诉欧文我答应了  拿去吧
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it. Go on,take it.

577
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,640
这样对大家最好
It's for the best.

578
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,620
给我看
Let me see.

579
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,690
-我要学会大师你所有的绝招 -我得先教你识字
-I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets. -Only if I teach you how to read.

580
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,530
这些魔术没有屁用
They're just stupid tricks,right?

581
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,460
完全不能帮你逃出去
Haven't helped you get out of here,have they?

582
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,500
大师  你能解开真的锁吗?
Or can't you undo real locks,professor?

583
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,370
也许我只是在等待时机
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

584
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,380
有一天我会张开双手请你看 然后问
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,get your attention

585
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,610
你在注意看吗?
ask,"Are you watching closely?"

586
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,550
也许念一两句咒语
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

587
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,920
然后我就消失不见
And then I'll be gone.

588
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,430
你凭什么这么出名?
How'd you get so famous then?

589
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,560
魔术
Magic.

590
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,870
波登  给我回来
Borden,get back here!

591
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,510
多谢啦!
Thank you.

592
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,410
闭嘴 抓住他
Shut up!

593
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,810
谢谢
Thank you

594
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,970
谁有钥匙?
Where's the bloody key?!

595
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,080
1899年2月8日
February 8,1899.

596
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,230
今天终于有了突破
Today,finally,a breakthrough.

597
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,020
泰斯拉同意见我
Tesla's agreed to see me.

598
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,900
这很百分之百安全
Perfectly safe.

599
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,090
你是魔术大师丹顿
So this is the Great Danton.

600
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,890
艾利经常说你的表演很精彩
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.

601
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,270
伸出另一只手
Hold out other hand.

602
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,810
电流从哪里通过?
What's conducting the electricity?

603
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,280
我们的身体能生产
Our bodies,Mr. Angier.

604
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,950
并制造能源
Quite capable of conducting and,indeed,producing energy.

605
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,550
你吃过了吗?
Have you eaten,Mr. Angier?

606
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,620
我需要惊世骇俗的魔术
I need something impossible.

607
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:42,170
你听过这句俗话吗? "心有余而力不足"
You're familiar with the phrase,"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

608
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,940
那不是真话
Is a lie.

609
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,080
人类只是胆量不够
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

610
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,110
社会一次只能接受一种改变
Society only tolerates one change at a time.

611
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,850
我第一次试着改变世界...
First time I tried to change the world

612
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,650
被称为先知
I was hailed as a visionary.

613
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,750
第二次他们却请我退休
Second time I was asked politely to retire.

614
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,730
所以我在这里享受退休时光
So here I am,enjoying my retirement.

615
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,170
没有不可能的事
Nothing is impossible

616
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,030
只是很昂贵
Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.

617
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,640
你只用这机器
If I were to build for you this machine

618
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,470
来表演魔术?
you would be presenting it merely as illusion?

619
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,010
如果大家把我的表演当真
Well,if people actually believed the things I did on stage

620
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,770
就不会鼓掌  只会尖叫 想想看  把女人锯成两半
they wouldn't clap,they'd scream. Think of sawing a woman in half.

621
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,820
你想过这机器的代价吗?
Have you considered the cost of this?

622
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,820
钱不是问题
Price is not an object.

623
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,860
或许吧  你有想过代价吗?
Perhaps not,but have you considered the cost?

624
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,160
我不懂你的意思
I'm not sure I follow.

625
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,060
回家吧  忘了这件事
Go home,forget this thing.

626
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,330
我看得出你着了魔
I can recognize an obsession.

627
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,490
这不会有好事
No good will come of it.

628
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,470
你自己着了魔也没好事吗?
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

629
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,730
一开始有  但我沉迷太久了
At first,but I have followed them too long.

630
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:53,350
我成了它的奴隶 总有一天  它们会毁了我
I am their slave. And one day,they will choose to destroy me.

631
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,710
既然着了魔 那你就该知道我不会改变心意
If you understand an obsession,then you know you won't change my mind.

632
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,040
就这样吧
So be it.

633
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,880
你愿意打造了吗?
Will you build it?

634
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,420
我已经开始打造了
I've already begun to build it,Mr. Angier.

635
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,960
希望你享受山上的空气
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

636
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,460
这得花点时间
This will take some time.

637
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,170
(魔术大师挑战死亡)

638
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,100
(重返江湖的移形遁影术)

639
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,360
我以为你走了
Uh...I thought you'd gone.

640
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,490
我没有地方可以去
I don't really have anywhere to go.

641
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,630
你都睡在这里?
You've been sleeping here?

642
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,200
柯特说我可以睡在这里 你在做什么?
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?

643
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,610
做研究
Uh...research.

644
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,210
魔术师得刺探对手表演什么...
Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition,see what illusions...

645
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,140
你打算对付他  对吧?
You're going to do something to that man,aren't you?

646
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,110
柯特希望你忘了这件事
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

647
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,720
如果波登觉得你们扯平了...
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you...

648
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,480
扯平?
Even?

649
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,580
他用手指换我太太的命?
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

650
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,660
他现在有家有室又能上台表演
He has a family now and he's performing again.

651
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,560
波登假装没事发生 继续过着日子
Borden is out there living his life just as he intended

652
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,790
看看我
as if nothing had happened and look at me.

653
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,840
-我孤家寡人  没戏院要请我表演 -是我们
-I'm alone and no theater will touch me. -Us.

654
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,470
你需要更好的伪装
You're going to need a better disguise.

655
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,620
我需要志愿者
I need a volunteer.

656
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,360
发生什么事?
What happened?

657
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,520
你伤了他吗?
Did you hurt him?

658
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,430
怎么了  劳勃?
What happened,Robert?

659
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,270
你
You,sir.

660
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,810
这只是个皮球  对吧?谢谢
Just a rubber ball,yes?  Thank you.

661
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,470
只是个皮球
Just a rubber ball? No.

662
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,840
但它一点也不普通
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

663
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,040
它有魔力
It's magic.

664
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,820
波登有个新魔术
He had a new trick.

665
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,720
很棒吗?
Was it good?

666
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,670
那是我看过最棒的魔术戏法
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.

667
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,870
观众有没有鼓掌?
Did they applaud when you saw it?

668
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,080
戏法太棒  太简单了
It was too good. It was too simple.

669
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,310
-观众根本来不及看得懂 -他是个糟糕的魔术师
-The audience hardly had time to see it. -He's a dreadful magician.

670
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,020
不  他是很厉害的魔术师 只是一个糟糕的表演者
A wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.

671
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,420
完全不懂得包装宣传他的魔术
He doesn't dress it up how to sell it.

672
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,220
-那他到底怎么变的? -他使用替身
-How does he do it? -He uses a double.

673
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,990
-太简单了  -一定更复杂
-No,it's too simple. -This is a complex illusion.

674
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,570
你不知道窍门才会这么说
You say that because you don't know the method.

675
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,900
后来现身的是替身  就是这样
It's a double that comes out. It's the only way.

676
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,230
我看过三次
I've seen him perform it three times.

677
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,880
-是同一个人 -不  不是
-The prestige is the same man.  -No  it's not.

678
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,510
从第二道门出来的是同一人
The same man comes out of the cabinet.

679
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,770
是同一个人
It's the same man.

680
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,420
他戴着手套掩饰断指
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers

681
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,420
仔细看就看得出来
but,if you look closely,you can tell.

682
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,850
他不会吸引观众  但是我会
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience,but I do.

683
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,360
我们可以用来当压轴表演
Yeah,we could use it as a climax to the show.

684
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,660
没错
Yes.

685
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,060
他毁了我一生  我就偷他的戏法
The man stole my life,I'm gonna steal his trick.

686
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,430
-我们要找个很像你的人 -他没有用替身
-We got to find someone who looks like you. -He doesn't use a double.

687
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,940
劳勃  我不知道波登的手法
I don't know how Borden does it.

688
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,480
你要不就等他退休向他买秘诀
Either...You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret

689
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,410
或是听我解释要怎么表演
or you listen to how I would do it.

690
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,480
我知道唯一的手段就是用替身
And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.

691
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,050
好吧
All right.

692
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,810
看清楚我的样子  去找我吧
Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me. Whoo!

693
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,960
你看  你看
Look,look.

694
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,660
这是什么?
What's that?

695
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,930
这是给你的
It's for you.

696
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,870
用来做什么呢?
What's this for?

697
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,670
过来
Come.

698
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,580
-我上礼拜问过你...-那时候我心情不好
-I asked you last week...-You caught me in a wrong mood.

699
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,150
但是你一直反对...
But you won't ever...

700
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,850
莎拉  我可以改变主意吧?
Sarah  I'm gonna have to change my mind,aren't I?

701
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,760
我的表演很成功 换一家大剧院表演
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater

702
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,160
就能赚大钱
things will work out.

703
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,300
我不敢相信  谢谢你
I can't believe it. Thank you.

704
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,370
谢谢你  好美喔
Thank you. It's beautiful.

705
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,840
杰瑞
Gerry?

706
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,370
亲爱的  看看你
Darling,look at you.

707
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,180
两位  这是杰瑞路特
Mr. Cutter,Mr. Angier,I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

708
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,720
幸会了  很荣幸认识你们
A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

709
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,850
你想听我说笑话吗?过来
Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.

710
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,000
怎样?
Yes?

711
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,190
你在笑吗?
Are you laughing now?

712
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,200
我得去尿尿
I have to take a piss.

713
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,710
-他是个疯汉 -当然了  他是个失业演员
-He's out of his mind. -Of course,he's an out-of-work actor.

714
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,680
他很好  外表修饰一下
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

715
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,680
就能当你的兄弟
But when I get done with him,he could be your brother.

716
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,380
我不要他当我兄弟  而是变成我
I don't need him to be my brother,I need him to be me.

717
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,110
给我一个月的时间
Give me a month.

718
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,400
你打开门  然后...
So you open the door,and...

719
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,200
跳下来吧
Come on.

720
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,840
-你就不能找个软垫子吗? -这又不是睡觉用的
-Couldn't you have found a softer one? -Well,it's not for sleeping on.

721
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,390
你从那上面跳下来
So,if you come down through there...

722
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,110
-路特就从那边上去吗? -没错
-does Root go up through there? -Yep.

723
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,260
这会令人叹为观止
It's going to be amazing.

724
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,560
一定要  波登的魔术大受欢迎
Well,it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

725
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,000
今天已经客满了
The place was packed today.

726
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,400
你又去看他的表演
You went and saw his show again.

727
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,940
准备见你自己吗?安先生
Ready to meet yourself,Mr. Angier?

728
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,610
我只要喝得烂醉
All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk

729
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,050
就不会被识破
and no one will be able to tell the difference.

730
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,120
你要有点信心
Have a little faith,sir.

731
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:40,160
路先生  麻烦你表演吧
Now,would you favor us with a performance,Mr. Root?

732
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,730
老天爷
You'd drink,too

733
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,080
你若像我看尽人情冷暖 也会借酒浇愁
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

734
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,480
你以为你很特别吗?
Did you think you were unique?

735
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,150
我扮演过凯撒跟浮士德
I've been Caesar,I've played Faust.

736
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:15,300
扮你这丹顿大师能有多难?
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

737
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,630
你可以变回自己了  不然开除你
You can go back to being yourself now,Root,for nothing.

738
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,960
我宁愿变成他
I'd rather be him for now.

739
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,940
我发现这还蛮好玩的
I find it,uh...amusing.

740
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,410
吾王  我确实否认没有囚犯...
"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."

741
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,450
-你扮得好像哦 -谢了
-You look wonderful. -Oh,thank you.

742
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,710
路特必须保持低调 被人看到我们就玩完了
Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him,the game's up.

743
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,830
我不知道你的做法  我也不想知道
I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know.

744
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,390
你决定这魔术叫什么吗?
Have you thought what we should call it?

745
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,130
没必要遮遮掩掩 波登称他的表演为"移形遁影术"
There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.

746
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,780
(全新移形遁影术)

747
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,040
各位  你们今晚看到的
Ladies and gentlemen,much of what you've seen may be termed

748
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,440
多半都是魔术或是小把戏
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

749
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,170
但是...
Alas...

750
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,820
下一个表演并不是魔术
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

751
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,880
仔细看
Watch carefully.

752
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,830
绝对看不到机关
You will see no trickery

753
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,850
因为这是真的
for no trickery is employed.

754
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,360
只有遥远东方的奇人异士
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient

755
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,730
以及喜马拉雅山的圣者才会
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

756
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,900
的确  有些观众看过这个表演
Indeed,many of you may be familiar with this technique

757
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,100
没看过的请不要紧张
but for those of you who are not,do not be alarmed.

758
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,340
这个表演绝对安全
What you're about to see is considered safe.

759
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,410
敬我们的成功
To our achievement.

760
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,750
经理说他没看过这种热烈反应
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

761
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,150
至少他看到了  我只能躲在台下
At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

762
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,690
观众才懒得管消失的人
No one cares about the man who disappears.

763
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,620
他们只在乎现身的大师
They care about the one who comes out.

764
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,770
-我就关心消失的人 -谢谢你
-I care about the man in the box. -Thank you.

765
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:28,130
也许我们能换过来
I don't know,maybe we could switch before the trick.

766
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,400
由我来现身 让路特跳到舞台底下
I'm the prestige,and Root's below stage.

767
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,300
不行  观众的期望最重要
No,the anticipation of the trick is everything.

768
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,500
你的舞台魅力才能营造张力
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

769
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,940
他一开口就完了  没办法表演
Once Root opens his mouth,it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

770
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,950
我当然行  我是丹顿大师
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

771
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,610
你这猪头  把这身装扮脱掉
Root,you bloody fool,get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

772
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,310
随时都可能有人经过
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

773
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,480
恭喜了  各位
Congratulations,all.

774
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,220
成功不是偶然的  我们很努力
Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard.

775
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,990
我们要好好庆祝
We need to celebrate properly.

776
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,200
怎么了? 想起你太太?
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

777
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,600
不是  这魔术还不够好
No,it's the trick. It isn't good enough.

778
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,970
波登比不上我们  他没有格调
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

779
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,980
他最后不必躲在舞台底下
He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

780
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,840
我要知道他的做法
I need to know how he does it.

781
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,380
-为什么? -这样我就可以做得更好
-Why? -So I can do it better.

782
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,990
我要你去当他的助手
I need you to go and work for him.

783
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,790
当他助手?  你在开玩笑?
Work for him? Are you joking?

784
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,220
你得当我的间谍
You'll be my spy.

785
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,460
我们才刚成功  你就要我走?
We just got our start. You want me to leave?

786
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,660
这样才能进步  想想看
That's how we advance. Think of it.

787
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,470
柯特的技俩已经让观众兴奋了 用正版魔术岂不更受欢迎
People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do

788
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,480
这将是前所未见的伟大魔术
with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

789
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,050
他知道我是你的助手
He knows I work for you.

790
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,480
他才会用你来打探我的秘诀
Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secret.

791
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,710
-他凭什么信任我? -因为你要告诉他真相
-Why would he trust me? -Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

792
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,090
乖女孩
Good girl.

793
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,830
你一定想知道 花大钱买到的是什么
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you.

794
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,340
你正好来目睹我们的处女秀
Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage.

795
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,210
你的高帽
Your hat.

796
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,580
你最好退后一点
You might want to stand back.

797
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,400
我不明白
I don't understand.

798
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,880
让我们来处理就好了
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

799
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,180
-有问题吗  泰斯拉? -没有
-Is there a problem,Mr. Tesla? -No.

800
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,880
-下星期再回来 -下星期?
-Come back next week. -Next week?

801
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,150
下星期就没问题
Next week,it will be fine.

802
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,090
机器有时候也会闹脾气
Just a little temperamental.

803
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,800
-很不错的工作室 -我们尽力了
-Interesting workshop. -Yeah,we make do.

804
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,300
-我是奥莉薇雅 -我知道
-My name is Olivia...-I know who you are.

805
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,770
你来偷我的秘诀?
Here to steal the rest of my show?

806
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,740
我有你缺少的东西
To give your show what it's missing.

807
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,070
-我缺少什么? -我
-Yeah,what might that be? -Me.

808
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,580
我刚才正在说...我们需要女性魅力
I was just saying that,wasn't I? A woman's touch.

809
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,580
我离开安杰
I've left Angier.

810
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,480
需要工作
-All right. -I want a job.

811
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,620
-我知道你一定不信任我 -我为什么不信任你?
-I know you've no reason to trust me. -Why wouldn't I trust you?

812
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,660
你是我敌手的情人  当然能信任
You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

813
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,130
-波登先生 -艾佛
-Mr. Borden. -Alfred.

814
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,630
我要告诉你事实
I'm going to tell you the truth.

815
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,470
干我们这行  没有所谓的事实
Now that is a slippery notion

816
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,940
不是吗?  温小姐
in our line of work,isn't it,Miss Wenscombe?

817
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,640
我会来这里 是安杰派我来的
I am here because he sent me here.

818
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,280
他要我替你工作  偷你的秘诀
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

819
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,110
为什么?
What does he need my secret for?

820
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,680
他的魔术算顶尖了
His trick is topnotch.

821
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,520
他消失后立刻出现在舞台另一边
He vanishes,and then he reappears instantly

822
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,520
痴肥又不开口  而且喝得烂醉
on the other side of the stage,mute,overweight and,unless I'm mistaken,very drunk.

823
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,360
不过还是很棒  何必偷我的?
It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me,Olivia

824
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,670
告诉我  他喜欢躲在台下吗?
does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

825
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,860
他快抓狂了
It's killing him.

826
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,030
他像着了魔似的
He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

827
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,400
只想知道你的手法
He thinks of nothing else

828
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,630
表演成功还不满足  我受够了
takes no pleasure in our success. And I've had enough.

829
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,240
跟他在一起没有未来
There is no future with him.

830
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:29,080
他派我来偷你的秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密
He sent me here to steal your secrets,but I've come to offer you his.

831
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,140
这是实话吗?
This is the truth...is it?

832
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,350
你赶快把衣服穿好
Think you'd better get dressed,sir.

833
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,750
你迟到了  而且比平常更醉
Root,you're late and more drunk than usual.

834
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,560
-立刻给我躲进舞台下面 -不
-Get down below stairs right away. -No.

835
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,230
我们得聊一聊  柯特先生
No,we need to have a little chat,Mr. Cutter.

836
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,430
麻烦大了
We have a problem. Cutter

837
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,170
波登就在对街表演
Borden is performing right across the street.

838
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,970
这里的问题更大
Yeah,we have a bigger problem.

839
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:00,050
路特他发现他可以狮子大开口
Root. He's realized that he can make demands.

840
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,210
他要勒索我们?
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

841
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,550
我倒是很惊讶 这种人通常过很久才会想通
I was surprised,to tell you the truth. It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.

842
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,520
-他要多少? -没差啦
-How much does he want? -It makes no difference.

843
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,090
-我们得暂停演出 -暂停演出?  你看看
-We've got to stop doing the trick. -Stop the trick? Look at this.

844
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,390
你看看上礼拜的报纸
Last week they said

845
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,930
他们说你是伦敦首席表演家
you were the premier stage performer in London.

846
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,660
不是魔术师
Not magician

847
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,430
-而是表演家 -你想说什么?
-mind you. Performer of any kind. -What's your point?

848
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,870
你成名太快
My point is,you've climbed too high

849
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,240
不能出纰漏
to get away with professional embarrassment.

850
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,640
最好别表演无法掌控的魔术
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

851
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,640
他想要多少都给他
Just pay him for now.

852
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,220
继续表演 直到波登开幕  我们再喊停
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.

853
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,760
好吧
All right.

854
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:48,450
柯特很惊讶路特这么快就造反
Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.

855
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,020
我何德何能被你请喝啤酒?
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

856
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,570
你是丹顿大师  对吧?
-You're the Great Danton,aren't you? -Sh,sh,sh,sh,sh.

857
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,070
当然  别声张  我怕被骚扰
Of course I am,but don't advertise it,because I'll be mobbed with fans.

858
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,140
我们给他钱喝酒
We paid him enough to keep him in beers.

859
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,440
以防他扯后腿
You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.

860
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,180
各位可能看过这个魔术
Many of you may be familiar with this technique

861
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:10,980
没看过的人不要紧张
but for those of you who aren't,do not be alarmed.

862
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:14,180
这个魔术很安全
What you're about to see is considered safe.

863
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,660
你是谁?
And who are you?

864
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:21,660
我是个仰慕者  也是魔术师
I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.

865
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,990
非常好
Mmm. Very good.

866
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,170
-再来一杯? -如果你要请客
-Another one? -Oh,if you insist.

867
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,250
-再来一杯 -我今晚没有演出
-Another. -I'm not performing tonight.

868
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,140
我只负责表演
I'm only doing one show,but to be frank

869
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,510
一切都由其他人安排
my people pretty much run things these days.

870
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,780
给我上去
Get up there.

871
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,250
上去
Get up!

872
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,590
你的移形遁影术
Your illusion,The Transported Man

873
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,730
我并不知道个中秘密
I'm not claiming to know your methods

874
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:58,890
但是我以前也有类似的表演 而且  我用一个替身
but I had a similar trick in my act and,uh...I used a double.

875
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,400
我懂了  很好
Mm,I see,very good.

876
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:04,130
结果出了麻烦
Well,it was,and then it went bad.

877
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:09,710
我没料到替身竟然喧宝夺主
What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act

878
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,850
把我的光彩全部夺走
he had complete power over me.

879
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,650
完全夺走?
Complete power,you say?

880
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,400
千万别让别人夺走你的光彩
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

881
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,850
谢谢你
Huh. Thank you. Um...

882
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,180
谢谢你的忠告
Yes,thank you for the warning.

883
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,340
干杯
Hmm. Cheers.

884
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,080
下一个表演并不是魔术
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

885
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,460
不过这个表演很安全
What you're about to see is considered safe.

886
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,660
伟大的丹顿大师
Oh! The Great Danton.

887
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,340
(大师在潘提剧场表演)

888
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,710
我在此致歉
I apologize.

889
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,610
我在对街的表演太精彩
There simply is too much magic...

890
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,780
不小心把自己变到这里来
...for my stage at The Pantages across the street.

891
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,690
太棒了!

892
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:02,260
抱歉打扰了
Pardon my intrusion.

893
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,760
-太棒了 -放过他吧
-And go easy on the poor chap.

894
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:09,030
他已经很努力了
He does try so very hard.

895
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,470
我不知道波登怎么找到他的
I don't know how Borden found him.

896
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,440
我很小心把他藏好
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

897
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,540
还是被他找到了
Yeah,well,he did.

898
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,470
是她泄的密吗?
Do you think it was her?

899
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,550
你没料到是我吧?
You weren't expecting me?

900
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,390
你来晚了  你明明约下午
I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

901
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,650
最近我的行动不便
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

902
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,650
他从我身边夺走一切
He's taken everything from me.

903
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,700
妻子  事业  还有你
My wife,my career now you.

904
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,860
是你派我来的
You sent me.

905
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,900
我派你 是要你偷他的秘诀  不是帮助他
I sent you to steal his secret,not to improve his act.

906
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:45,540
-那是我的工作 -或是爱上他
-It's my job. -Or fall in love!

907
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,270
-我照你的话去做 -是吗?
-I did everything you asked! -Yes? Yes?

908
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,970
-他到底用什么手法? -柯特说的对  他用替身
-How does he do it? -Cutter was right,a double.

909
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,410
-波登当然这么说 -他什么都没说
-'Course he said that. -He didn't say it.

910
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,350
我看到化妆  眼镜  假发 我们没用到  不过都藏在后台
I've seen things,makeup,glasses,wigs. We don't use for the show. I've seen it hidden backstage. Misdirection.

911
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,320
他故意让你误以为他用替身
He leaves them lying around to make you think that.

912
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,260
随时随地吗?不可能
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

913
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,400
随时随地  他就是这种人
All the time,Olivia! That's who he is!

914
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,860
你不懂吗?
That's what it takes!

915
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:11,400
他一直在演戏
He lives his act,don't you see?

916
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,730
他跟你上床不代表他信任你
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

917
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,240
你以为你什么都知道?
You think you can see everything,don't you?

918
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:23,040
丹顿大师是睁眼瞎子 这是他的笔记
The Great Danton is a blind fool. His notebook.

919
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,240
你偷的?
You stole it?

920
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,180
借来的 只有今晚
I borrowed it for tonight.

921
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,380
我想你可以翻译...
I thought you could translate some of it...

922
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,540
-不行 -你不行?
I can't.

923
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,560
没人能翻译  这是字谜
No one can. It's a cipher.

924
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:38,990
就算有关键字  也得花几个月
Even with the keyword,it will take months to decode.

925
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,100
-没有关键字呢? -那就没辙了
-And without the keyword? -Perhaps never.

926
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,670
-等着瞧吧 -不能等了
-We'll see. -We will not see.

927
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,770
我明早不放回去 他就知道是我偷的
If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it.

928
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,100
-离开他 -不行  他知道我住哪里
-Leave him. -I can't. He knows where I live.

929
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,440
这是他的日记
This is his diary,Olivia.

930
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,240
他的秘密都掌握在我手里
All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

931
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,480
这不能让你妻子复生
It won't bring your wife back.

932
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,810
我才不在乎  我只要他的秘密
I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.

933
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,430
听着
Look,I'll,um...

934
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,630
我去他的工作室布置成闯空门
I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

935
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,970
-他会知道是你拿走的 -对  是我  不是你
-He'll know you took it. -Yes,me. Not you.

936
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,900
懂吗?
Understand?

937
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,440
劳勃?
Robert.

938
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,680
我已经爱上他了
I have fallen in love with him.

939
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,390
那我就知道你有多为难了
Then I know how hard this has been for you.

940
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,860
他偷了笔记?
Notebook?

941
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,740
他不会就此罢手
Then he's just getting started.

942
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:01,340
(潘提剧场)

943
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,800
晚安
Good evening.

944
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,140
-能说句话吗? -大师

945
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,510
我今晚走路回家
I'm walking tonight.

946
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,580
让他来吧  我不在乎
Let him come. I don't care.

947
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,150
-大师 -大师
Professor! Professor!

948
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,380
-你没事吧? -死不了
-You all right? -I'm alive.

949
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,640
这样就省得我开个通风孔
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

950
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:27,190
-我很佩服你 -为什么?
-I'm impressed. -Why is that?

951
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,850
你终于动手杀生了
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

952
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,200
这就是伟大魔术的代价
It's what a good trick costs,Angier.

953
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,700
冒险
Risk

954
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,100
牺牲
sacrifice

955
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,300
不给我我要的  只有你会被牺牲
The sacrifice,I'm afraid,is all gonna be yours  unless you give me what I want.

956
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,840
-你要什么? -你的秘密
-Which is? -Your secret.

957
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,250
我的秘密?
My secret?

958
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,680
移形遁影术的手法
Your method for The Transported Man.

959
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,450
法隆不肯说  他根本不会说话
Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all.

960
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,880
你拿到我的笔记
You have my notebook.

961
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,990
少了关键字也没用
Useless without the keyword.

962
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,120
写出你的手法
Write down your method,Mr. Borden

963
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,160
详细写出来
describe it in full.

964
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,840
我要你的手法  不只是关键字
I want the whole method,not the keyword.

965
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,410
你的笔记也许根本没记载
I don't know if your secret's in your notebook.

966
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,850
关键字就是我的手法
The keyword is the method.

967
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,820
我的机关师呢?
Where's my ingueieur?

968
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,570
-他还活着吗? -看你能挖多快
-Alive? -How fast can you dig?

969
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,110
法隆  听得见吗? 法隆!
Fallon,you hear me? Fallon!

970
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,070
-你的手臂怎样? -幸好还在
-How's the arm? -Still attached.

971
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,940
-找到你的答案了吗? -我们的答案
Did you find your answer?

972
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,910
我还没看  我们一起看
Our answer,Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

973
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,550
我已经知道他是怎么变的
I already know how he does it,Robert.

974
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,590
他一贯的手法  跟我们一样
Same way he always has,the same way as we do.

975
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,120
但是你却不死心
It's just that you want something more.

976
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,850
我们一起看吧  好吗?
Well,let's find out then,shall we?

977
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,700
这是什么意思?
What does it mean?

978
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,530
(泰斯拉)

979
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,040
意思就是 我们得去旅行
It means,Cutter,we have a journey ahead of us.

980
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,940
-到美国 -劳勃
-To America. -Robert?

981
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,240
听我说
Listen to me.

982
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,550
着魔是年轻人玩的游戏
Obsession is a young man's game.

983
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,660
-别这么说 -我没办法再帮你了
-Come on. -I can't follow you any further in it.

984
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,620
不行了  很抱歉
I can't,I'm sorry.

985
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,420
我只好一个人去了
Then the rest is up to me.

986
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,160
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

987
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,050
晚安  你好 亲爱的
Good evening. Hello,darling.

988
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,580
来瓶最好的香槟
Champagne,your finest.

989
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,720
我不知道会有客人
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

990
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:01,820
-当然  大家要好好庆祝 -温小姐
-Absolutely,we are celebrating. -Miss Wenscombe

991
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,920
法隆先生 我们要庆祝什么?
Mr. Fallon.  What are we celebrating?

992
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,530
我们有新的魔术  对吧?
We've hit upon a new trick. Haven't we?

993
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,600
-佛迪  什么魔术? -是啊  佛迪  什么魔术?
-What trick,Freddie? -Yes,Freddie,what trick?

994
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:15,030
我每天晚上要把自己活埋
I am going to bury myself alive every night

995
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,970
然后找人来把我挖出来
and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.

996
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,040
-我老公酒喝多了 -倒香槟  来吧
-I think he's had quite enough...-No,pour the champagne.

997
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,940
莎拉  别把我当三岁小孩
Pour the...Sarah,don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child.

998
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,050
-我最好先走...-法隆
-Perhaps it would be better...-Mr. Fallon

999
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,280
请送温小姐回家 我老公很没礼貌
escort her home. My husband's being a bore. Oh,please.

1000
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,550
何必让你们受罪
I see no reason you should suffer.

1001
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,020
别这么扫兴嘛
Don't ruin this evening.

1002
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:42,050
晚安  波登夫人 晚安  佛迪
Good night,Mrs. Borden. Good night,Freddie.

1003
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,990
-佛迪? -那是我的名字
-Freddie? -That's my name.

1004
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:52,440
-在家里不是 -我又不常在家  对吧?
-Not at home. -I'm not always at home,am I?

1005
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:56,310
你至少可以卸掉假胡子吧?
Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1006
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,140
莎拉  我才刚表演完
Sarah,I just came from the bloody theater just now.

1007
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,010
大家都喜欢我这个模样
All right? I'm out in public.

1008
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,310
-大家都喜欢 -你怎么会变成这样?
-Everybody else loves it. -Why are you being like this?

1009
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,250
我今天真的很不顺
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1010
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,050
差点失去一件
I thought that something very precious...

1011
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:15,130
很宝贵的东西
...had been lost to me.

1012
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,390
我只想稍微庆祝一下
So I just wanted to celebrate just a little.

1013
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,830
什么?
All right,what?

1014
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,730
你失去什么?
What did you lose?

1015
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,680
又是更多的秘密
I see,more secrets.

1016
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:32,740
莎拉  秘密是我的生活重心
Sarah,secrets are my life.

1017
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,810
-我们的生活 -艾佛  别再演了
-Our life. -No,Alfred,stop

1018
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:40,510
这不是你  别再演了
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1019
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,270
我以为我是唯一的客人
I thought I had the place to myself.

1020
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,820
有个不速之客
Unexpected guests

1021
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:12,420
很没礼貌  问一大堆问题
not very polite. A lot of questions.

1022
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,220
我以为他们替政府工作
At first,I thought they worked for the government.

1023
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,260
-不是吗? -更糟
-No? -Worse

1024
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,620
他们是爱迪生的手下
they work for Thomas Edison.

1025
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,400
今天有不寻常的发展
Today,a most curious development.

1026
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:27,590
他的女助手来找我
His assistant came to us with a proposition.

1027
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:31,670
安杰派她来  承认自己卧底
Obviously,Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.

1028
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,570
他喜欢躲在台下吗?
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1029
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,410
他派我来偷你秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密
He sent me here to steal your secrets,but I've come to offer you his.

1030
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,480
这是实话吗?
This is the truth is it?

1031
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,930
不  这是他叫我说的
No,that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1032
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,900
其实我是爱他的  一直在帮他
...is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you

1033
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:01,440
但是他把我当跑腿小妹派我来
like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1034
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,270
我恨他这样对我
I hate him for that.

1035
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,440
我从大老远就看出安杰的手法
I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1036
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,640
你能给我什么?
So,what could you possibly have to offer me?

1037
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,920
你或许知道他的手法 但是你不懂
You may know his tricks but you can't understand

1038
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,560
大家看不出你比较厉害 你把断指包起来
why no one sees yours are better. You hide this.

1039
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,660
我要很仔细看才看得出来
I had to look very closely to spot it during The Transported Man

1040
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:24,460
不过这是你的优势
but this makes you unique.

1041
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,790
这代表你没有用替身
It shows you aren't using a double.

1042
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,060
别把手包起来  要大方秀出来
You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly.

1043
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:33,500
你只用一只手变魔术一定很厉害
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1044
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:36,000
对  没错
Yeah,it does.

1045
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,100
你要让大家知道
So let people know.

1046
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:44,510
你比他高杆  我可以教你怎么成名
You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how.

1047
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,810
我想她说的是真话
I think she's telling the truth.

1048
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,820
不过我们不能信任她
I think we cannot trust her.

1049
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:56,830
但是我爱她  也需要她
But I love her. I need her.

1050
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,190
打开心房接受这段感情
To open myself to such a relationship

1051
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:05,240
面对外遇的危险
to the dangers of such an affair

1052
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:10,110
我必须确认她对我忠贞不二
I need assurances of fidelity,of love.

1053
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:12,700
该怎么确信呢?
But how to be sure?

1054
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,350
我有个方法 那是了解她心意的唯一方法
I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.

1055
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,180
他怎么舍得让你离开?
How could he send you away?

1056
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,920
她必须帮我们除掉安杰
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1057
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,670
今天我的情妇证明了她的真心
Today,my mistress proves her truthfulness.

1058
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,140
不是向我证明
Not to me,you understand.

1059
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,270
她带我去找路特时 我就相信她了
I've been convinced since she led me to Root.

1060
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:46,240
今天她在你面前证明她爱我
Today,Olivia proves her love for me to you,Angier.

1061
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,310
没错  安杰
Yes,Angier

1062
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,780
是我要她把笔记交给你
she gave you this notebook at my request.

1063
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:56,120
"泰斯拉"只是关键字  不是秘诀
And yes,"Tesla" is merely the key to my dairy  not to my trick.

1064
01:22:56,290 --> 01:23:00,820
你以为我会轻易把秘诀给你?
You really think I'd part with my secret so easily after so much?

1065
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,220
再见  安杰
Goodbye,Angier.

1066
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,490
祝你在美国的新家找到安慰
May you find solace for your forward ambition back in your American home.

1067
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,180
泰斯拉...
Tesla!

1068
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,380
泰斯拉...艾利  艾利...
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1069
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:26,750
泰斯拉根本没打造我要的机器
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.

1070
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,650
-我们没说他有啊 -但你让我认为他有
-I never said he had. -You let me believe that he had.

1071
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,450
你们资金用完  所以骗我的钱
You stole my money because your funding was cut off.

1072
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:36,390
拿我的高帽做实验  一边嘲笑我
You've been shooting sparks in my top hat

1073
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,030
一边拿我的钱来花
laughing at me all along,while using my money to stave off ruin.

1074
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,000
-我看到爱迪生的人 -在哪里?
-I have seen Edison's men. -Where?

1075
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:45,140
旅馆  我大可以把他们带来
In the hotel,I have a mind to bring them up here.

1076
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,330
这么做很不明智  安杰
That would be unwise,Mr. Angier.

1077
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,540
你的确是我们最后的金主
It is true that you are our last remaining financier

1078
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,480
但是我们没偷你的钱
but we have not stolen your money.

1079
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,010
我的猫
This is my cat.

1080
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,150
我说能做出你要的机器是实话
When I told you I could make you a machine,I spoke a truth.

1081
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,720
-那机器为什么没有用? -科学不是绝对
-Why isn't it working? -Because exact science,Mr. Angier

1082
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:02,190
它充满变数
is not an exact science.

1083
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,450
机器不一定能正常运作
The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1084
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,890
需要进行更多实验
-It requires further examination.

1085
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,660
-我的高帽在哪里? -就在这里
-So where did my top hat go? -Nowhere.

1086
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:13,600
试了十几次
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1087
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,100
帽子一直在这里
The hat went nowhere.

1088
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,210
我们必须试不同的东西
We need to try different material.

1089
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:21,040
才可能有不同的结果
It may provoke a different result.

1090
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,640
猫咪  过来
Great.

1091
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,320
我的猫出了事你要负责  博士
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal,doctor.

1092
01:24:56,410 --> 01:25:00,080
我只希望我的钱花得很值得
I hope whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile

1093
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:02,190
泰斯拉先生
Mr. Tesla.

1094
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,300
艾利
Alley!

1095
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:02,940
机器真的有用
So the machine was working?

1096
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,640
我没去检查  因为帽子都没动
I never checked the calibration,'cause the hat never moved.

1097
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:09,880
事情总是很难如你所愿
These things never quite work as you expect them to.

1098
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,220
这也是科学原则
That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1099
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:15,760
我要花几个星期解决问题
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1100
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:18,120
好了就通知你
We'll send word when it's ready.

1101
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,430
别忘了你的帽子
Don't forget your hat.

1102
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,030
-哪一顶是我的? -都是你的  安杰先生
-Well,which one is mine? -They are all your hats.

1103
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,950
你穿这件新衣服好漂亮哦
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1104
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:39,980
-我们要去动物园吗? -爸爸有别的事情要办
-Are we going to the zoo? -No,Daddy has some errands to run.

1105
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,140
-你答应过我 -是吗?
-But you promised. -I promised,did I?

1106
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,480
那就去动物园吧
Then go to the zoo,we shall.

1107
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,960
我先去办事  马上就回来
Daddy will go run his errands,and I'll be back before you know it.

1108
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:51,830
你去准备好 我们去看黑猩猩
So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1109
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,260
莎拉
Sarah

1110
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,460
你在做什么?
what are you doing?

1111
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,140
我们各自有沉迷的事情
Each of us have our vices.

1112
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,950
莎拉  不管你怎么想
Sarah,whatever you may think...

1113
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,720
你唯一的对手是我们的女儿
your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1114
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,220
我爱你  永远爱你 我只爱你
I love you. I will always love you and you alone.

1115
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,460
-你今天是真心的 -一点也没错
-You mean it today. -Absolutely.

1116
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:29,600
当你骗我会让我更痛苦
Which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1117
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,010
又要买东西? 她真是爱钱
More shopping. She does love the smell of money.

1118
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,620
女儿想去动物园  你带她去吧
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,so I thought you could take her,yeah?

1119
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:48,780
不然我明天可以带她去
I mean,I can do it tomorrow,if not.

1120
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,420
莎拉已经知道了
And,uh...Sarah  she knows.

1121
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,460
她知道事情有点不对劲
Uh,at least she knows that something is not right

1122
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:02,090
请你尽量帮我安抚她的情绪
so if you can just do whatever you can to help me.

1123
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,210
说服她我是真的爱她
Talk to her,just convince her that I do love her.

1124
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:21,210
-佛迪  怎么了? -别这样叫我  拜托
-What is it,Freddie? -Listen,don't call me that,please.

1125
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,450
没事  只是有时
It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong.

1126
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:26,320
-有时我觉得很内疚 -我说过
I told you,when you're with me

1127
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,290
跟我一起心里只能有我
you're with me.

1128
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,590
你回家再想你的家人
Leave your family at home where they belong.

1129
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,470
我一直在试
I'm trying.

1130
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,130
我一直在试  我很努力
I'm trying,Olivia.

1131
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,800
-我要换衣服了 -好
-I'll get dressed. -Yeah.

1132
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:41,200
我看见法隆在附近晃
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1133
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:43,640
我对他不太信任
There's something about that man I don't trust.

1134
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,780
你信任我吗?那就信任法隆
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1135
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,510
他保护我在乎的东西
He protects the things that I care about.

1136
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:30,160
很遗憾你要离开了  安先生
We're sorry to see you go,Mr. Angier.

1137
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,890
真遗憾泰斯拉也要离开
We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave,as well.

1138
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,060
他对这地方贡献良多
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1139
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:41,510
安先生 我没告诉爱迪生手下有关箱子的事
Mr. Angier  I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1140
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,200
什么箱子?
What box?

1141
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,560
(安杰先生收)

1142
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:12,000
很抱歉离开之前没向你道别
I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye.

1143
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:16,640
但我在这里已经不受欢迎
But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.

1144
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:21,850
科学和工业界不能容忍前卫科技
The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.

1145
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:27,450
大概只有你的魔术能受到肯定 观众喜欢解不开的谜
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field  where people are happy to be mystified.

1146
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,520
你会在箱子里找到你要的
You will find what you are looking for in this box.

1147
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,990
艾利写了详细的使用说明书
Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.

1148
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,790
我对你只有一个建议
I add only one suggestion on using the machine.

1149
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,900
毁了这具机器
Destroy it.

1150
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:46,160
将它丢进最深的海底
Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.

1151
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,540
它只会带给你不幸
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1152
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:57,140
如泰斯拉所料  他无视他的警告
Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.

1153
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,250
今天我要测试机器
Today I tested the machine.

1154
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,880
预防它运作时出问题
Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1155
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:08,890
如果出事  我不想那样过活
But if it went wrong  I would not want to live like that for long.

1156
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:31,580
这就是偷天换日的步骤 我要遗弃你了  波登
But here at the turn,I must leave you,Borden.

1157
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,910
没错  就是你  波登
Yes,you,Borden

1158
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:36,320
坐在牢房
sitting there in your cell

1159
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:40,520
读着我的日记 因为谋杀我
reading my diary,awaiting your death

1160
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,750
等待死亡的来临
for my murder.

1161
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,170
安杰的日记  那是假的
Angier's journal,that gesture of good faith,that's a fake.

1162
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:55,300
我向你保证是真的 来历很清楚  没有疑问
I assure you,it's not. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1163
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:00,040
比对之后证实是安杰的笔迹
And it's written in Angier's own hand,for which we have numerous examples.

1164
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,780
无所谓了
It don't matter.

1165
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:08,760
这是我的秘诀
So my tricks.

1166
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,790
-全部的戏法 -包括移形遁影术?
-All of them. -Including The Transported Man?

1167
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,930
卡德洛爵士会很高兴
-Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. -No,he won't.

1168
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,590
他不会的  因为不完整
They're not complete.

1169
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,370
只有以虚代实和偷天换日
It's just the pledge and the turn for each.

1170
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,140
没有化腐朽为神奇的秘诀
Without the prestige for these tricks,these are worthless.

1171
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:30,080
-根本就一文不值 -没错
Yeah.

1172
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:34,210
想要的话就带我女儿来
You get the rest of it...when you bring my daughter here.

1173
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,150
我想跟她说再见
I want to say goodbye.

1174
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,750
不  我们必须谈谈
We have to go through it now.

1175
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,090
我们必须谈谈
We have to go through it now.

1176
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,520
你可以尽管否认
Now,listen to me,deny it all you want.

1177
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,990
我根本就不爱奥莉薇雅
Olivia means nothing.

1178
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,860
-我需要助手  不能没有助手 -我会告诉她...
-Olivia? -I need an assistant.

1179
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,730
-我会告诉她...-告诉她什么?
-I'll go to her,I'll tell her. -You'll tell her what?

1180
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,600
我知道你的秘密
I know what you really are,Alfred.

1181
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,010
-我再也无法...-莎拉  莎拉
-I know. -Sarah,Sarah,Sarah.

1182
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,440
-我再也无法隐瞒下去 -别胡说八道
-I can't keep it in. -You can't talk like this.

1183
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,240
莎拉  住嘴 莎拉  住嘴
-No. No. -Sarah,shut up! Sarah,shut up!

1184
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,040
我不想再听了
I don't want to hear it anymore.

1185
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:10,240
你不能这样
You can't talk like this.

1186
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,020
你瞒不住的  因为我知道
You can't hide it anymore,because I know,Alfred,I know.

1187
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,890
我知道你的真面目
I know what you really are

1188
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,760
艾佛
Alfred.

1189
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,630
我不能这样过活
I can't live like this.

1190
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,770
你觉得我可以这样过活?
Oh,well,you think I can live like this?

1191
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:27,060
我很享受这种生活吗?
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1192
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,830
我们有房子  有女儿
We have this beautiful house,lovely little girl,we're married.

1193
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,270
你的生活有什么不好?
What is so wrong with your life?

1194
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,940
我不要这种生活
Alfred,I can't live like this!

1195
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,980
你到底要我怎么样?
Well,what do you want from me?

1196
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,250
我要...
I...I want...

1197
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,550
我要你对我诚实
I want you to be...honest with me.

1198
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:53,290
不耍魔术
No tricks.

1199
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:57,330
不说谎话
No lies.

1200
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,730
没有秘密
And no secrets.

1201
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,680
你爱我吗?
Do you...do you love me?

1202
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,250
今天不爱
Not today.

1203
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,280
我不爱你
No.

1204
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,290
(奥德维奇路 230号 伦敦)

1205
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,250
是谁?
Who's there?

1206
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,160
我来找位老朋友
I'm looking for an old friend.

1207
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,460
听说有一场表演
I heard about a booking,nice little theater

1208
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:05,790
不错的小戏院  魔术界的新秀
good up-and-coming magician.

1209
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,440
-你回来了 -见到你真好  约翰
-You're back.  -It's good to see you,John.

1210
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:11,970
不错的排练场
Good rehearsal space.

1211
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,770
瞎子助手  我喜欢
Blind stagehands,I like it.

1212
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,380
你一向都很会耍宣传噱头
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1213
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,910
我需要你的帮忙
I need your help,John.

1214
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:21,780
我最后的表演  限定场次
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1215
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,480
你最后的表演?
Your last show?

1216
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,480
一位智者说着魔是年轻人的游戏
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.

1217
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:28,650
我差不多完成了
I'm almost done.

1218
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,390
只剩一件事
There's one thing left.

1219
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,830
真正的移形遁影术
The Real Transported Man.

1220
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,670
你想要为它设计一场表演
You want to design a show around it?

1221
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,600
我不要你在幕后 这次我要你在外面办事
I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing.

1222
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:44,300
我要你动用你所有的关系
Call in any favors or connections you have left

1223
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,070
-敲定表演场地 -你要哪一种剧院?
-to get us the right booking. -What sort of booking you after?

1224
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,480
波登会注意到的大剧院
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1225
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,580
能再见到你真是我的荣幸
Oh,what an honor it is to see you again,sir.

1226
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,090
你说有一个魔术会让我很感兴趣
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest.

1227
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,320
-非常巧妙的魔术 -幸会了  艾克曼先生
-It's a very clever trick. -Pleased to meet you,Mr. Ackerman.

1228
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,330
彼此彼此  开始吧 各位
Likewise,I'm sure. Let's get on,shall we?

1229
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,170
开动机器了 先生们
Turn it on,gentlemen.

1230
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,100
很漂亮
Very pretty.

1231
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:36,730
就这样?他就这样消失了?
That's it,Cutter? He simply disappears?

1232
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,730
这不是魔术啊! 他必须回来啊!
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1233
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,370
-他必须...-化腐朽为神奇?
-There has to be a...-A prestige?

1234
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,560
没错
Exactly.

1235
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,530
原谅我
Pardon me.

1236
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,740
很难得见到...
It's very rare to see...

1237
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,610
真正的魔术
...real magic.

1238
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,080
-我有很多年没见到...-有兴趣帮助我们吗?
-It's been many years since...-Are you interested in helping us?

1239
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,750
当然
Yes.

1240
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,690
不过你得稍微包装一下
but you'll have to dress it up a little.

1241
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,990
加一点伪装
Disguise it.

1242
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,030
让观众有怀疑的理由
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1243
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,100
你都没谈到莎拉  半句也没有
You haven't spoken about her,Freddie,not once.

1244
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,860
我们为什么要谈她?
Why would I talk about her to you,hm?

1245
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:22,430
她曾是你生命的一部分
Because she was a part of your life

1246
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,770
现在她死了
and now she's gone.

1247
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,980
她自杀前一天说她想见我
You know,the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1248
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:34,250
她想告诉我关于你的事
That she had something to tell me about you.

1249
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:37,750
但是我没胆量  不敢去见她
I was such a coward,I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1250
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,590
不过...
But...

1251
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,960
她想跟我说什么?
...what would she have said?

1252
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:46,030
你想知道我的真相?
You want to know the truth about me?

1253
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:50,660
真相是...
The truth is that...

1254
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,060
我从来没爱过莎拉
...I never loved Sarah.

1255
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,770
我不爱她
I never loved her.

1256
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,280
-你娶了她  你们有个孩子 -那是一半的我
You married her,you had a child with her.

1257
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:04,140
有一半是我  另一半不是我
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did,but the other part didn't.

1258
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,650
这个我遇见了你  坐在你面前
The part that found you,the part that's sitting here right now.

1259
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:09,780
我爱的是你
I love you. No,Olivia,I love you.

1260
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,660
我爱你  这才是真相
That's the truth.

1261
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:16,230
这个真相才重要
That is the truth that matters.

1262
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,630
你也很可能在另一家餐厅
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now

1263
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,390
对别的女人这么说我
talking about me that way.

1264
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:24,560
-不会 -你会的
-No. -Yes.

1265
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:32,710
你冷酷得真没人性
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1266
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:41,690
他回来了 事隔两年
He's back. After two years

1267
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:45,520
他有了新魔术 大家都说是前所未见的表演
he's got a new trick. They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1268
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:51,260
你该看看你的表情  大师
You should see the look on your face,Professor.

1269
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:54,100
你应该去见他
You should go to him.

1270
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:56,640
你们俩是绝配
You two deserve each other.

1271
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,540
有人订下我的剧院 莫斯科芭蕾舞团要演到明年
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year.

1272
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,310
取消他们的演出 我要做一百场演出
Then get rid of them. There will be 100 performances

1273
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,180
不多也不少
no more,no less.

1274
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,790
每周五场  没有下午场
Five performances a week,no matinees.

1275
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:17,630
这是门票的价格  祝愉快
That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day.

1276
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,910
各位我今晚的...
Ladies and gentlemen...

1277
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:45,750
第一个表演非常危险
my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk.

1278
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,950
怕看到有人被淹死的观众
Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown

1279
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:52,150
请离席
should leave now.

1280
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:55,300
教我这招魔术的女孩
When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion

1281
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:57,060
在表演时溺死
actually died performing it

1282
01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:00,430
你们应该了解这有多危险
you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.

1283
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,400
开始吧
Let's begin.

1284
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:18,150
我在旅行中看见了未来
In my travels,I have seen the future.

1285
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:22,120
非常奇异的未来
And it is a strange future,indeed.

1286
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:24,890
各位先生女士
The world,ladies and gentlemen

1287
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:30,360
这世界面临崭新骇人的可能性
is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities.

1288
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:54,090
你们即将目睹的不是魔术
What you're about to witness is not magic.

1289
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:55,730
而是纯粹的科学见证
It's purely science.

1290
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:58,530
尽管上台来
I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now

1291
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,600
亲自检查这台机器
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1292
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:00,250
人类的成就远远超过想像力
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1293
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:01,620
太棒了!
Bravo!

1294
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,190
太棒了!
Bravo!

1295
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:14,200
太棒了!
Bravo!

1296
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:24,110
一百场演出
One hundred performances. Why?

1297
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,580
为什么? 受限于手法?
Does his method dictate that?

1298
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,650
或是宣传伎俩?
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1299
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:33,520
他只是个瘪脚的魔术师 凭什么被称为英国顶尖大师?
He's a no-talent magician,and they call him the bloody best in England. Why?

1300
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,360
一秒钟移形五十码?
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1301
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:39,500
我只知道他用暗门
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1302
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:43,870
太厉害了 舞台底下有什么玄机?
Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?!

1303
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,840
你为什么猜不到?
Why can't you out-think him?

1304
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,080
每晚演出后
They do this every night

1305
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:06,420
都偷偷把它运走?
after each performance. Yeah?

1306
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:35,040
(真正的移形遁影术)

1307
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,420
我们没辙了
We're done.

1308
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,030
好吗?
All right?

1309
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,090
让他变他的
Let him have his trick.

1310
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:46,700
我不要他的秘诀
I don't need his secret.

1311
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,430
所以...
So...

1312
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:52,670
别去了  离他远点
...don't go back there,you leave him alone.

1313
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,040
我们俩都离他远一点
Both of us...just leave him alone.

1314
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:57,680
我们输了
We're done.

1315
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,590
我说过  约翰
I told you,John.

1316
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,690
我不要你到后台
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1317
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,960
尽管上台
I would like to invite you onstage now

1318
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:17,260
亲自检查这台机器
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1319
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:50,690
-你想去哪里? -我是表演的一部分  猪头
-Hey,where do you think...? -I'm part of the bloody act,you fool.

1320
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:01,510
那是谁?
Who was that?

1321
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:02,760
钥匙在哪里?  钥匙在哪里?
Where's the bloody key?! Where's the bloody key?!

1322
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:05,210
在瞎子那里

1323
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:08,940
钥匙在哪里?  他快淹死了!
Where's the bloody key?! He's bloody drowning!

1324
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:20,260
撑着点
Hold on!

1325
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,960
你做了什么?
What have you done?

1326
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:53,230
艾佛波登 你被判谋杀劳勃安杰有罪
Alfred Borden,you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1327
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,020
将被判处绞刑至死
You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1328
01:47:57,830 --> 01:48:00,820
愿主让你的灵魂安息
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1329
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,230
柯特先生
Mr. Cutter?

1330
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,270
我是欧文
Owens.

1331
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,140
谢谢你赶来
Oh,thank you for coming,Mr. Owens.

1332
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:13,610
我必须处理安杰的魔术道具
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1333
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,370
我发现多半都...
But I notice from this manifest

1334
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:19,010
被卡德洛爵士买走了
that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1335
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:23,120
你想知道东西要送到哪里...
Mr. Cutter,if you need to know where to deliver these items...

1336
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:26,590
不  只是有一件道具
No,it's just there is one particular item

1337
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,790
就是这一件 我想要...
this item,in fact  I would like to...

1338
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,960
-你想要怎样? -买下来.
-You would like to? -buy.

1339
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,070
-你想买? -对  没错
-Buy yourself? -Yeah,I suppose so.

1340
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,240
-就是这台机器? -是的
-This is the machine? -Yes.

1341
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:42,840
恐怕卡德洛爵士会不肯割爱
Well,I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item.

1342
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:46,010
我能跟卡爵士私下谈一下吗?
Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1343
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:48,850
想都别想
Out of the question,I'm afraid.

1344
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,150
不过
Of course

1345
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:56,220
如果你在运送过程...
I suppose if,in the course of your delivery arrangements

1346
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:58,830
无意间遇见他
your paths were to cross

1347
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:03,160
-我也不能阻止你们说话 -谢谢你
-I can't stop you speaking your mind. -Thank you.

1348
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:06,860
-你还在啊  波登 -是啊
-Still here,Borden? -For now.

1349
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,560
你有访客
You got a visitor.

1350
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,730
卡德洛爵士
Lord Caldlow.

1351
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,670
带着一个小女孩
With a little girl.

1352
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,780
洁丝?
Jess?

1353
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,440
亲爱的
Hello,my love.

1354
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,020
你好吗? 我好想你哦
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1355
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,220
法隆也想你  我们都想你
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1356
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,620
爸爸  我能进去吗?
Daddy,can I come in there?

1357
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,760
现在不行  不行 甜心
Not right now. Not right now,darling.

1358
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:39,460
放心  一切都不会有事的
No,but everything is gonna be all right.

1359
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,570
-你一定是卡德洛爵士 -卡洛德
-You must be Lord Caldlow? -Caldlow.

1360
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,030
我就是
Yes  I am.

1361
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,370
我一直都是
I always have been.

1362
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:52,580
他们还替你戴手铐啊  艾佛
They flatter you with all those chains.

1363
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:55,720
他们难道不知道 你没有小皮球绝对逃不了吗?
Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball?

1364
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,010
我把你...
I pulled you out...

1365
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,710
从水箱拉出来
out of that tank.

1366
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:02,550
我只想证明我比你厉害
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician.

1367
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:04,590
你却不放过我
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1368
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,460
我不知道你做了什么
I don't know what you've done.

1369
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:13,830
不过你不怕杀生弄脏手了
But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore,are you?

1370
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:15,840
是啊  再也不怕了
No,not anymore.

1371
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,240
而且我赢了
And I win.

1372
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,610
因为没有人在乎消失的人
No one cares about the man in the box,the man who disappears.

1373
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,770
你赢了?
You win?

1374
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:27,720
这不是对决  事关我女儿的未来
This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1375
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:30,950
你不能把她扯进来
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1376
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,960
我了解心爱的人
Oh,I know how hard it is to have someone so special

1377
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,750
被人夺走的感受
taken away from you,don't I,Borden?

1378
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,220
你死了就不能带她走了
And you can't take it with you,now,can you?

1379
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,160
我会好好照顾她的
Oh,she'll be looked after.

1380
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:46,830
-再见了  来吧 -不...别走...你瞧
-Goodbye,Professor. Come on,darling. -No,no,no,no,stop,my darling.

1381
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:48,300
拿去
Look,here.

1382
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,500
这是你一直想要的东西
That's what you're after.

1383
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,770
一切都是为了这个
That's what this is about.

1384
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,210
拿去吧
Take it.

1385
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,310
-你的秘诀? -对
-Your secret? -Yeah.

1386
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,720
你一直都比我高杆
You always were the better magician.

1387
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,380
我们都很清楚
We both know that.

1388
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,250
但是不管你有什么秘诀 你得承认
Whatever your secret was,you have to agree

1389
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:09,520
我的魔术比你厉害
mine is better.

1390
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:14,630
别这么做...洁丝
Don't do this. Don't do this,Angier. Jess,Jess!

1391
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,190
我答应要带你回家 我保证
Jess,I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.

1392
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:20,840
-拜托 -我保证  瞧
-For God's sake. -I promise. Look!

1393
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:26,210
我保证
I promise.

1394
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,010
我爱你  洁丝 我爱你
I love you,Jess. I love you.

1395
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,380
-来吧 -我爱你  洁丝
-Come on. -I love you. I love you,Jess.

1396
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:35,890
安杰  安杰
Angier! Angier!

1397
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,050
你以为这地方困得住我吗?
What,do you think this place can hold me?

1398
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:41,090
安杰  我会被吊死
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1399
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:44,360
我会被吊死  你可以阻止他们
And you can put a stop to this now!

1400
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,620
-听着!听着!那个人 -闭嘴
Listen! Listen! That man...

1401
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,230
那个人是大家以为 被我杀死的人
Listen,that man is the one I'm in for killing!

1402
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,340
猪头  听我说
Listen!

1403
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:53,440
-他没死  我就没罪 -警卫
-If he's alive,I'm not guilty!

1404
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:55,770
-我没罪! -抓住他
-I'm not guilty! -I don't care!

1405
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:57,930
-再见了  大师 -安杰!
-Get hold of him. -Angier!

1406
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,380
出去玩吧!
Run along now.

1407
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:08,840
老爷  有位先生在等你
Sir,there's a gentleman waiting.

1408
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:25,730
老天爷
Dear God.

1409
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,200
你好  柯特
Hello,Cutter.

1410
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:30,710
你还活着
You're still alive.

1411
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,640
你怎么会没死?
How is it you're still alive?

1412
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:35,110
我看到你的尸体
I saw you on a slab,for God's sake.

1413
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,150
-孩子 -晚安  先生
-Child. -Good night,sir.

1414
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,120
晚安  洁丝
Good night,Jess.

1415
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:45,120
我见过她
I've seen her before.

1416
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:50,600
她在法庭跟法隆在一起
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1417
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,960
-你做了什么? -她需要有人照顾
-What have you done? -She needs looking after.

1418
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,400
她需要她的父亲
She needs her father.

1419
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:00,540
你害他被处死  我成了帮凶
You're letting him hang,and I helped you.

1420
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:06,620
我是来求卡爵士让我毁了机器的
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine.

1421
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:10,380
我再也不会求你做任何事了
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1422
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,820
用不着  我再也不会使用它了
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again.

1423
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:19,220
那么  卡德洛爵士
Then,Lord Caldlow...

1424
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:22,660
你要我把它运到哪里?
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1425
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:24,200
我的剧院
My theater.

1426
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:26,490
和其它道具放在一起
It belongs with the prestige materials.

1427
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,630
我试着不牵涉到你
John,I tried not to involve you.

1428
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,480
所以...
So...

1429
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,880
咱们俩要分道扬镖了
We go alone now.

1430
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,420
咱们俩...
Both of us.

1431
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:58,300
只是我不能活得像你一样久
I mean,I don't have as far to go as you.

1432
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:05,200
不能
No.

1433
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,710
你是对的  我不该去招惹他
You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick.

1434
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:13,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

1435
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:17,190
我对很多事都感到抱歉
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1436
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,450
我对不起莎拉
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1437
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,860
我不是要故意伤害她
Didn't mean to hurt her

1438
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:25,960
我不是故意的
I didn't.

1439
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:30,230
你要好好活下去  好吗?
You go live your life in full now,all right?

1440
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,930
替咱们俩活下去
You live for both of us.

1441
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:42,200
永别了
Goodbye.

1442
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:30,290
你在仔细看吗?
Are you watching closely?

1443
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:03,750
放在这里
Put it down on the end.

1444
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:41,500
想想你的伟大成就
Take a minute to consider your achievement.

1445
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:47,030
我说过一个水手溺死的感觉
I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me.

1446
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:49,300
你说他觉得就像回到家一样
Yes,he said it was like going home.

1447
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:55,250
我说谎 他说痛苦至极
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1448
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:35,960
艾佛波登
Alfred Borden

1449
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:40,090
我以英王与最高法庭之名
this day,in the name of the king and the High Court of England

1450
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,530
将你判处死刑
you will meet your end.

1451
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:47,100
没人在乎消失的人
No one cares about the man in the box.

1452
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:52,800
柯特?
Cutter?

1453
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:59,110
柯特
Cutter!

1454
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:04,320
你有什么遗言?
Do you have anything to say?

1455
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:09,330
天灵灵地灵灵
Abracadabra.

1456
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,430
你们是...
A brother?

1457
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,590
双胞胎兄弟
A twin?

1458
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:55,670
你一直伪装成法隆?
You were Fallon. The whole time?

1459
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:56,970
不
No.

1460
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:00,380
我们都是法隆
We were both Fallon.

1461
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:01,600
也都是波登
We were both Borden.

1462
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:10,690
你是消失的...
Were you the one who went into the box?

1463
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:12,650
还是现身的那个人?
Or the one who came back out?

1464
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:16,020
我们会轮流
We took turns.

1465
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,890
重点就在于我们互换身分
The trick is where we would swap.

1466
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:33,670
柯特早就知道了 但我说这太简单  太容易了
Cutter knew. Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple,too easy.

1467
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:36,470
不
No.

1468
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:39,080
或许很简单  但是不容易
Simple,maybe,but not easy.

1469
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:43,010
两个人共享一个生活并不容易
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1470
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,860
我不懂  怎么又流血了?
I don't understand,how it can be bleeding again?

1471
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:58,030
奥莉薇雅呢?你的妻子呢?
Wha...What about Olivia and your wife?

1472
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:00,940
我们各有所爱
We each loved one of them.

1473
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,670
我爱莎拉
I loved Sarah.

1474
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:09,940
他爱奥莉薇雅
He loved Olivia.

1475
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:15,550
我们各拥有一半的生活 这样对我们已经足够
We each had half of a full life  really,which was enough for us...

1476
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,490
只不过...
...just.

1477
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,090
对她们却不够
But not for them.

1478
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:28,430
自我牺牲才是精彩魔术的代价
See,sacrifice,Robert  that's the price of a good trick.

1479
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:33,700
但是你完全不能体会 不是吗?
You wouldn't know anything about that,would you?

1480
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,480
我也做了牺牲
I've...I've made sacrifices.

1481
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,410
-没有 -我有
-No. -Yes.

1482
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,980
偷学别人不用花任何力气
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.

1483
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:46,780
我尽了一切努力
Yeah,it takes everything.

1484
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,900
不  等等  我是...
No,no,wait,I'm not...

1485
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,180
这需要勇气
It took courage.

1486
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:23,520
我每晚都要鼓起勇气走进机器
It took courage to climb into that machine every night

1487
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:29,320
不知道自己会消失不见...
not knowing if I'd be the man in the box...

1488
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:33,260
或是神奇现身
...or in the prestige.

1489
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:39,700
你想看看我的代价吗?
Do you want to see what it cost me?

1490
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:43,300
你还没看过这地方吧?
You didn't see where you are,did you?

1491
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:46,110
你看  你看
Look. Look.

1492
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,210
我不在乎
I don't care.

1493
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,150
你到了世界另一端
You went halfway around the world.

1494
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:00,090
花了一大笔钱
You spent a fortune.

1495
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:04,300
做出可怕的事
You did terrible things.

1496
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:08,300
真正可怕的事
Really terrible things,Robert.

1497
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,470
结果什么都没得到
And all for nothing.

1498
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:15,410
-什么都没得到? -对
-For nothing? -Yeah.

1499
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,550
你不懂我们为什么要变魔术
You never understood why we did this.

1500
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:29,720
观众知道真相
The audience knows the truth.

1501
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:34,320
现实既残酷又悲惨
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1502
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,590
没有奇迹  没有魔法
Solid...Solid all the way through.

1503
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:45,100
但是如果你能骗倒他们 即使只有一秒钟
But if you could fool them  even for a second

1504
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,370
就能让他们惊叹
...then you could make them wonder.

1505
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:52,050
然后你就能...
And then you...

1506
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:56,940
然后你就能看到非常特别的事
Then you got to see something very special.

1507
02:03:00,830 --> 02:03:03,090
你真的不知道吗?
You really don't know.

1508
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:12,070
那就是观众脸上的表情
It was it was the look on their faces.

1509
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:32,250
每一场魔术表演都有三个步骤
Every magic trick consists of three parts,or acts.

1510
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:38,760
第一个步骤是"以虚代实"
The first part is called "the pledge."

1511
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,830
魔术师先秀出一个真实的东西
The magician shows you something ordinary.

1512
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,700
第二个步骤是"偷天换日"
The second act is called "the turn."

1513
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:50,070
魔术师利用这个普通的东西
The magician takes the ordinary something

1514
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:53,180
做出令人叹为观止的表演
and makes it into something extraordinary.

1515
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,240
但是你还不会鼓掌
But you wouldn't clap yet

1516
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:59,480
因为把东西变不见还不够
because making something disappear isn't enough.

1517
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,610
你必须把它变回来
You have to bring it back.

1518
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,080
现在你想找出秘诀
Now you're looking for the secret.

1519
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,270
但是绝对找不到 因为你没真正在看
But you won't find it,because,of course,you're not really looking.

1520
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:52,360
你并不是真的想知道
You don't really want to work it out.

1521
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,740
你想要被骗
You want to be fooled.
