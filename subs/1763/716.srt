00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:12,021
（南极，拉尔森B冰棚）

3
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,019
明白吗？

4
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,755
我相信已经掌握到

5
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:25,602
最好掌握到，钻坏了冰湟捱骂
You better. The boss wiII chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.

6
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,431
放心好了
Don't worry.

7
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,580
我们钻到廿六尺
We're at 26 feet.

8
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,518
你让泽逊去钻？
You let Jason operate the drill?

9
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,749
他应付得来
Yeah, he can handle it.

10
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,603
不关我事！
l didn't do anything.

11
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,182
伸只手过来！放开把钻！
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

12
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,592
算了，阿积！来不及！
Forget it, Jack! lt's too late!

13
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,106
你跳不回来！
You're not gonna make it!

14
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,484
阿积！
Jack!

15
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,799
阿积！伸只手上来！
Jack! Give me your hand!

16
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,033
我捉住你了！
l've got you!

17
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,179
你搞什么？
What were you thinking?

18
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,519
-发生什么事？
-整个冰棚裂开了！
-What's happening?
-The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

19
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,881
就是发生了这种事！
That's what's happening!

20
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:20,739
我们发现了一万年前出现
过灾难性气候变化的证据
We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate
shift, which occurred 1 0,000 years ago.

21
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:23,278
（新德里，联合国全球暖化会议）

22
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,083
从冰渲刑烊晃率移体的浓度K
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores...

23
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:31,619
可知暖化曾经加速，把地球K
...indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an ice age...

24
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:34,053
推入长达二百年的冰河时期
...which lasted two centuries.

25
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,292
我不明白
l'm confused.

26
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:41,432
我以为你在说全球暖化
不是冰河时期
l thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

27
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:48,004
说来矛盾，不过
全球暖化可以触发气温下降
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can
trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain.

28
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:53,206
北半球气温取决于北大西洋海流
The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate
to the North Atlantic Current.

29
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,576
海洋把太阳热力从赤道带上北方
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

30
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:03,378
全球暖化令地极冰盖溶解
减弱了暖流
But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

31
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:07,115
最终会令暖流消失
当这情况发生时K
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...

32
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,190
温暖气候也随之而消失
...there goes our warm climate.

33
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:15,128
教授，这种情况
你认为几时会出现？
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

34
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,269
我不知道，可能一百年后
可能一千年后，但我知道的是K
l don't know. Maybe in 1 00 years,
maybe in 1 000. But what l do know is...

35
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:24,773
假如我们不尽快补救
我们的子孙会付出代价
...that if we do not act soon, our children
and grandchildren will have to pay the price.

36
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,471
防止全球暖化，代价很高
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

37
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,515
全球要付出数以千亿美元
lt would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

38
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:39,147
副总统先生，置诸不理的代价更高
With all due respect, Mr. vice President, the
cost of doing nothing could be even higher.

39
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,654
地球气候是脆弱的
Our climate is fragile.

40
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,023
我们过度消耗石油，污染环境K
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment...

41
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,425
冰盖很快会消失
...the ice caps will soon disappear.

42
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,931
贺教授K
Professor Hall...

43
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,162
我们的经济同环境一样脆弱
...our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.

44
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:58,365
你未语出惊人之前
请先记住这点
Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.

45
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,075
上次断裂的冰棚K
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off...

46
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,407
有罗德岛那样大
...was about the size of Rhode lsland.

47
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,380
有些人认为那是很惊人的
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

48
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,986
防止全球暖化！防止全球暖化！
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!

49

正举行全球暖化会议的新德里K
l'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi...

50
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,019
说来难以置信，竟然下起雪来
...where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.

51
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:22,792
有史以来最冻的气候
引起一片混乱K
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos...

52

...with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.

54
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:31,235
教授，你的证供非常精采
l enjoyed your testimony, professor.
lt was very spirited.

55
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,901
多谢，这就是这次活动的目的
做一场好骚
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

56
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:40,983
我想同你讨论你的
气候突变理论
Quite. l was wondering if l could talk to you
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.

57
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,416
我叫擦臣，泰利擦臣
The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.

58
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,650
-擦臣教授？在赫兰中心工作的？
-就是我
-Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
-That's me.

59
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,520
我读过你关于海流的大作
l've read your work on ocean currents.

60
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:54,358

-当然，如果截到的士的话
-What do you say to a spot of tea?
-Absolutely. lf we can hail a cab.

What? Yeah.

69
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,241

-对
-l just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
-Yeah.

70

-Yeah? Where is 431 1 ?

浮标一定是给浪抛坏了
Must have knocked it about.

76

Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

教授，印度的旅程怎样？
Hello, professor. How was lndia?

80

你知道这些科学会议都是怎样的
Oh, you know what these

-Hello?
-l just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.

91

我知道，我也收到成绩表的副本
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

92
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,566
阿森一向是优异生，不会不合格
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

93
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,836
我现在没有时间讨论
l don't have time to talk about this now.

94
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,843
或者你应该抽空
Well, maybe you ought to make time.

95

经常失踪几个月的不是我
Excuse me, l'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.

96
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:09,914
我实在不明白
I just don't understand.

97
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,818
我会让他亲自向你解释
你明早可以送他机吗？
I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

l know you're good at rubbing people
the wrong way...

...but why would you aggravate
the vice president?

110
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,306
因为我那十七岁儿子比他更懂科学
Because my 1 7-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

111
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,136
但不是你儿子控制我们的预算
Your 1 7-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

112
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,904
-即使他恨你也无关系

-怎可能有两个版本呢？
-Do you want to hear my side of it?
-How can there be two sides?

l got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me...

122
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:51,444
-因为我没有写下计算步骤
-为什么不写？
-...because l didn't write the solutions.
-Why not?

123
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,184
我用心算
l do them in my head.

124

-你有没有告诉他？
-我有，但他不信
-Did you tell him that?
-l did. He didn't believe me.

125
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:00,126
他说他也不能用心算计出来
所以我必定是作弊
He said if he can't do them in his head,
l'm cheating.

00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,658
他不能因为不够你聪明而肥你
Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

127
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,366
我也是那样说
That's what l said.

128
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,270
你那样说？
You did?

129
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,542
-他有什么反应？
-他肥了我，记得吗？
-How'd he take it?
-He flunked me, remember?

130
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,777
对
Oh, yeah.

131
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:22,943
对不起，我不应该妄下结论
Sam, l'm sorry.
l jumped to conclusions.

132
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:27,124
我会打电话找他谈谈
l'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

133
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:28,622
我们会取回公道
We'll straighten this out.

134
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,487
喂，你不可以在这里停车
Hey, you can't park there.

135
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,890
-算了吧
-森！
-Don't worry about it.
-Sam?

136
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,092
森
Sam.

137
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,579
柏加，这是侯斯顿
Parker, this is Houston.

138
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,479
卡纳维拉尔角天气恶劣
We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.

139
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:57,280
今个星期你们不能回地球
It doesn't look like you're coming back
this week.

140
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,513
你太太不会放过我
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.

141
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:01,316
收到
Roger that.

142
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:05,656
过来看看这风暴，好巨型
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
lt's enormous.

143
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,860
你没事吧？
You all right?

144
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,401
他怕搭飞机
He's afraid of flying.

145
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,298
我没事
l'm fine.

146
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,307
（不准吸烟
扣上安全带）

147
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,146
根据统计数字
因气流而坠机的机会K
Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence...

148
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,844
低于十亿份之一？
抑或百万份之一？
...is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

149
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:07,222
-我记不起K
-收声，拜仁
-l can't remember if it's a--
-Shut up, Brian.

150
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,824
森K
Listen, Sam...

151
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:11,894
不要理会他，没事的
...don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

152
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,860
空姐依然狈饮品出来
They're still serving drinks.

153
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:32,475
各位，航机会有点震荡
Folks, it appears we're gonna have a bit
of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.

154
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:35,675
请系上安全带
把前面小桌折K
Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables...

155
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:40,347
和椅子放回原来的位置
直至震荡完结，多谢合作
...and seat backs in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.

156
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,454
哗！
Whoa!

157
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,628
捉住它，小心！
Grab it. Watch out!

158
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:16,957
森？
Sam?

159
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,957
森
森
Sam.
Sam.

160
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,926
我可以缩手吗？
Can l have my hand back?

161
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,747
想不到我要陪我妈去度假
l can't believe l'll be alone
with my mom.

162
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:47,118
耐心点，她一直期待着这个假期
Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday.

163
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,758
我知道
l know.

164
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,993
我爱你
l love you.

165
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,158
我也爱你
l love you too.

166
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,699
喂
Hey.

167
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:59,366
拜拜
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

168
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,802
导致天气极度反常的原因依然不明
但有些专家认为K
The cause of this extreme weather remains
a mystery, although some meteorologists...

169
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,909
是太阳黑子所致K
...believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing....

170
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:12,208
奇怪，气象浮标量度到
海洋温度下降了十三度
This is very odd. There's a buoy registering
a 1 3-degree drop in ocean temperature.

171
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,512
对，那乔治海岸的浮标坏了好几日
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

172
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,588
我会找附近的船收回它
l'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

173
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,884
这浮标不是在乔治，是在格钞兰
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
lt's just off Greenland.

174
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,425
什么？
What?

175
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,860
-两个浮标同时失灵的机会有几大？
-不大可能
-What are the odds of two buoys failing?
-Remote.

176
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,671
是三个同时失灵
Make that three.

177
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:54,381
又是纽约的惯常情形
车龙有十条街长！
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 1 0 blocks long.

178
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:59,825
看吧，阿宝
这些人，他们的汽车排出大量废气K
Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust...

179
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,022
污染大气层
...and they're polluting the atmosphere.

180
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,828
对不起，我们非常赶时间
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

181
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:08,196
快到了
We're almost there.

182
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:12,536
-只差两条街
-我们行路去吧
-We're only two blocks away.
-Let's walk.

183
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:40,830
动物有什么不妥？
What's gotten into them?

184
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,498
不知道，今天特别烦躁
l have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

185
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:51,875
在1532年，西班牙征服者
法兰西斯高皮萨路K
ln 1 532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro...

186
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:57,646
在秘鲁高原的卡也马卡镇击败
印加的皇帝
...defeated this lncan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

187
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:00,718
那皇帝叫什么名？计时
What is his name? Time.

188
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,293
孟迪苏马
Montezuma.

189
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:06,190
不是，孟迪苏马是在墨西哥
不是在秘鲁
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

190
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:09,298
叫安他什么
lt's, like, Anta-something.

191
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,134
-安他华尔帕？
-没错！
-Atahualpa?
-That's it!

192
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,134
够钟，请回答
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

193
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:23,908
活蒙学校五分，`合学校五分
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

194
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,449
下条题目
Next question.

195
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:34,249
路易十四哪一年在法国登基？
ln what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

196
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:44,364
这里太古老，古老到可以当时兴
This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.

197
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,234
看，一大班书虫
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

198
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,031
喂
Hey.

199
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:52,465
喂
Hey.

200
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,170
你好漂亮
You look beautiful.

201
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,041
多谢，这个地方很有气派
Thanks. This place is incredible.

202
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,218
真不敢相信这是他们的饭堂
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?

203
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,148
你们在比赛中有好表现
You played a great first round.

204
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,282
你们也是
So did you.

205
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:08,219
我的队友，森和拜仁
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

206
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,451
-我叫罗拉
-我叫⒇D
-l'm Laura.
-Oh, l'm J.D.

207
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,357
-你的学校好宏伟
-想参观吗？
-Your school's amazing.
-Would you like a tour?

208
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,662
好啊
Sure. That'd be great.

209
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,804
可以帮我鹱∫徽舐穑
Could you hold this for a sec?

210
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,733
可以
Yeah, sure.

211
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,374
谢谢
Thanks.

212
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,848
你今次遇上情场劲敌
Man, you got some serious competition.

213
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,351
不要傻
Please.

214
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:41,218
-必定是有钱仔
-收声
-And l'll bet he's really rich too.
-Shut up.

215
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:56,836
-是谁？
-是泰利擦臣
-Who is it?
-Terry Rapson here.

216
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,474
抱歉在凌晨骚扰你
Sorry to call you so early.

217
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,769
不要紧，什么事？
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

218
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:06,649
我们发现了一些不寻常
而令人担心的情况
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

219
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:10,252
你记得你在新德里说过地极冰融K
You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting...

220
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:14,220
-可能干扰北大西洋的海流吗？
-记得
-...might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
-Yes.

221
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,158
这K
Well...

222
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:18,718
这情况正在发生
...l think it's happening.

223
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,461
什么意思？
What do you mean?

224
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,660
前几日我们探测到大西洋水温K
One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 1 3-degree drop...

225
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:30,773
下降了十三度，我发了电邮通知你
...in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.

226
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,772
等一等
Hold on.

227
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,544
起初以为是个别仪器失灵
At first we thought it was a malfunction.

228
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:40,774
不过有四个仪器传来同一资料
But there are four more across
the North Atlantic showing the same thing.

229
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:43,146
这真的是难以置信
This is unbelievable.

230
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,582
你预测过会出现
You predicted it would happen.

231
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,453
但不是在我们这一代出现，太快了
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

232
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,061
只有你的电脑模拟程式才能够预测到K
There are no forecast models
remotely capable...

233
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:56,563
气候会变成这样
...of plotting this scenario, except yours.

234
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,895
我的模拟程式是用来研究史前气候
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

235
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,163
不是用来预测
lt's not a forecast model.

236
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,568
但已是最接近的模拟程式
It's the closest thing we have.

237
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:08,406
这种情况从未出现过
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

238
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:11,805
起码一万年来未曾出现
At least not in the last 1 0,000 years.

239
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:43,645
正如我昨天估计
咙风娜兰妮带来巨浪
As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.

240
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:48,217
比我想像中更巨大的巨浪，看吧
These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.

241
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,453
-你不是应该在监察气候吗？
-这里是洛杉矶，天气是十年如一日的
-Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?
-This is L.A. What weather?

242
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,122
等一等，那是什么声音？
Wait. What's that noise?

243
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,161
什么声音？
What noise?

244
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,472
很快回来
Honey, l'll be right back.

245
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:21,580
各海滩现已封闭，海浪大到连K
The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for....

246
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,582
-洛杉矶气候中心
-我是汤美
-L.A. Weather Center.
-It's Tommy.

247
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:26,551
我正在忙，什么事？
l'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?

248
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:31,017
正在落r，高尔夫球那样大的r
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

249
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:33,719
加州沿岸的低压K
A low-pressure system along
the California coast...

250
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,661
正在洛杉矶盘地形成大气旋
...is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.

251
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:46,368
-喂？
-波士，扭开天气台
-Yeah?
-Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.

252
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:50,540
-我们要发出龙卷风警告
-你在说什么？
-I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
-What are you talking about?

253
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:54,475
洛杉矶风力时速超过K
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess....

254
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:57,950
-等一等
-这些情况极不寻常
-Hold on a second.
-Conditions highly unusual for California.

255
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,567
要制造预测模拟程式，需要什么？
We're building a forecast model,
we need-- What?

256
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:23,975
接驳去电脑主机两三日
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

257
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,014
-是吗？
-须立即接驳
-Oh, is that it? Anything else?
-We need it immediately.

258
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:29,208
我认为你发碰K
l would say that
you've lost your mind...

259
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,651
不过你发惯碰
...but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

260
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:36,849
-汤，这是重要的
-你在制造什么预测模拟程式？
-Tom, this is important.
-What's this forecast model you're building?

261
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:41,657
这位珍纳是太空总署咙风专家

我完全不知道他想搞什么
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and l have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.

263
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:49,565
卜加！发生什么事？
Booker. What's going on here?

264
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:52,606
洛杉矶发出龙卷风警告
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

We have live coverage now from our Fox 1 1
chopper. Are you there, Bart?

269
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,194
我听到，龙卷风形成得好快K
Yes, l'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast--

270
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,425
-巴特！
-什么？不得了
-Bart!
-What? Oh! Oh, my God.

271
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,002
丽莎，你接收得到影像吗？
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

272
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,696
龙卷风把好莱坞大标志卷走
This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.

273
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:27,138
大招牌被卷走，卷成碎片
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.

274
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,048
巴特，你见到什么？
有没有人受伤？
Bart, what can you see? ls anyone hurt?

275
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:44,125
机会很大，这里满目H箔
l wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.

276
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:47,057
有些人在拍照！
And there are people down there
taking pictures.

277
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:50,233
你们做什么？快找地方躲！
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!

278
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,902
不可以留在这里！快走！
You can't stay here! Get out of here!

279
00:27:55,506 --> 00:28:00,466
两股龙卷风正吹袭洛杉矶国际机场
What you're seeing are two actual tornados
striking Los Angeles lnternational Airport.

280
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,909
现在二合一，合成一大股龙卷风
Wait. lt looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

281
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,672
-汤美！
-惨啦！
-Tommy!
-Oh, my God!

282
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,884
惨！
Holy shit!

283
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:12,313
敦促各位观众避开K
I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away....

284
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:15,924
-谢夫，你在哪里？
-在兰街与葡萄街交界
-Jeff, where are you?
-l'm on Yucca and vine.

285
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:19,186
-我正要回来
-你上了电视，龙卷风就在你附近
-l'm on my way.
-You're on Tv. You're in the middle of it.

286
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:22,923
蹋〔遥
God! Oh, my God!

287
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,041
快些离开！
You gotta get out of there, man.

288
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:38,037
巴士刚刚跌落在保时捷上
That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!

289
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,478
但愿车里没有人
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.

290
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:43,152
现在才开始收看的观众K
For our national audience
just joining us now...

291
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:46,845
我们正在现场直播
洛杉矶市区的情形，汤美？
...we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?

292
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,958
我后面是龙卷风
If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.

293
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
对，洛杉矶竟然出现龙卷风
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

294
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:56,859
是众多肆虐本市的龙卷风之一
lt's one of many tornados
that are destroying our city.

295
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:00,298
那里有另一股
那是洛杉矶的空中轮锅线
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

296
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:04,133
R利！好巨型！前所未见
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.

297
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:17,981
发生什么事？
What's happening?

298
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:21,021
仿佛是一场K
lt looks like some sort of...

299
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:26,253
大恶梦，只是现在恶梦成真
...huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.

300
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,427
我正在看
Yes, l'm looking at it right now.

301
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,728
-对
-发生什么事？
-Yes, it is.
-What's happening?

302
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:41,336
我再打给你
l'll call you back.

303
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:46,502
总统先生，洛杉矶给龙卷风摧毁
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

304
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:52,209
除此之外
民航局请你批准所有航机停航
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

305
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,544
-你觉得我们应该怎样做？
-原因未明前K
-What do you think we should do?
-Until we can figure it out...

306
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,879
我们没有选择的余地
...l don't think we have
much choice, sir.

307
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:01,649
这是洛杉矶商业区的残余部分
What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.

308
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,384
我刚同我妈通过电话
Hey, man, l just got off the phone
with my mom.

309
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:08,531
对不起，真的很对不起
但我们要转台
Excuse me, you guys. l'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

310
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:13,369
民航局下令中止美国所有的航空交通
The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.

311
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,437
不幸地，有两架飞机来不及降落K
Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes...

312
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,609
在中西部遇上猛烈气流而坠毁
...brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.

313
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,745
-第一班机是K
-所谓“十亿份之一”
-The first flight....
-So much for ''one in a billion.''

314
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,513
好，大家听着
All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.

315
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,746
我们要做的事情很多
但时间无多K
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time...

316
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:36,517
大家开工，华士丁？
...so let's get started, please. vorsteen?

317
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,822
我们的短期预测模拟程式无用
All our grid models are worthless.

318
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,930
我不觉得模拟程式会有帮助
l don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

319
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,563
加拿大人的报告说
北极出现巨大的大气环流
Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.

320
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,932
西伯利亚笼罩着前所未见的低压
ln Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.

321
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:52,074
澳洲刚经历有史以来最猛烈讳风
And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.

322
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:55,837
-这些现象都互有关联？
-有可能
-These things are interconnected?
-We have to consider the possibility.

323
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:59,948
只有太阳才能影响全球气候
The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.

324
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,850
-太空总署有什么意见？
-我们已经查过
-What's NASA have to say?
-We've already checked.

325
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,782
太阳辐射输出正常
Solar output is normal.

326
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:09,118
-北大西洋海流呢？
-怎样？
-What about the North Atlantic Current?
-What about it?

327
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:14,357
我昨晚同赫兰中心的擦臣教授谈过
l got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

328
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:16,862
他认为海流有变
He thinks the current has changed.

329
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,270
怎可能？
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

330
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:23,440
海流是靠Q和淡水的
微妙平衡来维持正常
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

331
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:23,769
海流是靠Q和淡水的
微妙平衡来维持正常
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

332
00:32:23,974 --> 00:32:26,499
-我们都知道
-没错K
-We all know that.
-Yes...

333
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,510
但无人知道由于地极冰融K
...but no one knows how much freshwater
has been dumped into the ocean...

334
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:33,182
引致多少淡水倾倒入海
...because of melting polar ice.

335
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,281
我相信脱Q作用
已经到达了一个危险的地步
l think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

336
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:42,051
这就是造成这样极端的天气的原因
lt would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

337
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:45,023
赫兰中心的数据相当可靠
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

338
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:49,324
他们要求我把数据输入
我的模拟程式，预测未来情况
They've asked me to feed it into my
paleoclimate model to track the next events.

339
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:52,866
你的意思是，反常气候会持续？
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

340
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,964
不仅持续，而且每况愈下
Not just continue. Get worse.

341
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:04,011
我相信我们将会面临气候剧变
l think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

342
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,383
你会怎样告诉总统？
What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

343
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:15,524
-你认为呢？
-从速作长远准备
-What do you expect me to tell them?
-The government has to make preparations.

344
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:18,661
-这些全部只是你的理论
-给我使用电脑主机去证实吧
-You have a theory.
-Give me the mainframe. l'll prove it.

345
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:20,727
不
No.

346
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,498
给你四十八小时
You have 48 hours.

347
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:28,070
-贺教授
-是
-Professor Hall.
-Yes.

348
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,138
-我相信你的理论可能正确
-我们边走边谈
-l think your theory may be correct.
-Walk with me.

349
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:34,777
几个星期前
我见到有史以来最强的咙风
Just a few weeks ago, l monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

350
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:37,640
冰r、龙卷风，一切ê
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

351
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,442
你的模拟程式
可不可以计算风暴情况？
Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?

352
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,847
-我们没有时间
-我可以帮手
-We haven't had the time.
-Well, maybe l can help.

353
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,681
-欢迎你加入
-多谢
-Welcome aboard.
-Thanks.

354

-你好
-你好
-Hi.
-Hi.

356
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,193
彼得的电脑断层扫描结果有未？
Do you have Peter's CT scan results?

357
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,958
有了，治疗后，肿瘤收缩了两成
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

358
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,931
-他的视觉怎样？
-没有改善
-ls his eyesight better today?
-No. No change.

359
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,710
-彼得，你今日觉得怎样？
-好一点
-Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
-A little better.

360
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,509
好
Good.

361
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,278
让我听听
Let me listen here.

362
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,851
你读得到吗？
Can you read that?

363
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:25,424
读不到，不过从图片记得内容
No, but l remember the story
from the pictures.

364
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,091
你记得？
You do?

365
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:29,388
我妈以前读过给我听
My mother used to read it to me.

366
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,893
你非常勇敢，她必定很以你为荣
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

367
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:37,605
-多谢
-不要客气
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

368
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:41,141
-给你的
-多谢
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

369
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:49,050
你一口气工作了廿四小时
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

370
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,948
只有你一个没有休息过
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

371
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,884
或者我可以闭目养神一会
Maybe l'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.

372
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,218
有结果通知我
Call me when you get the results.

373
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,624
他总是这样拼搏？
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

374
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,769
-总是
-是
-Yeah.
-Yes.

375
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,304
从不轻松一点？
Does he ever lighten up?

376
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:12,134
-从不轻松
-从不
-Not really.
-No.

377
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,082
-你们合作了多久？
-法兰自从石器时代K
-How long have you been working together?
-Well, Frank's been working with him...

378
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:25,653
已经同他拍档
我只焙了两年奴仆生活
...since the Stone Age, but l've only
had to endure two years of servitude.

379
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,853
积
Jack.

380
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:37,056
积，结果出来了
Jack, we got the results.

381
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,807
六至八个月？不可能
Six to eight months? That can't be.

382
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:51,610
不是以月计，是以星期计
That time scale isn't in months.
lt's in weeks.

383
00:35:55,685 --> 00:36:01,055
广泛水浸令到很多地方封闭
包括两条隧道
Flooding has caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.

384
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,057
学校水管旧了，沟渠排不走雨水
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.

385
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:07,696
你住在哪里？
Where are you staying?

386
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,389
他们正在替我们找地方住
They're finding a place for us
with kids here.

387
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,034
你可以在明日之前回来吗？
You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?

388
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,167
可以的话，我会尽早K
Well, look, Dad, l would if l could,
you know. lt's just....

389
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,241
这里臭得厉害
This smell is unbearable, Dad.

390
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:23,378
不要再讲笑
我要你立即回来
Stop kidding around! l want you home.

391
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,241
我去搭火车
Dad, I'll be on the train.

392
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:28,508
不要担心，我会设法
Do me a favor. Just don't worry about me.
l'll figure it out.

393
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,750
好吧，阿仔，明天见
All right, son. l'll see you tomorrow.

394
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,857
森
Hey, Sam, guess what?

395
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,221
我们有地方住
We got a place to stay.

396
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:42,560
好极
Great.

397
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:48,102
恶劣天气暂时未抵达首都
但是首都居民不敢迓K
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C.,
but local residents aren't taking chances...

398
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:51,866
大家忙于准备K
...as people stock up for what is already
being billed as...

399
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,543
-应付最恶劣风季
-你最好有十足把握
-...the worst storm season on record.
-Better be sure.

400
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,837
-我不想被抄鱿鱼
-你见过模拟程式
-My ass is on the line.
-You saw the model.

401
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,379
我希望是错的
And l hope to God it's wrong.

402
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,510
-副总统先生
-汤
-Mr. vice President.
-Tom.

403
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:04,346
-你认识贺教授
-是，我们见过面
-You know Professor Hall.
-Yes, we've met.

404
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:07,751
贺教授有些资料
我觉得你应该看一看
Professor Hall has some information
l think you should look at.

405
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,756
从我们的模拟程式
分析出来的结果
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

406
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:14,089
-我们可以解释天气恶劣的原因
-我迟些再看
-They explain what's causing this weather.
-l'll read it later.

407
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:17,562
-我要同危急处理局局长开会K
-这是非常危急的
-l have to meet with the director of FEMA--
-This is very urgent.

408
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:22,101
六至八星期内
气候会发生剧变
Our climate is changing violently. lt will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.

409
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:24,865
你说过会在一百年后发生
You said this wouldn't happen
for another 1 00 years.

410
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,703
-我错了
-假如你现在又错呢？
-l was wrong.
-Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

411
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:31,039
我都希望我是错的
但你必定察觉到全球的反常气候变化
l wish l were, but you're aware
of what's happening everywhere.

412
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:35,582
我们正在做应变功夫
你还想我们做什么？
We're making all the necessary preparations
for this storm. What more do you expect?

413
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:39,619
你要开始考虑大规模疏散
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

414
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:41,518
尤其是北部各州
Especially in the Northern states.

415
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:43,249
-疏散？
-对
-Evacuations?
-Yes.

416
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,896
发神经吗？我要走了
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
l have to go.

417
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:52,128
副总统先生！
现在还不采取行动，就会太迟！
Mr. vice President! lf we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

418
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:58,106
我们走吧
Come on, Jack.

419
00:37:58,508 --> 00:38:00,100
多谢带我们来
Thanks for bringing us here.

420
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,144
来纽约，不可错过自然史博物馆
l couldn't let you leave New York without
seeing the Natural History Museum.

421
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:07,180
当然不可
这里是全世界最大的毛公仔展览馆
Of course not. lt's a fine collection
of stuffed animals.

422
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:08,681
看
Hey, guys, check this out.

423
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,852

尸体完整K
''The body of this mammoth was found
perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra...

424
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:18,493
口里胃里依然有食物K
...with food still in its mouth
and stomach...

425
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:23,822
显示它在食食物的时候，一俐间冷僵
...indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing.''

426
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:33,035
至今，英国与北欧下雪K
It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles...

427
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:36,269
已经下了廿四小时
我们并不知道雪几时会停
...and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.

428
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,243
不K不要担心
No, no, no.
You've got to stop worrying. No, no.

429
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:43,180
只不过是落雪
我们有很多鲁食用品
lt's fine. We've got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.

430
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,986
对，没有问题的
Yeah. No, it's all right. lt's all right.

431
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,180
你不要走开，我没事
No, you stay where you are.
l'll be fine.

432
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:51,255
我也爱你，拜拜
Yeah, l love you too. Okay, bye.

-没事
-Hey. How's Jeanette?
-Oh, fine.

434
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,667
渡轮刚刚泊岸
The ferry just landed.

435
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,836
西班牙天气应该很好，可惜我没机会去
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish l was there.

436
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:04,529
救援直升机已经出发，准备K
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter...

437
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,369
把皇室人员载到安全地点
...to airlift the royal family to safety.

438
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:11,407
-直升机会来接我们吗？
-不大可能
-Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
-Not likely.

439
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:16,585
幸好我们有发电机、茶叶同饼干
Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.

440
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,686
应该没事
Oh, we'll be fine.

441
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:21,356
只要厕所水不倒流
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

442
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:44,704
我们什么也看不到
保持方向和速度
We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.

443
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,178
-我们的方向呢？
-是035
-What's our heading?
-035, sir.

444
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,285
离皇室堡约四十公里
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmoral Castle.

445
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:53,047
我们看不到你们
We've lost visual contact with you.

446
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:19,938
-咪表不可能正确
-风速降至零
-This gauge can't be right.
-Wind speed has dropped to zero.

447
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,085
一堵垂直云墙正在形成
We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.

448
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,389
-究竟发生什么事？
-燃油在凝固！
-What the hell is going on?
-The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.

449
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:41,965
左引擎压力下降！转速下跌！
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

450
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:45,300
右边的引擎也停止转动
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

451
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:50,871
准备紧急降落

选用紧急燃料

00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,612
稳定点！
Come on, you bastard!

00:40:58,188 --> 00:40:59,985
稳定点！
Come on!

455
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:25,014
这是机密消息
What l'm about to say

456

这是机密消息
What l'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.

457
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:30,013
几个钟头前
三架直升机在苏格兰失事
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

458
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,621
原因是燃油在输油管内凝结
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

459
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:38,688
-什么温度才K？
-华氏零下150度
-At what temperature does--?
-Negative 1 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

460
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:40,157
是查出来的
We had to look it up.

461
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:42,854
气温急剧直线下降
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

462
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,367
陆地上，大家未落车已经冻僵
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

463
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,733
陆地上，大家未落车已经冻僵
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

464
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,837
我想看两小时前苏格兰的卫星照片
Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

465
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,166
数据有很多K
We've got mountains of data...

466
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:56,141
但电脑不够快处理
可不可以帮帮忙？
...but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?

467
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,514
即管把资料传送过来
我们会尽力
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

468

多谢你，拜拜
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.

469
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:06,143
这是温度骤降下的苏格兰
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

470
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,889
这东西看来像咙风
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

471
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:14,029
可是咙风不会在陆上形成
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

472
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,938
-你好，少爷！
-夏劳
-Good evening, sir.

00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,320
你住在这里？
You live here?

477
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,318
只是在周末
Just on the weekends.

478
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:43,185
这是我爸的家
但是他很少来K
lt's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so....

479
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:44,724
他在哪里？
Where is he?

480
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,056
同我继母到欧洲滑雪
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

482
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:55,896
对，我们在踩单车旅行
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

485
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:31,637
我只是避避雨
l'm just standing here.

486
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:33,636
不可以
You can't stay here.

487
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,078
反正我都不是太喜欢这一区
l never liked this neighborhood anyway.

488
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,804
中区总站秩序大乱
It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.

489
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:44,180
过半月台水浸，火车停止服务
Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.

490
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,447
飞机仍然停航
而火车也停止服务K
With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service...

491
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:49,352
这真是坏消息K
...that's bad news for the....

492
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,620
司机快来接我，要送你们去火车站吗？
victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?

493
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,058
已经不用去
Not anymore.

494
00:43:55,264 --> 00:44:00,634
加拿大东南部，水位急升廿五尺
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.

495
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:04,432
最可怕的情况终于出现
What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.

496
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,700
两股来自北极的冷锋竟然K
The cold front moving from the Arctic...

497
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:09,537
在加拿大合成一个风暴K
...has created an enormous
storm system in Canada...

498
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:13,546
虽然难以致信
但它越来越像一个热带咙风K
...which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane....

499
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,049
我要去接弟弟
你们要我送你一程吗？
l gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?

500
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:20,450
-他在哪里？
-费城的寄宿学校
-Where is he?
-He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.

501
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,124
假如这气候南下K
If this system moves south...

502
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:26,887
风暴潮将会危及整个东海床
...we could see a wind-driven storm surge
threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.

503
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:30,093
好，拜拜
Okay, bye.

504
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,790
司机在第五街遇上塞车，驶不动
victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

505
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:36,130
如果我们去那处找他
比较容易离开这个城市
lt'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.

506
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:39,137
-行路去？
-这样的天气我不去
-You mean walk?
-No, not in this.

507
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:44,775
我们应该行楼梯
We should take the stairs.

508
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:47,575
我们住顶楼
We're on the top floor.

509
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:52,178
大概只可行楼梯
l guess we're walking.

510
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:07,233
或者我们不应该出去
Maybe we should just stay here.

511
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:08,995
小姐说得对
l think the young lady is right.

512
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,907
不，我们要回家去
No. We need to get home.

513
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,500
凯萨，过来
Hey, Cesar, come here.

514
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:40,727
你做什么？
What are you doing?

515
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:48,537
所有狼都不见了！
The wolves, they're gone.

516
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,906
现在的情形是K
Just to give you an idea
of the situation...

517
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:54,208
天气的情况急转直下
...which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:

518
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:57,944
四处几乎成为泽国
At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.

519
00:45:58,154 --> 00:46:01,487
交通几乎瘫喝
原因是曼哈顿大部分的地方都停电K
We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out...

520
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:05,183
没有交通灯
...to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.

521
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:07,692
起码出现两百宗交通意外
Car accidents, at least two hundred.

522
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:12,266
下曼哈顿寸步难行
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.

523
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:35,813
可不可以替我打给我妈？
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

524
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:37,788
喂
Hey.

525
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:39,860
狗不可以进来
That dog can't come in here.

526
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:42,530
可是外面下着倾盘大雨！
Come on, man. lt's pouring out there.

527
00:46:42,732 --> 00:46:44,893
我不理，看标示吧
l don't care. Read the sign.

528
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:46,659
（禁止饮食、禁携宠物）

529
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:49,633
这是公共图书馆啊
lt's supposed to be a public library.

530
00:46:55,945 --> 00:46:57,936
快，这边
Come on, guys, this way.

531
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:00,243
你好论尽
Excuse me. Your bad.

532
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,612
千五元的雨衣却挡不到雨！
Goddamn 1 500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

533
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,687
-好心你收声
-肯定到处都是老鼠
-Please, shut up, man.
-There must be rats everywhere.

534
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,356
因为这里是纽约
That's because it's New York.

535
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:11,186
喂！喂！
Hey! Hey!

536
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:14,154
-开门
-不载客
-Open up, big papa.
-lt's out of service.

537
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:16,458
不载客！
lt's out of service.

538
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,499
-给你一百元
-不用
-l'll give you a 1 00 dollars.
-You don't have to do that.

539
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:22,330
收下来吧，两百元
No, really. 200 dollars.
l won't have it.

540
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:25,837
我喜欢坐巴士，认真过瘾
God, l love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.

541
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,071
喂？
Hello?

542
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,905
-我联络不到我的司机，电话收不到
-发神经才在街上走
-l can't reach my driver. No signal.
-This is insane.

543
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:33,741
不可能可以驾车
回你家吧
We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.

544
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,317
-我赞成
-你讲笑吗？我们要向高处走！
-Yeah, l vote for that.
-Are you kidding? We have to get higher!

545
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,152
跟我来
Come on.

546
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:41,516
上图书馆去
Up to the library.

547
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:44,318
冷静
Calm down.

548
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,427
我听不明白你说什么
l can't understand what you're saying.

549
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:51,058
冷静点，我会帮你们走出来
lf you stay calm, ma'am,
l'll get you out.

550
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:59,004
门卡死了！
The door is jammed!

551
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:01,373
我不懂法文！
l don't speak French!

552
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:38,241
罗拉呢？
Hey, where's Laura?

553
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:44,445
-刚才明明在这里
-那里！看到吗？
-She was just right there.
-She's right there! Right there, see?

554
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:46,087
她在做什么？
What is she doing?

555
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:48,985
叫他们掩着眼睛！
Tell them to cover their eyes.

556
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:16,809
有堵水墙向纽约冲过来
各位K
There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody--

557
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,828
-什么事？
-她的手袋在的士上，他们的护照
-What?
-Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.

558
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,058
没有时间回去拿了
Forget about it.

559
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:08,395
-我去
-走吧
-l'll get it for her.
-Come on.

560
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,239
我的K
Oh, my....

561
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,477
罗拉！
Laura!

562
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,883
罗拉！
Laura!

563
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:33,827
-森
-不要去！拜仁，不
-Sam.
-No! Brian, no!

564
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,191
罗拉！罗拉，看！
Laura! Laura, look!

565
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,026
赶快！跑！
Come on. Come!

566
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:40,426
赶快！
Come on!

567
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:44,303
森！
Sam!

568
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,704
教授
Professor.

569
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:28,114
多谢
Thank you.

570
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:32,851
-是尼仔的作品吗？
-尼仔不再划火柴公仔
-ls that Neville's handiwork?
-Neville's way beyond stick figures.

571
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:34,818
-他已经六岁了
-是吗？
-He's 6 already.
-Oh.

572
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:37,959
这是我第二个孙大卫的杰作
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

573
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,288
想不到尼仔已经六岁
God. l can't believe Neville's 6 already.

574
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,067
小孩子快高长大
You won't believe how fast they grow.

575
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,235
阿积找你
l've got Jack Hall on the phone.

576
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:53,801
他们已经处埋好数据
They've run the data we've sent them.

577
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:56,901
给你
Here he is.

578
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:03,218
你可以模拟热循环吗？
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

579
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:05,250
可以，风暴K
Yes. The storm's rotation...

580
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:09,584
把超冷却空气
从对流层扯下来
...is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.

581
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:15,586
可是空气未着陆前
不是应该变暖的吗？
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

582
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:20,064
下降得太快，来不及变暖
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.

583
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:23,594
这是不是个别情况？
ls this an isolated incident?

584
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:28,040
恐怕不是
l'm afraid not.

585
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:31,577
除了苏格兰之外
我们再发现了两个超级单体风暴
We've located two supercells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

586
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,372
一个在加拿大北面K
One over Northern Canada...

587
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:36,551
另一个在西伯利亚
...and another one over Siberia.

588
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:39,346
估计得到风暴路向吗？
And do we know their projected paths?

589
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,817
可以
Yes.

590
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:44,254
同我们早前所估计的，快得很多
Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.

591
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,952
这个风暴将会令地球改头换面
This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.

592
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:51,998
这是单体风暴形成廿四小时后的情形
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.

593
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:59,002
形成四十八小时后
This is 48 hours out.

594
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:03,643
七至十日后K
And in seven to 1 0 days....

595
00:53:06,782 --> 00:53:09,012
当风暴过后K
When this storm is over...

596
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:11,982
我们会进入新冰河时期
...we'll be in a new ice age.

597
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:17,889
惨
My God.

598
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,043
教授K
Professor...

599
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:40,215
趁有机会走吧
...it's time you got out of there.

600
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:45,379
恐怕我们已经错过机会了
l'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

601
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:52,723
我们可以怎样做？
What can we do?

602
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:58,456
救得一个得一个
Save as many as you can.

603
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:15,076
积K
Jack...

604
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:17,479
纽约出了事
...something's happened in New York.

605
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:30,895
没有电，我已经在这里一整日了
No, the power is out.
l've been in here all day.

606
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,160
-谁要帮忙？
-这里
-Who needs help?
-Here. Over here.

607
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:42,570
什么事？
What?

608
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:46,710
这是最后一条，好好享受
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

609
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:48,405
贪心鬼
Greedy.

610
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,984
线路现正繁忙
All circuits are busy at this time.

611
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:54,155
多谢你回来找我
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

612
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,652
你很勇敢
lt was really brave.

613
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:12,138
我要把手袋还给她了
l guess l better return her bag.

614
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,789
森？
Sam?

615
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,352
向她表明心迹吧
Just tell her how you feel.

616
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,900
好
Yeah.

617
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:47,668
-你联不联络到你的弟弟？
-电话打不通
-Did you reach your little brother yet?
-No, there's still no service.

618
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:49,867
死鬼流动电话
Damn cell phones.

619
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:57,381
请问，上层有没有收费电话？
Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?

620
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,144
没有K
No, no, no.

621
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,346
-但阁楼有几部
-太好了
-There are some on the mezzanine.
-Great.

622
00:56:01,557 --> 00:56:04,549
-但我估阁楼已被水淹没了！
-你去哪里？已经停电了
-But l think it's underwater.
-Where you going? Power's out.

623
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,228
旧式电话用电话线的电
Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.

624
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:10,921
国家海洋和大气局
各部门的主管将会举行紧急会议K
There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads....

625
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,567
我一直尝试联络阿森
Oh, God. l've been trying to reach Sam.

626
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,465
我也是
So have l.

627
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,072
打给你又打不通
l tried to call
and couldn't get you.

628
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:21,265
这里天下大乱，跟我来
lt's been a madhouse here. Come on.

629
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:29,144
你肯定要这样做？
Are you sure about this?

630
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:40,523
打得通
lt works.

631
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:47,435
我喜欢那张照片
l love that picture.

632
00:56:47,636 --> 00:56:49,797
我也喜欢
Yeah, so do l.

633
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,137
在哪里拍的？
Where was that taken?

634
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:53,603
迈阿米
Miami.

635
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:56,441
我在哪里？我记不起我有去过
Well, where was l?
l don't remember that trip.

636
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:59,409
森，我和我的家姐一起去
你在阿拉斯加K
Sam and l went with my sister.
You were in Alaska...

637
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:02,482
做研究
...doing research on your doctorate.

638
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:09,256
记得他小时候是怎样吗？
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

639
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,953
口头禅是“再一次”
Everything was ''one more.''

640
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:17,064
再讲一次故事，再骑一次牛牛
“再一次，爸爸”
One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders. ''One more, Daddy.''

641
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:23,132
积！森打电话来，四线
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.

642
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:25,169
-森？
-爸爸！
-Sam?
-Dad!

643
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:29,435
-你在哪里？
-我没事，在公共图书馆内
-Where are you? Are you all right?
-l'm all right. We're at the Public Library.

644
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:32,512
-阿森，是妈呀，你平安就好了！
-妈
-Sam, it's Mom. l'm so happy you're okay.
-Mom.

645
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:36,818
可以向罗拉和拜仁家报平安吗？
Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?

646
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,486
好，没问题
Yes, of course.

647
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:41,916
-阿森，那是什么声音？
-阿森
-Sam, what's that noise?
-Sam?

648
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:44,120
阿森
Sam?

649
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,921
爸，外面发生了什么事？
What is going on out there, Dad?

650
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:51,224
阿森
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

651
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,832
小心听着
Listen very carefully.

652
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:55,094
不要南下
Forget what l said about heading south.

653
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:57,465
太迟了，气候只会愈来愈恶劣
lt's too late.
The storm is gonna get worse.

654
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:03,267
会出现一股庞大的暴风雪
中间有风眼
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with
an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.

655
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:06,839
非常冻，冻到可以将人即时冻死
Only the air will be so cold,
you could freeze to death in seconds.

656
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:11,947
阿森？
Sam?

657
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:14,714
-我们应该怎样做？
-听着，阿仔
-Well, what should we do?
-Listen to me, son.

658
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:16,884
不要出外
Do not go outside.

659
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:19,993
有什么烧什么，尽量取暖
和耐心等待
Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.

660
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:24,154
我会去救你，你明白吗？
我会去救你
l will come for you. Do you understand me?
l will come for you.

661
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:28,530
阿森
Sam?

662
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,729
-阿森，回来！
-阿森
-Sam, come back!
-Sam?

663
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,341
阿森，你听到没有？
Sam, did you hear me?

664
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:35,771
你听到没有？
Did you hear me?

665
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:39,846
阿森
Sam?

666
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:44,985
-告诉我他会没事K
-他会平安
-Tell me he's gonna be okay--
-He's gonna be all right.

667
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,178
他会平安，你明不明白？
He's gonna be all right,
you understand?

668
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,912
还以为你已经浸死
l thought you'd drowned.

669
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:25,491
去找些干衣服给你换
Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.

670
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,229
北极探险装备放在哪里？
Where'd you store the arctic gear?

671
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:36,200
你去不到纽约
You can't make it to New York, Jack.

672
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,703
我试过在雪中走得更远
l've walked that far before in the snow.

673
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:41,303
今次情形不同
This is not the same.

674
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:45,708
这次情况不同！露丝，告诉他吧
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

675
00:59:48,116 --> 00:59:50,243
我非去不可
l have to do this.

676
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:54,422
我明白
l know.

677
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:03,187
我的手在发抖K
My hands are shak--

678
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:06,799
-发抖
-给你
-Shaking.
-That's okay. Here.

679
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:08,936
过来
Here. Come here.

680
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,505
你做什么？
What are you doing?

681
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,144
用我体温替你取暖
l'm using my body heat to warm you.

682
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:22,543
如果四肢的血，太快流向心脏K
lf we let the blood from your arms and legs
rush back to your heart too quickly...

683
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:25,242
心脏会停顿
...your heart could fail.

684
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,760
你从哪里学来的？
Where did you learn that?

685
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,764
上健康课时肯听书就学得到
Some of us were actually
paying attention in health class.

686
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:43,137
觉得怎样？
How are you feeling?

687
01:00:45,574 --> 01:00:47,371
好得多
Much better.

688
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,715
法兰告诉了我森的事
Frank told me about Sam.

689
01:00:56,918 --> 01:01:01,048
我不会阻止你
但你先要替我做一件事
l'm not gonna try to talk you out of going,
but there's something l need first.

690
01:01:01,256 --> 01:01:03,986
你要向白宫解释你的预测
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

691
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:07,025
-我已经试过
-今次不同
-l already tried that, Tom.
-l know. lt'll be different.

692
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,856
你会向总统直接汇报
You're gonna brief the president directly.

693
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:14,626
-再没有衣服了吗？
-没有了
-ls that the last of it?
-Pretty much.

694
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:16,394
好
Okay.

695
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:19,597
找到一部收音机，不过失灵
We also found this radio,
but l don't think it works.

696
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,737
让我看看
Let me see it.

697
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,013
阿宝，别吵
Buddha, keep quiet.

698
01:01:30,218 --> 01:01:32,880
这里本来不准你来
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

699
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,875
这边
Come on, guys.

700
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:38,747
我的天
Oh, my God.

701
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:03,737
风暴会持续到K
The basic rule of storms
is they continue...

702
01:03:03,945 --> 01:03:07,244
气候回复平衡
...until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

703
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:10,179
全球气候会面目全非
ln this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

704
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:14,254
超级风暴会持续七至十日
This superstorm will last
seven to 1 0 days.

705
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:19,519
然后，北半球会变成冰雪世界
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

706
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,253
冰雪会把阳光反射
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.

707
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:24,557
大气层会重新稳定，不过K
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize...

708
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:28,031
气温会接近上次冰河时期
...with an average temperature
close to that of the last lce Age.

709
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:32,305
我们可以怎样做？
Well, what can we do about this?

710
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,775
尽量南下
Head as far south as possible.

711
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:38,103
那并不好笑，教授
That is not amusing, professor.

712
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:40,538
你建议国民去哪里？
Where do you suggest they go?

713
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:43,149
愈南愈安全
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

714
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:47,981
去德州，去没水浸的佛罗里达
最好去墨西哥
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.

715
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,751
墨西哥？你只管科学好了
政策由我们来决定
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

716
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,450
我们试过那个方案
Well, we tried that approach.

717
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:57,655
为时未晚时劝你，你听不入耳
You didn't want to hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.

718
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:01,468
教授，你有什么实质提议？
What exactly are you proposing, professor?

719
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:13,220
疏散那条线以南的人
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

720
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:21,236
北部的人呢？
What about the people in the North?

721
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:25,937
已经太迟
l'm afraid it's too late for them.

722
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:28,268
他们一出外K
lf they go outside...

723
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:30,377
会冻死于风雪里
...the storm will kill them.

724
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:35,479
到这地步K
At this point...

725
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:39,315
他们最好躲在室内
...their best chance is to stay inside.

726
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:42,549
看看能否避过这场灾劫
Try to ride it out.

727
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:44,791
听天由命
Pray.

728
01:04:49,898 --> 01:04:51,388
你觉得他会怎样做？
What do you think he'll do?

729
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,431
不知道
l don't know.

730
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:54,897
积K
Jack...

731
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:57,203
多谢你K
...thanks...

732
01:04:57,406 --> 01:04:58,737
祝你好运
...and good luck.

733
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:00,636
我也祝你好运
You too.

734
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:04,804
我们都需要运气
We're all gonna need it.

735
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:12,444
不能因为那科学家一面之词
而疏散半个国家的人民
We can't evacuate half the country because
one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.

736
01:05:12,654 --> 01:05:16,556
-犹豫不决，只会死得更多人
-北方的人呢？
-Every minute we delay costs lives.
-What about the other half of the country?

737
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:19,023
假如贺教授说得对K
lf Professor Hall is right
about this storm...

738
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:21,628
派兵北上救人只是送死
...sending troops north will
create more victims.

739
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,196
我们要救可以救的人
We need to save the people
we can right now.

740
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:27,425
就像战场上救伤K
We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.

741
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:30,628
有必要壮士断臂K
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices--

742
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,706
我不认为有必要放弃一半国民
l don't accept abandoning
half the country as necessary.

743
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:36,207
如果你肯早点听他忠告
就没有必要了
Maybe if you listened sooner,
it wouldn't be.

744
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:38,811
他在首都安安全全
Bullshit. lt's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

745
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:42,313
-才夸夸其谈
-他儿子在曼哈顿
-He's safely here in Washington.
-His son is in Manhattan.

746
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:49,221
你未质疑他用心前，先紧记这点
l thought you should know before
you start questioning his motives.

747
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,455
我们采用贺积的方案
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

748
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:57,263
-将军
-总统？
-General.
-Sir?

749
01:05:57,466 --> 01:06:00,765
下令国卫军疏散南部各州
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate Southern states.

750
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:02,561
知道，总统
Yes, sir.

751
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,677
慧濉K
vivian...

752
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,684
接去我太太
...get me my wife.

753
01:06:39,675 --> 01:06:43,111
对不起，汽油快要用完
Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.

754
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:47,814
喂
Hey.

755
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:49,941
可不可以K
ls there any chance...

756
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:52,019
用这个K
...that it'll run...

757
01:06:53,322 --> 01:06:55,187
做燃料？
...on this?

758
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,948
你发神经吗？
Are you mad?

759
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:59,491
这是十二年威士忌！
That's a 1 2-year-old Scotch.

760
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:22,544
各位
Gentlemen.

761
01:07:23,518 --> 01:07:25,645
向英国干杯
To England.

762
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:28,386
向全人类干杯
To mankind.

763
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:32,323
向曼联干杯
To Manchester United.

764
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:41,464
可惜K
l just....

765
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,572
可惜我看不到他长大
l just wish l could have seen
him grow up. You know?

766
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,076
重要的是他会长大
The important thing is he will grow up.

767
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,882
阿门
Amen.

768
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:18,200
或者应该找人帮你修理
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.

769
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:21,638
我是电子K
Sir, l am president of the Electronics Club...

770
01:08:21,843 --> 01:08:24,073
数学、象棋学会会长
...the Math Club and the Chess Club.

771
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:27,305
论书虫，我认第一，无人敢认第二
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

772
01:08:29,718 --> 01:08:32,619
那就不打扰你了
l'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

773
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:36,914
阿宝，快点出恭
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

774
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,889
趁附近没有人
Look, there's nobody around.

775
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:42,928
我转过身去，保证不偷看
You know what? l'll turn around.
l won't look. l promise.

776
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:48,796
什么事？
What?

777
01:08:55,544 --> 01:08:57,341
出面有人
Hey, man, there's people out there.

778
01:08:57,813 --> 01:08:59,075
我带狗去散步
l was walking my dog.

779
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:03,274
有好几百个
他们在雪地上走
There's hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

780
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:12,783
他们去哪里？
Where they all going?

781
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:15,828
趁还来得及，离开纽约
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

782
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:21,969
大家安静点
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

783
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,105
谁同外界讲过手提电话？
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

784
01:09:25,307 --> 01:09:27,867
我在曼菲斯的亲杯说
l got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

785
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:29,907
人人南下
They're being evacuated to the South.

786
01:09:30,112 --> 01:09:31,602
我们也应该走
We should get moving too.

787
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:34,407
我们可以在冰上行走
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

788
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:37,813
趁雪未太深出发吧！
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

789
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:41,615
大家要穿够衣服！
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

790
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:43,222
我们不应该走
We shouldn't go.

791
01:09:43,425 --> 01:09:45,256
为什么？人人都走
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

792
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,122
我爸叫我躲在室内
When l talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

793
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,025
出去遇上风雪一定死
The storm will kill anybody in it.

794
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,962
-你应该告诉他们
-对
-Then you have to say something.
-l know.

795
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:59,596
先生，你错了
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

796
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:02,709
我明白大家都怕
但我们已没有选择的余地
What? Listen, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

797
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,469
-我不是因为害怕
-准备出发吧
-That's not it.
-Get ready to go.

798
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,115
出去会冻死！
lf these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

799
01:10:09,017 --> 01:10:10,746
不要胡说八道
Okay, what is this nonsense?

800
01:10:10,952 --> 01:10:14,581
不是胡说八道
风雪愈来愈猛
lt's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

801
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,190
遇上会即冻死
The people caught outside
will freeze to death.

802
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:20,122
-你怎知道？
-我爸是气象专家
-Where are you getting this?
-My dad's a climatologist.

803
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,922
-他为政府工作
-那么我们应该怎样做？
-He works for the government.
-So what do we do?

804
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:25,759
躲在室内取暖，以不变应万变
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

805
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,060
雪愈下愈深
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

806
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,795
我们会被困在这里
没有鲁食，补给K
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies....

807
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:33,065
-是要冒险的，没错
-没有必要冒这个险
-lt's a risk, yeah--
-An unnecessary risk.

808
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:34,503
是有需要的
No, no. lt's not.

809
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:37,075
多讲浪费时间，我们走
We've wasted enough time talking.
Come on.

810
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:38,576
我们走
Let's go.

811
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,113
-等一等！考虑一下吧！
-走吧K
-Look, look. Just look for a second.
-Come on, everybody--

812
01:10:42,317 --> 01:10:45,718
考虑一下！风雪会愈来愈猛
This storm is gonna get bad.
lt's gonna get really, really bad.

813
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:48,014
你们焙不过去！
You're not gonna be able to survive it.

814
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,586
信我吧
Believe me.

815
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:55,058
请你不要走
Sir, please just stay. Just stay.

816
01:10:55,931 --> 01:10:58,058
总之不要K
Just don't....

817
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:30,289
-她可以走
-直接去后面
-She's set to go.
-Come on, straight to the back, guys.

818
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,524
我们要通讯将会很困难
It'll be impossible to reach each other.

819
01:11:32,734 --> 01:11:35,362
在墨西哥城的美国领事馆
留个口讯给我
Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.

820
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:36,764

-谢谢你
-l'm gonna try later, okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

828
01:12:15,777 --> 01:12:17,574

829
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,174
你应该去搭巴士南下
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

830
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:25,843
我照顾你照顾了廿年
你觉得会让你单独去吗？
l've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think l'd let you go alone?

831
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:29,251
我以为一直是我照顾你
And all these years l thought
l was watching your back.

832
01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,186
钥匙呢？
Where are the keys?

833
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,122
在货车里
ln the truck.

834
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:36,094
你想去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

835
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:38,698
你们两个都没有方向感
Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.

836
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,868
没有我带路
你们会驶了去克里夫兰
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.

837
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:46,301
我会向你通报风雪情况
l'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

838
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:48,775
祝你好运
Good luck, Jack.

839
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:05,219
这是美国与墨西哥边境新闻直播
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

840
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,760
半小时前，墨西哥封锁边境K
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border...

841
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:12,593

打算进入墨西哥
These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.

844
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:20,534
不过食了闭门眉
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

845
01:13:20,742 --> 01:13:24,007
从来只有墨西哥人偷渡来美国K
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration...

846
01:13:24,212 --> 01:13:27,739

...thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:31,612
场面一片混乱，大家慌不择路
The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.

People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings...

849
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:40,052

...and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.

850
01:13:42,497 --> 01:13:44,055
就在这里
Here it is.

851
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,933
这火炉可能弃置了一百年
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 1 00 years.

852
01:13:51,706 --> 01:13:53,333
好
All right.

853

-不烧书还有什么可以烧？
-What are you doing?

-不可以烧书！
-绝对不可以！
-You can't burn books.
-No, absolutely not.

855
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:08,083
难道你们想冻死？
You want to freeze to death?

856
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:13,251
我去搬多一些来

我同他们一起去
l'm going with them.

859
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,234
有没有餐厅或饭堂之类的地方？
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

860
01:14:21,436 --> 01:14:24,234
只有职员休息室
里面有自动售卖机
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

861
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,740
单靠零食不能支持下去
We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.

垃圾桶总有食物
There's always something

他是十九世纪最重要的思想家
He was the most important thinker
of the 1 9th century.

866
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:52,866
尼采是恋妹狂、大男人主义猪罗
Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.

867
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:54,658
他不是大男人主义猪罗

868

但他是恋妹狂

不好意思，两位

换取边境开放
...to forgive all Latin American debt

Now, multitudes of American families

...l don't know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left....

你没事吧？

895
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:06,100
没事，只是较早前割伤了脚
Yeah, l'm fine. l just--
l cut my leg the other day.

896
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,533
接收到广播吗？
Did you get a signal?

897
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:13,798
一点点
Yeah, for a minute.

898
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,270
怎样？
And?

899
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,441
暴风雪无远弗致
Man, this storm is everywhere.

900
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:24,015
全面袭击北半球

1 5 feet of snow...

902
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:30,185

...and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

903
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,522
你爸不会来得到
l mean, l don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

904
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:38,956
他会来的
No, he'll make it.

905
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:45,569
他会
He'll make it.

906
01:17:50,178 --> 01:17:52,976
白宫向北部各州K
The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert...

907

暴风雪可以致命

大部分地区，所有道路不通行K
...as far south as Pennsylvania....

912
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:10,096
我们在哪里？
Where are we?

913
01:18:12,133 --> 01:18:14,966
似乎在费城北面
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

914
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:19,865
小心！
Look out!

915
01:18:24,245 --> 01:18:25,974

918
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:39,925
取出雪鞋来
Unpack the snowshoes.

919
01:18:40,128 --> 01:18:42,028
我们从这里徒步
We're walking from here.

920
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:46,429
太太，要上路了
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

921
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:51,298
我们只来到布鲁克林
或者应该掉头
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

922
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:55,067
城市给水掩，结了冰，回去无用
Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.

923
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:56,800
起程了

924

我们应该留在图书馆内

保暖
lnsulating.

929
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:39,252
报纸最好，不过这也可以
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

930
01:19:39,587 --> 01:19:43,421
露宿街头几年，学懂了怎样保暖
You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.

931
01:19:44,525 --> 01:19:46,322
给你
Hey.

932
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,362
多谢

你最喜欢哪一次假期？

01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:04,978
除了这一次？
Besides this one?

936
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,242
好
All right.

937
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:11,646
几年前我陪爸去格钞兰做研究K
l went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago...

938
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:18,549
船坏了，进退不得
...and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

939
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:22,186
而且一直下着雨
And it rained constantly.

940
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:26,362
似乎沉闷得很
That sounds really boring.

941
01:20:27,568 --> 01:20:30,036
其实好开心
But actually really nice, you know?

942
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,605
只有我们两父子，相处了十日

hanging out for 1 0 days.

943
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:49,590

944
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,941
法兰！

945
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:49,941
你怎样？
Are you all right?

946
01:21:50,151 --> 01:21:51,345
我没事
l'm fine.

947
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:55,783
只是顺便落去购物
l just dropped in to do a little shopping.

948
01:21:57,158 --> 01:21:58,682
我要割断雪橇
l gotta lose this sled.

949
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:17,774
等一等！我们会拉你上来
Hold on! We'll pull you up.

950
01:22:20,248 --> 01:22:23,217
泽逊！你要撑着法兰的体重
Jason! You've got to support
Frank's weight.

951
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:26,147
得，我会尽力
Okay, l'll try.

952
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,154
我撑住了
Okay, l think l have his weight now.

953
01:22:35,363 --> 01:22:37,058
我去你那里
l'm coming to you.

954
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:52,371
玻璃开始破裂！
The glass is breaking!

955
01:22:54,582 --> 01:22:56,015
太重了
Too much weight.

956
01:22:59,954 --> 01:23:01,444
支撑不住了
lt's not gonna hold.

957
01:23:11,299 --> 01:23:12,493
不要割！不要割！
No. No.

958
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:15,834
法兰，我会救你出来
Frank. l can get you out.

959
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,706
不要割！
Don't do it!

960
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:22,273
-法兰，不要！
-法兰，不要！
-No, Frank, no!
-Frank, no!

961
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:25,809
法兰！
Frank!

962
01:24:09,357 --> 01:24:11,222
这是什么书？
What have you got there?

963
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,525
古本圣经
A Gutenberg Bible.

964
01:24:14,762 --> 01:24:17,026
从珍贵藏书房那里拿来
lt was in the rare books room.

965
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:20,027
你以为神会救你？
You think God's gonna save you?

966
01:24:20,835 --> 01:24:23,565
我不信神
No. l don't believe in God.

967
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:26,900
但你揽圣经揽得相当实
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

968
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,076
我要保护圣经
l'm protecting it.

969
01:24:32,613 --> 01:24:36,071
这本圣经是第一本印刷的书籍
This Bible is the first book ever printed.

970
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:41,888
标志着理性时代的开始
lt represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

971
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:46,283
人类最重大的成就是文字
As far as l'm concerned, the written word
is mankind's greatest achievement.

972
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,185
要笑即管笑
You can laugh.

973
01:24:49,196 --> 01:24:52,290
不过，假若西方文明完蛋K
But if Western civilization is finished...

974
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:56,926
我起码挽救了一小片
...l'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

975
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,801
我们听说有人未走
We heard somebody was left behind.

976
01:25:36,777 --> 01:25:40,440
-我们驶来一部救伤车
-谢天谢地
-We brought an ambulance.
-Thank God.

977
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:45,646
非常多谢你来
Thank you so much for coming.

978
01:26:06,607 --> 01:26:08,097
喂
Hey.

979
01:26:09,043 --> 01:26:11,204
你没事吧？
Hey, are you all right?

980
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,641
你似乎发烧
You look like you have a fever
or something.

981
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:17,943
我没事，只是失眠
l'm fine. l just can't sleep.

982
01:26:20,888 --> 01:26:26,383
不断想着无聊的问答比赛
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

983
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:30,293
-很无聊，是不是？
-并不是
-lt's pretty stupid, huh?
-No, it's all right.

984
01:26:30,498 --> 01:26:33,956
你只是一时适应不来
l guess you just haven't had time
to adjust yet.

985
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:38,330
森，你叫我怎样可以适应？
How am l supposed to adjust, Sam?

986
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:42,841
我发愤读书，为了将来K
Everything l've ever cared about,
everything l've worked for...

987
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:47,006
怎知道没有将来
...has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.

988
01:26:50,518 --> 01:26:54,511
我知道你一直觉得
我太认真对待问答游戏
l know you always thought l took
the competition too seriously.

989
01:26:55,856 --> 01:26:57,653
你说得对
You were right.

990
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:01,227
-一切都是枉费心机
-不，不，我K
-lt was all for nothing.
-No, no. l--

991
01:27:02,196 --> 01:27:06,428
其实我只是回避真正原因
No, l just-- l just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

992
01:27:07,868 --> 01:27:09,495
关于什么？
Truth about what?

993
01:27:13,574 --> 01:27:16,907
关于我参加问答比赛的原因
About why l joined the team.

994
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:24,210
我参赛是为了你
l joined it because of you.

995
01:27:37,331 --> 01:27:38,764
喂
Hey.

996
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:06,287

999
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:13,231
对不起，我们不能再等
l'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.

1000
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:15,802
只走剩我们最后一批
We're the last ones.

1001
01:28:16,737 --> 01:28:18,261
好
All right.

有紧急讯息

她昨晚只是发烧

她的面色十分苍白

不是感冒

你怎么知道呢？

书不只是可以用来烧
她有什么病征？
Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?

1022
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:04,738
她发烧，而且标冷汗

She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1027
01:30:16,457 --> 01:30:19,255

l didn't think anything of it.

1028
01:30:23,764 --> 01:30:25,425

这几日来，我为困在北方的人K
For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people...

1163
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,658
忧心瘦瘦
...who are trapped in the North.

1164
01:53:09,862 --> 01:53:13,320
今日，露出了希望
Today, there is cause for hope.

几小时前，消息传来K

that a small group of people...

1166
01:53:18,170 --> 01:53:21,435
在纽约市，一小群人K
...survived in New York City
against all odds...

1167
01:53:21,641 --> 01:53:24,439
挺过严m气候，绝处逢生
...and in the face
of tremendous adversity.

我下令救援队立即载他们回来K
I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission...

1169
01:53:27,513 --> 01:53:31,347
并且搜索生还者
...to bring them home
and to look for more survivors.

1170
01:54:02,214 --> 01:54:03,681
积！

Look at that.

1173
01:55:05,311 --> 01:55:06,744
什么？
What?

1174

有没有见过那样清淅的天空？
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
