00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:23,818
醉后型男日记

5
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:02,818
波多黎各联合碳化物欢迎你莅临

6
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,443
- 是谁呢？ - 客房服务。
- Who is it? - Room service.

7
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,197
是鸡蛋吗？
Is it eggs?

8
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,616
我不知道，先生。不是我点的。
I don't know, sir. I didn't order it.

9
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,636
你想要开水吗？
You want some water with that?

10
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,138
不...。 不，我不要。
No, no. No, I don't.

11
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,265
看起来你有一个销魂夜呃。
Looks like you had a night.

12
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,188
看起来很完美。

13
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,732
滚出去。
Get out.

14
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,240
我本打算叫服务人员来的。
I intended to bring that to the attention of a member of staff.

15
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,994
我打开时遇到了一些困难。
I had some difficulty getting it to open.

16
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,331
小钥匙挂在房门钥匙里，先生。
It's the little key on the door key, sir.

17
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,583
是呃。
Right.

18
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,007
我一直在找一些坚果。
I was looking for some nuts.

19
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,805
我想尽量避免喝酒。
I tend to avoid alcohol.

20
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,478
有酒喝，我是可以的。
When I can.

21
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,074
我不会讲西班牙语。
I don't speak Spanish.

22
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,185
四十五块。 不找零。
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.

23
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,266
不... 你没在听。
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.

24
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,435
我说海盗，不是洋基。
I said the Pirates, not the Yankees.

25
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,353
我告诉你，今年将是罗伯托年。
It's going to be Roberto's year, I'm telling you.

26
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,022
找莱特曼先生。
Looking for Mr. Letterman.

27
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,523
最后那间。
End of the room.

00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,151
不，不，海盗。
No, no, the Pirates.

29
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,402
你们这些人会搞砸了。
You guys are going to be all over.

30
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,404
是罗伯托克莱门特，老兄。
It's Roberto Clemente, man.

31
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,614
还有，我想谈谈 ... 
And by the way, I want to talk about...

32
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,290
没空！
Not now!

33
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,044
他的周五危机。
He's having the Friday crisis.

34
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,299
- 坎普？ - 是啊。

35
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,843
他昨天在等你耶。
He was expecting you yesterday.

36
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,219
气候不佳。

在纽约的大风雪。
Big snow in New York.

39
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,809
他仍然在通电话。想喝点咖啡吗？
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?

40
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,019
不，谢谢。
No, thanks.

41
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,645
前门在吵什么？
What's all the fuss out front?

42
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,980
你走前门？
You came in the front?

43
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,316
我们不走前门。
We don't use that door.

44
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,693
当洛.吉巴度涨不起来时。
Not when los jibaros pitch up.

45
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,236
他们抗争什么？
What do they want?

46
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,321
我不知道。
I don't know.

47
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,823
为了工资想了一些鬼主意。
Some fucked idea of a living wage.

48
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,785
他们在那里闹了好几个月。
They've been out there on and off for months.

49
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,913
对了，我的名字叫萨拉。
By the way, my name's Sala.

50
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,873
鲍勃撒拉，摄影师。
Bob Sala, staff photographer.

51
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,166
很高兴见到你，鲍勃。
Pleased to meet you, Bob.

52
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,375
是啊。
Yeah.

53
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,586
他好了。
He's off.

54
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,006
你可以试着轻轻的敲门。
You might want to try another subservient knock.

55
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,508
是啊。
Yeah.

56
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,719
坎普。
Kemp.

57
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,721
不要提到假发呃。
Don't notice the wig.

58
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,394
是啊。 什么事？
Yeah. What?

59
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,408
如果你是我想找的人，最好坐下。
If you're who I think you are, you better sit down.

60
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,797
你觉得这里太亮了吗？
You find it a little bright in here?

61
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,175
眼镜要摘下来吗？我眼睛有点毛病。
I'd take them off, but I have a medical condition.

62
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,885
你是什??么意思，你瞎了吗？
What do you mean, you're blind?

63
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,054
结膜炎，长官。
Conjunctivitis, sir.

64
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,932
红眼症，是吧？
The old red eye, huh?

65
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,690
你遇到一个非常艰困的时刻，坎普先生。
You arrive at a very, very trying time, Mr. Kemp.

66
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,984
陈年堆积而成的。
One of those days stacking up.

67
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,696
那么，我们为何不去繁从简，就事论事，对吧？
So, why don't we cut through the niceties and just get right to it, huh?

68
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,489
这就是我想做的。
That's how I like to proceed.

69
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,241
好了。你的简历在这里。
Okay. Your resume here.

70
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,414
令人印象深刻。
Very impressive CV.

71
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,791
是啊。
Yeah.

72
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,252
你有自己的做法及有趣的标题。
You worked your way up some interesting titles.

73
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,424
我喜欢“一口流利的西班牙语。”
I really like the "fluent Spanish."

74
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,757
哇。
Wow.

75
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,222
这简历是一堆废话。
This CV is a bunch of bullshit.

76
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,600
是呃？
Ls it?

77
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,852
这是两天前上线的。
This is two days on the wire.

78
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,521
一天就完了。 我们没得玩了。
A day dead. We don't have it.

79
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,903
默巴克在搞什么？
What is the matter with Moburg?

80
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,364
他有苛Φ耐诳找磺小
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.

81
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,336
你看，报纸上的问题，坎普先生，
You see, the problem with this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

82
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,172
是我在许多报导里最不想见到的。
is that I am among many who don't enjoy reading it.

83
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,549
我们在流通有一个病因，
We have an ailing circulation,

84
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,886
我只能以井窥天的去理解。
and I just have to look around this building to understand why.

85
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,681
缺乏承诺和太多的自我放纵。
Lack of commitment and too much self-indulgence.

86
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
所以我要找
So what I'm looking for

87
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,605
一些热情，一些能源，
is some enthusiasm, some energy,

88
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,024
一些新血。
some fresh blood.

89
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
问题是，我常扪心自问
And the question that I'm asking myself

90
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,364
通常你体内有多少酒精。
is how much alcohol is usual in yours.

91
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,823
我的血液中？
My fresh blood?

92
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,283
你喝多少酒？
How much do you drink?

93
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,286
我想在上次的“社交”。
I suppose at the upper end of "social."

94
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,205
准备戒酒。
I'm poised to give up.

95
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,708
当然，波多黎各不是戒酒的好地方。
Well, Puerto Rico may not be the best place on Earth to do that.

96
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,714
没必要焦虑不安，坎普先生。
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.

97
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,176
在聘用之前，我是不会支付酒店的任何费用。
I wouldn't have paid for your hotel if I hadn't already hired you.

98
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,303
但这不是最后上车的机会，
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon,

99
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,097
我不需要另一个借酒浇愁。
and I do not need another heavy drinker.

100
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,600
我的条件，是眼镜背后的“眼光”，
Which I perceive, from the condition of eyeballs behind glasses,

101
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,310
你很可能够资格。
that you might very well qualify as.

102
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,896
这是眼疾的问题，莱特曼先生。
This is a medical condition, Mr. Letterman.

103
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,690
我知道，看起来像似，但这..
I know it might look like something else, but this is a...

104
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,857
其实就是“宿醉”
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.

105
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,192
是吗？
Does it?

106
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,701
来这里。
Come here.

107
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,206
我乐意见到一个守承诺的人。
That's the kind of commitment I like to see in a man.

108
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,711
判断力，融合力，恰如其份的人。
Determination, balanced with appropriate humanity.

109
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,629
啊，是啊，是啊，是啊，是啊。
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,175
你看好哪一方，坎普？
Which side do you dress, Kemp?

111
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,677
对不起？
I beg your pardon?

112
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,178
政治。
Politics.

113
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,472
我是中间派的。
I kind of hang in the middle.

114
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,562
这是一个精神分裂的社会，坎普。
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.

115
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,857
两种语言，两种标志，两种忠诚，两种国歌。
They got two languages, two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.

116
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,317
带给他们的，也是从未有过的。
We bring them stuff they never had.

117
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,818
他们是又恨又爱。
They either hate it or they want more of it.

118
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,320
这是美国最厌恶的部份。
It's a reluctant part of America.

119
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,447
就像长在英格兰的热带水果。
It's like an England with tropical fruit.

120
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,823
鲍勃。
Bob.

121
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,199
我想要的人选。
Just the man I wanted to see.

122
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,327
这是保罗.坎普。   他是纽约来的新伙伴。
This is Paul Kemp. He's joining us from New York.

123
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,661
啊，是啊，已经照过面了。
Yeah, yeah, we already met.

124
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,497
这是克莱夫多诺万先生，体育部。
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.

125
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,124
这是休伯特先生，会计。
And this is Mr. Hubert, accounting.

126
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,500
听着，帮个忙，可以吗？
Listen, do me a favor, will you?

127
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,002
带他逛逛，该做那些事。
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.

128
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,420
介绍给大家认识。
Introduce him to some of the guys.

129
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,671
我带他去找艾尔。
I'll take him up to Al's.

130
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,797
一定要。  会的。
The hell you will.

131
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,923
你带他去资料库。
You take him to the library.

132
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,133
找一些卷宗。
You pull out some volumes.

133
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,468
我要他找些有意义的文件。
I want him to get a sense of the paper.

134
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,595
知道吧，做些注解，在过去几年内，
You know, make some notes, go back a few years,

135
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,513
要特别注意保龄球馆。
paying particular attention to bowling alleys.

136
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,765
有保龄球和保龄球馆。
There's bowling and bowling alleys.

137
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,266
这里非常大。 如雨后春笋般。
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.

138
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,517
每周一报。
A new one premieres every week.

139
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,019
- 在波多黎各之前？ - 不。
- Been to Puerto Rico before? - No.

140
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,479
你会乐在其中。
You're going to fall right into it.

141
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,564
这里很繁忙，坎普。 是很开放的。
There's a boom on here, Kemp. It's an open door.

142
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,858
你做对了，就能步步高升。
You play it right, you can surf the place.

143
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,820
你知道占星术吗？
What do you know about horoscopes?

144
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,905
不知道。
Nothing.

145
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,365
那么，我可以写，你也可以。
Well, if I can write one, you can.

146
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,534
所以，每天都用特殊的“星之星”
So it's every day with a special "Star's Star"

147
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,370
星期六的主题是贝蒂.葛莱柏，
featured Saturday with Betty Grable

148
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,330
和尼尔.沙达克，之类的东西。
and Neil Sedaka, things like that.

149
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,124
所以，你需要的全部在这里。
So here, everything you need is right there.

150
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,336
这就是所谓的“鲁佐女士的预测”
It's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."

151
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,462
“鲁佐女士”发生了什么事？？
What happened to Madam La Zonga?

152
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,546
她被取消了。
He got canceled.

153
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,423
你的意思是，炒尤鱼？
What do you mean, fired?

154
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,800
她被奸杀。
They raped him to death.

155
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,594
她被奸杀吗？
They raped him to death?

156
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,888
在这里有极少数的岛，
There are very few places on this island

157
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,348
是禁止访问的。
I decline to visit,

158
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,933
但厕所经常是水手在利用。
but the toilets frequented by sailors

159
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,811
甘达多码头西侧是其中之一。
on the west side of Candado Pier is one.

160
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,146
水手奸杀她吗？
They raped him to death?

161
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,482
鲁佐死在一个小隔间内。
La Zonga died in a cubicle.

162
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,319
我说，你不是艺术家，坎普，你是吗？
Say, you're not artistic, are you, Kemp?

163
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,904
哦，不是。
Oh, no.

164
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,490
你该考虑改抽薄荷卷烟。
You might want to rethink those menthol cigarettes.

165
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,992
否则，你可能没烟抽。
They don't do a thing for you.

166
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,221
有空到我家来。
Come by the house.

167
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,389
我会的。
I will.

168
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,184
我喜欢你的题材。
I like your stuff.

169
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,020
你发送给莱特曼的插文。
The cuttings you sent to Letterman.

170
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,022
写的不错。
It's good writing.

171
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,357
谢谢。
Thanks.

172
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,945
我们再讨论。
We'll talk.

173
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,991
再一层！
One more floor!

174
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,620
大约半年前改成自动化包装。
They put in automated packing machines about six months ago.

175
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,789
机械化几乎无所不能。
They mechanized almost everything.

176
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,625
以前要50个人，现在只要5个。
There used to be 50 guys down here. Now there's five.

177
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,377
于是街上洋溢着失业的幸福。
Hence happiness in the street.

178
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,755
纪念品，每日一爆。
Souvenir, day one.

179
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,093
这里的美女都有肮脏的想法。
Here's to pretty women with filthy thoughts.

180
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,181
- 要一个汉堡？ - 不要
- Want a burger? - No.

181
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,682
- 汉堡？ - 不，谢谢。
- Burger? - No, thanks.

182
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,350
试试吧。   两个。
Try it. Dos.

183
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,395
所以，该如何归纳？
So how was the induction?

184
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,813
有点误人子弟。
Somewhat fraught.

185
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,484
无不敬，保罗，他没有太多的选择。
No disrespect, Paul, but he didn't have a lot of choice.

186
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,903
你知道有多少人申请工作吗？
You know how many people applied for the job?

187
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,404
一个。   你。
One. You.

188
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,655
是呃？
Ls that right?

189
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,866
即使这样，我还是要老王卖瓜。
Even then, I thought I'd blown it.

190
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,326
穷是我的弱点。
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.

191
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,827
怎么说？
Which is what?

192
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,914
2.5篇的虚构小说尚未发表。
Two and a half unpublished novels and references of equal fiction.

193
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,415
你是一个小说家。
You're a novelist.

194
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,792
在某种层面上来说。
In a manner of speaking.

195
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,544
还没完成。
Can't even get read.

196
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,005
所以我想先赚点钱，
So I figured I'd do some words for money,

197
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,423
在一年或两年的时间内。
see how it's looking in a year or two.

198
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,799
在艾尔之星吗？
At El Star?

199
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,760
我讨厌用这种说法，
Hate to tell you this on the way in,

200
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,304
但对出版物的发行。
but this publication's on its way out.

201
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,765
就我而言，不是说来就来的。
And as far as I'm concerned, it can't come soon enough.

202
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,350
不会这样的。
Not going to happen.

203
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,435
你喜欢那个小翁加公司吗？
You like a little vonga on that?

204
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,188
这件事从6月2日到13日。
I'll give you 13 to 2 this thing's over by June.

205
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,314
他们将进行断电。
They're going to cut the cord.

206
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,982
所有新的机器吗？
Then why put in all the new machinery?

207
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,693
这是重点，他却无能为力。
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.

208
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,404
好吧，争论让我觉得很累。
Well, like I'm tired of arguing the obvious.

209
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,906
来吧。  我们吃东西。
Come on. Let's eat.

210
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,742
现在，我得去见一个人，谈谈有关马的事。
Now, I got to go and see a man about a horse.

211
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,787
很高兴见到你，保罗。
Good to meet you, Paul.

212
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,502
另一个华灯初上的老圣胡安夜晚。
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.

213
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,671
你待在这里很久了吗？
You been here long?

214
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
太久了。
Too long.

215
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,174
这个地方真他妈的逊毙了
This place is like someone you fucked

216
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,717
死缠着你不放。
and they're still under you.

217
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,052
你为什么不退出呢？
Why don't you quit?

218
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,679
人生处处有出路。
Life's full of exits.

219
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,848
因为我只能等到倒闭，才能拿到的酬劳。
Because I'm waiting for it to collapse so I get the payoff.

220
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,810
三种压力让我留在墨西哥。
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.

221
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,147
不要往左看。
Don't look left.

222
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,984
你最好不要认识他。
That's an introduction you don't want to have.

223
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,610
他是谁？
Who's he?

224
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,281
活生生的例子，与本报社的错误。
Living example of everything that's wrong with this paper.

225
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,199
他叫默博。
His name's Moburg.

226
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,869
我们犯罪和宗教事务的记者。
Our Crime and Religious Affairs correspondent.

227
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,497
莱特曼不能解雇他，因为从没见过他。
Letterman can't fire him because he never sees him.

228
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,207
他很少在白天出来。
He's rarely out in daylight.

229
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,792
他很喜欢喝酒。
Looks like he enjoys a drink.

230
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,129
满脑子存放的只是朗姆酒。
The entire substructure of his brain is eaten away with rum.

231
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,632
我告诉你，这家企业是注定要失败。
I'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.

232
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,262
也许有三，四个专业人才在撑住报社。
There's maybe three or four professionals in the building running the entire show.

233
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,807
等等。     谁是哈尔.桑德森？
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?

234
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,268
在资料库。   他是谁？
In the library. Who's he?

235
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,937
他的工作是管理文件。
He used to work for the paper.

236
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,316
现在，是，他说是什么公关顾问。
Now he's what he says he is. A PR consultant.

237
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,319
这个地方的销售由街到街直到洋基。
Selling this place street by street to the Yankees.

238
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,197
靠着一个叫西格拉的滑头小混蛋。
Keeps a greasy little bastard of a contact called Segurra.

239
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,117
我见过。  没有交谈。
I saw him. We didn't meet.

240
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,533
不用介意。
Wouldn't bother.

241
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,037
当作小便。
Piss on the make.

242
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,998
那小子，西格拉拥有不义之财。
The boy, Segurra, is at the property wickedness.

243
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,876
我不知道桑德森是否参与。
I'm not sure where Sanderson fits.

244
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,253
但桑德森是值得栽培的。
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.

245
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,463
他有一些良好的关系。
He's got some good connections.

246
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,256
他适合在自由业。
He's good for some freelance.

247
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,386
这里真令人沉闷，今晚除外。
This place is depressing me beyond belief tonight.

248
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,597
你住普来兹酒店，对吧？
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?

249
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,475
来吧。  我送你一程。
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

250
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,412
我在想，如果你需要在某处，
I was thinking, if you need somewhere,

251
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,247
我租的房间。
I got a room for rent.

252
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,085
在城里不是最佳的地点，但有冰箱和电视机。
Not the best address in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.

253
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,461
每个月60块。
60 a month.

254
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,755
听起来很诱人，我会考虑的。
Sounds inviting. I might remention that.

255
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
还有，别喝死了。
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.

256
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,769
先生...
Sir...

257
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,813
我想游泳。
I was hoping for a swim.

258
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,439
泳池今晚暂停。
The pool is closed tonight.

259
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,316
真的吗？ 为什么呢？ 这是怎么回事？
Really? Why? What's going on?

260
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,777
这是一个联合碳化物公司的派对。
It's a Union Carbide party.

261
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,278
这是一个私人的派对。
It's a private function.

262
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,496
对不起。
Sorry.

263
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,707
我不知道这里有人。
I didn't realize anyone was there.

264
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,917
我只是在这里浮泳。
I thought it was just floating.

265
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,170
只是浮泳。
It is just floating.

266
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,630
你干嘛，跟我一样啊？
You doing what I'm doing?

267
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,175
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

268
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,885
那你在做什么呢？
What are you doing?

摆脱可怕的派对。
Escaping the dreadful party.

270

我只是想舒缓压力。

271
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,226
是呃，你真有勇气。
Well, that's very courageous of you.

272
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,271
我还以为是美人鱼咧。
I thought maybe you were a mermaid.

273
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,356
他们告诉我美人鱼常在海岸出没。
They tell me the coast is infested with them.

274
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,192
我来自康涅狄格州。

275
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,028
我男朋友的演说会。

需要整整21分钟。

277
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,033
好吧，我想这很无聊的，我请你喝酒。
Well, then I guess it's pointless, me inviting you for a drink.

278
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,285
你有什么呢？
What you got?

279
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,120
不，我的意思是在酒吧。
No, I mean at the bar.

280
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,458
无聊。
Pointless.

281
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,045
在去之前，最好让他们知道我在哪里。
I'd better go before they wonder where I went.

282
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,299
等一下。你叫什么名字？
Wait a minute. What's your name?

283
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,760
让我们保守秘密。
Let's keep that a secret.

284
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
我没有你的任何资讯。
I don't even know it.

285
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,222
最好，你最好就是保持这样。
Well, then you'll keep it even better.

286
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,807
你是什么星座？
What about your star sign?

287
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,725
我是一位知名的天文学家。
I'm an experienced astronomer.

288
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,228
可以试试双鱼座。
Could try Pisces.

289
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,938
鱼啊。
The fish.

290
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,650
噢，天啊。
Oh, God.

291
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,902
她为什么要出现？
Why did she have to happen?

292
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,113
就当做我没有遇见过。
Just when I was doing so good without her.

293
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,700
波多黎各哪里最喜欢，你会怎么说呢？
What would you say you like most about Puerto Rico?

294
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,453
保龄球馆和赌场。
The bowling alleys and the casinos.

295
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,539
当然，她喜欢免税。
Course, she likes the duty free.

296
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,791
那么，你花越多，就省越多。
Well, the more you spend, the more you save.

297
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,501
你见过很多的岛屿吗？
Have you seen a lot of the island?

298
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,128
我们没离开酒店过。
We don't leave the hotel.

299
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,964
那是不安全的。
It isn't safe.

300
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,048
但这样有乐趣吗？
But you're having fun?

301
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,759
哦，是的！一种洛塔，洛塔的乐趣！
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!

302
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
一些有趣的是他妈的卢杰。
Have some fun with a fucking Luger.

303
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,266
那些小巷对老饕很诱惑的。
These alleys are magnets to the glutton.

304
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,143
下船的人像蝗虫一样多。
They come off the boats like locusts.

305
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,439
肥胖猪头。
Beasts of obesity.

306
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,984
驴子感应不到箭头。
Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.

307
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,612
伟大的白人。
The great whites.

308
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,490
可能是地球上最危险的生物。
Probably the most dangerous creatures on Earth.

309
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,045
有你的宝贝。
There's your baby.

310
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
沃尔特和他的女人。
Walt and his woman.

311
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,216
不正是我心目中的保龄球馆。
Bowling alleys isn't exactly what I had in mind.

312
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,885
践踏它，直到冰雪融化，
Tread it till the snow melts,

313
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,386
然后加入出埃及记。
then join the exodus.

314
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,805
红灯！
Red light!

315
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
找坎普。
Looking for Kemp.

316
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,728
太多的形容词，太多的冷嘲热讽。
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.

317
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,563
没有人在乎什么是错的，
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place,

318
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,106
他们只在乎什么是对的。
they want to read about what's right.

319
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
- 这是重写的。 - 是的，我注意到了。
- It's a rewrite. - Yeah, I'm aware of that.

320
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,484
而你也在其中，
And while you're at it,

321
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,403
你可能要重写标题，并称它为
you might want to rewrite the title and call it

322
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,655
“我爱波多黎各的十大纪事。”
"Ten Things That I Love About Puerto Rico."

323
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,329
所以
So,

324
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,956
清醒的未来如何？
how's the sobriety coming along?

325
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,958
我砍掉了。
I'm cutting down.

326
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,629
我的意思是酒瓶的大小。
By that, I assume you mean the size of the bottles.

327
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,509
是不是每个人都喝161的样品酒呢？
How does anybody drink 161 miniatures?

328
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,429
每周你要喝掉 93 瓶的样品酒。
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.

329
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
他们一天要存放四次？
What, do they stock the place four times a day?

330
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,849
难道不是免费的吗？
Are they not complimentary?

331
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,267
坎普先生，不是的。
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.

332
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,561
不只是酒还有长途电话。
And neither is wine and long-distance phone calls.

333
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,190
因此，截至周一，你不再是世外桃源的居民。
So, as of Monday, you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.

334
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,651
是什么把你带进来的？
And what exactly brings you into the building?

335
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,777
我不要淡褐色。
Don't hazel me.

336
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,613
我拿到 X光片。  我活不到一个星期了。
I got the X-rays back. I got less than a week to live.

337
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,282
淡褐色吗？你在说什么，你这瑞典痞子？
Hazel you? What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?

338
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,535
你知道，太超过了，你还有心肝吗？
You know, it may have crossed what's left of your mind

339
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,162
这里有一家报社在运作，
that I have a newspaper to run here,

340
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,165
所谓的消息来源。
that we have something called news going on out there.

341
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
至于你所担心的，
But as far as you're concerned,

342
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,086
我还不如对他妈的窗口看！
I might as well look out of the fuckin' window!

343
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,129
你来这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

344
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,465
这是报社，这里不需你要。
This is a newspaper. There's nothing here for you.

345
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,094
拿两个铲子来，别想从我这里挖出东西来。
Two of the best scoops you ever had came out of my brain.

346
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,347
你讲话最好客气点，否则我到别家去。
And you better moderate your language or I'll go elsewhere.

347
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,558
别家？ 你找不到工作的。
Elsewhere where? You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.

348
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,310
你一文不值，默巴克。
You're worthless, Moburg.

349
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,312
你玩完了。
The last onion in the jar.

350
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,523
不要推我，莱特曼。
Don't push me, Letterman.

351
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,983
推我是很危险的。
I'm dangerous when pushed.

352
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,567
我知道你为什么还在这里。
I know why you're here.

353
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,236
为了奖金。
It's payday.

354
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,655
依你的情况，奖金是被延期的。
But in your case, deferred on a permanent basis.

355
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,823
你被解雇了！
You're fired!

356
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,324
你不能开除我。
You can't fire me.

357
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,742
你欠我的工资。
You owe me money.

358
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,328
你最好付清，不然我就告到上头。
And you better pay it, or I'll come through the roof

359
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,580
让这事变成保险索赔。
and turn this place into an insurance claim.

360
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,124
你在威胁我？
Are you threatening me?

361
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,333
嘿，老兄，我们好好谈。
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.

362
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,419
你想试试巫毒术吗？
You want to suffer some voodoo?

363
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,712
你这痞子！
You twerp!

364
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,588
吃亡命丸去吧，莱特曼！
Eat the death pill, Letterman!

365
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,383
来吧，我们走。
Come on, we're walking.

366
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,427
你听到他说我什么吗？
Did you hear what he said to me?

367
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,178
这家伙，让我血压上升。
This guy's my blood pressure.

368
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,763
这家伙会把我气死。
This guy's going to kill me.

369
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,559
我要消毁那张照片！
And I want the negative of that picture destroyed!

370
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,396
我不想这畜牲在这里。
I don't want that animal in this building again.

371
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,189
他是肮脏卑鄙的小人。
He is hygienically unacceptable.

372
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
你看到他的鼻侧吗？
Did you see the side of his nose?

373
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,735
黑的就像个瞎子。
Blackheads like Braille.

374
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,653
他们应该放下他。
They should have him put down.

375
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,865
让默巴克成为历史。
Moburg is history.

376
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,117
早期他在这里是有机会的。
He's out of here at the earliest opportunity.

377
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,079
早期的机运。
And the earliest opportunity

378
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,374
是你。
is you.

379
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,127
你明白我的意思，坎普吗？
You understand what I'm saying, Kemp?

380
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,046
我了解你的论点。
I think I get the drift.

381
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,298
我要你在这文件下功夫，
I want you to immerse yourself into this paper,

382
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,467
因为你是个人才，所以你一定会成功的。
'cause you got the talent and I think you got the will.

383
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,677
你造就它并一起茁壮。
You make it grow and you grow right along with it.

384
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,680
我不是最佳人选。
I'm not best placed to do that.

385
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,059
你以为是我让你重写占星术和保龄球馆的吗？
You think it's my intention to keep you on horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?

386
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,354
事实上，我现在要启发你。
Matter of fact, I'm gonna move you right now.

387
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,650
坐出租车到机场去。
Take a cab to the airport.

388
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,986
迈阿密的市长来访
The mayor of Miami's coming in.

389
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,697
把他的形象做好。
Make him sound nice.

390
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,075
要有照片??和专访。
I want a picture and an interview.

391
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,493
去完成它，保罗。
Make it work, Paul.

392
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,181
你离开我们了吗？
You leaving us already?

393
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,185
如果市长这家伙还不现身，我会搬到公寓去。
I'm moving into an apartment if this mayor guy ever shows up.

394
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,522
他们不断的改“延迟”再“延迟”。
They keep changing "delayed" to "delayed."

395
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,028
你要吃点早餐吗？
You want to have some breakfast?

396
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,863
沙滩上的小龙虾吗？
Little lobster on the beach?

397
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,490
20分钟的路程。
Twenty minutes away.

398
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,158
听起来像是邀请，但我得等市长来。
Sounds inviting, but I got to wait for the mayor.

399
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,952
不来了。
Isn't coming.

400
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,078
取消。
Canceled.

401
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,330
飞机时刻板写的。
That's not what it says on the board.

402
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,873
再一分钟。
It will in a minute.

403
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,083
我问过迈阿密那边。
I just called Miami.

404
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,502
来吧，我们吃早餐去。
Come on, let's have some breakfast.

405
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,046
有两件事，你可能有兴趣。
I got a couple things might interest you.

406
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,550
我得打电话。
I better call in.

407
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,343
你可以在车上打。
You can call from the car.

408
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,313
好呀。是啊，谢谢。
All right. Yeah, thanks.

409
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,653
这里只有两个岛屿。
There's only two of those on the island.

410
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,738
也许三个。
Maybe three.

411
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,616
没有人告诉我，这里这么漂亮。
No one told me it was so pretty here.

412
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,911
赚钱的好办法。
God's idea of money.

413
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,667
你知道是什么让这里变成金矿的吗？
You know what makes this place a gold mine?

414
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,336
不存在的东西。
Something that doesn't exist.

415
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,462
怎么会？
How's that?

416
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,839
土地。
Land.

417
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,757
不够。
There isn't enough of it.

418
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,470
那些知道如何弄到金矿的人。
Those who know how to get it get the gold.

419
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,222
雪诺？
Chenault?

420
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,480
保罗和我们一起早餐。
Paul's joining us for breakfast.

421
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,149
看起来像是去吃午餐。
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.

422
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,944
这是雪诺。
This is Chenault.

423
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,532
你们互相认识？
You two know each other?

424
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,160
不知道耶，也许在飞机上见过面。
I don't know, I thought maybe we met on the plane.

425
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,620
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

426
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,288
有男友航空公司吗？
I flew Boyfriend Airlines.

427
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,874
告诉我，保罗，龙虾喜欢吗？
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?

428
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,751
你知道吧，我今天可能没有时间。
You know what, I might not have time today.

429
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,920
不知道司机为何这么久还没来。
I didn't realize the drive was gonna take so long.

430
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,004
你剩多少时间？
How much time you got?

431
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,839
在15分钟内，我迟到了。
In 15 minutes, I'm late.

432
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,758
我来切凤梨。
I'll cut up a pineapple.

433
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,302
你应该把衣服穿上。
You might want to put on some clothes.

434
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,847
她是裸体做日光浴的。
She sunbathes in the nude.

435
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,102
当地的居民故意晒黑，把它当做旅游一样。
A few of the over-tanned locals tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.

436
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,603
我不感到奇怪。
Doesn't surprise me.

437
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,064
我的意思是，这是非常雅致的方法。
I mean that in a very tasteful way.

438
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,607
这是一个私人海滩。
It's a private beach.

439
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,942
他们不会来这里的。
They shouldn't be here.

440
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,361
坐下，保罗坐下。我会替你叫辆车。
Sit down, Paul, sit down. We'll grab you a cab.

441
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,908
他叫哈利。
His name's Harry.

442
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,369
取名自一本书。
Got the idea from a book.

443
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,205
保罗，我想谈谈
Paul, I wanted to talk,

444
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,041
因为我要找的人是
because I'm looking for someone who can

445
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,546
须具有同化与矛盾的观点
assimilate contradictory points of view

446
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,339
能让大家口径一致。
and make them into one voice.

447
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,300
你是一个小说家，对不对？
You're a novelist, right?

448
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,884
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that?

449
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,345
噢，得了吧。  八卦报纸多的是。
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.

450
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,473
我要找的人要能言善道，次日，就能翻盘。
I'm looking for someone who's good with words, next day, you turn up.

451
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,850
因为，我相信好运气，
And 'cause I believe in good luck,

452
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,476
我想，也许你有同感。
I thought maybe you were it.

453
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,270
我需要的是
What I need

454
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,440
眼光精准的那种人。
is someone with the right kind of eyes.

455
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,942
精准什么？
For looking at what?

456
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,403
精准那些。
Looking at that.

457
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,284
海洋的财富。
An ocean of money.

458
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,840
嘿，你来了。
Hey, you made it.

459
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,842
门在最后面。
Door at the end.

460
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,845
- 嘿。   - 嘿。
- Hey. - Hey.

461
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,931
嘿。  给我两分钟。
Hey. Just give me two minutes.

462
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,808
右转进去。
Walk right in.

463
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,101
好吧。
All right.

464
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,585
在你来之前，我试图把这里整理好。
I was trying to get the place shipshape before you arrived.

465
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,087
阿道夫希特勒的演讲？
Adolf Hitler Speaks?

466
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,840
不是我的。默巴克以前是纳粹。
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.

467
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,383
默巴克住在这里？
Moburg lives here?

468
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,885
他的制服还留在这里。
He keeps his uniform here.

469
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,471
这一个月我还没见过他。
I never see him from one month's end to the next.

470
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,977
所以，你可以看到，这是相当宽广的。
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.

471
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,271
别看厨房里。
Don't look in the kitchen.

472
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,356
水关了。 水龙头有问题。
The water's off. There's a problem with the valve.

473
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,109
你说你有一台电视机。
Thought you said you had a TV.

474
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,194
我说我有一种电视机。
I said I kind of have a TV.

475
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,702
对面巷子里的家伙配备了电视，而我有望远镜。
The guy across the alley has a TV, I have binoculars.

476
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,287
他的妻子是聋哑人士。
His wife's deaf.

477
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,664
打开窗户，你能听到每一个字。
With the window open, you hear every word.

478
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,875
来了。
Here it comes.

479
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,334
水来了。
Water's coming up.

480
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,004
我注意到你卧室里的一些鸡。
I noticed you had some chickens in the bedroom.

481
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,130
公鸡。
Cockerels.

482
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,465
呃，我流汗全身油渍渍的。
Yeah, I'm sweating the grease out.

483
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,633
不要担心，我会把鸡移到我的房间。
Don't worry about them, I'm moving them to my room.

484
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,801
你养它们做什么？
What do you do with them?

485
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,052
- 吃它吗？    - 吃它？
- You eat them? - Eat them?

486
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,222
不。  我才不吃它。
Nah. I don't eat them.

487
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,533
加油，宝贝，加油！
Come on, baby, come on!

488
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,368
那里，咬那里！
Get in there, get in there!

489
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,495
加油啊！
Come on!

490
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,138
嘿，贸易风，我的孩子！贸易风！
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy! On a trade wind!

491
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,431
来吧，硬起来，那里，鲍比。
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.

492
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,808
碰...碰...  是的，先生！
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!

493
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,356
嘿。  他们叫它厄尔怪物。
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.

494
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,026
三年来未曾败过。
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.

495
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,863
来吧，我们离开这里。
Come on, we're out of here.

496
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,993
来吧，快... 直达车。
Come on, rapido, rapido.

497
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,122
嘿，嘿，哇... 
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

498
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,207
来吧。来吧。推啊。
Come on. Come on. Go on.

499
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,900
我告诉你，我们继续坳，直到翻盘。
I tell you, we were on a roll til that thing turned up.

500
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,861
这是217元。
That's $217.

501
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,154
不错。
Not bad.

502
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,073
217元是载粪钱。
$217 is a shitload of money.

503
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,407
等同于载粪钱。
Relatively a shitload.

504
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,368
他们培训的费用很贵。
They're expensive to train.

505
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,663
我见过有人赢得2000元，1万，在北滩。
I've seen guys win 2,000, ten on North Beach.

506
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,247
1万元？
10,000?

507
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,375
他为什么不把厄尔怪物带去那里？
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?

508
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,586
你说的是希尔顿酒店附近。
You're talking the environs of the Hilton Hotel.

509
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,672
他们佩戴领结和光鲜的鞋子。
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.

510
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,590
无法企望戴那种帽子。
There's no hope for his kind of hat.

511
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,513
问题是，再次，那不是目标之一。
The question, again, is not one of goals.

512
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,639
我们为了实现这些目标。
We're for those goals.

513
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,765
手段之一。
It's one of means.

514
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,934
你宣称是否艾森豪政府...
Were you claiming that the Eisenhower administration...

515
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,771
洗刷这种耻辱能持续多久呢？
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?

516
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,817
看这忘恩负义的浑蛋，自称他自己很公正。
Look at this ingrate besotted with his own righteousness.

517
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,028
黑白分明。
Black is a very dark shade of white.

518
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,114
好的，非常感谢你，尼克森先生。
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.

519
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,409
我听不下去了。
I can't listen to any more of this.

520
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,785
说谎跟吃饭一样。
Lies like he breathes.

521
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,122
想像一下，你一生都是躺着过活。
Imagine spending your entire life lying.

522
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,748
神圣的基督。
Holy Christ.

523
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,084
从来没有变得更糟。
Never got worse.

524
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,339
唯一的可能性是，有一天你会比他更糟的
The only eventuality worse than him is you know that one day,

525
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,217
一些肮脏的妓女，就要现身了
some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up,

526
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,927
使他看起来像一个自由派。
make him look like a liberal.

527
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,305
尼克森是不可能赢的。
The only upside with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.

528
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,141
他的笑容。
He's got the grin.

529
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,392
他是不可能赢的。
He ain't gonna win.

530
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,018
爱尔兰这家伙会赢。
Irish guy's going to win.

531
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,895
但是，他们不可能让他活的。
But they'll never let him live.

532
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,606
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

533
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,650
我做“恐怖占星术。”
I do "horror-scopes."

534
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,572
你说他不会来这里。
Thought you said he never came here.

535
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:37,074
他拿到过滤器了。
He's got filters.

536
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,376
那种过滤器？
What filters?

537
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,288
他越过百加得工厂的墙。
He goes over the wall at the Barcardi plant.

538
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:46,917
这种过滤器在最后蒸馏过程中用的。
These filters are the last in line in the distillation process.

539
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,213
内含火箭燃料用的乙醇。
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.

540
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,339
类似什么呢？
What's it like?

541
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,091
大脑的手。
A hand on the brain.

542
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,843
关闭的范围。
Off the scale.

543
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,595
470验证。
470 proof.

544
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,638
没有470这样的东西来验证酒精。
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.

545
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,979
你可能会适度的要求。
Certainty you might be required to moderate.

546
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,610
在提取区域，禁止吸烟。
No smoking in the extraction area, if you please.

547
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,028
真是好笑。
Don't be ridiculous.

548
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,626
不是供大众的饮酒。
Not for the social drinker.

549
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,879
你有兴趣畅饮吗？
You want to quaff?

550
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,130
不要
No.

551
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,965
不是现在，我要写作。
Not right now. I got to write.

552
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,175
我有最后的期限。
I got a deadline.

553
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,052
他写些什么呢？
What's he writing?

554
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,013
他搬开石头去完成“美国梦”。
He's lifting the stone on the American Dream.

555
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,264
关尼尔海湾。
Guayanilla Bay.

556
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,767
哦，是呃。 那里很糟糕的。
Oh, yeah. it's bad down there.

557
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,687
你这样的主题，只能吸引少数的读者。
You might find such a topic attracts a limited readership.

558
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,189
只要一个就行。
Only need one.

559
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,066
送到莱特曼那里。
Taking it to Letterman.

560
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:54,985
是啊，我听说要点“好运气”？
Yeah. Did I hear somebody say "good luck"?

561
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,114
是啊，我早上要去那里。
Yeah, I went down there this morning,

562
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,577
实际上他不敢开除我，他只能空想。
he unfired me on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.

563
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,247
我想带些东西给莱特曼。
I'd like to bring something in to Letterman.

564
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,792
像幻灯片，“你他妈的”枪。
Like a slide-action, "fuck you" gun.

565
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,753
不要在这里喝。
Don't drink that here.

566
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,174
只是尼泊隆，老男童。
Just a nipperoo, old boy.

567
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,926
质量测试。
Quality test.

568
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,181
老兄，就像电影情节里的慢动作谋杀。
Man, slow-motion murder, just like they do in the movies.

569
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,226
看见他飘回来
See him flying back,

570
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,979
他娘的“枪炮在空中飞奔。
fuckin' arms flapping in the air.

571
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,273
好吧，妈妈。
Okay, mother.

572
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,568
抬头看，最后你面对的这边就是地狱！
Look upon the last face you'll see this side of hell!

573
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,902
碰！
Bam!

574
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:43,492
他倒下去，身体爆裂成肉块。
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs spinning off into flesh orbit.

575
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:44,827
碰！
Bam!

576
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,954
去他妈的屁眼。
There goes his asshole.

577
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,038
碰！
Bam!

578
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,915
去他妈的鸟蛋。
There goes his dick.

579
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,917
碰！ 碰！
Bam! Bam!

580
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,211
去他妈的，莱特曼！
Fuck you, Letterman!

581
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:58,132
你在他妈的B级电影里，我就是机器杀手！
You're in a B-fucking movie, and I am the death machine!

582
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,095
我们还要有阿道夫？
Shall we have some Adolf?

583
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,388
千万不要。
Definitely not.

584
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,682
上你的路，上你的路，默巴克。
On your way, on your way, Moburg.

585
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,475
嘿，我们有客人在。
Hey, we're expecting guests.

586
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,519
你说他正在写一本书。
I thought you said he was writing a book.

587
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,770
我在写一篇短文。
Said I was writing an essay.

588
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,647
我只要你闭嘴。
And it requires some shut mouth.

589
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,067
不要浪费时间在垃圾失败者的身上。
Don't waste your time on those junkyard losers.

590
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,404
这个国家建立在种族歧视和奴役制度。
This country was built on genocide and slavery.

591
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,281
我们杀光了所有的黑人，在这里
We killed all the black guys that were here,

592
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,659
然后，我们再运来新的黑人来
and then we shipped in new black guys of our own,

593
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,245
接着我们把耶稣带来，像酒吧间的肥皂。
and then we brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.

594
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,413
走吧。
Let's go.

595
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,789
你知道的。
You know it.

596
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,042
我是宗教的新闻记者。
I am the religious correspondent.

597
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,045
滚开，你这个耶稣警察！
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!

598
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,048
如果“圣经”是上帝的书，他为何没给大家呢？
If the Bible's God's book, why didn't He give it to everyone?

599
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,014
我们宁可发钱来停车，却没钱给孩子吃。
"We give more money to parking meters than we do to kids to eat."

600
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,516
别这样看。  我已经做了研究。
Don't read me like that. I've done the research.

601
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,396
12,000吨铁桶锈蚀后，海湾充满了盐酸。
12,000-ton rust bucket went down in the bay full of hydrochloric acid.

602
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,898
残害海里所有的生物。
Killed off everything in the sea.

603
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,192
毁了渔民。让他们的孩子沦为捡垃圾。
Killed off the fishermen. Their kids are picking garbage.

604
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,652
好吧，别生气。
All right, don't get angry.

605
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,945
外面很热。
It's hot outside.

606
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,238
你要喝吗？
You want a Scotch?

607
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,406
好啊。
Yeah.

608
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,036
十年前...五。  五年前
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,

609
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
我可能会说，展望未来。
I might have said go after it.

610
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,749
现在我想听天由命。
Now I say go with it.

611
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,793
无可改变的。
There's nothing you can change.

612
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,797
有时候多说无益，并避免争吵。
Sometimes you just got to spew over the side and keep rowing.

613
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,092
像夕阳的余辉。
Into a nut brown sunset.

614
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,970
土地发出积怨的愤怒。
It's the land of multiple outrage.

615
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,556
在起床吃早餐前，已遭千践万踏了。
Thousands trodden on before you wake up for breakfast.

616
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,060
这已经不是新闻，这是商业的现实。
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.

617
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,729
夕阳并不是他们的专利
And providing it isn't their sunset,

618
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,649
没有人想买他妈的五分之一股权。
nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.

619
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,567
你低估你的读者。
You underestimate your readers.

620
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,694
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

621
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,487
你也低估了我。
You underestimate me.

622
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,156
你告诉我，认真工作，这就是我想要的。
You told me to make it work, that's what I want to do.

623
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,659
风沿着拉容嘉的废话也能上报纸。
Wind down this La Zonga crap and make a newspaper.

624
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,327
告诉你实情。
Let me tell you some home truth.

625
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,622
报社是跪求银行才能撑到今天。
This paper's been on its knees to a bank since the day it opened.

626
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,833
像世上许多的报社
And like most every other newspaper on Earth,

627
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,334
资金来自广告收入。
it's financed by its advertising.

628
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,628
没有广告，不仅是有没有报社
And without advertising, not only is there no La Zonga,

629
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,588
更没有所谓的报纸，就这样。
there's no paper to put it in, so, thus,

630
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,174
有些事我们不能写。
there are one or two things that we don't write about.

631
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,759
换句话说，当作不知道。
In other words, nothing at all.

632
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,761
另一种说法，酌权处理。
In one other word, discretion.

633
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,680
你不是一个外国记者。
You're not a foreign correspondent

634
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,017
在遥远的外国土地上，这是美国。
in some far-flung foreign land, this is America.

635
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,393
这是波多黎各。
This is Puerto Rico.

636
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
这的确是美国。
This is America.

637
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,189
那些水管工人，平常从伊利诺伊
You think some plumber from Normal, Illinois,

638
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,234
搭船到这里来可节省高达25年的时间
saves up for 25 years to come here on a cruise ship

639
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,862
在景气不好的时候种植甘蔗园？
to read about bad times in the sugar plantation?

640
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,864
他们也不敢他妈的！
They don't give a fuck!

641
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,532
普通的老百姓不敢捣乱
The average guy don't rock the boat,

642
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,325
因为要依赖它。
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.

643
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,078
而我们的读者大都是被动的。
And our readership is vividly average.

644
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,541
他们不在乎谁是失败者。
They don't care who the losers are.

645
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,419
他们只在乎谁赢了。
They want to know who won.

646
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,712
谁赢得了碗
Who won the bowls,

647
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,882
他比赛赢了，玩角子机赢到锅子。
who won the races, who won the pot at the slot machines.

648
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,261
看着我，坎普。
Look at me, Kemp.

649
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,014
你没睡觉，你很清醒。
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.

650
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,600
这就是“美国梦”。
And this is the American Dream.

651
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,021
因此，许多酒店，看不到海。
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.

652
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,106
你想看海就得通过检查进到酒店。
You can see the sea by checking into the hotels.

653
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,441
花钱看海吗？
Pay to see the sea?

654
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,443
就是这么一回事？
What's the matter with that?

655
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,320
你只能寄望在梦中。
You're paying to be in the dream.

656
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,573
这个很薄的木皮，坎普
There's a thin veneer, Kemp,

657
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
就是梦想和现实之间。
between the dream and the reality.

658
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,287
你唤醒他们，他们便向你要求钱。
You wake them up and the people might start asking for their money back.

659
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,253
你是老板。
You're the boss.

660
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
不全是。
Not quite.

661
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,844
社论政策只是本报拥有的梦想。
The editorial policy of this newspaper is owned by the dream.

662
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,396
噢，天啊。
Oh, God.

663
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,529
哦，我的妈呀。
Oh, Christ.

664
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,954
哦，天啊，看看那个。
Oh, God, look at that.

665
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,166
哦，天啊！
Oh, God!

666
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,751
哈尔？
Hal?

667
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,837
不，不，我是哈尔的朋友。
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.

668
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,797
我一直在寻找他的船。
I was looking at his boat.

669
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,674
它是一艘可爱的小美女。
She's a sweet little beauty.

670
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,092
你搭过吗？
You been aboard?

671
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,343
没有
No.

672
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,845
壮丽的小岛屿。
Great little island hopper.

673
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,763
我们都去过。
We've all been down on her.

674
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,807
是一个美妙的体验。
It's a wonderful experience.

675
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,481
你们提早来了。
You two are early.

676
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,608
你很幸福。
You got lucky.

677
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,817
是啊。
Yeah.

678
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,110
吉姆，见过吗？
Did you meet?

679
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,820
是啊，我们用第一个名字。
Yeah, we got first names.

680
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,908
亚特朱巴格，美国已故海军陆战队员，一位伟大的朋友。
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S. Marines, great friend of mine.

681
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,535
这是保罗坎普先生，纽约时报。
This is Mr. Paul Kemp, New York Times.

682
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,870
你是作家。
You're the writer.

683
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,121
保罗是小说家。
Paul's a novelist.

684
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,500
纽约时报。
New York Times?

685
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,502
他不知道你从哪里来。
He don't know one from the other.

686
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,546
紧跟着他。  这家伙是关键。
Just go with it. This guy's key.

687
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,964
关键什么？
Key to what?

688
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,842
我们要讨论的关键。
Key to the discussion we're about to have.

689
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,181
看那些痞子。
Look at those mothers.

690
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,184
跟我来，坎普。
Come with me, Kemp.

691
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,021
这是一个私人海滩。
This is a private beach.

692
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,314
我们没有要到海滩啊。
We are not on it.

693
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,149
没有，是我们的！
No, but we are!

694
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,151
我们才叫做是私人的！
And what we do is private!

695
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,238
现在他妈的滚！
Now get the fuck gone!

696
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,034
他妈的滚出去！
Get the fuck out of here!

697
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,577
再让我看到你，下次
I see your face again,

698
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,622
你就赏你一把12口径的霰弹枪，告诉你怎么做。
you're gonna have a 12-gauge shotgun telling you what to do.

699
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,800
谈谈撒旦...
Talking about Satan...

700
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,178
如果撒旦的国度是存在的，就是苏联。
if there ever was a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

701
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,516
只有这样，才能用共产主义去消灭它。
The only way to come to terms with Communism is to destroy it.

702
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,437
民主，要毁灭民主得先击垮美国才行。
Hit it before it hits us in a devastating democratic strike.

703
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,106
没有比这更重要。
No more for the major.

704
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,693
他们正在找一个执行的人
They're looking for a man to push that button,

705
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,444
我就是那个人。
I am that man.

706
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,530
是的，你，亲爱的。
Yes, you are, honey.

707
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,783
你真令人陶醉，香奈儿。
You look ravishing, Chenault.

708
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,118
谢谢。
Thank you.

709
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,244
你需要救援吗？
You need rescuing?

710
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,745
不要把他带走。
Don't take him away.

711
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,455
他非常有趣。
He's very entertaining.

712
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,961
我们在讨论古巴，不知道有没有偏离，没有吧？
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't know, we kind of veered off, didn't we?

713
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,422
保罗介绍我们一些自由派的观点。
Paul presents us with a somewhat liberal point of view.

714
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,173
有没有自由派这种东西呢。
There is no such thing as a liberal.

715
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:58,719
自由派的想法是来自一位共产党员的黑人学士。
A liberal is a Commie with a college education thinking Negro thoughts.

716
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,138
这是真实的事情。
Well, here's a fact for you.

717
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:05,726
所有黑人中有76.4％来自莫斯科的控制。
76.4% of all Negroes are controlled from Moscow.

718
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,729
这就是为何卡斯楚能这样轻易过关。
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.

719
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,690
在我看来，我们应该用炸弹轰平古巴
In my view, we ought to bomb Cuba off the face of the Earth,

720
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,150
- 让他的人民活在和平中。 - 亚特。
- let its people live in peace. - Art.

721
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,485
嘿。来吧，让我们用餐去。
Hey. Come on, let's eat.

722
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,945
来吧。
Come on.

723
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,076
在阴暗处的家伙是谁呢？
Who's the guy in the shades?

724
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,538
西格拉的爸爸，是你在的等的人。
Segurra's Daddy. It's who you're waiting for.

725
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,250
谢谢你送我玫瑰。
Thank you for my roses.

726
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,128
没想到你有留意到。
I didn't think you noticed.

727
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,088
当然，我注意到了。
Of course I noticed.

728
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,844
保罗，你会介意加入我们的行列吗？
Paul, would you mind joining us?

729
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,185
先生，你好吗？
How do you do, sir?

730
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,478
- 坎普先生。 - 很高兴见到你。
- Mr. Kemp. - Nice to see you.

731
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,645
坎普先生。
Mr. Kemp.

732
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,483
好了。
Okay.

733
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,402
由我开始，这只是一个非正式的会议。
Let me just start by saying this is a purely informal meeting.

734
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,822
顺便说一下，你不用担心莱特曼，好吗？
And, incidentally, you don't worry about Letterman, okay?

735
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,074
莱特曼？
Letterman?

736
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,451
主要是纽约时报，关莱特曼什么屁事呢？
What the hell's Letterman got to do with The New York Times?

737
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,536
坎普先生为各种报纸兼职。
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.

738
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,038
偶尔，他会写写新闻。
Occasionally, he writes for the news.

739
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,248
他的业余时间是他的事。
What he does in his spare time is his affair.

740
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,666
这就是我喜欢他的原因。
That's how I like it.

741
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,126
我们希望你能为我们写一些东西。
We'd like you to do some writing for us.

742
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,544
因此，我搜集了。
So I gather.

743
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
关于什么？
About what?

744
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,131
在文章中，我们想要设置的东西
In a sentence, we want to set something up,

745
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,425
让公众成为我们的朋友。
and have the public as our friends.

746
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,761
我们有各种的方法，可以这样做。
And there are a variety of ways we can do that.

747
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,266
让我告诉你，这事该如何进行，保罗。
Let me tell you how this kind of thing works, Paul.

748
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,562
假设，例如，你想要把税提高5％。
Suppose, by way of example, you wanted to put up taxes by 5%.

749
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,022
聪明的做法
The smart way of doing it

750
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,983
是采浮动的10％加息法。
is to float the idea of a 10%o hike.

751
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,694
让大家都需要它，让自己小题大做
Let them all shout about it, get themselves in a fuss,

752
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,029
然后你提供优惠。
then you offer concessions.

753
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,073
“7％怎么样呢？” “不行”他们会说话。
"How about 7%?" "No way," they'll say.

754
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,578
好吧，留住友谊，就提高5％吧。
"All right, let's stay friends and make a compromise at five."

755
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,663
宾果。
Bingo.

756
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,333
他们认为他们赢了，那5％，你应摆在首位。
They think they won something, you get the 5% you wanted in the first place.

757
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,252
同样的道理也适用于房地产。
Same thing applies to real estate.

758
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,421
你想盖5栋房子
You want to build five houses,

759
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,798
你把规划申请为50栋。
you put in a planning application for 50.

760
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
你要盖多少？
How many do you want to build?

761
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,176
没有。
None.

762
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,220
我们要盖一个酒店。
We want to build one hotel.

763
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,805
好了，环顾这个地方
Well, looking around this place,

764
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,432
我想没人会注意到。
I don't think anyone would notice.

765
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,308
就在这里。
It isn't in this place.

766
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,601
在一个岛屿。
It's an island.

767
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,313
各种敏感的原因，我们不希望消息曝光。
Sensitive for a variety of reasons we don't want to get into now.

768
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,024
没有人希望天堂盖了酒店，但
Nobody wants a paradise choked with hotels, but

769
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,445
在一个妥协下大家都会很高兴。
everybody will be pleased to compromise at one.

770
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,613
这就需要靠聪明的写作
This is going to require some clever writing

771
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,323
去精心的布置所有的文章。
in various carefully placed articles.

772
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,326
那种事情是非法的吗？
Isn't that kind of thing illegal?

773
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,870
让我这样说，坎普先生，
If I may say, Mr. Kemp,

774
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,622
这是不恰当的评论。
that's an inappropriate comment.

775
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,833
岛屿在哪里呢？
Where's the island?

776
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,959
不能告诉你。
Can't tell you.

777
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,127
目前还不能。
Not yet.

778
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,796
自由裁量权是最重要的，坎普先生。
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.

779
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,048
如果你想加入我们，就必须签署一些文件。
If you want to join us, you'll have to sign some papers.

780
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,135
明天有一个会议，在哈尔的办公室。
We're having a meeting tomorrow in Hal's office.

781
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,386
如果你想了解那档事
If you want to be part of what will be

782
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,389
令人兴奋的计划，就来吧。
a very exciting project, come along.

783
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,225
有人开着滑稽的车在外面要找保罗。
There's a man outside in a funny little car for Paul.

784
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,310
哦，是的。
Oh, yeah.

785
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,728
先生们，请原谅我。
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

786
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,313
我要离开了。
I have to run.

787
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,570
不留下来吗？
Can't stay?

788
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,156
我听说美人鱼在月光下会出来。
I hear the mermaids come out in the moonlight.

789
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,624
我们见面的那一刻起，我就知道
From the moment we met, I knew

790
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,210
我们之间一定有搞头。
there was going to be something between us.

791
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,961
类似未婚夫那样。
It's called her fiancé.

792
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,465
天啊，我无可救药的坠入爱河。
God, I'm so hopelessly and progressively in love.

793
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,842
不要让爱情冲昏头
Do not confuse love with lust,

794
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,053
更不要酒后失身。
nor drunkenness with judgment.

795
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,263
你想听我的意见吗？
You want my advice?

796
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,973
不，如果涉及她的，不，我不要。
No. if it involves her, no, I don't.

797
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,433
远离她。
Stay away from her.

798
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,851
远离桑德森。
And stay away from Sanderson.

799
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,144
你在自找死路。
You're way out of depth.

800
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,939
我没对桑德森提供情报，让他去窃取岛屿。
I got no brief for Sanderson or his pissy rip-off island.

801
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,526
我只想要捻花惹草附带炒饭而已。
I just want some apple blossom lipstick and fucks.

802
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,528
你现在不承认。
You are in total denial.

803
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,820
她可是炒别人的饭。
She's fucking someone else.

804
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,407
据我所知，他们即将结婚。
And as I understand it, about to be married to him.

805
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,118
甚至不会邀请你。
You won't even make an invite.

806
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,497
真不敢相信。
I don't believe this.

807
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,624
我们言归正传。
We're right back where we started.

808
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,502
我们都见识过那些混蛋
That is the same Cabrones we passed

809
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,962
10分钟前。
ten minutes ago.

810
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,764
我们需要方针。
We need directions.

811
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,976
我们到那里吃点东西。
Let's get in there and get something to eat.

812
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,438
不
No.

813
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,648
不要，拜托。
Please, no.

814
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,777
我不会花一整天与罪犯在海滩上吃龙虾，
I haven't spent all day on a beach munching lobster with criminals,

815
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,070
我饿扁了。
and I'm starving.

816
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,862
两杯啤酒，两杯朗姆酒，一个牛排。
Two beers, two rums, one steak.

817
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,988
厨房已收了。
The kitchen is closed.

818
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,531
好吧，两杯啤酒和两杯朗姆酒。
All right then, two beers and two rums.

819
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,408
还有一份牛排。
And one steak.

820
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,909
已关了，先生 ...
Cerrado, Mister...

821
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,245
是呃，但我搞不懂那个。
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.

822
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,375
那标示上说，餐点供应到午夜，我要一份牛排。
You got a sign down there saying, "Food til midnight," and I want a steak.

823
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,715
汗流浃背的妇女。
Girl of the swamp.

824
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,718
这提醒了我，我们需要地图。
Which reminds me, we need a map.

825
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,345
你知道我怎么想吗？
You know what I think?

826
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,014
我想我们喝太多的朗姆酒。
I think we're drinking too much rum.

827
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,390
有没有其他办法。
There's no other way.

828
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:42,646
我看到双层的烟灰缸和炒盐锅。
I'm getting double ashtray and double salt pot.

829
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,190
你醉得跟默巴克一样了。
You got a Moburg bifocal.

830
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,567
天啊，真是令人发指。
Christ, this is heinous.

831
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,236
试想一下，他为何会变成一个酒鬼。
Imagine what it must be like to be an alcoholic.

832
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,572
2元。
$2.

833
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,200
付完钱后离开。
You pay and you go.

834
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,993
我没有看到牛排。
I don't see a steak.

835
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,912
没牛排了。
No steak.

836
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,246
你是什??么意思，没牛排？
What do you mean, no steak?

837
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,666
我认为他的意思是牛排没有了。
I think he means no steak.

838
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,377
厨房已关了。
The kitchen is closed.

839
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,878
我无法为你服务。
I got no way of serving you.

840
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,674
听着，你不想听我抱怨糟糕的一天，
Listen, you don't want to hear about my bad day,

841
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,218
我不希望你那么严肃。
and I don't want no grave side out of you.

842
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,096
如果你无法做牛排，把牛排拿来。 我会生吃牛排。
If you can't cook it, bring it like it is. I'll eat it raw.

843
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,307
两块钱，付钱离开。
Two dollars, you pay and go.

844
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,809
别叼扰我。
Don't bother me.

845
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,436
你现在付，或者我叫警察。
You pay now, or I call the cops.

846
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,648
如果你没打算卖我牛排
If you have no intention of serving me steak,

847
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,109
你最好是给我滚开。
why don't you do your best to fuck off.

848
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,128
在我看来，气氛不妙。
It seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.

849
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,464
有些异样的眼睛盯着我们看。
There are one or two oddities giving us the eye.

850
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,091
不要固执。
Don't get paranoid.

851
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,551
他在打电话。
He's on the phone.

852
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,719
干嘛？
For what?

853
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,053
向餐厅订购？
Ordering food in a restaurant?

854
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,305
但愿他能直通联邦调查局。
Let's hope he's through to the FBI.

855
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,520
怎么一回事？
What's the matter?

856
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,188
你在笑什么？
What are you smiling at?

857
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,399
我没笑啊。
I'm not smiling.

858
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,609
我假装镇定啊。
I'm maintaining a casual face.

859
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,115
一个人刚走进来
A man just walked in

860
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,744
从负面的角度看，最好有充足的理由。
and has good reason for regarding us in a negative light.

861
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,328
- 我们？ - 我。
- Us? - Me.

862
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,247
他不久前见过我。
And he's just seen me.

863
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,208
他想找白人报复。
And he wants revenge on the white man.

864
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,128
你他妈的在说什么？
The fuck are you talking about?

865
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,131
那个有疤痕的家伙？
How about the one with the dent?

866
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,218
独眼龙吗？
The one with the eye?

867
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,386
很像。
The very same.

868
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,514
我们用走的还是用跑的？
Do we walk or run?

869
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,516
用走的。
Walk.

870
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,642
我来推动汽车。
I'll push the car.

871
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,195
我们走吧，希望他能高兴。
Let's walk and hope he's happy.

872
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,669
嘿，美国人。
Hey, Yankee.

873
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,171
美国人！
Yankee!

874
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,360
别让我看到后车的大灯。
Don't let me see headlights.

875
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,530
拜托别让我看到后车的大灯。
Please don't let me see headlights.

876
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,866
我看到后车的大灯了。
I just seen headlights.

877
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,118
踩油门。
Put your foot down.

878
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,745
你觉得究竟在哪里呢？
Where exactly do you think I got it?

879
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:57,757
你能开快些吗？
Can you go faster?

880
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,092
开快，我尽量。
Going fast as I can.

881
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,030
耶稣基督，老兄啊。
Jesus Christ, man.

882
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,514
我们会被杀！ 我们会被杀！
We're gonna be killed! We're gonna be killed!

883
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,354
嘿！
Hey!

884
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,069
为落跑做好准备。
Get ready to run.

885
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,362
从反方向落跑。
Run in opposite directions.

886
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,447
那桶给我！
Give me the brew!

887
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,615
给我他妈的酒桶！
Give me the fucking brew!

888
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,385
保罗！
Paul!

889
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,578
狗屎运。我刚才看到默巴克。
Piece of luck. I just saw Moburg.

890
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,664
至少我认为他看到了我们。
At least I think he saw us.

891
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,543
他们要上夜间法庭。
They got some kind of night court going.

892
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,810
他说，我们是禽兽
He says we were animals

893
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,105
醉酒又横冲直撞，
on a rampage of drunken anarchy,

894
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,065
把汽油浇在警察身上。
poured gasoline on one of his cops.

895
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,781
哦，我的天，我们注定要蹲苦牢。
Oh, my God, we're doomed.

896
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,825
你有话要说吗？
You have something to say?

897
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,578
是的，法官大人，我要。
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

898
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,667
首先，和我被铐的这家伙，我一生从没见过他。
Firstly, this guy handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.

899
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,296
第二，我们要求有翻译的法庭。
And second, we'd like a translation of the charges.

900
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,798
你听到他们说什么吗？
You heard what they said?

901
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,468
恕我直言，我听到大家都讲西班牙话。
With respect, I heard people speaking Spanish.

902
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,431
你要什么语言，这个国家说的是什么语言，先生？
What kind of language do you think we speak in this country, Mister?

903
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,105
他跟我们不是一起的。
He's not with us.

904
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,941
警察要求他定罪。
The cops attached him to get a conviction.

905
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,653
你离开餐厅时有没有付钱？
Did you leave the Café Cabrones without paying?

906
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,700
你放火烧警务人员，有或没有？
Did you set fire to the police officer, yes or no?

907
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,827
不幸的是，法官大人，他凑巧给火喷到。
Unfortunately, Your Honor, he got in the way of our flame.

908
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,328
没错。
That's right.

909
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:18,374
不可能的，我们烧他的头上还能这样笑。
No way did we pour gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.

910
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,876
他说的可不是这样。
It wasn't like he said.

911
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,335
就像他说的吗？
Like he said?

912
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,379
如同你说的，你不会说西班牙语。
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.

913
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,506
坎普先生不会讲西班牙语。
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.

914
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,550
那么，他会有充足的学习机会。
Well, he will have plenty of opportunity to learn.

915
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,635
对你的指控是很严重的。
The charges against you are grave.

916
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,181
拒捕袭警是要监禁一年的。
Resisting arrest carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.

917
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,516
跟使用致命武器攻击没有关系。
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.

918
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,561
我打算把这个案件送到高等法院。
I'm going to refer this case to a higher court.

919
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,898
同时，我判决拘留30天等待候审。
Meanwhile, I remand you both in custody for 30 days.

920
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,903
如果可以的话，法官大人。
If I may, Your Honor.

921
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,915
来吧，桑德森先生。
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.

922
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
谢谢你，法官大人。
Thank you, Your Honor.

923
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,794
我无意要中断审判
It isn't my purpose to interrupt proceedings,

924
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,589
如果能将他们发回重审
but if the intention is to remand these gentlemen,

925
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,966
我谨要求暂时休会
I would respectfully ask for a brief recess

926
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,718
允许我向他们的律师联系。
to allow me to contact their counsel.

927
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,512
律师是谁呢？
Who is who?

928
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,763
阿尔弗雷多.昆。
Alfredo Quinones.

929
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,226
当然，有必要我会叫他起床的。
It would necessitate getting him out of bed, of course.

930
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,729
让你了解他们两位的重要性。
But given the importance of these gentlemen to

931
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,023
及各种利益关系。
various interests,

932
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,693
我确定，他会跟我一样很高兴来的。
I'm sure that he would be as pleased as I

933
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,072
在清晨3点来这里。
to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.

934
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,621
我们的保证金是多少呢？
How much did we cost him?

935
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,706
1,000美元。
About $1,000 apiece.

936
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,679
我不足以感谢你。
I can't thank you enough.

937
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,722
不要迟到。
Don't be late.

938
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,210
他妈的蛋！
Mother of balls!

939
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,630
总算有救援水车了。
We got to rescue the car.

940
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,841
不是现在。我们稍后再做。
Not now. We'll do it later.

941
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,134
我有一个会议要开。
I've got a meeting.

942
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,011
我没有时间了。
We do not have later.

943
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,555
他们12个小时前就开始了。
They've already had it 12 hours.

944
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,266
我知道那些混蛋是如何工作的。
I know how these bastards work.

945
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,020
他们可以在12分钟内拆下火车的轴心。
They can strip a train to axles in 12 minutes.

946
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,440
而且地上看不到油斑。
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.

947
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,279
这还要等多久呢？
How long is this gonna take?

948
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,530
我怎么会知道呢？
How would I know?

949
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,698
我不能迟到。
I can't be late.

950
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,533
不知道你为什么急着想去。
I don't know why you're going at all.

951
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,202
那家伙的公司是很糟糕的。
That guy is bad company.

952
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,037
他是操控者。
He's a manipulative prick.

953
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,372
他操控我们免以牢狱之灾，没他行吗？
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?

954
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,124
现在，我们被他妈的控制了。
Now he fucking owns us.

955
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,461
我舌头像...
I got a tongue like...

956
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,631
绑了毛巾。
Like a towel.

957
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,216
想要喝啤酒吗？
Want a beer?

958
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,718
我像是要喝啤酒吗？
Do I want a beer?

959
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,679
不，我不要。
No, I do not.

960
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,058
我再也不要沾酒了。
I am never gonna touch alcohol again.

961
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,614
这车真他妈的通风。
What fresh hell is this?

962
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,449
前座不见了。
Front seat's gone.

963
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,701
该报销了，不是吗？
That's a write-off. isn't it?

964
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,388
你知道吧，我有一个绝妙的主意。
You know what, I've got a brilliant idea.

965
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,079
是什么？
What's that?

966
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,290
车轴的重量很重。
There's too much weight on the axle.

967
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,417
试着向前移动一下。
Try and move forward a bit.

968
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,960
要迟到了。
Gonna be late.

969
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,045
我要去一个星期。
I'm gonna be a week late.

970
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,050
你在做什么，萨拉？
What are you doing, Sala?

971
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,095
我突然意识到我是多么喜欢你。
I suddenly realize how much I like you.

972
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,680
什??么意思，你说我能干嘛？
What do you mean, what am I doing?

973
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,391
是车轴有些不对劲。
There's something wrong with the axle.

974
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,857
哦，我的天啊，被我们放火烧的警察。
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.

975
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,030
装做很正常。
Try and look normal.

976
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,789
靠右边！靠右边！
Make a right! Make a right!

977
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,541
- 怎么靠右边？ 无法靠右边。 - 靠任何一边！
- What right? There is no right. - Any right!

978
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,111
他来了。  保罗进来。
There he is. Paul, come in.

979
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,530
对不起，出点意外。
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.

980
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,616
我得回家，开始新的一天。
I had to go home and start the day again.

981
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,994
告诉我这件事。 有些日子是渡日如年。
Tell me about it. Some days are two sizes too small.

982
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,871
好吧，我怕有人要离开了。
Well, I'm afraid some of us had to leave.

983
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,873
但是，朱巴格先生你知道的。
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.

984
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,542
这是格林先生，国际第一海事银行。
And this is Mr. Green of First National Maritime Bank.

985
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:54,627
你要咖啡吗？
You want some coffee?

986
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,670
我认为我们该讲重点，哈尔。
I think we should move right along, Hal.

987
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,047
- 我得走了。 - 当然。
- I gotta go. - Sure.

988
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,632
坐下，保罗。
Sit down, Paul.

989
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,176
如你所知，坎普先生，
As you may know, Mr. Kemp,

990
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,221
岛上是由美国政府拥有的。
the island is owned by the U.S. government.

991
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,807
有部分范围现在归海军使用。
Part of it presently used as a target range by the Navy.

992
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,184
我们知道，据内部人士透露...
We know from internal sources...

993
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,435
这就是你打电话的目的？
Is that what you're calling me?

994
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:16,399
...政府正准备放弃租赁
...That the government is preparing to relinquish the lease,

995
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,359
这个地方有32平方英里将被释出
and this place wakes up as 32 square miles

996
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,028
宏伟又原始之地。
of magnificent and untouched real estate.

997
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,531
放眼看看。
Knock your eyes out.

998
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,783
在加勒比海没有比这更漂亮的海滩。
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.

999
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,703
海滨环绕着一个美丽的小艇码头。
Orientated around one hell of a beautiful marina.

1000
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:32,998
假设这是一间酒店的码头。
Thought it was one hotel.

1001
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,583
我们先从酒店开始。
We start with one hotel.

1002
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,876
就在你的脚下。
It's a foot in the door.

1003
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,337
一旦我们开始运作，我们市场的公仆。
Once we're up and running, we're servants of a market.

1004
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,840
- 像这里吗？ - 像这里。
- Like here? - Like here.

1005
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,259
你看起来很担心，坎普先生。
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.

1006
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,220
他不会担心。
He's not worried.

1007
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,596
保罗和我共享一个微妙的夜晚。
Paul and I shared a tricky little night.

1008
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,266
对吧，保罗？
Right, Paul?

1009
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,892
虽然我们没什么睡。
Neither of us got much sleep.

1010
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,979
我得走了，伙计们。
I gotta go, guys.

1011
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,022
那么，我们也要离开了，先生们。
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.

1012
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,649
坎普先生签署文件了吗？
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?

1013
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,526
现在签。
Doing that right now.

1014
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,529
我一定要签吗？
What am I actually signing?

1015
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,031
为了保密协定，互相信任。
Just a confidentiality agreement, affirmation of trust.

1016
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,951
所以我们都坐在相同的按摩浴缸。
Just so we're all sitting in the same Jacuzzi.

1017
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,163
如果一个粪浮出来，这样你明白吧。
In case a turd floats up, if you know what I mean.

1018
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,002
来吧，保罗，我们来这里。
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.

1019
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,966
给你。
Here you go.

1020
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,219
只是技术性的问题，保罗。
It's just a technicality, Paul.

1021
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,931
意味着你不能向任何人泄露该计划。
Means you promise not to talk to anybody about the project.

1022
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,475
头好一点了吗？
How's the head?

1023
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,934
很不舒服。
Unpleasant.

1024
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,395
再次感谢你帮我保释。
Gotta thank you again for putting up the bail.

1025
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,856
我能体会。
It's held on my cognizance.

1026
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,359
但我认为这会让你丧失心智。
And I think it more than likely to slip various minds.

1027
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,613
这个地方是钱海，保罗。
This place is a sea of money, Paul.

1028
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,615
钱多的令人难以置信。
Unbelievable money.

1029
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,410
几乎每一家大公司都把钱藏在海岸上。
Practically every major corporation hides its cash offshore.

1030
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,828
不，谢谢。
No, thanks.

1031
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,414
对我们来说是好消息
And that is good news for us,

1032
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,250
因为我们就是海岸。
because we are the shore.

1033
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,171
任何钱都不用进到波多黎各政府
Not one dollar that wings its way into Puerto Rico

1034
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,756
去缴税款。
pays a cent in tax.

1035
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,758
- 免税？ - 一毛钱也不用。
- Nothing? - Not penny one.

1036
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,051
这包括化学公司
That includes chemical companies,

1037
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,677
石油公司，矿业公司。
oil companies, mining companies.

1038
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,763
价值120亿美元的铜矿
There's $12 billion worth of copper

1039
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,265
从这里不到20英里的山区里。
in mountains less than 20 miles from here.

1040
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,726
几十亿美元。
A dozen billion dollars.

1041
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,439
像我这样的人
And there's people like me

1042
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,816
才知道如何把它弄出来。
who know how to get it out.

1043
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,613
所以，把合约签好。
So, putting it into context,

1044
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,450
我可不想为了1,000元保释金，被打断骨头。
I don't envisage the breaking of bones to get at a thousand bucks.

1045
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,828
因为你不在那里
Because you weren't here,

1046
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,331
我同意你一个行程，以朱巴格的名义。
I agreed to an itinerary with Zimburger on your behalf.

1047
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,960
你要在早上出发，希望没问题。
You'll be traveling down in the morning. Hope that's okay.

1048
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,758
你需要什么，保罗？
What do you need, Paul?

1049
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,303
只是在上下文里朱巴格的东西
Well, just in the context of this Zimburger thing,

1050
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,473
你认为有提前的可能性吗？
do you think there's a possibility of an advance?

1051
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,726
我不想问，但莱特曼非常不稳定
I don't like to ask, but Letterman's pretty erratic

1052
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,311
有关薪水的事，你知道的。
with the paycheck, you know.

1053
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,437
我需要一辆汽车。
Need to get a hold of a car.

1054
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,855
你没有车吗？
You don't have a car?

1055
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,691
不太可靠。
Nothing too reliable.

1056
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,151
此外，我必须找一个像样的地方住。
Plus, sooner or later, I'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.

1057
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,611
好吧，这我们可以帮你。
Well, we can help you with that.

1058
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:11,031
你回来后，我们将整理出你的观点。
When you get back, we'll sort you out something with a view.

1059
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,619
卡罗，有什么在车库里呢？
Carol, what do we have in the garage?

1060
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:18,831
不... 不是那个。
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.

1061
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,375
是呃，这很好呀。  好吧，谢谢。
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you.

1062
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,337
你有一辆车了。 她会给你车钥匙开车上路。
Got you a car. She'll give you the keys on the way out.

1063
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,050
应该是500吧？
Feels like 500?

1064
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,679
是啊。谢谢。
Yeah. Thanks.

1065
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,473
保罗 ...
Paul...

1066
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,601
你下午干嘛呢？
How's your afternoon?

1067
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,269
写半版的星座。
A half-written horoscope.

1068
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,105
帮个忙，你愿意吗？ 开车去海滩接香奈儿。
Do me a favor, will you? Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.

1069
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,648
我要她6:00在家里的楼下等。
I need her downstairs by 6:00.

1070
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,066
好的。
All right.

1071
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,861
那么，是这一件呢？
So, this one?

1072
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,572
或者是...
Or...

1073
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,742
这一件呢？
This one?

1074
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,827
这些是干什么用，一个派对？
What are these for, a party?

1075
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,579
狂欢派对。
It's for carnival.

1076
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,915
他没告诉你吗？
Didn't he say anything to you about it?

1077
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,876
- 没有 - 你要来哦。
- No. - You've got to come.

1078
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,462
我们都要上船去。
We're all going down on the boat.

1079
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,090
他没有邀请我。
He didn't invite me.

1080
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,217
嗯，这是不是他的狂欢节。
Well, it isn't his carnival.

1081
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,427
这一件呢。
This one.

1082
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,682
我喜欢另外一件。
I like the other one.

1083
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:05,896
是的。
Yes.

1084
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,786
喜欢这车吗？
Love this car.

1085
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,123
他给你的吗？
Did he give it to you?

1086
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:25,791
但愿是。
I wish.

1087
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,085
加速快。
Fast.

1088
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,839
你想小赌一下吗？
You want a little bet?

1089
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,633
赌什么呢？
A bet about what?

1090
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,219
看谁先尖叫。
That you scream before I do.

1091
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,682
如果我先尖叫，会得到什么呢？
That I scream before you do, in relation to what?

1092
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,768
那么，加速看看有多快？
Well, how fast does it go?

1093
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,312
我不知道。
I don't know.

1094
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,483
这才叫赌啊。
That's the bet.

1095
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,450
我今天已经毁了一辆车。
I already crashed one car today.

1096
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,498
没关系，我会坐在大厅等他的。
It's okay. I'll just go sit in the foyer and wait for him.

1097
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,430
我如果我赢了呢？
What do I get if I win?

1098
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,600
你做了，我就会让你知道。
I'll let you know if you do.

1099
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,752
来吧，我带你回去。
Come on, I'll take you back.

1100
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,474
天啊，他们从哪里拿到这个？

- You're gonna go? - Yes, we're gonna leave.

1237
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,820
你好了吗？
You're done?

1238
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,280
跳不动了。真的。
I can't dance no more. Really.

1239
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,199
等等。你知道吗？ 我叫香奈儿。
Hold on. You know what? I'll be out. Let me just get Chenault.

1240
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,039
朗姆酒或啤酒呢？
You want rum or beer?

1241
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,291
都要。
Both.

1242
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:59,711
两杯朗姆酒，两杯啤酒。
Dos rum, dos cervezas.

1243
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:00,962
- 哇，哇。 - 我们要走了。
- Whoa, whoa. - We're gonna go.

1244
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,630
- 嘿。 - 我们要走了。
- Hey. - We're gonna go.

1245
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,799
- 什么？ - 娜特莉离开了。
- What? - Natalie's leaving,

1246
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:06,176
- 我们走了。 - 嘿，嘿。
- so let's go. - Hey, hey.

1247
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,178
- 来吧，来吧。 - 不...。
- Come on, come on. - No, no, no, no.

1248
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,724
香奈儿，到这里来。  离开了。
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.

1249
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:16,436
- 香奈儿。 - 停止吧！
- Chenault. - Stop it!

1250
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,062
香奈儿！
Chenault!

1251
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,665
香奈儿，来这里！ 香奈儿！
Chenault, come here! Chenault!

1252
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,002
把手拿开，操你娘！
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!

1253
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,801
他妈的，你敢动我！
You want to fuck with me?

1254
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,721
知道我是谁吗？
You know who I am?

1255
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,222
操你娘！
You motherfucker!

1256
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,182
知道我是谁吗？
You know who I am?

1257
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,479
- 你死定了！ - 走啊！走啊！
- You're a dead man! - Go! Go!

1258
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:24,856
把手拿开。
Get your hands off me.

1259
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,357
- 你死定了！ - 走啊！
- You're a dead man! - Go!

1260
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,067
算了。
Forget it.

1261
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,696
- 我帮你叫出租车。 - 滚开！
- We'll call you a cab. - Fuck off!

1262
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,785
我必须去找她。
I gotta get the girl.

1263
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:40,371
她玩得正爽。我们关门了。
She's having a good time. We closed.

1264
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,626
你聋了吗？
You deaf?

1265
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,377
我说，我们关门了。
I said we closed.

1266
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,962
不行的，保罗。
No way, Paul.

1267
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,672
不行的。
No way.

1268
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,664
我到处找过了。
I looked everywhere.

1269
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,249
我去找宪兵。
I went to the gendarme.

1270
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,168
然后呢？
And?

1271
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:29,837
我们去的地方。
We went up there.

1272
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,756
没有人，那里没半个人。
Nothing. Nobody there.

1273
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,968
只有，扫地的老妇人。
But an old woman with a mop.

1274
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,765
找警察帮忙应该比较有效。
She was more help than the cops were.

1275
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,352
我能做些什么，如果你的女友爱上别人呢？他说。
"What can I do if your girlfriend likes someone else?" he said.

1276
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,271
他是对的，保罗。
He's right about that, Paul.

1277
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,900
她不是你的女朋友。
She's not your girlfriend.

1278
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,956
也许，她已回到船上了。
Maybe she went back to the boat.

1279
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,295
你有去船上找吗？
Did you try the boat?

1280
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,964
没有。
No.

1281
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,718
我不认为他会让她回去。
I don't think he'd let her back on.

1282
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:37,113
她是否跟你在一起？
Is she with you?

1283
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,992
你何不把心思放在该死的公司呢？
Why don't you mind your own goddamn business?

1284
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,495
我要钥匙。
I want the keys.

1285
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,789
雪佛兰。
The Chevy.

1286
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,018
你搞砸了，坎普。
You blew it, Kemp.

1287
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,544
全生锈了。
It's all rust.

1288
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,593
我有看到较好的轮胎悬在拖船的侧面。
I've seen better tires hanging over the side of a tug.

1289
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,929
你要还是不要？
You want it or not?

1290
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,725
是的，我们需要它。
Yeah, we want it.

1291
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:52,104
每个人都改成周五在领钱，对不对？
Everyone turns up for their Friday check, right?

1292
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,398
没得领钱，莱特曼不在。
No check, no Letterman.

1293
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,736
所以，我去找他那又蠢又丑陋的老婆。
So I go around to see that unforgivably ugly wife of his.

1294
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,113
她告诉我，他去了迈阿密。
She tells me he's gone to Miami.

1295
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,448
为了什么？
For what?

1296
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:04,659
你不知道，我不知道。
You don't know, I don't know.

1297
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,286
但那些罢工者又回来了。
But the scabs are back.

1298
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,916
由于玛丽欧走了，报纸又发生滞销。
Since Merell went, the paper took a turn for the worse.

1299
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,837
有任何钓鱼用诱饵吗？
Is there anything in the spinner?

1300
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,588
我们需要一个新袋子。
We need a fresh sack.

1301
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,384
好吧，也许我能让那些人引起兴趣。
Well, maybe I can interest you gentlemen in something else.

1302
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,261
类似什么，死亡吗？
Like what, death?

1303
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,014
史上最毒的药物。
Like the most powerful drug in the history of narcotics.

1304
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,811
我不是随便说说和臭屁。
I'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.

1305
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:35,022
我可以告诉你这东西毒性非常强大的。
All I can tell you is this stuff is so powerful,

1306
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,191
让他们成为共产党员。
they give it to Communists.

1307
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:38,860
谁呢？
Who does?

1308
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,528
联邦调查局。
The FBI.

1309
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,531
为什么联邦调查局会搞上共产党高层？
Why would the FBI get Communists high?

1310
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,450
我无法告诉你。
That I can't help you with.

1311
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,204
你把它像眼药水。
You take it like eye drops.

1312
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,041
在眼？
In the eye?

1313
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:55,751
所以，我明白了。
So I understand.

1314
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,546
它让眼睛看得到。
It makes the eye see things.

1315
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,256
你会看到一个不同的现实。
You see a different reality.

1316
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,508
你想要干什么？
What do you want for it?

1317
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:05,803
我会骑自行车把它扔进去，如果你能个忙。
I'll throw it in with the bike if you do me a favor.

1318
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,805
有什么偏爱呢？
What's the favor?

1319
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,518
我要你跟我来浴室。
I want you to come to the bathroom with me.

1320
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,938
这男人是你的。
He's your man.

1321
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,982
- 50元，对不对？ - 是啊。
- $50, right? - Yeah.

1322
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,291
他要我看他的家伙。
He wants me to look at his dick.

1323
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,001
我断然拒绝。
I flatly refused.

1324
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,003
他要你看什么？
What does he want you to look at it for?

1325
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,421
就说，一定有鬼。
Says there's something wrong with it.

1326
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,672
这是君子做的事。
It's a gentleman's matter.

1327
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:42,924
我不会看那档事！
I'm not looking at it!

1328
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,300
好吧，把毒品还我。
All right, give me the drugs back.

1329
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,676
不！等等。
No! Wait.

1330
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,929
我来看看。
I'll look at it.

1331
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,019
我会在镜子看。
I'll view it in the mirror.

1332
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,665
有拍手吗？
Is it clap?

1333
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,710
全场起立鼓掌。
A standing ovation.

1334
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,991
你看到了什么吗？
You see anything?

1335
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,492
没有。
No.

1336
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,830
我也一样。
Neither do I.

1337
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:17,018
我们再等五分钟看看。
We'll give it another five minutes.

1338
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:19,895
还在裹足不前吗？
Trouble making ends meet?

1339
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,273
- 然后，你需要的贷款吗？ - 对。
- Then, you need the Lending Man. - Right.

1340
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,323
请打贷款人专线。
Call the Lending Man now.

1341
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,346
从开始到现在多久了？
How long since we took it?

1342
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,477
我不知道。
I don't know.

1343
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:02,938
一段时间了。
A while.

1344
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:12,656
开玩笑，不是吗？
Bullshit, isn't it?

1345
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,826
是开玩笑吗？
Is it bullshit?

1346
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:43,664
耶稣啊。
Jesus.

1347
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,668
你的舌头就像是鸡、鸭的内脏。
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.

1348
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,302
为了耶稣基督，不要伸出来。
For Christ's sake, keep it out.

1349
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:57,553
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1350
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,180
你的舌头是撒旦的！
Your tongue belongs to Satan!

1351
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,472
你灵魂出窍了吗？
Are you out of your mind?

1352
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,141
不要伸出来！
Keep it out!

1353
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,352
如果伸回到你的嘴里，就会身亡。
If it goes back into your mouth, it'll kill you.

1354
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,564
我们开始在下沉了！
We've got to get it into the sink!

1355
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,193
你让我忧心。
You're giving me fear.

1356
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,694
别闹了！我很害怕！
Stop it! I've got fear!

1357
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,321
你他妈的。我也是。
Fuck you. So do I.

1358
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:16,614
你很high，你这个傻瓜。
You're high, you fool.

1359
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:17,990
喝些朗姆酒。
Drink some rum.

1360
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,348
我以为我在那里失控。
I thought I was losing grip in there.

1361
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:45,726
我们该怎么因应？
What did we take?

1362
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,311
我不知道。
I don't know.

1363
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,690
我们需要拿到更多。
We need to get some more.

1364
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,120
这不就说明了。
That explains it.

1365
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,333
不是吗？
Doesn't it?

1366
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,293
说明什么？
Explains what?

1367
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,381
全世界。
The world.

1368
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,176
和我们。
And us.

1369
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:29,478
我惊讶的是，我们可能在不同的世界。
I wonder what it is you might think about our different worlds.

1370
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:34,483
他看着我像似侧着身体说
He looked at me kind of sideways and said,

1371
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:38,529
人类是地球上唯一的生物
"Human beings are the only creatures on Earth

1372
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,115
声称是上帝。
"that claim a God.

1373
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,287
唯一有生命的东西，其行为举止好像没有了。
"And the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.

1374
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,000
世界上没人拥有，除了你之外。
"Does the world belong to no one but you?"

1375
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,046
而当他说话时，我大吃一惊。
And when he said it, I was taken aback.

1376
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,843
不因为是谁在说话，
Not because of who was doing the talking,

1377
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,804
因为我终于明白如何连接
because I finally understood the connection

1378
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,390
孩子之间的觅食。
between children scavenging for food

1379
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,686
及银行大门光亮的黄铜板。
and shiny brass plates on the front doors of banks.

1380
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,939
得走了。
Gotta go.

1381
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:45,679
进来。
Come in.

1382
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,602
我们得走了。
We gotta go.

1383
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,979
等我一分钟。
Give me a minute.

1384
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,777
我在楼下等你。
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

1385
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,208
你来了真好。
How nice of you to drop in.

1386
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,709
我被狂欢节淹没了。
I was covering the carnival.

1387
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,127
这不是我所听到的。
That's not what I heard.

1388
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,380
我听说你是在桑德森那里兼职。
I heard you were in the moonlight for Sanderson.

1389
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:20,506
我曾经是？
I was what?

1390
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,965
为桑德森兼职。
Moonlighting for Sanderson.

1391
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,050
西格拉在哪里？
Where's Segurra?

1392
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,468
西格拉先生不再与我们共事了。
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.

1393
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,552
我讲个故事给你听。
I got a story for you.

1394
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,389
是的，你可能注意到我有点忙。
Yeah, you may have noticed that I'm somewhat busy.

1395
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,309
这真的很重要，涉及西格拉先生和哈尔.桑德森先生。
This is real important, involving Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

1396
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:33,894
我将告诉你有多么的重要。
I'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.

1397
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,814
我在这行业干过21种工作和失败的报纸。
I got 21 jobs on the line and a newspaper going under.

1398
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,399
印出这些，然后销售。
Print this, and you'll sell it.

1399
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,900
一个策划的骗局。
A planning scam.

1400
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,027
从字面上看天堂的掠夺。
Literally despoliation of a paradise.

1401
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:44,363
千余人像垃圾一般被扫进大海。
A thousand people will be swept into the sea like garbage.

1402
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:45,906
你很诡异，坎普。
You are weird, Kemp.

1403
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,200
这不是他们要给什么，而是你要给他们什么。
It's not what it's doing to them, it's what it's doing to you.

1404
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,743
这就是所谓的新闻学。
It's called journalism.

1405
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:51,203
逗我笑。
Make me laugh.

1406
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,080
我在求你戒掉豪饮。
I asked you to tidy up the booze,

1407
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,790
你甚至无法清出一个房间。
you couldn't even sweep out a room.

1408
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,125
你认为你还在这里工作吗？
Why do you think you're working here?

1409
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,336
因为你的所作所为违反了记者的本份。
'Cause you're everything that's wrong with a journalist.

1410
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,839
这一切的错对一家报社是耻辱。
And you're everything that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.

1411
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,674
一致同意。
Unanimously agreed.

1412
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,843
你为什么不闭嘴，默巴克？
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?

1413
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:08,679
你是浪费人类的精虫。
You are a waste of human sperm.

1414
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:14,810
拖延死亡和死神不断地挣扎！
Die a prolonged and relentlessly agonizing death!

1415
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,368
享用她。
Enjoy her.

1416
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,604
泡了些茶。
Made you some tea.

1417
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,571
你应该试着睡觉。
You should try and sleep.

1418
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,698
我偷了你的床。
I stole your bed.

1419
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,159
没关系。
It's okay.

1420
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,328
我要写作。
I'm going to write.

1421
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,959
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1422
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,087
不要难过。
Don't be sorry.

1423
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,093
你给了我从没有过的恩惠。
You did me the best favor I ever had.

1424
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,267
这不是梦，香奈儿。
There is no dream, Chenault.

1425
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,522
只是相怜相惜。
Just a piss puddle of greed,

1426
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,067
在世界各地传播。
spreading throughout the world.

1427
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:53,325
我要对读者作出承诺。
I want to make a promise to you, the reader.

1428
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:56,828
我不知道，如果我明天能完成
And I don't know if I can fulfill it tomorrow

1429
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,997
或者是还要多几天。
or even the day after that.

1430
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:02,668
但是，我要把这个混蛋公之于世。
But I put the bastards of this world on notice.

1431
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,089
我本身并没有获得任何利益。
That I do not have their best interests at heart.

1432
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,301
我会详实的告诉我的读者。
I will try and speak for my reader.

1433
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:13,971
这是我的诺言。
That is my promise.

1434
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:19,101
这是油墨制成的愤怒之声。
And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.

1435
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:24,064
坐下。我煮了咖啡。
Sit down. I made you coffee.

1436
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,482
谢谢。
Thanks.

1437
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,445
一份你的，一份我的。
One for you and one for me.

1438
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,994
哦，伙计，我宁愿此事不是那样开始的。
Oh, man, I would rather not start the day with this.

1439
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,538
- 这是什么？ - 是传票。
- What is it? - Lt's a writ.

1440
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,123
这表示我们要上法庭。
Means we're going to court.

1441
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,625
他们可以逮捕我们，正是他们希望的。
It means they can arrest us, should they so desire,

1442
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,586
该死的时候，他们称心如意了。
any damn minute they please.

1443
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,254
我们需要律师代言。
We need to speak to a lawyer.

1444
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,131
我们连电话都没有。
We don't even have a phone.

1445
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,841
我知道一个老家伙，西班牙的律师。
I know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.

1446
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,426
欠我一份情。
Kind of owes me one.

1447
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,969
你穿好衣服，我们现在就去。
You should get dressed. We'll go down there.

1448
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,513
头发都是水，我满头都是肥皂。
Water ran out. I'm covered in soap.

1449
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,515
他妈的，看我能做些什么。
Fuck it. See what I can do.

1450
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,102
能做什么？
What's it for?

1451
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,230
是哈尔。
It's Hal.

1452
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,319
这件事是他指使的，现在他要打击我们。
He put up a bond for us on this thing, and now he's pulled it.

1453
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:11,528
在这里。
Here.

1454
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,536
你知道他是个骗子，保罗。
You know he's a crook, Paul.

1455
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,331
而我们收到的传票。
And we get the writs.

1456
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,470
那是什么？
What is it?

1457
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:03,223
是希特勒的演说。
It's Hitler.

1458
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:13,859
完蛋了。
It's over.

1459
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:15,152
是什么？
What is?

1460
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,238
他们想要我们死。
They shut us down.

1461
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,616
他站在那里，公然向我们撒谎。
He just stood there and lied to us.

1462
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,411
他是一个没道德观腐朽的收银机。
He hasn't got the morality of a clapped out cash register.

1463
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:28,081
我不想告诉你这事，老兄，为了遣散费。
I hate to tell you this, guys, but it was to avoid severance.

1464
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,916
我们都知道结果如何，查理。
We all know what it was for, Charlie.

1465
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,752
- 那我们该怎么办？ - 一无所获。
- What are we gonna do? - Nothing.

1466
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,796
我们无能为力，除非把他告到劳动局。
There's nothing we can do, except report him to the labor board,

1467
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:36,548
这样做无济于事。
which is the same thing as doing nothing.

1468
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,008
我不同意。
I disagree.

1469
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,885
我们必须反击。
We gotta strike back

1470
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,679
用指甲把这个混蛋抠出他的大门。
and nail this bastard to his own front door.

1471
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:44,431
除了祈祷，我们该怎么办呢？
And how, pray, do we do that?

1472
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,391
利用报纸。
By printing the paper.

1473
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:48,977
我们拥有莱特曼极多的资源。
We got tons of stuff on Letterman.

1474
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:52,022
与其人之道还治其人之身。
Every happy maggot with his hand in the till.

1475
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,610
这是最终的难题，但我们得放手一搏。
It may be the last-ever issue, but we go out in a blaze of rage.

1476
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:59,821
你在说什么？ 光成本就要2,200美元。
What are you talking about? It costs $2,200 a shot.

1477
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,072
我们把罢工者带来。
We bring in the scabs.

1478
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,282
让他们监督钱的事。
They're picketing for money.

1479
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:03,909
你照照镜子。
You're through the looking glass.

1480
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,536
我们连酒钱都不够。
We haven't even got enough money for drinks.

1481
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,041
这不值得去斗争，课税已是长久以来的问题。
It's not worth the fight. This has been coming down the pike for a long time.

1482
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,626
你应知道该结束时，就会结束。
You got to know it's over when it's over.

1483
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:16,505
加勒比这小地方是搞不出什么名堂的。
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing but a wrapping for fish heads.

1484
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:17,631
外加，它是封闭的。
Plus, it's a lockout.

1485
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,216
封闭个屁。
Fuck the locks.

1486
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:21,968
我说我们不得不行动。
I say we just walk in.

1487
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,056
有人同意吗？
Anybody with me?

1488
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,310
鲍勃？
Bob?

1489
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,563
你知道我会的。
You know I'm with you.

1490
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,237
我们还没缴电费。
We didn't pay the bill.

1491
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:45,909
香奈儿在哪里？
Where's Chenault?

1492
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,216
她去纽约了。
She's gone to New York.

1493
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,261
她留给我100元。
She left me $100.

1494
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,763
我敢不相信。
I don't believe it.

1495
01:43:07,557 --> 01:43:09,307
她身无分文。
She didn't have any money.

1496
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:11,309
你应该跟她一起走。
You should use it to go with her.

1497
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,103
红眼捐50块钱。
Red-eye for 50 bucks.

1498
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,271
不
No.

1499
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,107
我不会去任何地方。
I'm not going anywhere.

1500
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,653
透过某些手段或方法，我要刊登在报纸上。
By some means or another, I'm gonna put the paper out.

1501
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,697
报导这混蛋，然后我们走人。
Print the bastard, then we're gone.

1502
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,699
面对现实，保罗。
Face the reality, Paul.

1503
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,993
没有工作，没有钱，没有女人
There's no job, no money, no girl,

1504
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:29,870
只有我们的逮捕令。
and a warrant out for our arrest.

1505
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:31,162
什么都没得比。
There's no contest.

1506
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:33,039
多诺万是对的，这是不值得斗争的。
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.

1507
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,374
我不是多诺万！
I'm not Donovan!

1508
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:36,793
其他人也是一样。
And I'm not like the others.
