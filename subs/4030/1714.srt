1
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,635
Last week, Flash Gordon

2
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,970
defended the Witch Queen Azura

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,346
from the attack of the Death dwarfs.

4
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,224
Paul, having proclaimed himself King of Blue Magic Land

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,602
offered John the Hawkman the command of the army...

6
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,707
Go on, then, Paul.

7
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,125
Don't be long.

8
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,482
Paul?

9
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,862
Paul?

10
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,328
Paul.

11
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,432
He winked at me! He winked at me!

12
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,841
I love it here.

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,010
You know, it feels so...

14
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,761
- Right.       - Yeah.

15
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,723
We're 5,339 miles from home

16
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,267
and yet, somehow, I feel like we belong.

17
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,269
I know what you mean.

18
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,023
I think this is probably the most fun I have ever had.

19
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,442
I'm so glad we came, Clive.

20
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,319
Clive?

21
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,072
- May I?         - Be my guest.

22
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,325
- Thank you.       - I was over there, on my own.

23
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,285
That there is the Black Vampire.

24
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,745
Watch out.

25
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,996
She bites.

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
How much?

27
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,875
$1,349.99.

28
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,879
Aren't you gonna get it?

29
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,089
Fair enough.

30
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,135
I can't believe we're gonna meet Adam Shadowchild.

31
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,763
I know. He's, like, the coolest man in the world.

32
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,806
Thank you.

33
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,518
Come forth. Welcome, my friends.

34
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,189
I just wanted to say that the Planet Fall trilogy has been a huge influence

35
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,358
on me and on my work.

36
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,943
Don't tell me. You're a writer.

37
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,655
- I am, yeah.       - Well, good.

38
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,449
He actually won a Nebulon Award in 1992.

39
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,577
For best science fiction short story by a male under 16.

40
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,663
I'm working on a follow-up.

41
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,830
Oh, I'd love to see that.

42
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,123
Not today.

43
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,000
No, no. It's a legal thing.

44
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,378
I'm sure it's good.

45
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,297
That is a wonderful cover. Three tits.

46
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,342
Awesome.

47
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,928
- That was Graeme, my illustrator.       - I'm an artist.

48
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,055
I'm hoping to complete it soon.

49
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,266
I'm just having a bit of trouble with the ending.

50
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,020
Well, a wise man said,

51
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,065
"You have to spin a good yarn before you can weave a great dream. "

52
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,983
Who said that?

53
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,402
I did. I just said that.

54
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,861
Move along, please, guys.

55
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:21,946
Yes.

56
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,823
- Very nice to meet you.       - No, no...

57
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,157
Thank you.

58
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,286
- You bought a book?       - No.

59
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,871
Then fuck off.

60
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,499
Let's get a picture of you, me and Adam.

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,167
- Okay, ready.       - Ready.

62
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,592
Yes.

63
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,928
Yes.

64
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,013
- Is that the RV place?       - Yes.

65
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,307
And there's definitely two single beds?

66
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,644
Because there's been a bit of a mix-up at the hotel.

67
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,730
Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much.

68
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,733
And have a nice day to you, as well.

69
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,111
- Is it here?       - It's in the car park.

70
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,529
I think you mean "the parking lot."

71
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,947
I sure do.

72
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,324
I did my American voice.

73
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,662
It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here. America.

74
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
Huh?

75
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,958
How long have we dreamt about this?

76
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,877
- Since we were kids.        - Yeah.

77
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,588
Now look at us. Grown men.

78
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,215
Pizza!

79
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,345
- Good evening, sir.       - Come on in.

80
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,184
- Where can I set this down?       - You could put it on the bed.

81
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,935
You guys on honeymoon?

82
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,396
No.

83
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,316
No, silly. We're just friends.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,818
We had a mix-up. The reservations were messed up.

85
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,904
Pop it on the table here. Let me clear that.

86
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,282
- Ah, going on a road trip?       - Yeah. Yes.

87
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,951
What better way to follow Comic-Con

88
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,205
than a tour of America's most famous UFO hotspots?

89
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,539
Huh?

90
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,711
We're going to Area 51 and the Black Mailbox in Nevada,

91
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,881
then down to Camp Verde, then to Apache Junction

92
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,177
and then on down to Roswell, New Mexico for the site of the famous crash of '47.

93
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,595
- No.       - Everybody knows that.

94
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,181
Stop it! It's an alleged site at this point.

95
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,432
Why would they admit there was a crash,

96
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,683
if the crash happened somewhere else?

97
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,311
Let's just agree to disagree, all right?

98
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,562
That's what we always say at the end.

99
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,067
Do you believe in aliens?

100
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,486
What do you mean, "aliens"?

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,826
I'll sign that check, shall I?

102
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,329
Get that out of your way. Pizza grease on a map is the worst thing.

103
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,501
We should turn in. We got an early start in the morning.

104
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,836
Yeah.

105
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,212
What do you think you're gonna dream about?

106
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,174
Oh, the open road. High adventure. That kind of thing.

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,469
- You?       - Wonder Woman.

108
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,346
- Please don't.       - Okay.

109
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,099
- You ready?       - Yeah.

110
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,559
Okay. And...

111
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,435
Three, two, one.

112
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,191
What an amazing Con.

113
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,860
That, my friend, was just the beginning.

114
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,240
Here you go.

115
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,491
That's not ours.

116
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,701
No?

117
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,370
No. That's ours.

118
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,680
Fucking orcs!

119
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,495
That one.

120
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,379
Oh! People!

121
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,771
Smile.

122
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,692
"Watch the skies" or "Alien on board"?

123
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,612
"Alien on board," please.

124
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,573
Okay. If you're sure.

125
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,285
So, how was Comic-Con?

126
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,120
We met Adam Shadowchild.

127
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,456
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

128
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,708
Oh, he wrote The Venusian Pangenesis.

129
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,043
I didn't read that one.

130
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,045
Jenny Starpepper and the Great Brass Hen?

131
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,129
No.

132
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,422
The Robot's Mistress?

133
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,715
I like romances.

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,300
That's kind of a romance.

135
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,928
- Between a woman and a machine?       - Yeah.

136
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,721
I hear that.

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,309
Do you get a lot of UFO types around here?

138
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,104
Some.

139
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,400
Do you believe?

140
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,276
Oh, yes, I do.

141
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,322
Been a lot of strange happenings in these parts.

142
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,075
Ah, it'd be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe.

143
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,828
Probability alone suggests not.

144
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,581
You know, there are 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe.

145
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,043
Makes you think, doesn't it?

146
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,670
What?

147
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,922
Where is everybody?

148
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,849
Gotcha.

149
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,767
So, you fellows set or can I get you something else?

150
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,936
Oh, I think I would like a refill of coffee, please, Pat.

151
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,063
All right, then. How about you, pumpkin?

152
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,899
Can I have an E.T. Malt, please?

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,776
You want that with a sparkler?

154
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,030
Yeah.

155
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,282
I will take that as a yes.

156
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,744
I think I might do a toilet.

157
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,458
Pretty funny.

158
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,379
He's sitting right there on top of that bull,

159
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,799
and he goes, " Cut her loose. "

160
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,224
What?

161
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,102
I don't know you.

162
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,897
Comics.

163
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,815
What was that about?

164
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,817
How you think that makes me feel?

165
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,071
Be rude to me?

166
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,118
Eggy,

167
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,037
an alien just sicked up in my palms.

168
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,246
Clive...

169
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,623
What?

170
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,916
- I'm joking.       - Stop it.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,960
They've got a soap dispenser in there shaped like an alien's head. It's brilliant!

172
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,253
- Someone's here.       - What?

173
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,380
Here it comes!

174
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,553
What in...

175
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,852
Hey, fellas! How you doing today?

176
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,438
What is this, some kind of gay bar?

177
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,690
No. Just a place where you can get a bite to eat

178
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,526
and maybe share a close encounter.

179
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,569
Yeah. It sounds like a gay bar.

180
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,489
Oh, no, we're just friends.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,535
So, you guys look like you could do with a couple beers.

182
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,994
You go do that.

183
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,913
All right. You do that.

184
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,833
Yes.

185
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,376
Get a sip. I'll get this.

186
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,211
Just leave it.

187
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,963
Thank you very much.

188
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,302
What are you doing?

189
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,304
Don't you put those queer eyes on me.

190
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,848
I'm not. I forgot the sticker.

191
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,307
What took you so long?

192
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,309
I was putting the sticker on.

193
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,686
They were an odd pair, weren't they?

194
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,772
Yeah, definitely not my kind of people.

195
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,025
I doubt very much we'll be seeing them again.

196
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,402
Oh!

197
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,488
- That wasn't their truck, was it?       - No.

198
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,323
- Should I go and have a look?       - No!

199
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,800
The Black Mailbox.

200
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,011
Wow!

201
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,597
This is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen.

202
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,473
Do you remember when we Googled it on your mum's computer

203
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,267
and the phone rang and you thought it was the FBl?

204
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,186
I didn't really think it was the FBl.

205
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,271
- You started crying.       - I had jet lag.

206
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,647
We'd only been to Brussels.

207
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,816
Go stand next to it.

208
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,693
Smile.

209
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,780
Hey, imagine if we got buzzed by a craft.

210
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,490
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?

211
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,201
It just hovers over us

212
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,038
and then all the coins in our pockets go magnetic, and then we get sunburned.

213
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,414
Then it just goes up really quickly.

214
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,881
Smile!

215
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,385
What would you do if they actually landed?

216
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,388
Well, first contact is a big responsibility, isn't it?

217
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,558
They come in peace, we go to pieces?

218
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,809
That's not how I roll.

219
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,102
No.

220
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,688
What's that?

221
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,198
Do you think that's those men?

222
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,075
No.

223
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,037
We've seen enough.

224
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,498
Let's go.

225
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,999
Go, go, go!

226
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,047
Oh, they're gaining.

227
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
This is like Deliverance!

228
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,092
They're going to rape us and break our arms!

229
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,551
I don't want my arms broken!

230
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,347
- I need the toilet.       - You've just been!

231
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,640
You know I've got a child's bladder.

232
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,395
Don't let them get past!

233
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,563
- What do you want me to do, ram them?       - What about the deposit?

234
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,444
It's not them! It's not them!

235
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,988
Oh, my God.

236
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,906
That was awful!

237
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,366
That was terrifying!

238
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,830
Hello?

239
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,055
Maybe you should call for help.

240
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,643
It's ringing.

241
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,187
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

242
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,870
Put the phone down.

243
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,374
Oh, fuck me.

244
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,336
- What have you done to him?       - I didn't do anything to him. He fainted.

245
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,921
Yeah, but you made him faint!

246
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes. But it's not like I set my phaser to "Faint."

247
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,591
You've got a phaser?

248
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,510
No, I don't... Look! Listen.

249
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,970
Hey, I really need your help, okay?

250
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,764
Can we get this guy back onto your wagon?

251
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,601
Are you an alien?

252
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,269
To you, I am, yes.

253
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,521
Are you gonna probe us?

254
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,689
Why does everyone always assume that?

255
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,360
What am I doing? Am I harvesting farts? How much can I learn from an ass?

256
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,486
What?

257
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,571
I'm sorry. What's your name?

258
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,156
It's Graeme Willy.

259
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,658
And what's his name?

260
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,159
That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

261
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,828
Okay, cool! I'm Paul.

262
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,204
Paul?

263
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,331
Yeah. It's a nickname that stuck.

264
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,667
My ship crashed on a dog. It doesn't matter!

265
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,877
Look! Can we get the writer, Clive Gollings, back on the RV

266
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,420
and get the hell out of here, please?

267
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,422
- I can't...       - I'm in a hell of a pickle,

268
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,759
and if you don't help me, I could die on this road tonight.

269
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
I don't know. We're on quite a tight schedule.

270
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,433
Look, man. Sometimes, you just gotta roll the dice.

271
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,519
What do you say?

272
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,279
- Okay.       - Okay! Perfect! Great!

273
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,364
Okay, help me grab him.

274
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,201
This man has peed his pants.

275
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah, he's got a child's bladder.

276
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,580
Oh, fantastic.

277
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,142
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

278
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,228
Well, I'm sorry, the speed limit is 70, so...

279
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,482
Screw the speed limit! Actually, no. Ooh, yeah. Don't screw it.

280
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,652
That's good thinking. Okay? Stay inconspicuous. That's good.

281
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,196
How come I can understand you?

282
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,448
Are you using some sort of neural language router?

283
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,201
Actually, I'm speaking English, you fucking idiot.

284
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,661
- That's not nice.       - That was mean.

285
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,164
Look, I'm little tense. I was just involved in a major car crash.

286
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,373
That was your fault.

287
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,918
I can't reach the pedals. My legs are too little.

288
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,295
I had to use the parking brake, okay?

289
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,298
I'm sorry. You're in shock right now.

290
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,135
I understand this must be very weird for you.

291
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,264
Just act normal and drive north, okay?

292
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,935
We gotta get as much distance as we can between us and the Big Guy.

293
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,479
Zoil? What's happening?

294
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,733
- He's gone.       - Shit!

295
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,986
Looks like he hitched a ride, too.

296
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,821
- What do you mean?       - Tire tracks.

297
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,489
Bastard jacked a native?

298
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,740
Could be two.

299
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,243
Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?

300
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,911
Are you suggesting he knew?

301
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,621
Little fucker might have phoned home.

302
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,749
There might even be a rescue party on the way.

303
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,419
Zoil, we need to break out the big guns.

304
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,464
Do you think that that's wise? The last thing we need is

305
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,799
a hoo-ha.

306
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,467
Maybe you're right.

307
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,847
Listen, I got two rookies on a special mission 75 clicks north of you.

308
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,432
I'll have them set up a roadblock.

309
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,809
These are just civilians. Why don't you let me take care of it?

310
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,436
You might need the extra muscle.

311
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,356
Just keep them in the dark. I don't want any loose ends.

312
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,443
These roads can be treacherous at night.

313
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,156
People get into accidents all the time.

314
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,908
I like your thinking. Get it done.

315
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,794
Heads up. We just got reassigned.

316
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,087
Nice.

317
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,922
What about the sandwich?

318
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,758
- She said we can share it.       - Oh, I love this job.

319
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,155
Man, I needed that.

320
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,205
I love pistachios.

321
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,082
I hate it when you get a closed one, right?

322
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,584
I usually just bite them.

323
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,002
No. You don't do that at all.

324
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,421
You tap them, if they don't open on their own, you throw them away.

325
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,006
No, that's mussels.

326
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,133
No, it's pistachios.

327
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,427
- What the fuck?       - Clive, stop it! What are you doing?

328
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,553
What are you?

329
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,225
He's okay. He's fine. He's friendly. His name's Paul.

330
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,437
Aliens aren't called "Paul. "

331
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,774
Was that Klingon? You psychotic nerd!

332
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,276
Paul is from a small M-class planet

333
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,987
in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.

334
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,239
Thank you.

335
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,573
He looks too obvious.

336
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,659
There's a reason for that, Clive.

337
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,704
Over the last 60 years the human race has been drip-fed images of my face

338
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,998
on lunchboxes and T-shirts and shit.

339
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,460
It's in case our species do meet, you don't have a fucking spaz attack!

340
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,962
I did not have a spaz attack!

341
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,548
- Don't do it again!       - That's my fucking jorph.

342
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,968
Get your fucking fingers out of there! If I get a jorph infection, you're dead!

343
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,137
- Oh, my God!              - Oh, shit!

344
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,143
Paul.

345
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,519
Paul?

346
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,857
Okay, okay. This could be it. So, what are we looking for, again?

347
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,108
I don't know.

348
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,241
- What brings you to USA?       - We're on holiday.

349
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,701
We've been to Comic-Con.

350
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,078
Comic-Con? Don't tell O'Reilly.

351
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,497
He loves that dweeb shit.

352
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,332
You guys know Benny Hill?

353
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,751
- No.       - No.

354
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,421
Oh, my God! Look at this!

355
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,630
- What?       - Look at this!

356
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,090
What?

357
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,134
These guys have met Adam Shadowchild.

358
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,970
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

359
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,139
He wrote The Jupiter Praxis.

360
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,515
What?

361
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,642
Jenny Starpepper and the Huge White Gibbon?

362
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,727
Huh?

363
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,020
Night of the Moths?

364
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,606
Are you speaking English? What are you talking about?

365
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,192
Brilliant! What was he like?

366
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,693
He was a bit intense.

367
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,278
Well, he's an artist.

368
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,490
Let me see this. What is this, nerd porn?

369
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,700
- No, that's Clive's...       - It's my novel.

370
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,951
Okay.

371
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,829
Three tits. That's awesome.

372
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,499
You guys should have given her four tits.

373
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,417
That's just sick.

374
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,877
I was just saying.

375
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,213
Hey, do you think this is it?

376
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,881
Doubtful. What else did you find in there?

377
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,883
Not much. Just some pissy jeans.

378
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
- Clive's got a child's...       - Shut up.

379
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,595
Sorry.

380
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,515
- Okay. You guys can go.       - Thank you.

381
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,059
Can I have my... Thank you very much.

382
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,019
May I ask what you're searching for?

383
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,564
No.

384
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,817
Thank you. Come on, Graeme.

385
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,447
Way to go, Dirty Harry!

386
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,615
That was all right, right?

387
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,326
- All right? That was great energy, man.       - Yeah. It was.

388
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,870
That's it... Is right. It was like... Not...

389
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,164
- I thought it was okay.       - No, you're thinking about it too much.

390
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,251
- You think so?       - Oh, God. They were shaking in their boots.

391
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,715
I think it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?

392
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,467
Is it?

393
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,595
The government used some kind of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox.

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,890
It caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien.

395
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,267
It makes complete sense.

396
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,768
Wrong!

397
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,111
Your dick is gone.

398
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,320
Your balls are gone.

399
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,156
Oh, no!

400
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,867
What?

401
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,453
Come on, grow up. You guys seen my shorts?

402
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,498
How did you do that? How did you go invisible?

403
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,667
Oh, it's a camouflage response.

404
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,918
What, like, Predator?

405
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,129
Exactly! Although I can only do it while I'm holding my breath.

406
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,589
But you can do it any time you want?

407
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,007
Any time.

408
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,634
That's just like him.

409
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,680
Am I the only sane person here?

410
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,640
Eh?

411
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,102
It's all right for you, isn't it? You'll go back to Area 51.

412
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,315
We'll be arrested for harboring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay!

413
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,693
Why don't I go make some bagels and coffee?

414
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,945
Leave you two alone.

415
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,240
What's the matter, Clive?

416
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,245
There is an alien in the kitchenette, making bagels and coffee.

417
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,040
- Did you want tea?       - No, I don't want tea!

418
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,125
Right, because tea is weird in America.

419
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,543
They leave the bag in.

420
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,672
What's weird, Graeme, is the fact that we've picked up an extraterrestrial hitchhiker

421
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,883
and you seem completely fine with it!

422
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,968
Bagels and coffee

423
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,553
Ooh! Marmite!

424
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,223
He said his life's in danger. He needs our help, you know?

425
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,935
Sometimes, you've just gotta roll the dice.

426
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:09,025
What if we wake up and find him inserting a probe into our anus?

427
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,819
Apparently, they don't do that.

428
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,447
Anyone want one of these?

429
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,158
Eh? Anyone? Anyone?

430
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,910
Eh?

431
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,086
Forty-eight, 49, 50.

432
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,296
Coming! Ready or not, you son of a bitch.

433
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,013
- Where's the other one?       - I don't know, sir.

434
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,600
Haggard!

435
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,852
Sorry, it's just, we were...

436
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,813
Haggard!

437
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,356
Fuck.

438
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,277
Nice.

439
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,446
Get over here. It's a guy with a badge.

440
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,199
We were just playing hide and seek, because we had a lot of time.

441
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,617
Hurry up!

442
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,868
I was hiding.

443
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,453
You have any traffic through here?

444
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:07,625
No, just a couple of hillbilly types and two nerds in an RV.

445
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,751
Nerds, huh?

446
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,712
Yes, they were coming from Comic-Con. They met Adam Shadowchild.

447
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,006
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

448
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,385
He wrote Prisonhulk Four-Forty-One, okay?

449
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,596
Jenny Starpepper and the Spitting Worm. Fluxing Uranus.

450
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,974
You know you're a grown man, right?

451
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,644
Probably shave, pay taxes, have pubic hair?

452
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,020
All of those things.

453
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,814
- Did you search that vehicle?       - Yes, sir.

454
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,524
- What did you find?       - Nothing much.

455
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:36,612
Just a book with a green woman with three titties.

456
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,156
Titties. Three titties.

457
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,699
Three tits. That's awesome.

458
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,160
Oh, and some pissy jeans.

459
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,370
- Guy pissed himself.       - Close that.

460
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,955
I don't know if he had a pre-existing problem or...

461
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,207
Listen to me, Frik and Fuck.

462
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,210
I want everything you can remember about the pissy nerds, okay?

463
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,628
We're leaving.

464
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,964
What about the roadblock, sir?

465
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,591
It didn't work.

466
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,303
We gotta take down that roadblock. It didn't work.

467
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,471
I'm standing right next to you.

468
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,822
Hey!

469
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,158
Reese's Pieces! Yes!

470
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,659
Thank you.

471
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,519
I heard there was a commotion on the road after Rachel.

472
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,771
Funny, I didn't hear nothing.

473
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,982
- It must have been the boys out at the base.       - Yeah.

474
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,654
- That's a bit much, isn't it?       - What?

475
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,072
Put it all back.

476
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,116
Except the donuts and the chocolate milk.

477
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,369
And the burritos, Cheetos and Fritos.

478
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,122
- What about Paul's Reese's Pieces?       - Just hurry up. Please.

479
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,795
No, you go right ahead.

480
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,464
Are you sure? Thank you. Thank you.

481
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,258
- That beast outside yours?       - What?

482
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,469
- What do you mean "beast"?       - Your RV?

483
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,555
Oh, the... Yes. The RV is...

484
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,265
No... Yes.

485
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,516
Where are you boys from?

486
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,560
- England.       - England.

487
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,145
I heard about England. No guns.

488
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,148
- Not many.       - Not really.

489
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,150
Just, you know, farmers.

490
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,571
How are police supposed to shoot anybody?

491
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,241
- They don't.       - They try not to.

492
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,665
That'll be $15.58.

493
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,963
$20. Just keep the change, and give it to charity, or something.

494
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,678
You did amazing, Graeme!

495
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,638
That cop didn't suspect a thing!

496
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,848
And, Clive,

497
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,933
you didn't pee your pants.

498
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:14,812
I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but you are asking a lot of us, all right?

499
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,065
We've only just met, we don't know where we're going, or why.

500
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,109
You don't think we're due an explanation?

501
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,070
Look, the less you guys know, the better.

502
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,780
I want you to have plausible deniability.

503
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:30,328
Let's just say I spent a long time at that base thinking I was a guest.

504
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,579
Turns out

505
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,706
I was a prisoner.

506
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,209
But don't worry. I got it all under...

507
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,885
Fuck, that made me jump.

508
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,219
Poor little thing!

509
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,221
Nothing you could've done, mate.

510
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,186
What you doing?

511
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,021
Just watch.

512
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,380
It's a miracle!

513
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,718
Man, I'm gonna miss these.

514
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,221
Why would you do that?

515
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,515
I'm not going to eat a dead bird, am I?

516
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,853
Going out of my mind

517
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,899
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time

518
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,192
Don't bring me down

519
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,276
Come on, guys!

520
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,696
11:00, 12:00! 11:00, 12:00!

521
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
Come on! It's fun!

522
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,367
If you think about it, it's time travel.

523
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,665
11:00, 12:00!

524
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,792
Yes! All right!

525
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,257
Let me see. No, just sit still.

526
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,177
You gonna draw me like one of your French girls, Jack?

527
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,306
I'm joking. I'm sorry.

528
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,727
Just don't make me look fat, okay? Earth's gravity adds 10 pounds.

529
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,563
Paul, could I ask you a question?

530
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,814
Shoot!

531
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,025
Have you ever done that to a person?

532
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,403
Yes, I've eaten many people.

533
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,280
I'm joking, big guy. Relax.

534
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,323
No, I mean, fix them.

535
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,492
Oh. No. Not a dead person.

536
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,455
Recently dead bird? That's one thing. Dead person? Whole other ball game.

537
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,624
It's actually really dangerous for me. The damage can bounce back onto me and...

538
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,421
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I boring you? Have you heard this one before?

539
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,465
Are you tired, Sausage?

540
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,259
Don't call me that in front of him.

541
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,011
Are you tired, though?

542
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,054
Eggy, I'm bushed.

543
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,056
You know what? We're all tired.

544
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,100
Let's just pull over and stop for the night, huh?

545
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,769
We're fugitives, Paul, all right?

546
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,939
I refuse to just sit around and wait to get fingered by the Men in Black.

547
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:08,110
We just gotta find somewhere quiet. We won't draw attention to ourselves.

548
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,279
But where are we going, Paul?

549
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,740
Oh, you'll know it when you see it.

550
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,035
- Two white guys?       - Two strange white guys.

551
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,163
Strange white guys. Got it. Order anything weird?

552
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,372
Chocolate milk.

553
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,083
Chocolate... Chocolate? Chocolate...

554
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,710
Zoil, report.

555
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,297
We've tracked him to a gas station in Ely.

556
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,634
We think he may be traveling in an RV with two men from England.

557
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,719
New England?

558
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,929
Old England.

559
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,973
Creepy. What are they, ML6?

560
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,812
Negative. Just a couple of nerds on the lam from Comic-Con.

561
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,396
My sister's kid went to that.

562
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,649
Little manga faggot.

563
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:51,028
Zoil, something doesn't feel right. I think he had help on the inside.

564
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,449
I want those nerds iced

565
00:33:55,534 --> 00:34:00,079
and that little green prick either back in his fishbowl or dead ASAP.

566
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,622
I'm closing in. I can feel it.

567
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,376
In 24 hours he's gonna wish he never set foot on planet Earth.

568
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,669
Good.

569
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,217
Okay. Here we are. This is the place.

570
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,760
Yeah, this looks good.

571
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,847
It doesn't look like anyone's been murdered here.

572
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,228
Awfully quiet.

573
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,023
Quiet's good, Graeme. Quiet's our friend.

574
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,484
Hi, there.

575
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,112
There's a girl outside.

576
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,701
Okay. All right. Look.

577
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,870
We're just a couple of regular guys

578
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,790
on a tour of the less touristy side of the American Midwest.

579
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,917
I don't think she heard you.

580
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,419
I'm talking to you.

581
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,670
Oh, sorry.

582
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,215
Hi. I'm Ruth Buggs.

583
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,511
Good evening, Ruth. I am the writer, Clive Gollings.

584
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,764
This is my friend and cohort, Mr. Graeme Willy.

585
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,730
Have you got room?

586
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,190
Sure. Yeah, park in bay nine.

587
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,610
It's $25 a night, including hookups

588
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,486
and I'll need an ID to hold onto.

589
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,946
Okay.

590
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,204
We're just a couple of regular guys

591
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,875
on a tour of the less touristy side of the American Midwest.

592
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,501
- How exciting.       - I know.

593
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,088
There you go. It's my passport.

594
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,468
The UK. I love the UK.

595
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,345
- Have you been?       - No.

596
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,429
You should go.

597
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,851
No, no, I meant, you should go to London.

598
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,520
There's a lot of places I want to go.

599
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,190
Ruth! Ruth! Get in here!

600
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,275
I'll be by in the morning to get your money

601
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,944
so have a pleasant evening now, won't you?

602
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,153
- Thank you.       - Thank you.

603
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,780
Bye. And you. Bye.

604
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,119
She was lovely.

605
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,289
Why don't you just marry her, then?

606
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,707
Boo!

607
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,668
Every time, it works!

608
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,128
That was 30 seconds ago, I did it.

609
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,303
- What took you so long?       - I was just talking, Papa.

610
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,264
Well, you talk too much.

611
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,599
Sorry, Papa.

612
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,818
Hello.

613
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,531
- You want a cigarette?       - No, thanks. I don't smoke.

614
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,953
- Can I ask you something?       - Yeah, sure.

615
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,997
- You and Graeme, are you guys...       - What?

616
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,084
You know...

617
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,465
You know! You guys, two guys...

618
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,264
Fucking kidding me?

619
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,151
What are you...

620
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,072
- I don't know what you mean.       - Gay!

621
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,242
No! Why do people keep saying that?

622
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,618
No, I was just wondering.

623
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,122
It's totally cool if you are. Everyone's bi on my planet.

624
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,374
It's all about the pleasure thing. You know what I'm saying?

625
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,919
Why are you here, Paul?

626
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,255
Oh, I was here on a science mission, actually,

627
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,509
and then I had some spaceship-related problems,

628
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,512
and I kind of crashed.

629
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,639
Lucky for me though, this little girl,

630
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:48,724
she pulls me out of the wreck.

631
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,643
Next thing I know, guys arrive, cart me off to the base.

632
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,314
What have you been doing here all this time?

633
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,109
I've been kicking back, man. I've been shooting the shit.

634
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,111
I've been advising the government.

635
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,362
Not just the government.

636
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,617
I want him to have some kind of a special power.

637
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,869
Something messianic.

638
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,539
Okay, Steven, how about cellular revivification?

639
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,041
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

640
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,876
Oh. Restoration of damaged tissue

641
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,378
through telepathic manipulation of intrinsic field memory.

642
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,298
- What's that mean?       - It means healing, Mr. Spielberg.

643
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,966
Yeah, right. Healing.

644
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,010
By touch, or something like that.

645
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,888
Maybe his finger lights up at the end when he reaches out and touches?

646
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,724
Maybe. You know, sometimes I find less is more.

647
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,726
Hey. Trust me.

648
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,604
You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture

649
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,730
over the last 60 years.

650
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,649
Agent Mulder was right.

651
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,360
- Agent Mulder was my idea!       - Really?

652
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,987
That's cool.

653
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,741
Pump that shit, Earth-man. I like this song.

654
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,034
Marvin's my boy.

655
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,289
Come on. Break it down a bit, boys.

656
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,583
Don't be afraid.

657
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,127
Yeah, look at me, I'm breaking it down.

658
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,091
Use them tongs.

659
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,260
Dance with those tongs.

660
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,928
Stoke the fire!

661
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,015
Yes.

662
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,787
Ruth! Prayers!

663
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,165
I don't know the words to this song.

664
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,876
No one does!

665
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,462
Guys, let's get fucked up.

666
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,222
Oh, who's knocking? Stop it.

667
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,017
- What are you doing?       - Oh, shut up.

668
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,688
I'll hide in here.

669
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,607
- Don't come out. Why would I come out?

670
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,108
- Who is it?       - It's Ruth.

671
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,736
Ooh... Don't you dare open that door.

672
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,112
- Hi.       - Hello.

673
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,323
Good morning. May I come in?

674
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,285
- No. I don't think you should come in.       - Yeah. Make yourself at home.

675
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,954
- I'm not really dressed.       - Sure. In you come.

676
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,664
Oh, was everything okay?

677
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:22,252
- Yes it was. It was very nice. The best. Ever.       - Yes, thank you. Adequate.

678
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,670
So, where's the other one?

679
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
The other one? It's just...

680
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,217
Oh, oh. It's okay, we don't charge by the person.

681
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,971
There were three shadows I saw dancing around the RV last night, right?

682
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,557
- The other one. The other one.       - Oh... He...

683
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,727
I'm in the can. I ate a closed pistachio.

684
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm paying for it.

685
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,902
- That's a nice T-shirt.       - Oh, thanks. I got it at my church.

686
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,780
It's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin.

687
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,199
Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin?

688
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,494
Because of his blasphemous theories.

689
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,703
Are you men of God?

690
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,710
We're men of science, you know.

691
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,880
We believe in the establishment of a biological order

692
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,549
through the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos.

693
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,679
God created the Earth in six days, and on the seventh day he rested.

694
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:14,972
Really?

695
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,893
Or it could be God. You don't know, do you? It's up in the air.

696
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:24,147
The world is 4,000 years old and can only be the product of intelligent design.

697
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,941
Oh, that's horseshit.

698
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,778
All right, well, then,

699
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,573
please explain how something as complex as the human eye

700
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,409
simply just comes into being.

701
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,662
Oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap.

702
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,707
Something as intricate as that does not just occur

703
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,001
without the intervention of a guiding hand.

704
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,711
It didn't just occur!

705
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,255
It is the culmination of billions of years of development

706
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,841
across countless fucking species.

707
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,467
What are you talking about?

708
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,720
Evolution, baby.

709
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,222
Blasphemy!

710
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:01,309
Nothing that you can say or do can shake my belief or faith

711
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,021
in the sure and certain knowledge that God made heaven and earth

712
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,939
and created us all in His own image.

713
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,357
- Oh, his own image?       - Yeah.

714
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,443
Well, I got a question.

715
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,987
How do you explain me?

716
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,782
She's going, she's falling. Catch...

717
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,827
And that's Jenga.

718
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,581
- Why did you do that?       - She fainted!

719
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,832
We've gone through this! They faint!

720
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,333
But we're going to have to take her with us now!

721
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,127
No! No!

722
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,672
This is America. Kidnapping a Christian? That's worse than harboring a fugitive.

723
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,884
But she's seen you. If we leave her, she's going to call the police!

724
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,928
Who gives a shit? No one's going to believe this God-bothering Cyclops.

725
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,765
Let's just dump her on the road! Just roll her up in the rug.

726
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,226
We can't risk that! If we take her with us, then we can get her on our side!

727
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,228
You'd love to get her on her side, wouldn't you?

728
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,772
That doesn't make sense.

729
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,399
Look. She'll be fine. We're quite nice.

730
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,526
All right. What about my passport?

731
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,071
Oh, God! You guys.

732
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,541
No!

733
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,681
Oh, shit.

734
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,643
Ruth, what in the Lord's name...

735
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,937
- Morning.       - Morning.

736
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,401
Go, go, go!

737
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,573
Oh, fuck.

738
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,284
Show yourself, demon!

739
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,620
Where are you? Where are you?

740
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,955
Passport! Passport!

741
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,373
Jump! Jump!

742
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,505
What? That's actually small on my planet.

743
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,152
Ruth?

744
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,031
Hello, Ruth, would you like a cup of tea?

745
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,994
Where am I?

746
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,538
Hey, look who's awake.

747
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,707
Demon! Demon!

748
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,543
We're sorry. We're not going to hurt you, I promise.

749
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,545
And we'll let you go just as soon as we can.

750
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,006
You've been deceived by an agent of Satan himself.

751
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,133
- He's evil!       - I'm sitting right here, come on!

752
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,262
No, he's not evil, he's just a bit rude. We're trying to help him get home.

753
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,847
He's from another world.

754
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,893
There's only one world, our world! The world that our God, the Father, created!

755
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,477
If it makes you feel any better

756
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,521
my existence only disproves traditional notions

757
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,231
of the Abrahamic, Judeo-Christian God,

758
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,817
as well as all one-world theologies. That's all I meant.

759
00:44:55,902 --> 00:45:00,071
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound

760
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,907
You can't win with these people!

761
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,577
Ruth, just listen to me, for one second. Please, if you could just calm down.

762
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,997
I can't drive like this.

763
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,043
She's talking in tongues now? Fuck this.

764
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,559
What did you do to her?

765
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,645
I just transferred my collective knowledge and experience

766
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,521
via a tactile psychokinetic bridge.

767
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,898
Ooh, wow, could you do me?

768
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,608
It really takes it out of me.

769
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,109
Oh, go on, please.

770
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,531
Oh, wow!

771
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,034
Oh, yeah.

772
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,036
He always knew what was going on in Battlestar before me

773
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
'cause his mum had cable.

774
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,956
Fine, pull over. I'll do you.

775
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,124
Absolutely not. No spoilers.

776
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,380
I didn't call the government. I called the police!

777
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,424
This is not the police's area of expertise, Mr. Buggs.

778
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,428
- That devil took my daughter.       - What do you mean, devil?

779
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,806
And your daughter's name is Ruth, is it?

780
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,518
That's right. I brought her up by myself after her mama died.

781
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,269
Do you have a photograph of Ruth, sir?

782
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,063
Yeah. She's pretty easy to spot.

783
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,566
She's had this eye thing since she was four years old.

784
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,111
Didn't want to take her to a doctor for that?

785
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,613
The good Lord is the only doctor she'll ever need.

786
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,991
Copy that. Do you have a phone here

787
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,743
that your daughter might try to reach you at if she decides to call?

788
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,120
Yeah, in the back.

789
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:34,207
Hey, Peter Parker. Want to put the snappy down and get to the phone?

790
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,709
Right.

791
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,460
She'll call me if she can.

792
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,797
- You mentioned they went east?       - That's right.

793
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,924
They'll get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge

794
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,175
if they ain't on the interstate.

795
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,969
There's been a big-rig spill...

796
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,266
Here we go. Boys, to the car.

797
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,728
Thank you very, very much for your time, sir.

798
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,399
Promise me you'll kill that thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what it is.

799
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,401
We're gonna do our best.

800
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,528
I've seen its eyes.

801
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,946
It's evil.

802
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,159
Godspeed, Mr. Zoil.

803
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,704
First 48 are crucial.

804
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,542
Sir, you mind telling us what we're looking for?

805
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,793
Yeah, what are we looking for?

806
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,171
I told you this is a need-to-know operation.

807
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,840
Yes, sir, but...

808
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,718
Damn it.

809
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,472
Sir, I think it's time you tell us.

810
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,516
Hey, just do what the fuck I tell you, Haggard.

811
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:38,313
Now let's go find that crazy old bastard's little girl before it's too late.

812
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Ruth!

813
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,238
Ruth, wait!

814
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,573
Leave me alone!

815
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,492
Please, please, stop. I've got shin splints.

816
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,998
He cannot be from space! It's not possible.

817
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,416
He's from somewhere else.

818
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,586
Ruth, you saw it for yourself, okay? He showed you.

819
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,963
There's probably billions of intelligent civilizations out there.

820
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,591
So where is everybody?

821
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,968
But one of them's there!

822
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,845
Are they looking? Are they looking?

823
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,806
Are they looking right now?

824
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,182
Sorry.

825
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,353
That's pathetic.

826
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,981
What's your beef, Clive?

827
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,775
I don't have a beef.

828
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,447
I'm from outer space. You're a science-fiction writer.

829
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,199
We should be best buds.

830
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,326
It's not you.

831
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,037
It's me.

832
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,294
Is that what this is? You're jealous? Of her?

833
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,297
It's not just that.

834
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,967
Whoa.

835
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,885
Of me?

836
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,721
This is because me and Graeme

837
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,807
got two minutes of face-time while you were sleeping?

838
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,977
- Is that what this is?       - I wanted this to be special, you know?

839
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,938
I have dreamt about meeting you

840
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,607
ever since I saw Mac and Me.

841
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,317
And I blew it.

842
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,362
Now you two are friendly, and he's off talking to girls

843
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,865
and it's like, where am I?

844
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,491
Come on, man.

845
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,994
This is special.

846
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:20,248
You guys being all nerdy and shit and meeting me. That is fate.

847
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,209
Who cares if you pissed your pants, man?

848
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,754
When I first got here, first time I saw a human, I puked.

849
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,716
You guys are weird looking.

850
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,094
You have giant bodies. You have tiny, little, tiny heads.

851
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,514
- You're just being nice now.       - No.

852
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,349
Look, you want a little sugar?

853
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,687
It's just knowledge and experience, man.

854
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,398
You're a writer. Might give you some inspiration.

855
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,733
Will it hurt?

856
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,110
Only if you struggle.

857
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,945
All right.

858
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,871
So, everything that I have been told my whole life

859
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,623
is just a big fat lie.

860
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,334
Do you know how that feels?

861
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,047
Just because your truth isn't a true truth doesn't mean that there is no truth, Ruth.

862
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,633
- That's easy for you to say.       - It's really not.

863
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:17,222
So there's no heaven. No hell, no right, no wrong, no sin?

864
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,556
Well...

865
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,434
- I can drink?             - If you like.

866
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,020
- I can fornicate?         - Maybe.

867
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,189
- I can curse?         - Well, yeah.

868
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,732
- Penises!       - Ruth.

869
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,402
Assing, hairy boobs, poop-farting buttholes!

870
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,071
Ruth, I'm not sure this is helping.

871
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,949
What are you doing?

872
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,743
- Stop it!       - Why? Why should I stop?

873
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,206
This is not...

874
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:49,754
Because you have your whole life to explore new things.

875
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,089
Okay?

876
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,009
It doesn't necessarily mean you should be exploring mine right now.

877
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:03,101
You said you wanted to travel, to see new stuff? This is your chance.

878
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,437
I really think you should come with us.

879
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,605
Where would I sleep?

880
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,608
I'll sleep on the sofa. And then you can have my bed.

881
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,570
But I'd push the tissues off with a pen, if I were you, because I've had a cold.

882
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,281
Oh.

883
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,415
Ruth has decided that she would like to come with us.

884
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,501
Wicked.

885
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,838
I'm gonna go freshen up.

886
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,300
Hey, Ruth. Wait up.

887
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,051
You don't smoke.

888
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,594
I just wanted to say thanks.

889
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,139
I know this has been weird for you,

890
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,809
but you saved my life and I owe you one, okay?

891
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,185
Okay.

892
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,188
What have you got there, by the way?

893
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:53,484
Severe epiretinal membrane complicated by macular edema in your left vitreous cavity?

894
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,944
How did you know that?

895
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,779
Lucky guess.

896
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,032
Do you mind if I take a look at it for one second?

897
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:08,416
What does it say in the Old Testament? "An eye for an eye"?

898
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,669
- Wait, I don't...       - It's okay. You can trust me.

899
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,922
- I don't know...       - Just have a little faith, okay?

900
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,495
How did you do that?

901
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,998
Evolution, baby.

902
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,049
- Graeme?       - Yeah?

903
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,303
Oh, my God. Clive.

904
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,389
Oh, my God.

905
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,450
What are you going to do? Come on. Make your move.

906
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,785
Oh, shit. Damn it.

907
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,947
Hey, check it out! Check it out!

908
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,117
This is easy.

909
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,413
Small corrections, Paul. Just make small corrections.

910
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,165
Graeme, hit the brakes!

911
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,471
Hey, there, sleepy face!

912
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,766
Fuckeroo. That was the best titty-farting sleep I have ever had.

913
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,645
I got a feeling that you're new to cursing, Ruth.

914
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,566
Look, cursing's fun. You just gotta pick your moments, okay?

915
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,402
Maybe we should stop for some food. Is anybody hungry?

916
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,778
- Fuck, yeah!           - Ruth?

917
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,364
You bet your big, fat cock I am!

918
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,782
Nice!

919
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,493
I'm starving.

920
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,203
What's new, fatty?

921
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,664
It's not fat, Paul, it's power. Fat power.

922
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,041
- So rude.        - You're rude.

923
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,167
Maybe I should call my dad.

924
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,544
- What?               - What? Why?

925
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,754
I've been gone for a whole day

926
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,007
and if he calls the police, they're gonna be looking for us.

927
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,676
If I don't, there's a good chance we could all end up in Shit-Butt City.

928
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,720
You're really getting the hang of this.

929
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,055
Thanks, dick milk.

930
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,090
- I won't be long.       - Okay. Be careful.

931
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,275
- Ruth Buggs?               - Yes?

932
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,736
Listen to me carefully. I want you to tell me where you are.

933
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,904
Who is this?

934
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,115
My name is Agent Zoil,

935
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,075
and it's very important that you tell me where you are

936
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,994
and where you are headed, Ms. Buggs.

937
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,996
I can't tell you.

938
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,498
I mean, I don't know.

939
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,250
You've been abducted.

940
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,378
And the individual that you're traveling with is highly dangerous.

941
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,255
Oh, no, he's not dangerous.

942
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,008
I mean, he's kind of rude, he curses a lot,

943
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,761
and a couple times I've seen him scratch his spaceman balls.

944
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,267
Please listen to me. Your father is extremely worried about you

945
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,394
and we'd like to get you home, Ms. Buggs.

946
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:40,813
He showed me things.

947
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,898
She's talking about his spaceman balls.

948
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,859
You know I'm just trying to help you, right, Ruth?

949
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:48,321
I don't know what's real anymore. I'm confused.

950
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,448
- We got the bitch!       - Yeah, dog! Up high!

951
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,408
Damn it, Haggard!

952
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,332
Whoa, slow down there, baby.

953
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,292
Excuse me, I have to get to my friends.

954
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,420
I got a friend down here that would love to meet you.

955
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,881
Me, too.

956
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,843
Well, as much as I would like to meet your penises,

957
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,261
I'm in a hurry, so excuse me.

958
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,388
Now, this won't take long, sugar.

959
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,932
Nope. Won't take long at all.

960
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,478
Well, since you're both being so romantic, maybe I could

961
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,355
give it just a quick hello.

962
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,231
What the fuck? Shit!

963
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,816
Now, why would you even...

964
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:26,984
Okay?My balls!

965
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,071
Hey, how's your dad?

966
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,947
- We gotta go.       - What about the mini pizzas?

967
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,449
- We gotta go now!       - No, you don't!

968
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,409
Holy shit!

969
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,372
It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile!

970
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,499
- Yeah. We were just leaving.       - I don't feel well.

971
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,751
- I don't think so.       - Leave her alone!

972
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,003
Oh, shit! Sailors!

973
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,963
- Let's go.       - Sorry!

974
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,424
Excuse me, miss.

975
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,094
Papa?

976
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,265
Ruth? My Lord! Your eye!

977
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,685
- Let's go!       - What about my dad?

978
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,978
Let's go, boy!

979
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,360
Where you going, girls?

980
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,904
Leave us alone, you stupid vaginas!

981
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,782
That's no way for a pretty little thing like you to talk!

982
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,950
She's fairly new to it, to be honest.

983
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,702
Leave this to me. I'll talk to them.

984
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,168
Yo, fucknuts!

985
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,962
It's probing time.

986
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,802
Ha! Only one of us fainted.

987
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,971
Oh, shit! The five-O! Let's bounce.

988
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,306
I'm sorry. They answered the phone.

989
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,058
They knew about us.

990
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,228
Get in the RV.

991
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,106
- Come on, they're going to wake up!       - Hurry!

992
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:52,570
Sorry!

993
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,614
Okay. We need to get off the road.

994
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,575
- Shouldn't we keep moving?       - No.

995
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,743
That is exactly what they'll expect us to do.

996
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:03,205
Trust me. Only an idiot would stop right now.

997
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,167
- Yeah, pull in here. Perfect.       - What? Paul.

998
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,127
We're idiots, remember?

999
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,267
What should we do now?

1000
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,811
How about a hot chocolate and bed?

1001
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,271
What are you, my grandma?

1002
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,316
Oh, I couldn't sleep. I'm too pumped.

1003
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,319
Yeah, me, too. Let's get some beers. Find somewhere to chill.

1004
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,612
What do you say?

1005
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,113
What if someone sees you?

1006
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,823
It's dead out there. And I can do this.

1007
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,911
Okay. I'm in.

1008
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,579
- Rocky?       - Sure.

1009
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,080
Bullwinkle?

1010
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,790
I'm a little bit tired.

1011
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,083
Don't be a pussy.

1012
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,877
Don't call me a...

1013
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,670
All right.

1014
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,509
Just get your hands off me!

1015
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,019
Hoss?

1016
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,064
Something I can help you with?

1017
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,192
Yeah. You mind telling me what happened here?

1018
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,819
Just a good old-fashioned beer-soaked slobberknocker.

1019
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,404
See anything unusual?

1020
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,618
A couple hillbilly types in the back of that meat wagon won't stop crying.

1021
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,669
Have you gentlemen seen anything unusual this evening?

1022
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,506
Are we sure?

1023
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,220
- Thank you.       - No sweat.

1024
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,609
It's a nice window. It's a little cowboy, isn't it?

1025
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,862
That's funny.

1026
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:04,118
I'll tell you what else is funny, was when you kissed me yesterday.

1027
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,912
- Sorry.       - No. It's not...

1028
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,292
I was like, "Get off me, you rapist."

1029
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,590
- Do it again, if you like.       - What?

1030
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,842
I said you can do it again, if you like.

1031
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,262
Really?

1032
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,140
If you're gonna try it, then maybe you should do it with a friend,

1033
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,017
rather than someone like a stranger

1034
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,102
because there's a lot of weirdos out there.

1035
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,272
I am planning on doing a lot of kissing and fornicating

1036
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,941
so you'd really be helping me out.

1037
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,651
- Great.       - Okay.

1038
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,237
- What, now?       - No, I thought you meant...

1039
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,989
No, I did. Let's do it now.

1040
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,366
- I mean...       - Yeah, all right.

1041
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,993
Put my hands on you.

1042
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,953
Just stand here? Okay.

1043
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,413
Hold you steady.

1044
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,252
Fuck!

1045
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,297
I'm sorry. I thought I was gonna pass out.

1046
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,632
Carry on.

1047
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,718
- What's happening?       - Nothing, just hanging around.

1048
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,555
They were about to make out. It was awkward.

1049
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,432
We were just...

1050
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,811
Good. Please put your shorts on, Paul.

1051
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,276
You guys partake?

1052
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,028
No, thank you.

1053
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,113
I'll partake.

1054
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,992
Are you sure? It's pretty strong shit.

1055
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,828
I got it from the military, actually. This is the stuff that killed Dylan.

1056
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,163
Bob Dylan's not dead.

1057
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,123
Isn't he?

1058
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,377
Hit me.

1059
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,213
Okay. Just go easy on it.

1060
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,756
Ruth.

1061
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,633
Just a little bit. Little bit.

1062
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:53,811
It's not so bad.

1063
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,480
To be fair, it takes a while to be absorbed into...

1064
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,856
Oh, shit.

1065
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,031
I'm hungry. We should cook up some sausages.

1066
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,991
Do we have any sausages?

1067
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,660
- What do you mean by that?       - No.

1068
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,080
Why do you guys hate me? Can we cook up some sausages?

1069
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,833
Ooh, I have wasps in my brain!

1070
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:21,463
She'll be fine. That happened to me the first time.

1071
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,174
Paul.

1072
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,678
I was wanting to ask. You know us now, right?

1073
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,682
Yeah. Graeme, we're bona fide BFFs.

1074
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,394
Why are you in such a hurry to leave now?

1075
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:42,443
Well, according to the government, I've fulfilled my usefulness.

1076
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,194
I told them everything I know.

1077
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,906
The only thing I have left to offer them now are my abilities.

1078
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,744
The healing, the thought transfer, the camouflage.

1079
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,497
In order to cultivate those abilities, they need some of my stem cells.

1080
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,750
And I'm not really down with that.

1081
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,794
Lucky for me, I do have one friend left on the inside.

1082
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,255
So, I managed to get an SOS beamed into space.

1083
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,467
I got my people primed and ready to pick me up.

1084
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,428
Then, motherfuckers brought the procedure forward by a day,

1085
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,971
my whole plan goes to shit.

1086
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,139
What happened?

1087
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:16,518
On the way to the mental labs, I zapped my escort, I stole his car, I took off.

1088
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,312
Found you guys.

1089
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,439
So what happens if you get caught?

1090
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:24,234
Graeme, they're gonna cut out my brain.

1091
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,156
Yeah. It's fucked.

1092
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,366
It's kind of a buzz-kill.

1093
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,536
Let's lighten the mood, shall we? Clive, when did you last get laid?

1094
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,419
- Collectormania, London, '08.       - '08.

1095
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,796
Ewok chick.

1096
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,548
Clive likes boning space bears!

1097
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,425
Shut up.

1098
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,595
No, but seriously, be honest with me.

1099
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,763
What was it like?

1100
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,183
Well, she was furry nice.

1101
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,813
That's disgusting! That's gross.

1102
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,362
Hey, Clive.

1103
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,614
No, Boomer, it's forbidden.

1104
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,658
Hey, Clive.

1105
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,201
Clive!

1106
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,745
Let's go, guys! We gotta get out of here!

1107
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,920
Where's Ruth?

1108
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,464
She went back to the RV.

1109
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,759
Of course!

1110
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,928
He can read minds.

1111
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,054
Come on.

1112
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,643
Guys, I think we have a slight problem over here.

1113
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,981
Oh, man.

1114
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,193
I can't hold my breath the whole way through town.

1115
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,904
Wait here.

1116
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,158
What? Wait!

1117
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,129
Good morning. Agent Zoil, Secret Service.

1118
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,256
You mind if I come in there and ask a few questions?

1119
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,757
Not at all.

1120
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,557
Morning.

1121
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,772
- Why are we holding hands?       - So we look like a family.

1122
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,691
Yeah, the fucking Friedmans.

1123
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:28,984
You could be a midget.

1124
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,903
- You're obsessed with midgets!       - No, I'm not!

1125
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,697
Stop it! Just act normal.

1126
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:37,951
We're just a couple of regular guys walking down the street with a small cowboy.

1127
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,119
All right, Clive?

1128
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,746
Clive?

1129
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,998
- Clive.       - Oh, come on!

1130
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:49,922
Clive, what are you doing?

1131
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,423
Yeah, man, what the fuck?

1132
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,633
I want it.

1133
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,845
I can appreciate it's a bargain, but this is not Comic-Con now. This is reality.

1134
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,932
It's false economy anyway, it'll break the first time you use it. Let's go!

1135
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,392
- Why would I ever use it?       - Can we just go, please?

1136
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:04,978
Wait. Maybe we should go inside.

1137
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,605
- What?       - We'll hide out.

1138
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,775
You go back and get Ruth. Get the RV, pick us up in 10 minutes.

1139
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,901
You sure?

1140
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,445
Trust me.

1141
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,620
Good morning. My name is Agent Zoil, Secret Service.

1142
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,997
Mind if I come in, ask you a few questions?

1143
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,583
Do you mind if we just do it right here?

1144
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,629
This place is a real cock-sucking mess.

1145
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,798
Got it.

1146
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,761
I'm telling you, we're looking for a goddamn alien.

1147
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,389
I thought all that Project Blue Book stuff was horseshit.

1148
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,848
No, it all makes sense.

1149
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,642
All this hush-hush crap?

1150
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,227
The drawing that I found?

1151
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,729
What do you think that girl was talking about last night?

1152
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,856
Holy shit! Spaceman balls!

1153
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,526
Yeah. And who has spaceman balls?

1154
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,486
- Buzz Aldrin?       - Be serious.

1155
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,580
Hello, handsome.

1156
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,041
Is that you?

1157
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,128
Is that you on the cover?

1158
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,423
No.

1159
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,675
- What's your name?       - Keith Nash.

1160
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,470
- Nice to meet you. I'm Paul.       - Right.

1161
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,973
So, you're not freaked out by me?

1162
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,892
Yes and no.

1163
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,437
You mind taking a look at these photographs?

1164
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,898
Tell me if you recognize either one of these two gentlemen or the one-eyed girl?

1165
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,110
- Ma'am?       - No.

1166
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,112
Anything? Anything at all?

1167
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,742
- You really think this is an alien?       - Yeah!

1168
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:45,620
- This is huge! This is huge!       - I know! I know!

1169
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,414
Is that a comic book shop?

1170
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,999
Can we go in there?

1171
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,418
Maybe. If you're good.

1172
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,003
Where are you coming from?

1173
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,254
Austin.

1174
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,965
- Good town.       - Yeah, it is. They have a lot of bats.

1175
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,717
Sorry? What'd you say?

1176
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,137
Okay. Thanks for your time, Mrs...

1177
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,513
Darwin.

1178
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,350
Charlotte Darwin.

1179
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,269
Charlotte Darwin. You have a great day.

1180
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,361
You are not gonna believe this.

1181
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,281
You should get this one.

1182
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,034
- Thanks.       - Yeah, it's good.

1183
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:28,622
Nice! I like your style, Keith Nash.

1184
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,373
- I gotta go.       - Catch you later.

1185
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,875
Bye, Paul.

1186
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,043
Don't get caught.

1187
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,338
Happy trails.

1188
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:43,887
Huh!

1189
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,473
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1190
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,060
How much is that?

1191
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:54,481
With the sword, $299.99 plus tax.

1192
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,732
Yeah, I'll wear it now.

1193
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,568
Come on, man, let's go!

1194
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,988
I'll be right out.

1195
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,034
Should have used the cufflink thing.

1196
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,763
Spaceman balls?

1197
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,691
Get your goddamn hands off my motherfucking junk!

1198
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,820
It's in there! It's in there!

1199
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:53,915
Hello.

1200
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,626
O'Reilly!

1201
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,461
You dumb shit, that's just some asshole in a mask.

1202
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,715
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

1203
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,675
I gotta quit smoking.

1204
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,387
Let's go!

1205
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,763
Sorry, ma'am!

1206
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,314
- Shit! Don't let... Behind me!

1207
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,983
Hurry up, buttcracks!

1208
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,067
Look, it's that nerd.

1209
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,907
- Who was that kid?       - Keith Nash!

1210
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,074
Punch it!

1211
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,744
I don't know what happened! Who is that kid?

1212
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,711
- Get the car started!       - Yes, sir!

1213
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,173
Whoa, whoa. What's going on? Did you guys get me some information?

1214
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,841
We saw it. We saw the alien.

1215
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,594
It was in the comic book shop. It's hideous! I think I shit my pants.

1216
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,929
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1217
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,556
You know what?

1218
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,559
You know exactly what we're talking about.

1219
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,811
I'm sick and tired of being in the dark on this...

1220
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:01,149
Where the fuck did he go?

1221
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,776
I got your door for you.

1222
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,985
I got mine.

1223
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,738
He went with those nerds.

1224
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,450
So, you want to follow us, big guy?

1225
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,452
You kids are gonna go back to the base.

1226
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,413
Daddy's gonna stick behind, do a little adult work.

1227
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,332
Now, tell me which way the little green guy went.

1228
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,876
- North East highway.       - North East highway.

1229
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,127
Straight home, now.

1230
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,050
Sorry, guys. It's my dad!

1231
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,262
This guy doesn't quit. You kind of have to respect it.

1232
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,729
Oh, God, Graeme, drive faster. Go away, Dad!

1233
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:42,065
- Guys, calm down.       - Those asshorns are gonna catch us!

1234
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,608
I said, calm down! Pull over!

1235
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,193
- What do you mean, pull over?       - Pull over!

1236
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,047
All right. That's it.

1237
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,259
This is too dangerous. I can make it on my own from here.

1238
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,636
- What do you mean?       - No. Graeme, you've done enough.

1239
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,639
I'll boost a car or something. I can drive an automatic.

1240
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,057
You're a terrible driver!

1241
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,601
He's right, Paul. You can't even drive a spaceship.

1242
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,895
I'm close now. I'll be fine.

1243
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,564
But we've come all this way.

1244
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,024
Yeah, and at what cost, huh?

1245
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,277
I've shaken your faith. I've almost gotten you guys killed!

1246
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,528
I just want to get home.

1247
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,407
You are going home. I think we've come too far to let you do this alone.

1248
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:35,869
Yeah. What happened to BFFs? We are in this together, Paul.

1249
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,955
You bet your hairy love eggs we are.

1250
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,082
The last 72 hours have been the ride of my life

1251
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,209
and I'm fucked if I'm getting off this bus now!

1252
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,795
- Yeah, me, too.       - And me.

1253
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,547
Well, that settles it.

1254
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,674
We're all fucked.

1255
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,677
Thank you guys so much.

1256
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:57,724
If you're absolutely sure, there is a little something you can do for me.

1257
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,189
- What about this one?       - No, too small.

1258
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,982
- Really?       - Yeah, too small.

1259
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,323
Seems rather fitting.

1260
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,537
- That wasn't difficult, was it?       - No. Not at all.

1261
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,372
- Hello.       - Hello.

1262
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,125
That'll be $299.99, plus tax.

1263
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,253
Same as the sword.

1264
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,132
Look. They're running. Holy shit!

1265
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,593
- Get the door.       - Oh, shit. Can you drive this thing?

1266
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,303
I've been driving these things my whole life.

1267
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,808
Come on! Get in, get in.

1268
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,103
Graceful.

1269
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:51,236
Zoil. Picked up a 9-1-1 outside of Prospect.

1270
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,156
A fireworks store just got ripped off by two British nerds in an RV.

1271
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,241
Son of a bitch!

1272
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,661
According to local bacon, they're on the 14, 40 miles west of you.

1273
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,080
Drive like a man, you'll catch up to them in 30.

1274
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,833
Cops are standing down. You better spin your ass around!

1275
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,292
Roger that!

1276
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,049
Don't make me come out there.

1277
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:15,385
I'm guest of honor at the governor's ball tonight

1278
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,886
and I'm dressed up real nice.

1279
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,764
Where the hell does this 14 go, anyway?

1280
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,015
You tell me.

1281
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,935
You got Thermopolis, you got Lytle Creek.

1282
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,522
Holy shit! Moorcroft's on the 14.

1283
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,065
You don't think...

1284
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,109
Son of a bitch is going back.

1285
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,070
He's gonna try and make contact. We got him, Zoil.

1286
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,613
Bring me back my space monkey

1287
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,075
and I guarantee you level 5 clearance and all the perks.

1288
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,077
Great. Better parking space would be good.

1289
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,080
I don't know, man. I don't know. He looked awful mad.

1290
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:48,209
Fuck him. He's a dinosaur. It's time for some new blood.

1291
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,344
Okay. We're nearly there.

1292
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,721
This is where we've been headed?

1293
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,390
No. I just need to make a little stop first, okay?

1294
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,601
Do you think we've really got time to be making little stops?

1295
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,187
This is something I really have to do.

1296
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,815
Okay, stop here. This is good. This is close enough.

1297
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,906
Shouldn't we park a bit closer?

1298
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,408
No. We don't want to scare her.

1299
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,577
Scare who?

1300
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:25,580
You knock. You knock.

1301
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,706
I always knock.

1302
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,500
Who's there?

1303
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,587
Is that Tara Walton?

1304
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,923
Leave me alone.

1305
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,677
Ms. Walton, my name is Clive Gollings.

1306
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,555
I'm here with my friend, Mr. Graeme Willy.

1307
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,603
And what do you want?

1308
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:54,817
We're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago.

1309
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,782
Let's go. Let's just go.

1310
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,159
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

1311
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,623
Hey, Tara.

1312
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:13,670
You!

1313
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,929
That's a very loud clock, isn't it?

1314
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,808
You have a nerve showing your face here after all these years.

1315
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,895
Maybe I should make some tea.

1316
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,313
I'll do it.

1317
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,986
Okay.

1318
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,622
Look, Tara.

1319
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:53,126
I only just stopped believing in you, you know.

1320
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,941
I spent a very long time trying to convince

1321
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:58,256
folks about what happened that night.

1322
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,259
Everyone said I was mad!

1323
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:05,555
They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul.

1324
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,559
They took me away and they did tests.

1325
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,061
They said it was for cosmic radiation.

1326
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:15,690
That I was concussed, hallucinating.

1327
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,734
But I knew you were real!

1328
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,737
I pulled you from that spaceship myself.

1329
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,655
I kept you warm and comfortable.

1330
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,950
I sat there with you till the men came to take you away.

1331
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,870
Pop tried to understand,

1332
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,957
but he would just smile and say, "There there, Tara. "

1333
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,628
When word got out about my story,

1334
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:42,842
kids used to come and throw stones at the house, call me names.

1335
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,762
And I just hid myself away.

1336
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:50,058
I'd spend whole nights up there, just staring at the sky,

1337
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,518
hoping that I'd catch a glimpse of you.

1338
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,645
And here you are.

1339
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,985
I'm sorry. If I could have done it any other way, I...

1340
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,279
Oh, it's okay.

1341
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:04,655
You're real.

1342
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,324
That's all that matters.

1343
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,993
I was right.

1344
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,954
And all those folks that said I was crazy?

1345
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,832
They can all just go fuck themselves.

1346
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,005
I brought something for you. I thought you might want it back.

1347
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,218
Here you go.

1348
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,016
Oh, thank you.

1349
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,194
Who do you suppose that is?

1350
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,740
- Where did that come from?       - Holy shit! It's them!

1351
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,033
I'll take the front!

1352
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,123
What the fuck are you doing here?

1353
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,541
Go! Go!

1354
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:04,257
Haggard!

1355
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,466
Alien!

1356
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,981
Haggard! Where's the party, man?

1357
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,567
There's no one in this place! Come on, buddy, help me out.

1358
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,693
Oh, fuck!

1359
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,445
Freeze, motherfucker!

1360
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,197
So weak.

1361
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,866
Give me the alien!

1362
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,451
Give me the fucking alien!

1363
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,412
- No!       - Fuck. Watch it.

1364
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,997
Give me the alien!

1365
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,166
Get your own alien.

1366
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,634
Thank you, Clive! Is Tara with us?

1367
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,679
Tara! Come this way! Follow us!

1368
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,681
Oh, man-balls! It's my dad!

1369
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,600
Are you okay? Am I heavy?

1370
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,393
I told you, it's not fat, it's power!

1371
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,063
Oh, great.

1372
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,362
I told you we should've parked closer!

1373
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,909
Holster that. They're mine!

1374
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,620
- Consider that a warning!       - You crazy bastard!

1375
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,123
I got you, you little space freak!

1376
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,125
Ruth! Get back here!

1377
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,251
Just go home!

1378
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,966
Oh, I got you, sucker. Coming.

1379
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,468
Ready or not.

1380
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:40,478
Holy fuck.

1381
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,404
- Papa!       - Ruth, wait!

1382
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,325
Papa! Papa!

1383
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,204
It's okay, he's alive. He's okay!

1384
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,540
- Go, Clive, go!       - Wait for me!

1385
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,833
You okay?

1386
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,585
- Thank you. I'm okay.       - Wait there.

1387
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,053
Graeme!

1388
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,642
Ruth! Drive!

1389
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,021
Come on, Graeme!

1390
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,149
Don't leave me!

1391
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,031
Never.

1392
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,077
Graeme, you scared the shit out of me.

1393
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,037
Ruth, why aren't you driving?

1394
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,998
I told you. It's easy!

1395
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,258
Got it. Got it. Got it. Shit. Shit. Shit. Road! Okay.

1396
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,720
Small corrections! Small corrections!

1397
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,558
Oh, my weed!

1398
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:24,248
Motherfucking titty-sucking two-balled bitch!

1399
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,425
Zoil, progress report.

1400
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,889
This is Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil is no longer in command.

1401
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,516
I don't give a shit who's in command. Where the fuck are they?

1402
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,394
Just ahead of me, heading east towards Lytle Creek.

1403
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,856
I don't wanna hear from anybody until that cocksucker is dead! Get me?

1404
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,191
Yes, sir.

1405
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,275
Ma'am.

1406
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:58,783
God damn it!

1407
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,207
This is official government business!

1408
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,460
Stand down, or I am authorized to use deadly force.

1409
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,046
That thing has my daughter!

1410
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,756
This isn't your mission!

1411
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,550
I'm on a mission from God!

1412
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,968
Tell him you failed.

1413
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,819
Shit! We got company.

1414
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:43,953
He's trying to overtake us!

1415
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,913
- Don't let him get past!       - Should I ram him?

1416
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:48,707
- What about the deposit?       - Fuck the deposit.

1417
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,875
You're crazy!

1418
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:58,092
Fuck.

1419
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,602
Oh, fuck! Come on!

1420
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:09,937
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1421
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,273
Eyes forward, butthorn.

1422
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,326
Do you think he'll be okay?

1423
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,786
Yeah, he'll be fine.

1424
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,380
- Haggard.       - Zoil.

1425
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,048
Where are the other two?

1426
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,676
One crashed and burned, the otherjust burned.

1427
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,179
Jesus Christ! This has been one fuck-up after another.

1428
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,139
I should have handled this myself.

1429
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,600
I am very close. You give me one hour.

1430
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,728
An hour? I'll be eating canaps with the governor in an hour.

1431
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,313
I need this wrapped up now!

1432
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,357
No, no. They're mine, damn it. I'm gonna finish this, once and for all.

1433
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,235
Too late, Zoil. I'm bringing in the big guns.

1434
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:02,364
Boring conversation anyway.

1435
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,498
Fare thee well, my friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed.

1436
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,957
I can't believe she's gone.

1437
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,209
Ain't that a bag of tits.

1438
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:16,504
Oh, what'll we do now, Paul?

1439
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,130
Paul?

1440
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,925
Paul, where are you going?

1441
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,604
See? What did I tell you, fellas?

1442
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,981
You'd know it when you saw it.

1443
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,402
Of course.

1444
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,625
Right. Shoots flaming balls.

1445
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:58,003
- Can you just light the fucking thing?       - Fireworks are not toys, Paul.

1446
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:01,632
- What is the suggested safe distance?       - Right.

1447
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:05,052
- 500 feet.       - That's going to put us behind the tree line.

1448
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:07,471
- We're not gonna enjoy the full effect.       - That's true, actually.

1449
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,266
Now you're running, huh?

1450
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,643
That's not funny. That's dangerous.

1451
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,176
What now?

1452
01:27:46,886 --> 01:27:49,346
We wait.

1453
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:59,106
Yes.

1454
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,566
- That's amazing.       - Thank you.

1455
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,775
Not bad.

1456
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,819
That's three times you've done that now.

1457
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:05,904
I never met anyone...

1458
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,644
Oh, no, you don't.

1459
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,191
Wait a minute.

1460
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:55,954
Stay where you are, you little green bastard!

1461
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,435
It's the Big Guy.

1462
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,273
Well, what do you know?

1463
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,651
Small world.

1464
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,279
- Paul!       - Zoil?

1465
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,143
Don't fucking move!

1466
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:03,147
Okay, everyone be cool. Everyone just be cool.

1467
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,607
I gotta say, I'm a little hurt, Agent Zoil.

1468
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,776
He introduced me to my wife. He's my friend.

1469
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,905
You stupid son of a bitch. You could've been where I am in 15 years.

1470
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,033
- I don't want to be where you are.       - Too bad,

1471
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:18,454
seeing as how I'm the one holding all the cards.

1472
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,165
And when I say "cards," I of course mean

1473
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,833
big fucking gun.

1474
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,293
Very big gun.

1475
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:28,005
- Let's go, Mork.       - Don't call me Mork.

1476
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,715
- No.       - Guys, you don't have to do this.

1477
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,175
No, he's going nowhere.

1478
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,261
Can it, nerds.

1479
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:37,264
Shit, I'd shoot you now if I didn't get off on the idea

1480
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:40,893
of your being hog-tied and pissed on in Guantanamo Bay.

1481
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,728
They've shut Guantanamo Bay.

1482
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,062
Did they?

1483
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,440
Be honest with yourselves.

1484
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,569
What do you think you can possibly bring to the table at this point in the game?

1485
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:54,573
Blind fury.

1486
01:30:58,328 --> 01:30:59,995
False economy. I told you.

1487
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,539
Step aside, fag.

1488
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:09,754
frapp Cette femme.

1489
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,257
Insane!

1490
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,031
- Ruth!       - Get away from her, you bitch!

1491
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,248
Zoil, you okay, man?

1492
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:48,293
- So much for the plan, huh?       - I know, right?

1493
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:50,212
Sorry I zapped you at the farmhouse.

1494
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,589
That's okay. I'm sorry I wasn't there to meet you outside the base.

1495
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,299
By the time I got there, you'd already gone.

1496
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,760
But I see you got yourself a plan B, huh?

1497
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,221
Did I ever. These are my friends.

1498
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,056
- Hello.       - Pleasure to meet you boys.

1499
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,475
- You did a hell of a job.       - Thank you, Agent Zoil.

1500
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,561
Please call me Lorenzo.

1501
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:06,979
- Lorenzo Zoil?               - Lorenzo Zoil?

1502
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:09,898
That's right.

1503
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:12,943
Ruth!

1504
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:14,903
Papa?

1505
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,117
- Paul!       - Ruth!

1506
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,331
That was close.

1507
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,839
Oh, my!

1508
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:36,967
No!

1509
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,677
Oh, God, Graeme.

1510
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:40,679
Graeme!

1511
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:43,140
- I never meant to...       - Put the gun down, Mr. Buggs.

1512
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,766
Drop the fucking gun, Dad!

1513
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,060
Oh, no!

1514
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,271
I really liked this T-shirt.

1515
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:52,691
This is all my fault. We should never have come on holiday.

1516
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:56,028
No, no. It's fine. It's fine, Clive.

1517
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,613
We've had a good time, haven't we?

1518
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,781
Yeah. But you got shot.

1519
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,368
Yeah, I know. But I can honestly say, Clive,

1520
01:33:03,368 --> 01:33:05,787
this is the most fun I have ever had.

1521
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:14,129
Graeme?

1522
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:20,427
Graeme?

1523
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:22,679
Graeme?

1524
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,227
I've gotta try, right?

1525
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,566
- Yeah?       - No, no.

1526
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,657
Paul, think about this.

1527
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,040
Paul!

1528
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:38,839
Paul?

1529
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,901
Oh, that sucked. I don't even get to eat him.

1530
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,909
Wasn't that really, really dangerous?

1531
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:12,289
Sometimes, you just gotta roll the dice.

1532
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,750
It's a miracle!

1533
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:20,839
The Lord has delivered his healing hand!

1534
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,300
You can't win with these people.

1535
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:31,725
- Sorry you got killed by my dad.       - That's fine.

1536
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:35,020
- Do you want to try that kiss again?       - Fuck, yeah.

1537
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,778
Well, what do you know? The geek shall inherit the Earth.

1538
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:55,874
Well, ain't this...

1539
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,048
I changed my mind. That is Jenga.

1540
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:12,891
It feels better.

1541
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,110
Okay?

1542
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,490
Oh, that's good.

1543
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:30,992
- This is a nice one of you.       - Thank you.

1544
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,410
Look, Mr. Buggs.

1545
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,787
It's been a hell of a ride, huh?

1546
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,248
Sorry I frightened the shit out of you.

1547
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:40,252
You didn't frighten me. You freed me.

1548
01:36:40,711 --> 01:36:42,295
I'm glad.

1549
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:44,422
Mmm. That's nice.

1550
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,466
Thanks.

1551
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,181
Hey, take care of her, big man.

1552
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:56,101
Oh, I will, sir. And God be with you.

1553
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:58,144
Yeah, whatever, dude. Sure.

1554
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,442
Say bye to Karen for me.

1555
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,612
Safe trip, Short Round.

1556
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,489
Thanks.

1557
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,377
- Oh, you're coming with me.       - What?

1558
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:24,379
I ruined your life, Tara.

1559
01:37:24,463 --> 01:37:26,715
I think it's only right I give you a new one.

1560
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,511
I don't have my toothbrush.

1561
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:36,308
Baby, where we're going, you don't need teeth.

1562
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:44,983
That's right. Right on. Get in there, girl.

1563
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:48,194
Yeah, she's cool. She's with me. Let her in. Yeah. No.

1564
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,492
Gentlemen.

1565
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:59,122
I meant to ask, what did you think of the book?

1566
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,667
I liked it, actually. I really liked it.

1567
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:05,420
There's lot of good ideas in it.

1568
01:38:05,504 --> 01:38:08,632
I kind of found it hard to finish, to be honest.

1569
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:11,426
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

1570
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:13,428
You know, as I always say,

1571
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:16,765
"You have to spin a good yarn before you can weave a great dream. "

1572
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,643
That's what Adam Shadowchild said.

1573
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,187
That asshole! He stole that from me.

1574
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:26,858
- He was a bit of an asshole, actually.       - Yeah, he was.

1575
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:31,988
- Keep it for the journey home, if you like.       - Oh, yeah. Definitely.

1576
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,956
It's safe to say we've all learned something from this.

1577
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,125
Be yourselves. Speak from your heart. Some shit like that, I don't know.

1578
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,338
Yeah, you know, I certainly feel a bit different.

1579
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,507
And me.

1580
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,842
Thank you, guys.

1581
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:56,513
- No, thank you.       - Yeah, thanks, Paul.

1582
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:59,641
Hugs?

1583
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:00,934
Come on.

1584
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,440
Clive, I can feel your boner.

1585
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,615
Till next time.

1586
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,375
- So cool, isn't it?       - It's amazing!

1587
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,295
Goodbye!

1588
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,654
See you! Goodbye!

1589
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:05,582
This ship takes off very slowly. It's a little awkward.

1590
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:06,791
Goodbye!

1591
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,295
Can you guys take off any faster? Come on!

1592
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,557
That was good, wasn't it?

1593
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:28,623
- Leias!       - Thank you. Cheers.

1594
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:33,503
Sorry. Who are you?

1595
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,172
Someone who loves you.

1596
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:39,717
I thought you were coming as Wonder Woman today.

1597
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,891
All right, would you please welcome

1598
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:52,021
the team behind this year's multi-Nebulon-award-winning best seller.

1599
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:00,780
By the way, these are friends of mine.

1600
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,409
- I'm very proud of you, Graeme.       - I'm very proud of you, Sausage.

1601
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:06,536
Come on.

1602
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:19,674
Pat Stevens? Like, Pat Stevens from Chapter 1?

1603
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:20,884
The very same.

1604
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,719
You know, I always pictured you taller.

1605
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,513
- You should see me standing up.       - Oh, I'd like that.

1606
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,567
I didn't realize you were so damn pretty.

1607
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:39,194
You should see me out of these crazy clothes.

1608
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,321
I'd like that.

1609
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:46,201
I can't.

1610
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,459
I understand, apparently, they are citing me as the...

1611
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:56,794
Well, fuck. You know...

1612
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:04,886
Please welcome to the stage, Clive Gollings and Graeme Willy.

1613
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,095
Give it up.

1614
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:11,142
Three, two, one.

1615
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:13,186
Congratulations.

1616
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,729
- Congratulations.       - Thank you.

1617
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,701
Graeme! Clive!

1618
01:43:31,407 --> 01:43:32,648
I know those guys!
