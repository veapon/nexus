00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,720
这是什么？
What is this?

9
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,325
肿瘤？
Cancer?

圣母玛利亚，你满有恩惠，求你保护我
Mother Mary, full of grace, protect me

11
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,551
求你此刻指引我
and guide me in my hour of death.

12
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,115
这是试炼
It's a test.

13
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,551
断了吧
Cut it down.

14
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,288
断了吧
Cut it down.

苏・斯奈尔，汤米・罗斯，快点
Sue Snell and Tommy Ross, come on.

17
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,861
姑娘们，戴好泳帽，赶紧入水！
Let's go, ladies! In the water! Caps on, please!

18
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,793
克丽丝，苏，赶紧的！
Chris and Sue, let's go!

19
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,583
我要你们垫三次球，明白吗？
I want you to keep it in the air three times. All right?

20
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,420
我们要毕业了，戴佳汀老师
We are graduating, Ms. Desjardin.

21
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,892
好球，苏！
Yeah, Sue!

22
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,531
接啊
Get that.

23
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,069
不要惧怕球，姑娘们
Don't be afraid of the ball, ladies.

24
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,936
好了，继续
All right, here we go.

25
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,114
好了，嘉莉，让嘉莉也来吧
All right, Carrie White. Let's get Carrie into the game.

26
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,889
你总不能一直看着吧，快来
You can't stand on the sidelines all the time. Come on.

27
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,752
嘉莉发球
Carrie's serve.

28
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,886
嘉莉・怀特！
Yeah, Carrie White!

29
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,090
发球，嘉莉！
Do it, Carrie! Yeah, yeah.

30
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,791
抛起来，发球啊
Throw it. Do it. Serve it.

31
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,133
搞什么鬼？
What the hell?

32
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,073
太搞笑了，克丽丝
It's so funny, Chris.

33
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,308
- 没事吧？ - 没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

34
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,650
我的天
Oh, my God.

35
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,078
你真行
You eat shit.

36
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,700
- 不，不是他 - 是他
- No, he didn't. - Yes, he did.

37
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,065
不是他，是你讲和的
No, he didn't. You're making it up.

38
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,604
他走过来，我让他伸出手
He came up to me and I said, "Well, you have to extend your hand..."

39
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,104
开始瞎说了
Now you're lying.

40
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,583
救命！救救我！
Help! Help! Help me!

41
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,519
救救我
Help me.

42
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,784
- 快走开，你个怪胎！ - 求你了
- Get off me, you freak! - Please.

43
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,953
我的天，我的内衣
Oh, my God. Look what you did to my shirt.

44
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,119
求你了！
Please!

45
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,893
住手！别过来
Stop! Stop! Settle down.

46
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,298
我要流血而死了，救救我
I think I'm bleeding to death. Please.

47
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,199
天哪，这是大姨妈
Oh, my God. It's period blood.

48
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,534
我在流血，我要死了
I'm bleeding. I think I'm dying.

49
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,598
什么？我的天
What? Oh, my God.

50
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,604
救救我吧！
Please help me!

51
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,472
你只是来大姨妈了
It's just your period.

52
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,413
堵上就行了
Just plug it up.

53
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,478
- 救救我！ - 天哪！
- Help me! - Oh, God!

54
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,813
- 她抓到你了 - 救救我！
- Oh! She got you. - Help me!

55
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,322
快堵上啊！
God, just plug it up!

56
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,718
救命啊！
Help!

57
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,617
堵起来！
Plug it up!

58
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,130
别这样，不！
I'm sorry. No!

59
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,596
不要！
No!

60
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,337
堵起来！
Plug it up!

61
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,840
姑娘们，都闪开！
Girls, come on! Move!

62
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,178
姑娘们
Ladies.

63
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,315
- 我的天，好了，没事了 - 救救我
- Oh, my God. Okay. All right. - Help me.

64
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,652
好了，宝贝，站起来弄干净
Okay, honey, stand up. Let's get you cleaned up.

65
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,850
救救我，救救我
Help me, help me.

66
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,088
嘉莉，别这样
Oh, Carrie, come on.

67
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,695
快站起来，能站起来吗？
Stand up. Come on, can you stand up?

68
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,356
很疼！很疼！
It hurts! It hurts!

69
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,933
很疼！感觉很不好，很不好
It hurts! Something's not right. Something's not right.

70
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,434
好了好了，哪里感觉不好？
Okay, okay. What are you talking about?

71
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,505
戴老师，我觉得她不知道自己来月经了
Ms. Desjardin, I don't think she knows it's her period.

72
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,097
不！
No!

73
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,666
好了，苏，都出去吧！不用你们帮忙
All right, Sue. Get out of here! You're not helping.

74
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,278
- 不，不！ - 别吵了！
- No! No! - Calm down!

75
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,616
全都出去！马上！
Everyone get out! Now! Out!

76
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,487
好了，深呼吸，来
Okay, deep breaths. Come here.

77
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,053
好了，没事了，亲爱的
Come on. It's okay. You're okay, sweetie.

78
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,118
这很正常
It's totally normal.

79
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,394
你知道这是代表什么吗
Do you know what it means?

80
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,298
好了，亲爱的
Okay, sweetie.

81
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,573
你感觉好点了吗？
Are you, uh, feeling better?

82
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,374
要不要给你点阿司匹林？
Can I get you some aspirin?

83
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,880
果汁还是别的？
Some juice or something?

84
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,175
果汁？亏你说得出来
Juice? Really, Henry?

85
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,741
也许你只想一个人待着
Maybe you just want us to leave you alone.

86
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,322
嘉莉，我刚才不该打你
Carrie, honey, I am so sorry that I slapped you.

87
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,824
我应该处理的更好点
I should have handled it better.

88
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,155
女孩子来月经太正常了
It's totally normal for young girls to get their periods.

89
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,855
通常来说会来的早一点
It usually actually happens a little bit earlier.

90
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,398
这是第一次吗？
Is this your first time?

91
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,842
宝贝，你知道你身体怎么了吗？
Honey, do you understand what's happening to your body?

92
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,240
你知道这意味着什么吗？
Do you know what it means?

93
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
什么？
What?

94
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,013
我不知道，我感觉有东西往下爬
I don't know. I felt something moving down there.

95
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,515
宝贝
Oh, honey.

96
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:59,050
也许你可以跟辅导老师或者护士说说
Maybe you could, uh, talk to a counselor about that or a nurse.

97
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,393
我只想知道谁带头扔…
Um, what I need to know is who started throwing...

98
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,352
…那些东西
...things.

99
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,862
是克丽丝・哈根森和她的伙伴
It was Chris Hargensen and all of her friends.

100
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,092
- 嘉茜 - 嘉莉
- Cassie... - "Carrie."

101
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,098
嘉莉，是克丽丝带的头吗？
Carrie, did Chris Hargensen start this?

102
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,004
宝贝，你不用护着她们
Honey, you don't have to protect them.

103
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,904
她们的所做所为不可原谅
What they did was unforgiveable.

104
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,640
好吧
Okay, uh...

105
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,078
看来嘉莉不想指认
It doesn't seem that Carrie is going to point the finger,

106
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,606
戴老师，就由你来查清楚这事吧
so Ms. Desjardin, I need you to get to the bottom of this.

107
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,176
让她们得到应有的惩罚
Let the punishment fit the crime.

108
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,243
好的
Okay.

109
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,147
嘉莉，这周接下来的体育课你可以不上了
Carrie, you're excused from P.E. Class for the rest of the week.

110
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,556
去图书馆上自习吧
Just take study hall, okay? At the library.

111
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,618
是的，我们得打个电话给你妈妈
Yeah. We're going to have to call your mom.

112
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,420
什么？
What?

113
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,297
我们要打给你妈妈，嘉莉
We're going to have to call your mother, Carrie.

114
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,569
我知道自从国家不允许
I know she's had problems with us in the past,

115
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,232
她在家给你教书之后
ever since the state stopped her from

116
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,831
她和我们有些矛盾
homeschooling you anymore,

117
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,070
但是我们得叫她过来，好吗？
but we've got to bring her into this, okay?

118
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,133
不
Mmm-mmm. No.

119
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,736
亲爱的，我们只能这样
Sweetie, we have no choice.

120
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,338
- 必须把事情告诉你妈 - 不
- We have to tell your mom what happened. - No.

121
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,510
嘉莉
Carrie.

122
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,033
嘿，说你呢
Hey. Hey, you.

123
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,658
蒂娜，给我，快给我
Tina, give it to me. Give it here.

124
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,792
太精彩了，看这个视频
This is brilliant. Look at this video.

125
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,270
<i>堵起来！</i>
<i>Plug it up!</i>

126
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,602
她来大姨妈了，还弄到我手上
She got her period. On my hand.

127
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,738
真恶心
That is so disgusting.

128
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,873
还弄到苏的衣服上，真恶心
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt. It was so disgusting.

129
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,571
妈妈，很抱歉让你来学校
I'm sorry you had to come to school today, Mom.

130
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,686
进去吧，孩子
Let's go inside, little girl.

131
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,489
你得跟我进去
You need to come inside with me.

132
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,851
妈妈，为什么不告诉我？
Mama, why didn't you tell me?

133
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,624
我怕极了，我以为我会死
I was so scared, Mama. I thought I was going to die.

134
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,357
妈妈，他们嘲笑我，还朝我扔东西
Mama, they laughed at me and they threw things at me.

135
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,034
我们进去再说，嘉莉
We'll talk about this inside, Carrie.

136
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,097
不
No.

137
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,497
就在外面说
I want to talk about it right here.

138
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,203
我不想跟你进去
I don't want to go inside with you.

139
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,863
疯嘉莉，疯嘉莉！
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!

140
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,562
疯嘉莉，疯嘉莉！
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie.

141
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,510
主啊，帮助我的孩子
Oh, Lord, help my child.

142
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,109
她迷失了
She's lost.

143
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,279
妈妈，快停下
Mama, stop it.

144
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,677
妈妈！
Mama!

145
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,919
我不想让你心烦
I don't want to upset you.

146
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,459
你现在是女人了
So, you're a woman now.

147
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,365
上帝用亚当的肋骨造了夏娃
And God made Eve from the rib of Adam.

148
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,704
- 然后呢，嘉莉？说啊 - 不，妈妈
- And what, Carrie? Say it. - No, Mama.

149
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,436
- 说啊 - 告诉我
- Say it. - Talk to me.

150
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,805
- 快告诉我 - 然后夏娃软弱了
- Please just talk to me. - And Eve was weak.

151
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,708
我只想你告诉我
I just want you to talk to me.

152
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,249
首罪就是交媾的罪
And the first sin was the sin of intercourse.

153
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,783
首罪就是交媾的罪
And the first sin was the sin of intercourse.

154
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,444
你为什么不告诉我，妈妈？
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

155
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,419
上帝就对夏娃施了咒诅
And God visited Eve with a curse.

156
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,151
血的咒诅
And the curse was a curse of blood.

157
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,556
我不说了
I'm not going to say that.

158
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,754
不光别处没这么说，圣经上也没有
That's not even in the Bible. It doesn't say that anywhere.

159
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,821
主啊，帮助孩子认识自己行为的罪孽
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl see the sin of her days and ways.

160
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,957
让她知道如果保持圣洁
Show her if she had remained innocent,

161
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,092
夏娃那样血的咒诅就不会降临到她身上
the curse of blood would not have come upon her as it did on Eve.

162
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,660
我不是夏娃，妈妈，我没犯罪
I'm not Eve, Mama. I didn't sin.

163
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,204
你和其他女孩子一起洗澡
You showered with those other girls.

164
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,502
你脑子里充满了色欲
You had lust-filled thoughts.

165
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,544
每个人都得洗澡，妈妈，这是规定
Everyone has to shower, Mama. Everyone. That's just the rules.

166
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,636
你不一样，因为上帝能看到你
You must be different, because He can see you.

167
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,682
我不想与众不同，我想跟她们一样
I don't want to be different, Mama. I want to be like them.

168
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,216
k知道你所犯的罪
He can smell the sin on you.

169
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,013
k会惩罚你
And He will punish you.

170
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,577
我不会让惩罚降临到你身上的
I will not let that come down upon you. I will not.

171
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,020
主是仁慈的
Lord have mercy.

172
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,218
不，「耶和华本为善，k的慈爱存到永远」
No. "The Lord is good. His unfailing love endures forever,

173
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,751
「k的信实直到万代」
"and his faithfulness continues through all generations."

174
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,922
诗篇第100篇，第5节
Psalms 100, verse 5.

175
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,056
我不能让你待在那所学校了
I'm going to keep you away from that school.

176
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,623
- 不可以 - 我们要祷告，我们一起祷告
- You can't. - We'll pray. We'll pray together.

177
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,636
来挽救我们女人软弱邪恶，有罪的灵魂
To save our women-weak, wicked, sinning souls.

178
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,002
你没告诉我，她们都嘲笑我
You didn't tell me and they laughed.

179
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,199
我没犯罪，你犯了
I didn't sin, you sinned.

180
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,936
我没有
I did not.

181
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,441
我没犯罪
I did not sin.

182
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,181
进祈祷室去
Go to your closet.

183
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,551
不，妈妈
No, Mama.

184
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,153
进去祷告
Go to your closet and pray.

185
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,530
祷告
You pray.

186
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,027
不
No.

187
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,566
不！
No!

188
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,734
不！
No!

189
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,608
放开我！妈妈！快住手！
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!

190
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
- 进祈祷室求主赦免你的罪 - 不！
- Go to your closet and pray for forgiveness. - No!

191
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,644
- 去祷告 - 妈妈！
- You pray. - Mama! Help!

192
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,246
- 不，妈咪！ - 进去吧
- No, Mommy! - Come on.

193
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,913
别这样！求你了！
Please! Help!

194
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,254
快祷告，孩子，求主赦免
You pray, little girl. Pray for forgiveness.

195
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,730
妈咪，放我出去！
Mommy, let me go!

196
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,364
放我出去！
Let me out!

197
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,566
妈妈！
Mom!

198
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,132
上帝，去你的！
God, you suck!

199
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,589
帮帮我，帮帮我
Help me. Help me.

200
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,941
怎么了？
What?

201
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,808
- 对不起 - 怎么了？
- I'm sorry. - What?

202
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,988
你怎么了？
Hey. What's wrong?

203
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,193
今天真是糟透了，汤米
I really messed up today, Tommy.

204
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,024
什么，嘉莉的事？
What, that thing with Carrie?

205
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,433
你知道了？
You know about that?

206
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,861
是啊，大家都知道
Yeah, everyone knows about it,

207
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,669
但是你不用替克丽丝担责
but you're not responsible for what Chris does.

208
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,337
可是我也参与了
Yeah, but it was me, too.

209
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,744
你也朝嘉莉・怀特扔卫生巾了？
You threw tampons at Carrie White?

210
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,181
我有次把一个小孩的肋骨踢了
I kicked a kid in the ribs once.

211
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,418
当时他醉醺醺的
Yeah, while he was knocked out.

212
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,959
因为这个小孩
Because this kid,

213
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,791
六年级的时候经常把我揍得屁滚尿流
he used to beat the living shit out of me every day in sixth grade.

214
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,490
丹尼・帕特里克
Danny Patrick.

215
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,003
你向嘉莉道歉了吗？
Did you apologize to Carrie?

216
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,269
你向丹尼道歉了吗？
Did you apologize to Danny Patrick?

217
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,538
没有，但我们现在不是六年级了啊
No, but we're not in sixth grade anymore.

218
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,369
不要啦
Don't.

219
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,546
他就是个混蛋
He was a dick to me.

220
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,516
嘉莉对你做什么了吗？
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

221
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,855
女士们先生们，他就是这样丢掉驾照的
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why he lost his license.

222
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,827
那你怎么还在开车？
Then why are you still driving?

223
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,762
如果他们抓不到我，我就不需要驾照
I don't need a license if they can't catch me.

224
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,900
杰克的电邮，杰克的电邮！
Jackie's email, Jackie's email!

225
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,775
克丽丝，不，不！
Chris, no. No!

226
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,914
都滚到床上了，不如你们俩亲热一下？
Wow. Why don't you two kiss or something while you're at it?

227
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,382
宝贝儿
Oh, baby.

228
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,851
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

229
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,717
等等
Wait.

230
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,057
你觉得我们会不会被拘留？
Do you think we're going to get detention because of that?

231
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,200
- 那样可糟透了 - 不会的
- Because that would suck. - No.

232
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,502
他们应该感谢我们帮她度过了初潮
They should be thanking us for helping her through her first period.

233
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,564
我都给她卫生巾了
I got her a tampon. So what?

234
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,576
你只是想帮她，对吧？
You were only trying to help her, right?

235
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,202
我们得发上去
We should post it.

236
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,414
不行，拍到我了
No, I'm in it.

237
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,442
没人会看你的，蒂娜
No one's going to see you, Teenie.

238
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,549
怎么？你想怎么弄？
What?  What are you doing?

239
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,292

祷告做完了吗，孩子？
Did you finish your prayers, little girl?

251

是的，妈妈

255

好了，都站起来
All right, stand up.

256
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,354
站好队
Line up, please.

257
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,961
重要的一周就要到了，确切的说是一个月
You have a big week coming up. A big month, actually.

你们都将盛装打扮

比利・诺兰，你不认识

他不在这个学校
He doesn't go to this school.

266

Are you going to get him a boutonniere?

267
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,992

Or are you just going to pin a bloody tampon to his lapel?

268
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,221
我真不想听这些
I so don't need to hear this.

269
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,696
你哪都不许去
You're not going anywhere.

270
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,365
你呢，苏？
What about you, Sue?

但不是现在
Not now.

00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,143
你们昨天做了件可耻的事
You all did a shitty thing yesterday.

275
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,950
相当可耻

276
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,619
还有一个人无耻地发了视频
And one of you had the audacity to post a video.

277
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,382
有人拍了视频？
Somebody made a video of it?

278
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,949
胡说
This is bullshit.

279
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,223
好了，拜哈根森小姐所赐，你们得接受跑步惩罚
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen, you're all running suicides.

280
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,594
我不干
I'm not doing it.

281
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,360
那是你的事
That's up to you.

282
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,663
跑不跑是你们的事，但是谁不跑就会被禁学
That's up to all of you, but anyone who stops running is suspended.

283
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,707
要是被禁学了，就不能参加毕业舞会
And if you're suspended, you're not going to prom.

284
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,841
你们跑的时候，我希望你们认真想想
While you're running, I'd like for you to think long and hard

285
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,847
嘉莉・怀特在这之后会怎么样
about what it would be like to be Carrie White.

286
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,718
我没事的，妈妈
I'll be okay, Mama.

287
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,125
我会早点下班来接你放学
I'm going to leave work early today and pick you up after school.

288
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,711
她不能这么对我
She can't do this to me.

289
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,876
算了吧，克丽丝，快结束了
Just let it go, Chris. We're almost done.

290
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,419
这周每天都这样？
Then every day this week?

291
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,455
都是因为嘉莉・怀特？
All because of Carrie White?

292
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,154
我绝对不干
Like hell I will.

293
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,954
别停，哈根森
Keep moving, Hargensen.

294
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,052
继续跑，不然就不能参加舞会
Keep running or you're not going to prom.

295
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,426
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

296
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,325
这是虐待儿童
This is child abuse.

297
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,389
你说什么？
What did you say to me?

298
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,566
我他妈不会再跑哪怕一英尺
I'm not going to run another goddamn inch

299
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,230
就因为嘉莉・怀特来月经了
because Carrie White got her period

300
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,298
却还傻乎乎的不知道
and was too stupid to know what it was.

301
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,435
- 什么？ - 你被禁学了
- What? - You're suspended.

302
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,605
舞会没你的份了，我的班级也没有你了
You're out of prom and you're out of my class. Now.

303
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,148
- 不行 - 不行？
- No. - No?

304
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,980
你说了不算，她不能这样对我们
You can't decide that. She can't do this to us.

305
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,748
再见，克丽丝，其他同学继续
Goodbye, Chris. The rest of you, keep at it.

306
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,083
有人会脱水而死的
Someone could die of dehydration.

307
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,147
蒂娜，你不是有心脏病吗？
Tina, you have a heart condition, right?

308
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,626
如果我们团结一致，她不会让我们都禁学的
If we all stick together, they're not going to suspend all of us.

309
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,029
她不能让我们都不参加舞会，那样就没舞会了
They're not going to keep us all from prom. There would be no prom.

310
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,225
尼琪，莉琪？
Nik, Lizzy?

311
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,962
继续，姑娘们
Let's go, ladies!

312
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,828
海瑟尔？
Heather?

313
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,299
真是扯淡！我们没做错事
This is bullshit! We didn't do anything wrong.

314
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,003
好了，我们继续
All right, let's go.

315
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,070
苏？你支持我的，对吧？
Right, Sue? You're with me on this, right?

316
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,440
来吧
Come on.

317
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,940
苏
Sue.

318
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,042
继续
Come on.

319
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,590
继续，姑娘们
Keep going, ladies.

320
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,257
这事没完
This isn't over.

321
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,628
这事绝对没完
This isn't over by a long shot.

322
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,773
那是嘉莉・怀特
That's Carrie White.

323
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,390

Um, you know... Sorry.

326
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,725
我只是想说，你可以全屏看的
I was just going to say, you can make it full-screen. Watch.

327
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,508
好了，下一个是谁？
All right, who's next?

328
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,017
嘉莉，最喜欢的诗，有吗？
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem. Did you bring one?

329
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,610
有
Yeah.

330
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,748
那你到前面来
Why don't you come to the front of the class

331
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,121
给大家分享一下？
and share it with us all?

332
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,811
「来到这人迹罕至之处找寻宁静」
"This unfrequented place to find some ease

333
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,107
「肉体平静，心灵却波澜不惊」
"Ease to the body some, none to the mind

「为何我的出生是天国的预言」
"O wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold

336
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,257
「两次预言的天使最终显现」
"Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight

337
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,927
「我的双亲在火焰中」
"Of both my Parents all in flames...

「缓缓升起」
"...ascended."

339
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,107
好了，有点…
Okay, uh, that was, uh...

340
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,514
让人不舒服
...disturbing.

341
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,608
这一整年在课堂上就刚才说得最多
That is the most you've said in class all year.

342
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,913
你还有什么要分享的吗？
Is there anything else you'd like to share

343
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,681
或者你吓唬我们吓够了吗？
or are you done scaring us for the day?

344
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,416
真恶心
Asshole.

345
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,888
抱歉，罗斯，你刚说什么？
Excuse me, Mr. Ross. Did you say something?

346
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,983
我说「真不错」
I said, "Awesome."

347
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,196
我觉得嘉莉念的诗很不错
I just thought what Carrie read was awesome.

348
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,366
你不觉得吗，厄尔曼先生？
Didn't you, Mr. Ulmann?

349
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,438
好吧，下一个是谁？
All right, who's next? Uh...

350
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,406
尼琪
Nicki.

351
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,965
我是想叫，莉琪
I mean, Lizzy.

352
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,379
有人在吗？
Is anyone working?

353
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,889
打扰了
Excuse me.

354
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,820
有人在吗？
Is anybody working?

355
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,640
玛格丽特
Oh, Margaret.

356
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,773
很抱歉打扰你，我不知道雨果和格丽娅…
I'm sorry to disturb you. I don't know where Hugo and Gloria...

357
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,609
需要帮忙吗，斯奈尔？
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?

358
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,012
我来取衣服
Yes, I'm picking up.

359
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,250
玛格丽特，对于学校发生的事
Margaret, I want to say how sorry I am

360
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,384
我想说声对不起
about what happened at the school.

361
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,658
苏的所作所为没有借口，但她是个好孩子
There's no excuse for what Sue did, but she's a good girl.

362
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,098
那些女孩都是好孩子吗？
Are any of those girls good?

363
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,805
这真是太完美了，玛格丽特
Oh, that is beautiful work, Margaret.

364
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,408
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,640
领口这一圈的做工真好
I love what you've done with the neckline.

366
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,685
几乎看不到缝线
And the stitches. You can barely see them.

367
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,950
没几个人能缝这么好
So few people can sew like this anymore.

368
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,151
我自己永远都做不到这么好
I could never do anything like this myself.

369
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,194
苏穿上肯定很漂亮
Sue's going to look beautiful.

370
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,559
我太为她兴奋了
I am so excited for her.

371
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,860
我还记得我的毕业舞会
I remember my prom.

372
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,800
反正她肯定喜欢
Anyway, she's going to love it.

373
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,370
那是渎神的活动，斯奈尔
These are Godless times, Mrs. Snell.

374
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,377
体育老师让克丽丝跑得精疲力尽
This gym teacher was running Chrissie

375
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,937
还出言不逊
into the ground and used profanity.

376
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,846
她肯定用了「可耻」这个词
I believe the term "shitty" was used.

377
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,544
她不能这么做，这是滥用职权
She can't do that.It's abuse of power.

378
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,417
你说得对，爸爸，她说了那个词
You're right, Daddy. That's what she said.

379
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,888
「可耻」，说话真的很难听
"Shitty." She's really abusive.

380
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,485
戴佳汀是在为今天的事教训她们
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded for what happened in class today.

381
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,654
你知道之前
But you know we've had a lot of problems

382
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,822
你女儿也是问题多多
with your daughter in the past.

383
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,390
这次是对同学，嘉莉・怀特
And now, with what she did to her classmate, Carrie White.

384
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,629
那个女孩经历了…
The girl was having her...

385
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,194
你女儿和她的朋友们…
What your daughter and her posse...

386
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,706
我不想听你们的片面之词
I'm not going to sit here and listen to half-truths.

387
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,867
我了解我女儿，她说她没做
I know my daughter. She said she didn't do it.

388
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,877
我希望能恢复她参加舞会的权利
I want her prom privileges restored.

389
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,676
你不能证明她做了错事，对吧？
You can't prove she did anything, can you?

390
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,451
我知道有个当时事件的视频
I believe that there is a video of the incident.

391
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,681
而且我想是你女儿拍的
And I think your daughter is the one who took it.

392
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,351
这个视频就够让参与的人受到严厉惩罚
I think a video like that would probably be pretty damning to anyone in it

393
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,087
包括拍摄者
and to the person who made it.

394
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,924
对吧，哈根森先生？
Don't you, Mr. Hargensen?

395
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,363
我不清楚，我就是个体育老师
I don't know. I'm just a gym teacher,

396
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,391
但好像这种视频会影响到大学录取
but it seems like a video like that would probably affect college admissions,

397
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,736
还可能遭来起诉，以及各种负面宣传
possibly a lawsuit, tons of bad publicity.

398
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,435
我觉得「今日秀」肯定会拿这视频开涮
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i> would do with a video like that.

399
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,502
我们应该查查她的手机，如果没有视频
I think we should just look at her phone and if it's not there,

400
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,380
那我会诚挚地道歉，并恢复她舞会的权利
I owe you a huge apology and she should be allowed to go to prom.

401
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,774
克丽丝
Chris.

402
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,323
克丽丝
Chris.

403
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,124
爸爸，我不会给他们看手机的
Daddy,I'm not going to give them my phone.

404
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,684
里面有个人信息
I have personal things on here.

405
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,924
这样不是侵犯个人隐私吗？
Isn't that invasion of privacy or something?

406
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,033
克丽丝，如果你想参加舞会
Chrissie, if you want to go to prom,

407
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,695
就把手机给他们看看，这事就结束了
just give them the damn phone and we can be done with this.

408
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,897
我还赶着回去工作呢
I have to get back to work.

409
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,064
爸
Dad.

410
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,904
该死的，给他们看啊，克丽丝
God damn it, just give them your phone, Chris.

411
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,238
不
No.

412
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,520
好了，我正式无缘毕业舞会了
So, I'm officially out of the prom.

413
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,894
我打赌混蛋莫顿迟早会丢工作
I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though.

414
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,463
我爸爸会起诉他
My dad is suing him.

415
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,204
苏，当时为什么不站我这边？
Jesus, Sue, why didn't you stand up for me?

416
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,807
我们本可以掌握主动的
We could have had them by the balls.

417
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,402
我们对嘉莉做了错事，罪有应得
We deserved it for what we did to Carrie White.

418
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,239
我觉得我活该
I thought I deserved it.

419
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,575
戴佳汀说得对，我们做了非常可耻的事
Desjardin was right. We did a shitty thing for no reason.

420
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,643
扯淡！
Bullshit!

421
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,712
那个嘉莉到处宣称除了她和她妈
That Carrie goes around saying that everyone but her and her mother

422
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,224
所有人都要下地狱，你还袒护她？疯了吧！
are going to hell and you stuck up for her? Come on!

423
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,659
你有时候真是蠢，克丽丝
You can be such a pig sometimes, Chris.

424
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,059
嘉莉・怀特惹到你了吗？
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

425
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,826
她从六年级开始就低声下气，苏
She's been begging for it since the sixth grade, Sue.

426
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,332
我要走了
I got to go.

427
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,066
我好像记得你和我们其他人一起
I seem to remember you were in there

428
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,003
也朝她扔了那玩意
throwing shit with the rest of us.

429
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,473
苏当时怎么叫她来着？
What was it that she was calling her?

430
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,476
- 「怪胎」？ - 我打住了
- "Freak"? - I stopped.

431
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,879
你打住了？
Oh, you stopped?

432
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,846
- 对 - 那为什么还继续跑步？
- Yeah. - Why did you keep running?

433
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,282
- 你怎么还继续跑步，苏？ - 住口，克丽丝！
- Why did you keep running, Sue? - Stop it, Chris!

434
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,878
你跑啊跑，苏，小苏苏
You kept running, Sue, little Suze,

435
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,618
因为你一直梦想着高三
because you've been dreaming about senior year

436
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,320
完美的男友，还有完美的舞会
and the perfect boyfriend and the perfect prom

437
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,986
你那该死的生活
your whole goddamned life.

438
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,757
你都订好了酒店房间
You already booked the hotel,

439
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,696
练习了叫床的声音
already practiced the sounds you're going to make

440
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,362
好在和汤米做爱的时候用
when you and Tommy make love.

441
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,104
这就是为什么你会改变想法
That's why you had this bullshit change of heart.

442
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,540
你一点都不在乎嘉莉・怀特
You don't give a shit about Carrie White.

443
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,877
大家都知道的
And everybody knows it.

444
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,344
好吧，我们回见，苏
Okay. I'll see you around, Sue.

445
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,928
嘉莉？
Carrie?

446
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,720
嘉莉？
Carrie?

447
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,576
我不会让任何人伤害你
I'm not going to let anyone hurt you, little girl.

448
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,751
你和我在一起没事的
You're safe here with me.

449
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,631
接到了
Got it.

450
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,212
- 你好吗？ - 很好
- How are you doing? - Good.

451
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,513
- 很好？ - 嗯
- Good? - Yeah.

452
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,722
- 怎么了？ - 我想让你带嘉莉参加舞会
- What's up? - I want you to take Carrie White to prom.

453
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,288
真逗啊，过来
Good one, babe. Come on.

454
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,259
你说真的？
Are you serious?

455
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,927
我想弥补我的过失
I'm just trying to fix what I did.

456
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,597
我知道，可是这…
Yeah.I get that, but this is...

457
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,730
苏，你疯了吧
Sue, it's nuts.

458
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,104
对，我是疯了
Okay, so it's nuts.

459
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,611
可是我做了错事，我得弥补
But after what we did to her, I have to do something.

460
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,578
我得做一些有意义的事
I have to do something that counts.

461
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,482
你怎么知道她会同意呢？
What even makes you think that she would say yes to me?

462
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,575
她会同意的
She'd say yes.

463
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,244
我们几乎没说过话
We've barely even spoken.

464
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,982
你课堂上帮她解围的时候，我看到她看你的眼神
I saw how she looked at you in class when you rescued her.

465
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,149
哪个女孩不想去毕业舞会呢？
What girl doesn't want to go to prom?

466
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,493
哪个女孩不想拥有奇妙之夜呢？
What girl doesn't want one magical night?

467
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,559
也许我可以为她放弃
Maybe I can give that up for her.

468
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,157
不，宝贝，我想和你共度奇妙之夜
No. Babe, I want you to have that magic night.

469
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,966
我不想带嘉莉・怀特去毕业舞会
I don't want to go to prom with Carrie White.

470
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,471
我要和你去
I want to go to prom with you.

471
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,504
我不去
I can't go.

472
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,831
嘉莉
Hey, Carrie.

473
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,124
我在图书馆到处找你
I was looking for you at the library

474
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,396
他们说你就在那儿
because that's where they said you were.

475
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,803
可是你不在那，我就想你可能会在这
But, uh, you weren't there, so I figured maybe you were here.

476
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,179
《心灵遥感：打开心门》
<i>"Telekinesis: Unlocking the Mind."</i>

477
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,376
不，不，这是催眠之类的吗？
No, no.Is that about, uh, hypnosis?

478
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,451
我和我朋友，我们试过
Because me and my friends, we tried that.

479
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,784
我们真的对狗做了催眠
We actually hypnotized my boy's dog.

480
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,385
不管怎样…
Anyway, um...

481
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,993
你还好吗？
How are you doing?

482
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,494
还行
I'm okay.

483
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,290
那就好
Cool.

484
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,797
那你知不知道…下周就是毕业舞会了？
So you know how, um, prom is next week?

485
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,070
知道吗？
You know?

486
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,476
我在想
Um, I was wondering,

487
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,309
要是还没有人约你的话，你可以跟我去
if you don't have a date already, maybe you want to go with me.

488
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,211
什么？
What?

489
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,654
下周的舞会啊
The prom. Next week.

490
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:08,987
嘉莉
Carrie.

491
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,307
- 嘉莉 - 别过来！
- Carrie. - Stop!

492
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,213
求你别再开我玩笑了
Please, just stop trying to trick me.

493
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,820
不，我没开你玩笑，我没有
No, I'm not trying to trick you. I'm not tricking you.

494
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,286
你不是和苏・斯奈尔一起吗？
Aren't you with Sue Snell?

495
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,258
对，我是和她一起，但她不想去
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell, but she doesn't want to go.

496
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:40,991
对不起
I'm sorry.

497
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,844
那些女孩又欺负你了？
Did one of the girls try something again?

498
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,842
没有
No.

499
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,558
有人邀请我去舞会
I got invited to prom.

500
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,556
真的吗？
Really?

501
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,531
真是太好了
That's great news.

502
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,536
和谁？
With who?

503
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,168
汤米・罗斯
It's Tommy Ross.

504
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,776
汤米・罗斯？
Wow. Tommy Ross?

505
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,449
那可真是太美妙了
He is pretty dreamy, huh?

506
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,010
嗯
Yeah.

507
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,748
我知道他和谁作伴
I know who he goes around with.

508
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,920
他们只是想再耍我一次
They're just going to trick me again.

509
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,128
对吗？
Right?

510
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,234
也许他是真心的
Maybe he really meant it.

511
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,128
不
No.

512
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,272
他肯定是真心的
Yes, of course he did.

513
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,537
为什么
Why?

514
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,715
他为什么想和我一起去？
Why would he want to go with me?

515
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,611
来
Come here.

516
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,954
你知道我看到什么了？
Do you know what I see?

517
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,761
我看到一个年轻美丽的女人
I see a beautiful young woman.

518
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,966
再化一点妆
Maybe wear a little make-up.

519
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,935
脸颊上来一点
Pinch your cheeks a little bit,

520
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,902
弄点颜色
put some color in there.

521
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,008
烫个卷发
Curl your hair.

522
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,102
站直了
Stand up straight.

523
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,338
就棒极了
There you go.

524
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,375
拜托，苏
<i>Come on, Sue.</i>

525
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,512
你跟克丽丝是好朋友，要是你们两个…
You and Chris are best friends. If you two...

526
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:48,854
你们三个谋划耍一个孤独，毫无防备的的女孩…
If you three are planning on playing a joke on a Ionely, defenseless girl...

527
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,359
这和克丽丝没关系
This has nothing to do with Chris.

528
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,952
你也是，戴佳汀女士，对我来说…
Or you, Miss Desjardin. And for me...

529
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,226
恕我冒昧，戴佳汀女士，这是我和苏之间的事
Listen, with due respect, Miss Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.

530
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,736
这就是一件私事
It's kind of like a private thing.

531
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,669
这应该不算什么大事吧？
And what is the big deal anyway?

532
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,968
就是一个晚上，对吧？
It's just for one night, right?

533
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,867
著名运动员，像蒂姆・迪伯
Famous athletes like Tim Tebow,

534
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,381
他总是带些孩子去舞会，但大家都喜欢他
he takes kids to prom all the time and everyone loves him for it.

535
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,208
真的吗？
Really?

536
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,774
你还不算是著名运动员
You're hardly a famous athlete.

537
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,286
这对她来说意义重大
This is a really big deal for her.

538
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,582
听着，已经没事了
Listen. It doesn't matter.

539
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,590
她拒绝了
She said no.

540
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,592
- 那你得再试一次 - 不行
- So you'll try again. - Don't.

541
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,888
- 好吧 - 不行
- Okay. - It's not okay.

542
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,319
汤米
Tommy,

543
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,289
当嘉莉挽着你的手出现在舞会的时候
when you show up to prom with Carrie White on your arm,

544
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,427
你不觉得你看起来会有那么一点点滑稽吗？
don't you think you're going to look the tiniest bit ridiculous?

545
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,802
我们不关心这个，对吧？
We don't care how we look. Do we?

546
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,297
不
No.

547
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,137
走吧
Come on.

548
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,727
你来这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

549
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,325
你不让我进去坐坐？
Aren't you going to ask me in?

550
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,427
你想干嘛？你不能来这儿
What do you want? You can't be here.

551
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,200
这么直接啊？就想说说舞会
Right to the point, huh? Cool. About the prom.

552
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,303
你貌似不太想搭理我
You kind of left me hanging.

553
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,866
我跟你说了
I already told you.

554
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,435
我知道，但我希望你能改变心意
I know, but I was hoping that you'd change your mind.

555
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,182
女孩子不总是变来变去的嘛
Girls change their mind all the time.

556
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,347
为什么要这样？
Why are you doing this?

557
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,786
因为我想
Because I want to.

558
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,116
你得走了
You need to leave.

559
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,028
你不同意我就不走
I'm not leaving until you say yes.

560
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,888
这对你有那么重要吗？
Why is this so important to you?

561
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,161
因为我们肯定会玩得很愉快
Because I think that we would have a good time.

562
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:46,571
因为我觉得你在课上读得很好
And because I think that what you read in class was cool.

563
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,310
我在图书馆找过这本书
I looked up that book in the library myself.

564
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,650
就是那个摧毁宫殿的家伙，参孙，对吧？
That's the guy who brought the temple down. Samson, right?

565
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,246
嗯
Yes.

566
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,591
好吧，我会去的
Yes, okay, I'll go.

567
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,424
我得10点半前回家
I have to be back by <i>10:30.</i>

568
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,564
没问题
Sure, okay. Um...

569
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,802
我7点过来接你？
I'll pick you up here at <i>7:00</i>?

570
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,327
好
Okay.

571
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,962
不可思议，汤米・罗斯和嘉莉・怀特
Crazy, right? Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

572
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,356
你去哪了？我担心死了，快进去
Where have you been? I was worried sick. Come on. Come inside.

573
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,262
- 抱歉我晚归了，妈妈 - 赶紧进去
- I'm sorry I'm late, Mama. - Just get inside.

574
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,530
晚饭凉了，我得去热一热
Your supper's cold. I'm going to have to heat it up.

575
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,040
我不知道…
I didn't know...

576
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,711
太不得体了
You're immodest.

577
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,312
我不敢想你去哪了
I didn't know where you were. I didn't know.

578
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,353
不，妈妈，我就是坐巴士去市中买了布料做裙子
No, Mama. I took a bus to Main Street and I bought cloth for a dress.

579
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,754
除了去学校和回家，你哪都不许去
You are not to go anywhere but to school and back. You know that.

580
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,621
妈妈，先别说这个了，有人邀请我去舞会
Mama, before you say anything else, I've been asked to prom.

581
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,791
妈妈，有人邀请我参加舞会
Mama, I've been asked to prom.

582
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,496
天啊，为什么？
Oh, God, why?

583
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,199
在下周六，他是个很好的男孩
It's next Saturday and he's a very nice boy.

584
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,072
他会事先来见你一面，还答应10点半前送我回家
And he'll come and meet you before and he promised to have me home by <i>10:30.</i>

585
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,711
- 不，不，不 - 我已经答应了
- No, no, no. - I already accepted.

586
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,076
我知道这会吓到你
I know this scares you.

587
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,575
也吓到我了
It scares me, too.

588
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,748
其他同学
The other kids,

589
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,882
他们觉得我是怪人
they think I'm weird.

590
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,085
但是我不想这样
But I don't want to be.

591
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,421
我想成为一个完整的人
I have to try to be a whole person.

592
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,894
现在还来得及
Before it's too late.

593
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,206
他会伤害你的
He'll hurt you.

594
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,936
不，妈妈
No, Mama.

595
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,379
不，妈妈，是有很多坏人，但汤米不是
No, Mama, there are bad people, but not Tommy.

596
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,679
他很好，你会喜欢他的，他是个好男孩
He's good. You'll like him. He's a very nice boy.

597
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,015
男孩，男孩，流血之后
Boys, boys. After the blood,

598
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,022
男孩就像狗那样嗅探，垂涎
comes the boys sniffing, slobbering like dogs.

599
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,387
别说了，妈妈
Stop it, Mama.

600
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,188
他会抓挠你，直到他找到血味的源头
He's going to paw at you until he finds where that blood smell comes from.

601
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,627
他会上了你，嘉莉，在荒郊野外的车里
He's going to take you, Carrie, in his car out to the wilderness,

602
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,858
周围很寒冷，小旅馆很冷，威士忌也很冷*
out where it's cold and the roadhouses are and the whiskey.

603
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,160
别说胡话了
Stop being so crazy.

604
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,427
你跟他说你不去了
You tell that boy you're not going.

605
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,559
不
No.

606
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,570
我们要搬走，我们会一直搬家
We'll move from here. We're never going to stop moving.

607
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,434
你马上去祈祷室做祷告
You're going to go to your closet and you're going to pray.

608
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,804
你要进去求上帝赦免你
You're going to get in there and you're going to pray for forgiveness.

609
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,274
不，再也不去了，妈妈！
No, never again, Mama!

610
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,958
妈妈，站起来
Mama, stand up.

611
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,132
妈妈，站起来！
Mama, stand up!

612
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,035
妈妈，我会去的
Mama, I'm going.

613
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,372
- 女巫 - 我不是女巫，妈妈
- Witch. - I'm not a witch, Mama.

614
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,673
没有女巫
There are no witches.

615
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,808
魔鬼附上了她，就像之前那样
The devil's got her now. Like he did before.

616
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,853
不是魔鬼，妈妈，就是有些人像我一样
It's not the devil, Mama. There are other people out there like me

617
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,944
他们也能做这些事
who can do what I can do.

618
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,889
可怜的孩子，你都不知道这是他在做工吗？
You poor child. Don't you know he's working through you?

619
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,153
妈妈，这是遗传，从奶奶那里遗传的
Mama, it's inherited. It was passed down from Grandma

620
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,489
跳过了你
and it skipped you.

621
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,928
你知道的，也许是爸爸那里来的
You know that. Maybe it came from Daddy.

622
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,432
他给了我一个肿瘤，你就是那肿瘤
He gave me a cancer. I thought you were cancer.

623
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,830
- 这太荒唐了，别说了 - 她不再属于我了
- That's awful. Don't say that. - She's lost to me.

624
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,338
你自己祷告吧，妈妈，我还是会去的
Pray all you want, Mama, but I'm going.

625
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,411
什么都不能阻止我
And nothing's going to stop me.

626
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,715
我不想再说这件事了
And I don't want to talk about it anymore.

627
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,096
我们这是干嘛？
What are we doing?

628
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,365
这和嘉莉・怀特有关系吗？
What does this have to do with Carrie White?

629
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,771
宝贝，你想让我们给她点教训
Baby, you said you wanted us to do something about her.

630
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,882
这是只猪！
It's a piggy!

631
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,056
过来，小猪猪
Here, piggy, piggy.

632
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,717
过来，小猪猪
Here, piggy, piggy.

633
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,124
这里臭死了
It smells like shit in here.

634
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:42,156
克丽丝，挑一只最像她的
Chris, pick one. Pick one that looks like her.

635
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,595
给猪的猪血
Pig's blood for a pig.

636
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,504
那只
That one.

637
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,769
上
Go on.

638
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,283
用力抡一记，懂吗？
One quick swing, all right?

639
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,782
知道了
I got this.

640
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,520
别担心，小猪猪
Don't worry, little piggy,

641
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,788
杰克叔叔会敲得很准的
Uncle Jack is going to bash your head right in.

642
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,755
你都不会感觉到…
You're not going to feel one...

643
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,695
闭嘴！赶紧的
Shut up! Do it already. Jesus.

644
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,265
我做不到
I can't.

645
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,641
我的天，你们真是一群娘炮
God, you guys are such goddamn pussies.

646
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,867
闭嘴！
Shut up!

647
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,643
对不起，比利
I'm sorry, Billy.

648
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,497
来吧，这个你来
Come on, you got this.

649
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,741
就是快速划一刀…
All right, it's just one quick slice and...

650
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,339
我的天
Oh, my God.

651
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,241
干得好，宝贝
Good job, baby.

652
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,004
苏，你还好吗？
Sue. Hey, are you okay?

653
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,884
搞定
There we go.

654
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,761
比利，快点
Billy. Hurry up.

655
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,734
我的天
Oh, my God.

656
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,965
时机一到，你就拉绳子，好吧？
When the time comes, I'll let you pull the rope, okay?

657
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,336
我就这么想的
Oh, I plan on it.

658
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,209
你们今天见到苏了吗？
Did you guys see Sue today?

659
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,110
她脸色不太好
She looked awful.

660
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,509
克丽丝没来
I know Chris isn't coming.

661
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,742
她被禁学了
She's suspended.

662
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,043
你们觉得他会砸场子吗？
Do you think she'll crash?

663
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,346
你永远不知道克丽丝的想法，是吧？
You never know with Chris, right?

664
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,453
我觉得我会弄个余兴派对
So, I think I'm going to have the after-party.

665
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,187
不行
No.

666
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,630
- 怎么样？ - 下面？
- What do you think? - Down?

667
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,790
不
No.

668
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,259
嗯
Yeah.

669
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,403
你要给我别上吗，妈妈？
Will you pin it on me, Mama?

670
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,036
红色
Red.

671
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,013
我就知道是红的
I might have known it would be red.

672
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,312
这是粉色
It's pink.

673
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,889
我能看到你下流的枕头，大家都看得见
I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.

674
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,455
乳房，妈妈
Breasts, Mama.

675
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,395
乳房，你和所有女人都有
Breasts. You have them and every woman has them.

676
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,600
把裙子脱了吧，嘉莉
Take off that dress, Carrie.

677
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,528
不
No.

678
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,402
脱下来，我们把它烧了，然后祈求赦免
Take it off and we'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.

679
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,909
妈妈，这很端庄
Mama, it's modest.

680
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,842
打给那个男孩说你不去了
Call that boy and tell him you're not going.

681
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,381
跟他说你生病了
You just tell him you're sick.

682
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,746
我不想你受伤害
I don't want you to get hurt.

683
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,012
你会为我高兴的
Or you could just be happy for me.

684
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,222
妈妈，别打了
Mama, stop hurting yourself.

685
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,687
你知道这样没用的
You know it's not going to make me stay.

686
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,099
他不会来了，这是个玩笑
He's not coming. It's a trick.

687
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,464
一如既往
Same as always.

688
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,369
他会来的
He's going to come.

689
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,809
他们会嘲笑你的
They're going to laugh at you.

690
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,141
他们都会嘲笑你的
They're all going to laugh at you.

691
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,239
妈妈，别说了
Mama, stop it.

692
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,079
我已经够紧张了
I'm nervous enough as it is.

693
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,179
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

694
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,497
看到了吗，妈妈？
You see, Mama?

695
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,998
一切都没事的
You see, it's all going to be okay.

696
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,695
忏悔吧，现在还来得及
Oh, repent. It's not too late.

697
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,068
妈妈，别扫兴了，我会早点回家的
Mama, don't ruin this for me. I'll be home early.

698
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,607
我得告诉那个男孩真相
I'm going to have to tell that boy the truth

699
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,074
你爸夺去了我，你从罪中出生
that your father took me and you were born of sin.

700
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,667
- 你别说了，妈妈 - 从那罪中…
- You'll say nothing, Mama. - And from that sin...

701
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,775
那罪中又会生罪
From that sin was born another.

702
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,147
最恶的罪
The worst sin.

703
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,913
附在你身上的男巫或者女巫
"A man or a woman who is a witch

704
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,454
都要受死
"among you is to be put to death.

705
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,682
你要用石头击打他们
"You are to stone them."

706
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,286
我警告你，妈妈
I'm warning you, Mama.

707
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,622
魔鬼之手
The devil's hand.

708
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,085
请别这样
Please don't do this.

709
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,391
会有审判的，嘉莉
There will be a judgment, Carrie.

710
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,062
就像耶洗别从塔上落下，你也…
As Jezebel fell from the tower, you too...

711
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,611
妈妈，我走之前你不能说话了
Mama, you're not going to say another word until I'm gone.

712
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,861
妈咪，对不起
Mommy, I'm sorry.

713
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,475
我爱你
I love you.

714
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,170
我会早点回家
I'll be home early.

715
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,245
嗨
Hi.

716
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,017
嗨
Hi.

717
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,220
好看吗？
Do I look okay?

718
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,795
美极了
You look beautiful.

719
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,820
汤米，能等一会吗？
Tommy, can we wait a minute?

720
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,816
当然，等多久都行
Yeah, sure, we can wait as long as you want.

721
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:09,998
你害怕了？
Are you scared?

722
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,228
他们没那么讨厌
They're not that bad.

723
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,332
而且，我需要你
Besides, I need you in there.

724
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,275
一个人跳一晚上多傻啊
Dancing by myself all night, I'd look awful silly.

725
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,306
来，我来整一整
Here, let me fix this.

726
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,183
我觉得这个应该戴在手腕上
I think this is supposed to go on your wrist.

727
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:34,947
像这样
There.

728
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,819
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

729
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,123
你帅呆了，罗斯
God, you look handsome, Ross.

730
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,290
道森！
Dawson!

731
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,428
别担心，要是他俩同归于尽了，我跟你跳
Don't worry. If they kill each other, I'll dance with you.

732
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,438
嘉莉，这是我好兄弟，乔治・道森
Carrie, this is my best buddy, George Dawson.

733
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,475
这是他女友，艾丽卡，她老去多佛
And this is his girlfriend, Erika. She goes to Dover.

734
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,531
你好
Hi.

735
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,610
我带你们就坐
Come on, I'll show you the table.

736
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,651
我喜欢这裙子，哪买的？
I love your dress. Where did you get it?

737
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,049
自己做的
I made it.

738
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,587
不会吧，真的？
No kidding. Really?

739
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,246
- 嗯 - 真是太神奇了
- Yeah. - That's amazing.

740
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,130
想跳舞吗？
Do you want to dance?

741
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,505
要是想，我们可以等一首慢歌
Or, if you want, we could wait for a slower song.

742
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,172
嗯
Yeah.

743
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,616
我去去就回
I'll be back.

744
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,389
戴老师
Miss Desjardin.

745
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,229
你看起来美极了
You look beautiful.

746
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,165
你们两位女士慢聊
I'll let you two ladies talk.

747
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,498
你们要来点软饮吗？
Uh, do you want some punch?

748
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,538
我听说格雷格和哈利偷偷掺了烈酒
I heard Greg and Harry spiked it.

749
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,765
真的？
Really?

750
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,299
没有啦，开玩笑的
No, I'm just kidding.

751
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,307
感觉还好吧？
You're doing okay?

752
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,147
- 还好 - 还好？
- Yeah. - Yeah?

753
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:58,611
汤米：一切都好，她很棒，想你

754
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,796
问你个事
Listen.

755
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,138
你真的要这么早回家吗？
Do you really have to be home so early?

756
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,745
我发过誓了
I promised.

757
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,715
对，我知道
Yeah, I know. I understand.

758
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,515
可是，我们一帮人还想结束后去卡瓦利
But, um, a bunch of people, we're going to the Cavalier after.

759
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,681
- 没关系 - 什么没关系？
- That's okay. - What is?

760
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,981
我知道你想和你朋友出去
I know you want to hang out with your friends, and that's...

761
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,049
不
No.

762
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,523
慢歌来了
It's a slow song.

763
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,625
不
No.

764
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,160
来吧
Yeah. Come on.

765
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,296
不，汤米，我从没跳过舞
No, Tommy. I've never danced before.

766
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,897
- 没事的 - 不，我不行，我不会跳
- It's okay. - No, I can't. I can't do it.

767
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,773
来参加舞会总不能一支舞都不跳吧
You can't go to prom and not have at least one dance.

768
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:42,868
我不会
I can't.

769
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:46,437
嘉莉・怀特，你愿意跟我跳一支舞吗？
Carrie White, will you have this dance with me?

770
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,681
来吧
Come on.

771
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,951
来
Come on.

772
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,066
很简单的，握住我这只手，像这样
It's so easy. Take this hand in my hand. Like this, see?

773
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,971
另一只手搭在我肩上
You're going to put this hand on my shoulder.

774
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,511
我把手放在你臀部
And I put my hand on your hip.

775
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,977
左右摇摆
Then we sway.

776
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,146
看，很简单吧
See, it's easy.

777
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,915
没什么可担心的
You've got nothing to worry about.

778
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,715
做得很好，你学得很快
And you're good, you're a good learner.

779
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,555
然后，如果想来点花样
And then, if you want to get fancy with it,

780
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,650
我们可以试试「与星共舞」
we can do the <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

781
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,158
- 来吧 - 不
- Yeah. - No.

782
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,887
准备好了？看
Yeah. Ready? Look.

783
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,832
回到原位
To the first one.

784
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,568
很有意思吧？
This is fun, right?

785
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,028
汤米，我怎么在这？
Tommy, why am I here?

786
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,122
因为我邀请你了
Because I invited you.

787
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,393
为什么？
But why?

788
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,960
嘉莉，我们在这
Carrie, we're here.

789
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:18,873
我们在舞会上，跟你在一起很快乐
We're at prom. I'm having such a great time with you.

790
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,236
是吗？
You are?

791
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:23,400
是的
Yeah.

792
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,879
我希望你跟我一起也很快乐
And I hope that you're having a good time with me.

793
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:29,408
嗯
Yeah.

794
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,048
那我们就跳久一点
So, what do you say we dance a little longer,

795
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:41,225
看看哪对傻瓜加冕了国王和王后
and then we see which poor fool they crown King and Queen,

796
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,891
然后一起去卡瓦利？
and then we go to the Cavalier?

797
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:48,626
我会在10点半送你回家，怎么样？
And I'll have you home by <i>10:30.</i> How does that sound to you?

798
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,430
- 好 - 好？
- Yeah. - Yeah?

799
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,136
11点也行
Maybe 11:00.

800
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,405
你喜欢就行
Whatever you want.

801
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,278
11点
11:00.

802
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,215
好了，各位就坐
<i>All right, everyone,</i> <i>take your seats. Take your seats.</i>

803
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,781
现在请大家投票选出今晚
<i>It's now time to vote for your King</i>

804
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,987
舞会的国王和王后
<i>and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>

805
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,058
选票放在桌上，每人一份
<i>Ballots are on the table.</i> <i>Everyone gets their own, please.</i>

806
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,126
请大家就坐
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>

807
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:56,627
坐
Here.

808
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,372
在你的选择前面画一个X
<i>Make an "X"beside</i> <i>the candidate of your choice.</i>

809
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,479
享受这最精彩的舞会吧
<i>Let's have the best prom ever.</i>

810
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,512
好了
<i>All right.</i>

811
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,328
汤米，我们在上面
Tommy, we're on here.

812
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,386
你不希望我们在上面？
Don't you want to be on there?

813
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,762
你想？
Do you?

814
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,095
为什么不想？
Why not?

815
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,862
要是我们赢了
If we win, the only thing that happens is

816
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,699
我们就会上台坐在王座上
we have to go up there on those thrones,

817
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,836
伴着校歌挥舞着权杖
wave a scepter around while they play the school song,

818
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,502
然后，跳个小舞让大家看看我们有多傻
and then, uh, do a little dance so everyone can see how idiotic we look.

819
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,476
真美啊
They are beautiful.

820
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,242
你真美
You're beautiful.

821
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,346
那我们投给谁？
So, who do we vote for?

822
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,049
我觉得你支持者比我多
I guess they're more your crowd than mine.

823
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,215
我没什么支持者
I don't really have a crowd.

824
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,381
我觉得我们可以投给自己，对吧？
Well, I think we vote for ourselves, right?

825
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,018
不，不，别投给自己
No. No, don't vote for us.

826
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,131
致假谦虚的小魔鬼吧
To the devil with false modesty.

827
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,935
致小魔鬼
To the devil.

828
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,746
- 割破了？ - 没事
- Hurt yourself? - No.

829
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,688
致我哥们，乔治・道森，致四大天王
To my boy, George Dawson, to the Fearsome Four,

830
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,817
麦克，马特，布莱恩和布拉德，我会想你们的
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad. I'm going to miss you guys.

831
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,158
- 好了？ - 是的
- All set? - Oh, yeah.

832
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,098
好运，我投了你们一票
Good luck, kids. You've got my vote.

833
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,165
票给你
More ballots for you.

834
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,397
美女
Hey, girl.

835
01:09:50,737 --> 01:09:52,865
克丽丝：你的姑娘挺好的，不过好不了多久了

836
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,935
去吧
Here you go.

837
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,501
桶一翻下来，我们就跑
As soon as that bucket goes, we run.

838
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,565
不能为了笑声或是尖叫声逗留
We don't stick around for the laughs or the screams or anything.

839
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,536
懂吗？
All right?

840
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,208
听懂了吗？
You got it?

841
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,109
你在听吗？
Are you listening? Hey.

842
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,444
- 什么？ - 他们一上来
- What? - When they get up there,

843
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,316
搞什么？你就拉绳子
what's happening? You're pulling the rope and when the...

844
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,719
- 闭嘴，我听不到了 - 你给我听着
- Shut up so I can hear. - Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

845
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,951
要是你被抓了，把我们的事供出来
If you get caught and you say anything about what we did,

846
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,549
我会杀了你
I will fucking kill you.

847
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,527
这不是你们在浴室闹着玩
This isn't what you bitches did in the shower.

848
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:34,790
这是暴力事件
This is criminal assault.

849
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,888
要是被抓会坐牢的
This is fucking jail time if we're caught.

850
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,126
我知道了
I get it.

851
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,877
不管怎么样，你都是王后
Hey. Whatever happens tonight, you're Queen, okay?

852
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:58,349
结果出来了，非常非常接近
And the results are in. And it was very, very close.

853
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,849
鼓声在哪里
A drum roll, please.

854
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,892
根据投票结果，当选者是…
By one vote, our winners are...

855
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,998
汤米・罗斯和嘉莉・怀特！

858
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,276
海瑟尔，克丽丝在哪？
Heather, where's Chris?

859
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,435
你说什么？她不在这
What are you talking about? She's not here.

860
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,325
怎么了？来，你可以的
Hey, what's wrong? Come on, go. You can do this.

861
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,827
我们必须成功，现在回头太晚了
We are fucking doing this. It's too late to go back now.

862
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,628
绝配
Ewen High...

863
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,739
我宣布新加冕的舞会国王和王后是
I give you your newly crowned King and Queen of the prom,

864
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,936
汤米・罗斯和嘉莉・怀特
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

865
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,078
- 倒啊！ - 闭嘴，比利！
- Pull it! - Shut up, Billy!

866
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,687
- 克丽丝 - 苏？
- Chris. - Sue?

867
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,220
苏
Sue.

868
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,058
你在干嘛？来，我们走
What are you doing? Come on. Come on, let's go.

869
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,356
不！戴老师，不是我，是克丽丝
No! Miss Desjardin, it's not me. It's Chris.

870
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,931
倒啊，比利，倒啊！
Pull it, Billy, pull it!

871
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,261
别砸嘉莉的场子
Don't ruin this for Carrie.

872
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,859
- 不是我！ - 快，出去
- It's not me! - Come on. Out.

873
01:12:58,607 --> 01:12:59,631
- 让她好好享受吧 - 不，等等！
- Let her have this. - No, wait!

874
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,544
搞什么鬼？
What the hell?

875
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,050
<i>堵起来！</i>
<i>Plug it up!</i>

876
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,495
<i>求你们帮帮我！</i>

877
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,324
<i>堵起来！</i>
<i>Plug it up!</i>

878
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,908
嘉莉，等等，嘉莉

879
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,108
<i>救救我</i>

880
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:12,841
<i>不！</i>

01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,784
- 怪胎！怪胎！ - 快走
<i>- Freak! Freak!</i> <i>- Come on.</i>

882
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,926
嘉莉，过来
Carrie, come on.

883
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,466
汤米
Tommy.

884
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,451
汤米
Tommy.

885
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,658
汤米，不
Tommy, no.

886
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,157
不
No.

887
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,668
操
Fuck.

888
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,639
空间不大啊
You have an inch.

889
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,972
来吧
Yeah. Come on.

890
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,003

892
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,234
- 等等 - 快走
- Wait. - Come on.

893
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,583
这里发生了爆炸
There's been an explosion.

894
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,425
不要乱！
Don't panic!

895
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:11,524
上面看台！
Bleachers!

896
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,050
我们得到门那里
We have to get to the door.

897
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,285
尼琪！
Nicki!

蒂娜，快走！
Tina, come on!

901
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,329
我们要死了！
We're all going to die!

902
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,964
快！
Come on!

903
01:19:05,259 --> 01:19:07,242
爸爸，过来接我

904
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:08,773
你要干嘛？你要干嘛？
What are you doing? What are you doing?

905
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,404
- 没什么 - 你以为这他妈是场游戏？
- Nothing. - Do you think this is a fucking game?

906
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,811
闭嘴
Shut up.

907
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,608
我们怎么办？
What are we going to do?

908
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,919
我们离开这里，再也不回来了
We're going to leave town and we're never going to come back.

909
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:26,925
好吗？没事的，都会好的
Okay? It's okay. It's going to be okay.

910
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,153
好
Okay.

911
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,152
我的天，小心！
Oh, my God! Watch out!

912
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,199
该死的城市！
Shit town!

913
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,201
快离开！
Go, move!

914
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,671
我的天
Oh, my God.

915
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,306
是嘉莉
It's Carrie.

916
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,945
撞过去
Run her down.

917
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:22,505
杀了她
Kill her.

918
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,611
杀了她，比利，杀了她！
Kill her, Billy. Kill her, Billy! Kill her!

919
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:26,949
闭嘴！我知道
Shut up! I got this.

920
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,292
上啊！
Come on!

921
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:44,998
比利？
Billy?

922
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,130
比利？
Billy?

923
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,067
比利？
Billy?

924
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:52,707
不
No.

925
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,822
妈咪，妈咪，妈咪
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

926
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,161
妈妈？
Mama?

927
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:29,965
妈妈？
Mama?

928
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,397
妈妈？
Mama?

929
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,179
妈妈！
Mama!

930
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:48,874
不
No.

931
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,110
不
No.

932
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,042
不
No.

933
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,995
对不起
I'm so sorry.

934
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,083
妈妈？
Mama?

935
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,887
妈妈？
Mama?

936
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:42,299
妈妈
Oh, Mama.

937
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,495
妈妈，你说得对
Mama, you were right.

938
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,941
他们嘲笑我，妈妈
They laughed at me, Mommy.

939
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,406
都嘲笑我
They all laughed at me.

940
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,568
我就知道他们会伤害我女儿
I knew they'd hurt my little girl.

941
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,414
他插入我的时候我就该杀掉自己
I should have killed myself when he put it in me.

942
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,956
我们同床共枕
We slept in the same bed,

943
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,181
一起圣洁地生活
lived together sinlessly.

944
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,656
一个晚上，他用那种眼神看我
Then one night, I saw him look at me in that way.

945
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,892
我们跪下来向上帝祈求能力
And we got down on our knees to pray for strength.

946
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,801
就在那个时候他要了我
And that's when he took me.

947
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:22,468
不，妈妈，我不想听
No, Mama. I don't want to hear it.

948
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,876
- 我很喜欢 - 妈妈，不
- And I liked it. - Mama, no.

949
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,541
我本该在你出生之时就把你献给上帝，但…
I should have given you to God when you were born, but...

950
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,341
我软弱了
I was weak.

951
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,719
我是那么爱你
And I loved you so much.

952
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,621
我说，主啊
And I said, "God,

953
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,724
让女儿跟我在一起
"let me keep my little girl.

954
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,859
跟我一起
"Let me keep her."

955
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,164
我们来祷告
Let's pray.

956
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,666
好的，妈妈
Yes, Mama.

957
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,703
我们来祷告
Yes, we'll pray.

958
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,508
我是牧师，你是信徒
I'll be the preacher. You'll be my congregation.

959
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,882
「我们在天上的父」
"Our Father, Who art in heaven,

960

961
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,314
「愿你的国降临」
"Thy kingdom come,

962
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,682

"as it is in heaven."

965
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:22,229
妈妈！
Mama!

966
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,848
妈妈，不要
Mama, please.

967
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,655
不，妈妈，求你了
No, Mama. Mama, please.

968
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,086
这不是你的错，嘉莉，是我的错
This isn't your fault, Carrie. It's mine.

969
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,027
- 妈咪，不是这样的 - 魔鬼永远不死
- Mommy, this isn't right. - You know the devil never dies.

970
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,863
他会回来，你得不断击杀他
He keeps coming back. You've got to keep killin' him.

971
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:56,631
- 不，妈妈 - 一次一次击杀
- No, Mama. - Over and over again.

972
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,604
妈妈，求你了，妈妈！
Mama, please. Mama!

973
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,804
不！
No!

974
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,280
不，妈妈
No, Mama.

975
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,891
妈妈，住手！
Mama, stop it!

976
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,323
- 嘉莉 - 对不起
- Carrie. - I'm sorry.

977
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,589
嘉莉！
Carrie!

978
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,389
忍住
Okay.

979
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:08,567
没事了
It's okay.

980
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,246
没事了，没人会伤害你了
It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.

981
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,585
没人会伤害你了
No one's going to hurt you.

982
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,896
嘉莉？
Carrie?

983
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,770
我来帮你，嘉莉
Let me help you, Carrie.

984
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,204
就不能别管我吗？
Why couldn't you leave me alone?

985
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,475
对不起
I'm sorry.

986
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,477
看看你把我搞成什么样了
Look what you turned me into.

987
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,279
别伤害我，嘉莉
Don't hurt me, Carrie.

988
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,890
为什么？
Why not?

989
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,421
我把我的生活都毁了
I've been hurt my whole life.

990
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,634
我杀了我妈
I killed my mom.

991
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,142
我想让她活过来
I want her back.

992
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:33,176
我怕极了
I'm scared.

993
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,806
我们得离开这儿！
We've got to get out of here!

994
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,670
手给我
Give me your hand.

995
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,378
把手给我
Give me your hand.

996
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:01,809
快啊！
Come on!

997
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,149
- 是个女孩 - 什么？
- It's a girl. - What?

998
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:11,723
你不知道？
You don't know?

999
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,158
我的天
Oh, my God.

1000
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,832
出去！
Get out!

1001
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,867
出去！
Get out!

1002
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,999
没事了
It's okay.

1003
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,564
做得很好，这只是子宫收缩
You're doing great. That's just another contraction.

1004
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,041
别紧张
Okay.

1005
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,641
苏，用力
Sue, do me a favor and push.

1006
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,803
感觉不对劲，不对劲
No, something doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel right.

1007
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,360
- 别紧张，深呼吸 - 再来，苏，再来
- Come on now, breathe. - Try again, Sue. Try again.

1008
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,726
没事的
Everything's okay.

1009
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,084
准备好了吗？
There we go. Ready?

1010
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,286
好疼，救救我！
It hurts! Please help me!

1011
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,001
快躺下，好吗？
Just lay back, okay, Sue?

1012
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,487
加油
There you go.

1013
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,761
快了
Almost there.

1014
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,007
正常吗？
Is it normal?

1015
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,651
- 别紧张，只管用力 - 没事的
- All right, just push! - Everything's gonna be okay.

1016
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,926
按住她！
Hold her still!

1017
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,081
苏，用力！
Sue, push!

1018
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,925
苏，深呼吸！
Sue, I need you to breathe!

1019
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,601
准备下次用力
Now, get ready for the next one.

1020
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,485
- 用力，你可以的 - 加油！
- Push! You can do it! - Come on!

1021
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,761
醒醒，孩子！
Wake up, baby!

1022
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,527
别怕，别怕，有我在
It's okay, it's okay.I gotcha.

1023
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,451
都过去了，孩子，过去了！
It's over, baby! It's over!

1024
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,045
苏，你没事的！
Sue, you're all right!

1025
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,441
你没事的！
You're all right!

1026
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,281
孩子，醒醒！
Baby, wake up!

1027
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:08,728
