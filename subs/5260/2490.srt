5

Well, thank you.

6
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,360
Up the stairs, ma'am.

7
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,156
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.

8
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,491
Good evening, ladies.

9
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,076
Purses.

10
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,246
Good evening. Can you
open your jacket, please?

11
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,331
Excuse me!

12
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,333
Follow me.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,002
Why all the security?

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,212
OK, big boys with the big guns

15
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,591
- I feel protected.
- They are not here to protect us.

16
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,384
I have a bad feeling about this.

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,136
Cat, don't worry.

18
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,221
Yeah, but just stay safe, OK?

19
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,640
Yes, don't worry about me.

20
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,343

Are you crazy?

25
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,478
Ooh, I like the chick in the back,
the blonde one.

26
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,857
Yeah. Do you think
she's got her real tits?

28
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,218
Jakovic, hi. I owe you, pal.

29
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
See you.

30
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,559
No, no, no, thank you.

31
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,894
Come on!

32
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,898
Take that!

33
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,278
Oh-ho! That's good.

00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,029
That's really good.

35
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,490
I'm going to take this off.

36
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,286
Take it off. Who wants to
fuck a big, fat American?

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,454
- I want to fuck.
- You do?

38
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,502
Do you know each other?

39
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,130
- No.
- Well, you will soon.

40
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,717
- Hi, I'm Lela.
- Cat. Nice to meet you.

41
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,428
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

42
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,769
Sava. Come, come.

43
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,605
Come.

44

Sava, how can you sell the food

46
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,320
if you don't know what it tastes like?

47

You and you and me...

51
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,370
- What? What the fuck?
- What are you doing here?!

52

Jesus! You're wet.

55
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,758
- Why are you here?
- I came to see my best friend.

56
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,219
- Meet my ladies.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

57
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,264
- This is, er, Eva?
- Jieva.

58
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,099
- Jieva.
- Mm-hm.

59
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,226
- And this is Natsuya?
- Nastasya.

60
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,895
- N-Nastasya.
- Nastasya, yes.

61
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,106
Uh-uh. It doesn't matter.
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,275
This is my oldest friend, Anthony.

63
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,110
How are you doing? Hi.

64
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,487
I saved him from
many brutal beat-downs.

65
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,157
Hey!

66
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,081
It's true.

67
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,500
How beautiful are they?
Look at that.

68
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,255
- You need a place to stay?
- No, I got a spot down the street.

69
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,759
They laid it out, flat screen TV,
satellite dish,

70

minibar, got 950 channels.

71
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,847
- I'm watching the game.
- No, you didn't.

72
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,391
- What you talking about?
- It's bullshit.

73
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,561
Yesterday was the tenth.
No international travel.

74
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,397
It's now 3.27,
it means you got in around 2pm,

78

There's three channels only so...

79
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,910
- OK.
- You need a place to stay.

80
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,953
I said they could stay with us.

81
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,289
- They can't.
- You got a girlfriend?

82
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,917
- No, but you do.
- You do?

83
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,295
- You have a girlfriend?
- What happened was...

84
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,672
What happened with Stephanie?

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,885
I've been promoted, so I'm moving to
California. The movers come tomorrow.

86
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,055
I want you and your shit out of here.
Here, 300 bucks.

87
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,558
- Good luck.
- You're paying me to move?

88
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,478
But deep down, I think she loves me.

89
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,023
You can stay on my couch,
help with the restaurant.

90
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,570
- Get these girls a cab.
- You'd take away my hoasis?

91
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,949
Come on, you're going to help
me cook. Make something good.

92
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,451
They need to help me cook, too.

93
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,036
I'm right up here.

94
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,961
So? You like it?

95
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,005
Yeah.
You want me to be straight up?

96
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,218
OK, fuck it. Go next door and eat yak
butter and deep-fried Twinkies.

97
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,096
No, no, no, no! Let me finish this.

98

I'm just saying, maybe
the restaurant business isn't for you.

99
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:00,688
It's a people-pleasing thing and
you're not a people-pleasing person.

100
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,023
So what do I do, man, huh?
You tell me.

101
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,945
I should serve hotpockets and
Chef Boyardee like the rest?

102
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,989
To win paying customers, yes.

- Go.

Where's the bathroom?
I'm just playing.

105
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,371
I'm going to take a leak real quick.

When my nephew was teething,

127
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,721
he'd teeth on her pinky
and it left a bruise.

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,452
- Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,204
Did you see the munk?

161
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,331
Fun fact. I don't trust her.

162
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,458
What,
cos she didn't eat your food?

163
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,212
Not just that.
She's about to take my car.

164
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,881
All the bending over
was a subterfuge

165
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,967
to sleight of hand my keys.

166
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,553
- She also took your phone.
- What?!

167
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,233
Come on!

168
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,946
Quick! Come on, man.

169
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,240
Hey, hold on! Hey!

170
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,202
Lady, open the door.
You've got my phone.

171
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,663
Come on. El ni?o loco.
What are you doing?

172
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,875
I just want my phone.
My momma bought me that phone.

173
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,252
Come on, I've got numbers.
Come on.

174
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,255
Miss, could you please steal
someone else's car?

175
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,925
Don't drive off with my phone!
Hey!

176
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,262
Lady! Hey! I'm gonna call the cops!

177
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,055
Man, shit!

178
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,808
You're gonna let her
steal your car like that?

179
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,768
She must really need it.

180
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,854
"She... She must really need it?"

181
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,772
I must really need my phone!

182
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,726
- How far is your place?
- 15 minutes away.

183
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,561
You said that 15 minutes ago.

184
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,271
Anthony, you don't think

185
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,858
my business ideas
have been unsuccessful, do you?

186
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,568
Compared to what?

187
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,030
Some have been
very, er, interesting.

188
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,450
It's not how good you are,
it's how good you wanna be.

189
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,078
- I guess so.
- I got an idea.

190
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,704
What you got?

191
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,083
- OK, it's a lot of money.
- Ah, this is a good story.

192
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,543
- We'll make a lot.
- Sounds interesting.

193
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,987
(SERBO-CROATIAN)
I need a one-way ticket to Treviso.

194
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,912
(SERBO-CROATIAN) One moment.

195
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,219
You want to set up
a detective agency?

196
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,014
I want us
to set up a detective agency.

197
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,391
You've been through a lot.

198
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,186
- No, this guy Gerry told me...
- Who the helI's Gerry?

199
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,480
You know Gerry.
He comes on late night.

200
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,066
Is your spouse cheating on you?

201
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,652
Do you want to find a loved one?

202
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,197
If you can't catch them,
Kech can.

203
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,907
Licensed private investigators.

204
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,410
He charges $400
plus expenses.

205
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,039
Dude, trust me.
These guys eat well, they tip well.

206
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,582
You know chicks love that.

207
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,709
And we have one clear advantage.

208
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,587
- What's that?
- We have nothing better to do.

209
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,298
Listen, we'd need an office,
experience...

210
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,259
- "We?"
- ..equipment, all kinds of capital.

211
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,762
- You said "we".
- No, absolutely not.

212
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,389
Ten, twenty grand for start-up
costs.

213
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,391
I don't have money.

214
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,353
- What about the trust fund?
- Absolutely not.

215
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,314
I'm trying hard
to keep my family out of my life.

216
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,608
- At least you have a family.
- Stop it.goth

217
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,860
I was raised by African fruit bats.

218
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,196
Don't play
the African fruit bat card.

219
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,990
Can I play the best friend card?

220
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,212
ln ninth grade, you helped the Dean's
wife find her husband's diary.

221
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,255
Then she shot him in the face.

222
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,009
- So the answer's no?
- I'm in Eastern fucking Europe.

223
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,179
I left the States three years ago,
which was your idea.

224
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,764
I remember.

225
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,475
It was to get away from my family.

226
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,313
Why? Because I like to cook.
And be alone. That's it.

227
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,107
Well, you got your wishes.

228
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,734
Nobody comes to the restaurant
to eat.

229
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,696
Just wish to never get laid
and all three wishes will be up.

230
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,231
Anthony?

231
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,732
Mm?

232
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,152
Can I get a glass of water?

233
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,529
No, you're gonna piss on my couch.

234
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,080
I know I told you
to get away from your family,

235
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,291
go travel, live your life,

236
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,378
but you're here
just hiding from the world, man.

237
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:12,799
I need you in on this.
And you need to live your life.

238
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,509
So, you in on this, man?

239
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,221
You going to get with me?
Come on, man, be a dick.

240
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,518
All right.

241
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,271
If it doesn't work,
you're waiting tables.

242
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,273
- We're gonna do this?
- I'm with you.

243
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,525
- We can! Yes, we can!
- We'll try.

244
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,070
Come on, you feel me!
My boy! Bros before hos.

245
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,740
- I don't have any hos.
- That's on my list.

246
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,617
You gonna get some hos.

247
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,827
It's, er, wait.

248

"Bonjour". It's right here.
Come on, here we go.

Oh, yes!

251
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,713
Yes! Dude, that's Santa Claus.

252
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,090
They're showing
Christmas movies.

253
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,469
A porno theatre.
Our office is in a porno theatre.

254
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,181
Dude, you think Ben and Jerry
started in a high rise creamery?

255
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,769
No, not at all. They had
one big spoon, one bucket,

256
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,897
in the back of a VW van,
creaming in their pants.

257
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,399
Ground up, Anthony, ground up.

258
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,861
(SERBO-CROATIAN)
Hey, you wanna watch the movie,

259
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,696
you need to buy a ticket.

260
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,657
Er, let's see.

261
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,785
We're looking for a... Boden.

262
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,538
Ah, Boda? It's me.

263
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,498
Come on, guys, come on.

264
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,752
This is your office.
You make here much money.

You have all you need here.
Big desk, free porno.

266
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,928
Careful, careful. Boards rotten.

267
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,223
Here, you can put the papers.

268
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,267
And this is very important place.

269
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,852
You can wash here or piss here.

270
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
Everybody must piss, yes.

I give to you for four, OK?

273
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,574
We'll take it.

274
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,409
Good guys.

275
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,619
- Yes.
- Come on, pay him.

276
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,163

- You ready to wait tables?

- You make here big success.
- Ah.

00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,504
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

280
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,173
So we have
an uninhabitable hovel

281
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,301
overlooking
a Santa Claus snuff film.

282
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
What's next?

283
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,637
Staff.

284
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,056
You know,
I was in Army language school.

285
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,267
I speak five different languages.

286
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,770
- Um, do you mind if we ask, Mr...
- Call me Dexter.

287
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,068


288
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,196
OK, er, Dexter, um, how did you...?

289
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,532
Well, I mean,
were you born like this?

290
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,076
- He was in the Army.
- Oh. Oh, no.

291
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,870
Shortly after I was discharged,

292
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,873
my wife and I
were vacationing in Florida,

293
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
and we were involved
in a shark attack.

294
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,503
Um, so that's how you lost...?

295
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,173
- Oh, no, shark ate my wife.
- Oh, God.

296
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:02,010
Have you ever seen somebody
you love eaten alive slowly,

297
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
one bite at a time?

298
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,805
Er, he didn't eat her whole?

299
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,559
Oh, they found her hole. And
a piece of her ass on the beach.

300
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,062
Just an empty thong
and a broken dream.

301
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,105
You know,
that hits you kinda hard.

302
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,900
I started drinking
and using intravenous drugs.

303
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:21,529
Lost my arm through
an abscess caused by a dirty needle.

304
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,574
I reached rock bottom
about five years ago.

305
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,911
I was living on the streets
and begging and eating pet food.

306
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,416
Finally, I just threw myself
under a subway train,

307
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,712
and landed on the rails,
and well, that train just, whoosh!

308
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,631
Popped my legs clean off.

309
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,008
Well, listen,
you seem remarkably positive.

310
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,345
I thank God every day
for what happened to me.

311
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,431
You know, my accident,
well, it brought me to the Lord.

312
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,143
I stopped drinking and drugging.

313
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,729
I promised myself
that I would make the most

314

out of every single opportunity
that life afforded me.

OK, well, I guess, um,

00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,322
practically speaking, could you
fill some of the requirements?

You see that phone over there?

318
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,035
Ring! Ring!

Well, when can you start?

Hello?

Daniel Carver? This is Cat.

325
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,395
Cat, where are you?
I'm so glad you're alive.

326
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,898
- How did you get my number?
- I copied Ryder's address book.

327
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,860
How very industrious.
So what is this about?

328
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,736
Wanted to touch base?

329
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,030
I have your hard drive, OK?

If you don't call off your dogs,

331
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,576

332
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,495
the most-watched video
on YouTube.

333
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,791
Turn off the fucking music!

334
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,002
Oh!

335
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,930
You can't get anything
off that hard drive.

336
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,057
It's got military encryption.

337
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,020
It's gonna purge itself like
a Russian farm worker on Easter.

338
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,647
I took it to an expert.
He figured it out.

Never lie to grown-ups.

I'm old enough
to be your sugar daddy.

I'll find you by the pm.

Someone left it on the street.

I could get 300 - 400 Euros for it,
I'm sure.

I don't know whose it is, don't care.

346

Away! Away from the car!
Away, you dirty shit!

347
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,741
I said get away from the car!

348
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,870
Get away from the car

What? What did you do?
Are you crazy?

351
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,972
- You stupid fuck.
- You said to kill the driver.

352
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,848
No said boy or girl.

353
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,517
- You killed a cop?
- Yah.

354
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,270
You won't get paid for this.
Fuckers!

355
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,938
Shoot him.

356
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,442
OK, now I'm really
annoyed with you, princess.

357
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,861
It's time to bring in a professional.

- She's fine.

And Eliska?
What is she now? Three?

364
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,278
- Three and a half.
- How lovely.

You know Razwell?

366
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,158
Of course,

And yet, you'll pay top euro

What's on the hard drive, Daniel?

- Baby pictures.
- Hm.

376
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,478
That's need-to-know, Helen.
Trust me, you don't need to know.

377
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,105
And the girl?
What do we know about her?

378
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,732

Thank you.

Her name is Catalina Rona,
also answers to Cat.

381
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,452
Left her rustic, rural homeland
of Andorra looking for work,

382
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,331
and found her true calling
sprawling and balling.

- Well, we know she's smart.
- And how do we know that?

386
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,383
- Because she's still breathing.
- Ah.

387
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,807
And those other girls, the ones who
weren't as smart as Catalina?

388
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,850
What are your plans for them?

Dear me. Pull!

I thought you boys
were all about change.

Oh, we have changed.

394

We used to be

you're not much concerned.

You're not worried
about your daughter?

What to worry? I never see her.
And she never gives me a dime.

- I know nothing.

If you do happen to hear anything,

if you'd give me a call.

She's got a kid.

and why would this
make the headlines?

471
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,629
Which leads us to conclude what?

472
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,715
Some hard, bad people,
connected and respected are fronting

473
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,593
and want her found
before she can make a sound.

474
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,887
Oh, MC Dr Seuss, kicking rhymes!

475
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,389
I'm just saying,
something is not right.

476
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,684
A bunch of stuff ain't right.
and you suddenly care?

477
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,895
I'm just curious, that's all.

478
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,148
I knew it! You want to
have sex with her, don't you?

479
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,026
- What are you saying?
- You want to hit that.

480
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,403
It's cool by me.
It's our first case.

481
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,156
Come on, let's catch our train.
Come on.

482
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,587
- Mr Ryder? Good afternoon.
- You work for Carver?

483
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,382
- I do.
- You got answers about my girls?

484
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,843
I was hoping you could
help me on that score.

485
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,719
You see,
one of your girls, Catalina,

486
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,013
has stolen something
from my employer.

487
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,350
I need to know if you've heard
from her and where she is.

488
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,644
I don't know
where that scheiss bitch is.

489
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,648
Where the fuck are the others?
Debbie, Susie, Bubbles, Sabina?

490
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,859
I'm afraid I have no idea.

491
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,361
Then we've both got
no fucking idea.

492
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:37,032
Well, perhaps you could tell me
who Catalina left her baby with?

493
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,874
Lady, look at you. You come in
here, Mary fucking Poppins.

494
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,378
You've got a brass pussy,
but no offense, get fucked, mama.

495
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,463
Oh, I'm not your mama, I'm afraid.

496
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,465
I would love to have
a son like you,

497
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,343
but no such luck, poor old me.

498
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,181
And your real mother, didn't she
teach you it's rude to point?

499
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,018
The only thing my mother taught
me was how to take a punch

500
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,603
and to cook up base.

501
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,521
She taught my sister to suck dick

502
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,232
- and take it up the ass.
- My goodness.

503
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,819
Hans,
show Mary Poppins the way out.

504
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,911
If you'd been closer to your mother,
she might have taught you manners.

505
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,498
For instance, when a lady enters
the room, it is polite to stand up.

506
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,262
Do you think you could
stand up for me now, Mr Ryder?

507
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,349
Lady, I swear,
I don't know where she is,

508
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,601
Cat or her fucking baby.

509
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,728
You can sit down now.

510
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,897
Ah! God!

511
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,523
Are you crazy?

512
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,778
God! OK, OK, OK.
I'll tell you all I know.

513
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,991
Hmm, well, unfortunately, with
a man of your low character -

514
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,035
and I don't mean to insult you

515
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:07,748
but you were brought up by a sodomy-
and fellatio-tutoring crack addict -

516
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,376
there's the possibility
that you might lie.

517
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
Lady, you got to trust me.

518
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,506
Well, that's one option.

519
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,508
Oh, no, no, no, lady!

520
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,690
Mr Carver? Officer Slobodan.

521
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,441
We have two young males.

522
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,112
OK. Pictures coming right up.

523
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:42,783
- We're gonna find your daughter.
- Politsia? Hah! They find nothing.

524
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,536
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

525
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,163
That's why you need
professionals like us.

526
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,542
We handle, er, how many cases
on the books, Anthony?

527
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,254
- One.
- Too many to count, really.

528
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,257
But we really feel that
we can find your daughter.

529
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,259
- Find her?
- Yes.

530
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,054
Who says Catalina disappear?
Like I already told woman.

531
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,597
What woman?

532
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,601
Woman policeman.
Name Virgin Woolf. Very nice.

533
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,063
I say my daughter never home.
Takes after mother.

534
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,568
All I have is broken condom
that turns into son here.

535
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,112
Hey! Hey!

536
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,490
So how much money
we talk about?

537
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,617
Er, not very much money.

538
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,828
Our fee is $400 a day
plus expenses.

539
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,706
And we'd need a $2,000 retainer.

540
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,791
How about 100 euros?

541
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,376
What, a day?

542
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,961
No, the whole thing.

543
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,756
Give me 100 euros,
I can help you find sister.

544
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,008
When she first start
fucking for money,

545
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,178
I drive her a little bit
for, how you say, protection.

546
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,014
I could show you where I took her.

547
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,225
Her favourite client.
Maybe he knows where she is.

548
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,146
Look, the way this works
is that you would actually pay us...

549
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,607
- Here, take it.
- What are you doing?

550
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,443
- You have a car?
- You just paid him.

551
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,613
We could have got the retainer.
What are you doing, man?

552
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,575
I think
Pinocchio needs his nose clipped.

553
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,871
Oh, God!

554
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,797
And this will teach this little piggy
not to point.

555
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,931
That car is tailing us.
It has been since the pig farm.

556
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,600
They were snapping shots
of us.

557
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,019
Uh-oh. It could be the cops.

558
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,063
Whoop whoop-whoop whoop.

559
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,483
- Do you want me to lose them?
- Yes, I do.

560
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,985
OK, why are we going off the road?

561
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,196
- Tree!
- Left, left, left!

562
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,573
I think I peed a little bit.

563
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,043
Shit.

564
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,420
- Oh, damn, you all right?
- Yeah. You?

565
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,005
Yeah.

566
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,049
Yo, where's your boy at?

567
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,932
- Oh, man, he look dead.
- You OK?

568
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,603
Come on, man.

569
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,438
Shoulda wore that belt.

570
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,441
Come on, man. You all right?

571
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,944
You need a doctor.
We'll take a taxi.

572
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,492
Hello?

573
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,453
The fish that got away.
Has it been fried yet?

574
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,414
Er, don't worry.

575
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,249
We've got the borders sealed.

576
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,502
She'll hardly go to the police,
though we have friends there.

577
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,713
I'm not worried about the police.

578
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,509
You may be able to get away with
burying 5,000 people in a mass grave

579
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:52,264
but in America, a hint of scandal
and the Senate will be up my ass.

580
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,434
If I see that girl on TV in anything
other than a body bag,

581
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,895
the closest you'll get
to a missile contract

582
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,272
is reading about them
in the newspaper.

583
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,692
- Jesus, Bill, it wasn't me who...
- Don't Jesus Bill me.

584
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,279
- Just find the girl.
- It's being done. Trust me.

585
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,740
Carver's got his best man on it.

586
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,743
Well, I believe you now, Mr Ryder.

587
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,538
You really don't have
any additional information for me.

588
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,916
I apologise for
taking up your morning,

589
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,044
but I'm sure you appreciate
the value of being thorough.

590
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,588
A job worth doing
is worth doing well,

591
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,673
as my dear old mum used to say.

592
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,801
Kill me.

593
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,055
Ooh, now.
What's the magic word?

594
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,726
Please. Kill me.

595
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,395
- Fucking bitch.
- That's the one.

596
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,483
Well, I'll say goodbye to you, sir.

597
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,278
Now, do you need a moment?

598
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,492
Anthony Hester and Julian Simms,
American nationals.

599
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,455
When Cat called you, that was from
Julian's cell and Anthony's car.

600
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,209
- Why they are talking to the family?
- They're private detectives.

601
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,461
- Working for who?
- We don't know.

602
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,422
But Julian gave 100 euros
to the brother.

603
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,800
- Is that a problem for us?
- Maybe.

604
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,677
Want me to ring the bank?

605
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,429
No, no,
we'll deal with it ourselves.

606
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,434
Bonjour, comment ?a va?

607
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,895
Bonjour, mademoiselles.

608
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,022
Er, où est...

609
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,358
Rue de Bon? Rue de Bun?

610
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:31,029
We're looking for Rudible. Ladies,
you wanna help us out? S'il vous pla?t?

611
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,781
You saw the high scarf?

612
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,700
Those weren't words you said.

613
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,495
You wanna deal with girls or you
wanna start a detective agency?

614
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,080
I wanna do both.

615
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,000
You need to focus
on finding Catalina, I think

616
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,545
Oh! Anthony
and Catalina sitting in a tree...

617
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:51,133
There is no-one like her
to draw venom from my serpent.

618
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,225
More sweetly than any other one.

619
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,853
So, you're saying,
as a blowjob provider,

620
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,772
Cat's head and shoulders
above the rest?

621
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,607
"A blowjob provider"?

622
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,863
That would be like calling
Caravaggio a house painter.

623
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,825
Gentlemen, would you like
some tea? Chamomile.

624
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,577
Sure, I'll have a cup.

625
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,912
You are not to be
easily shocked, are you?

626
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,914
- No, no.
- Us? No, go on.

627
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,251
Cat produced from me
a jet of semen,

628
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,961
which travelled some 1 1 feet.

629
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,466
It was like the salty exhale
of the great white whale

630
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,217
in Melville's classic tome.

631
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,762
Let me show you something.

632
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,639
This is a mark here she leaves.

633
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,227
"Le plaisir de Cat".

634
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,689
Wow. From the windows
to the walls. That's nice shooting.

635
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,232
lndeed.

636
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,152
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

637
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:57,949
If I help you find her, will there
be any, er, pecuniary rewards?

638
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,078
I don't want to sound
too bourgeois,

639
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,206
but my needs
are quite varied and exotic.

640
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,085
Well, the reward will be
very large and pecuniary,

641
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,755
and, er, Catalina's father's
filthy rich, he's rolling in it.

642
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:16,093
Very well. I obtained her services
through a man named Ryder.

643
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,761
Do you have a number?

644
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,680
Better yet, gentlemen.
His address.

645
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,608
- Hi.
- Hi.

646
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,945
OK. It's a level-five encryption.

647
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,655
- Level-five?
- Uh-huh.

648
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,407
Wow, that might be a problem.

649
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,993
If anyone can do it, you can.
You are my little genius.

650
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,122
Thank you. After all these years,
you haven't changed.

651
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,291
I'll bring the hard drive
and passport to the hotel

652
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,544
as soon as it's ready.

653
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,004
You sure you got the right place?

654
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,965
It's the address he wrote down.

655
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,176
- I didn't sign up for this.
- It's a little sketchy.

656
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,928
Can we go back?

657
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,305
Come on, we're right here.
You ready?

658
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,932
No.

659
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,939
What kind of pimp doesn't open
up for a potential doubleheader?

660
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,150
A dead pimp.

661
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,667
Oh, shit.

662
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,169
How bad is it?

663
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,131
Remember when you started that
lawn mower with the kittens inside?

664
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,717
- Yeah.
- This is much worse.

665
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,094
Oh, damn!

666
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,805
You weren't kidding
about the dead part.

667
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,600
Ah-Ah! What the hell?

668
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,143
Are those...? Ahhhh!

669
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,604
Chick who did this
must have been pissed.

670
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,564
What, a female did this?

671
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,525
- I think so.
- Wanna see what she looks like?

672
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,402
- That blinking light.
- Shit!

673
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:01,281
Security cam. I'm thinking
it recorded everything.

674
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:05,076
Our sick, castrating bitch missed
it cos it was bright outside.

675
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,579
Course, I could be wrong,
but I don't think so.

676
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,509
Look at this lady plying her trade.

677
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,512
Oh, she's plying
more than a trade.

678
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,599
Ohhh, God! Ohhhh!

679
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,310
Oh, my God. Is she going for the...

680
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,230
Not the nuts, not the n-n-n... No!

681
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,610
..on a houseboat
on the river in ltaly...

682
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,987
- What? ltaly?
- .. near Ferrara.

683
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,242
The arsehole sold her out!
He sold the baby down the river!

684
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,370
- We should probably warn her.
- Let me see this.

685
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,789
Er, Grushenka,
Grushenka, Grushenka...

686
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54,459
- No Grushenkas here.
- Look for, er, Agrafena.

687
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,712
- Agrafena?
- Grushenka's short for Agrafena.

688
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,214
Grushenka's longer.

689
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,551
It's three syllab...
Just look for the fucking number.

690
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,678
It's like the backwards Ks and Hs.

691
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:09,891
- Read The Brothers Karamazov.
- You just read the Cliff Notes.

692
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,393
I read it. Look up the number.

693
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,063
Well, I'll be damned!
OK, here, you talk to her.

694
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,149
- Why don't you talk to her?
- No, dude, I'm nervous.

695
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,734
My stomach's bubbling.

696
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,362
- I get sweaty armpits.
- Shut the fuck up.

697
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,918
Grushenka, listen.
Someone is coming to kill you.

698
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,962
A very bad lady
is coming to kill you.

699
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,758
Get out now. Someone is coming
to kill you and the baby.

700
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,470
She's speaking Russian.

701
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,389
What? Russian? Oh, let me see.

702
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,016
You speak Russian?

703
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,101
I had a Russian girlfriend once.

704
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,734
(SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN) Bitch!
Get the fuck out of here!

705
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,071
(SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN) I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

706
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,616
(SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN) I'll kill you!
Get the fuck out of here!

707
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,370
- (RUSSIAN) Are you threatening me?
- (RUSSIAN) I'll kill you!

708
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,418
- You think she understood that?
- Do you think I did?

709
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,338
I think we need to
go warn her in person.

710
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,237
I like you very much, young lady.

711
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,158
Your resilience, and dedication
to your friend is admirable.

712
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,868
Oh-oh-oh.

713
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,745
There we are.

714
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:58,917
You must understand,
I will find Catalina anyway,

715
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,461
and then your sacrifice
and your nobility

716
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,088
will all have been in vain.

717
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,759
Oh dear, oh dear.

718
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,514
Do you see these?

719
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,809
These are to remind me
of courage.

720
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,812
I had them made from the teeth
of a young man

721
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,647
I interrogated in the Yemen.

722
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:24,484
He held out
for eight days straight.

723
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,862
The last thing he said to me
before he died,

724
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,534
having told us absolutely nothing,
by the way, was the F word.

725
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,831
Ahh, look who's just woken up.

726
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,749
Hello.

727
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:46,339
- (RUSSIAN) Please...
- Hello! hello, relax.

728
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,927
(RUSSIAN)
Please leave the baby out of this.

729
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,429
Leave him alone.

730
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:58,101
(SPANISH) Hola.
How are you, little one?

731
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:03,857
(RUSSIAN) Leave him alone!
Please let Alex be.

732
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:08,361
(SPANISH)
Oh, you like this toy, do you?

733
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:12,699
(RUSSIAN)
Where is Cat, Grushenka?

734
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,035
I liked this detective idea
but I'm ready to wait tables.

735
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,330
- We gotta save this girl.
- You think she's still alive?

736
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know. I hope so.

737
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,503
(RUSSIAN) This is morphine.
It will make your death painless.

738
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,633
(RUSSIAN)
I really don't know where she is.

739
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,969
Shh.

740
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:37,640
- I believe you.
- Please, the baby.

741
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:43,771
Yes, yes, I'll call the police.
They'll take care of him.

742
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:52,405
I want you to know
I would never hurt a tiny baby.

743
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,955
Not on a Sunday.

744
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,173
Hey! Hey!

745
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,676
Don't you know how to drive?
I'm wet, bitch!

746
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,806
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Virgin Woolf?

747
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,391
This is Virginia Woolf.

748
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,644
This is Catalina's father.
Remember me?

749
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,271
Good morning, Mr Rona.
How may I help you?

750
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,319
Hello?

751
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,198
Oh, God.

752
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,617
Ma'am, are you OK?

753
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,577
Say something.

754
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,621
- Come on, I got you.
- Miss. Hello?

755
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,002
Splen... Splendid?

756
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,464
Oh, God.

757
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,344
- What's going on?
- I think she's dead.

758
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,638
She said something like
"splendid" before...

759
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,641
Jesus. Oh, no.

760
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,435
I think she meant
the Splendid Hotel in Budva.

761
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,104
That's probably where Cat is.

762
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:11,484
Dex, I need tickets to Constalova
We'll staying at the Splendid Hotel.

763
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,611
And send some thermal underwear.

764
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,405
So you will buy me a new van?

765
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:19,242
- It would be my pleasure.
- With AC, CD, DVD, and TV?

766
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:23,705
Fully equipped. What information
do you have for me?

767
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,541
Two guys came, wanted to know
about my daughter.

768
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,668
Asking many questions.

769
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,047
Here. They gave card.

770
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,757
So, you pay me now?

771
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,759
Oh, yes, I'll pay you now.

772
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,553
Do you need a moment?

773
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,221
For what?

774
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,394
No, Ronas, no stay here.

775
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,690
No Ronas? OK, see if
you have a Cat or a Catalina.

776
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:54,235
Sir, we have 370 rooms
and over 1 ,000 guests.

777
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,363
OK, she's a short girl, 5'4", 5'5",

778
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,283
long, dark hair,
nice low-opening booty.

779
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,036
Got up-top heavy breasts,
skimpy dress.

780
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,537
No, I'm sorry.

781
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,372
All right, well, let me get a room.

782
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,374
It is magic convention today.

783
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,628
I am afraid we have only
Presidential Suite apartment.

784
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,922
But it's much too expensive.
It's 2,400 euros.

785
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,633
- 2,400 euros?
- Yes.

786
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,302
OK. You, er,
you come with the room?

787
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,803
No, I'm sorry.

788
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,139
- You don't come with the room?
- No.

789
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,521
Hello?

790
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,024
- Can I help you?
- Hello.

791
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,985
Is this the Juan Detective Agency?

792
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,656
- It's Ju-An. Come on in.
- Thank you.

793
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,240
Can I get you anything?

794
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,577
We have a lovely selection
of herbal teas.

795
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,830
Or are you just looking for
a good date?

796
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,250
How very kind.
Nothing for me, thank you.

797
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,628
My name's Emily Bront?.

798
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,214
I'm from
the National Security Agency.

799
00:52:56,382 --> 00:53:00,051
I believe you're working on a case
of great importance to us.

800
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,137
A missing girl. Catalina Rona.

801
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,475
Emily Bront??

802
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,977
Like the writer lady?

803
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,563
Died of, er, TB or some shit?

804
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,982
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.

805
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,778
Well, Miss Bront?,
I can't discuss the case with you.

806
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,155
You'll have to
talk to my employers.

807
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,116
When might I be able to do that?

808
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,285
Well, they're in the field,
so it might be a few days.

809
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,331
And what field might that be?

810
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,500
Why don't you
give me your number,

811
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,961
and I'll be happy to pass it on?

812
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,046
Or you could just
give me that note

813
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,091
that you slipped into
the Gospel of St John.

814
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,592
You...

815
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,054
You, er,
you read that upside down.

816
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,515
I did.

817
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,475
You did.

818
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,571
Oh, Lord.

819
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,575
Oh, damn.

820
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,127
Oh, my goodness.

821
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,385
Oh, put them away.

822
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,223
Sweet baby Jesus.

823
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,647
Nice. Oh!

824
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,108
Oh, king size!
I got this. I got all this.

825
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,111
You make your phone calls.
I'm going to put him to bed.

826
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,240
OK, we just need to
find your mom, that's all.

827
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,867
Shh, it's all right.

828
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,333
Hi, my name is Julian.
I'm looking for Cat or Catalina.

829
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,627
Hello? Hello?

830
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,337
OK, all right.

831
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,507
Let's take a little look at
what you got here, OK?

832
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,763
Can you shut the baby up?

833
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,475
Hello? Hi? I'm looking for
a Cat or Catalina.

834
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,353
- No, no, housekeeping .
- Oh, I'm sorry, OK.

835
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,730
Well, yeah, can we get
more towels up here, then?

836
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,524
Yes, yes, moment.

837
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,629
One new message.

838
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,882
Er, hi, my name's Julian Simms...

839
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,769
There she is. Is that her?

840
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,355
I recognise that rack.

841
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,441
How do I look?

842
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,819
You're good, let me see.
Collar's cool.

843
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,614
What about the 'fro? 'Fro's good?

844
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,617
The boats. See her boats?

845
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,243
Get her number this time.

846
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,914
Come on. Give him to me.
Give me my baby.

847
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,750
- It's OK.
- Give him to me. Come on.

848
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:05,880
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

849
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,801
Sit down.

850
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,554
I have a gun in my bag.

851
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,016
You try anything, I swear to God,
I will shoot you in the balls.

852
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,893
It's OK. It's not necessary.

853
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,104
Not to mention impossible,
since you don't really have a gun.

854
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,857
Man, you could be wrong.

855
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,234
Who are you guys, hm?

856
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,487
You don't recognise us?

857
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,447
- I stole your car.
- And my phone.

858
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,784
With my ringtones, numbers,
I had those pictures.

859
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,452
What do you want?

860
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,423
- What the fuck, man?
- I know you did not just slap me.

861
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,094
We're private investigators.
Your father hired us to find you.

862
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,013
- My father?
- I mean, technically, we're not...

863
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,890
Ah, OK, he's worried about you.

864
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:02,103
All he's worried about is the money
I stopped sending after Mum died.

865
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,938
You all don't get along?

866
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,023
You could say that.

867
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,318
Yes! My father and I
were the same way.

868
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,405
He preferred my brother,
take him fishing and stuff.

869
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,240
My father beat me with a belt

870
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,701
and made me sleep in the barn
with pigs.

871
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,953
Yes, yours is substantially worse.

872
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,539
- That's bad. Yeah.
- Why have you got my son?

873
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,583
- Agrafena is dead.
- Who is Agrafena?

874
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,130
- Grushenka's short for Agrafena.
- Nobody been reading that book.

875
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,341
- You gotta get them Cliff Notes.
- Grushenka's dead?

876
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,843
Yeah. And Ryder.

877
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,886
Dead. Gone, six feet under.

878
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,930
- He's my pimp.
- No, not any more.

879
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,517
- He's pimped out.
- They tried to kill our assistant,

880
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,060
cut his fucking arm off.

881
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,731
What kind of person cuts
a one-armed man's only arm off?

882
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,026
Cat, it's the kind of person
that cuts someone's balls off.

883
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,945
- They are going to find you.
- Find you.

884
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,949
They'll chop you up like a tomato.
We need to get you out of here.

885
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:02,371
No, I can't. I'm waiting for someone.
My room is 432. Meet me there.

886
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,541
Wait. No, I'm gonna go with you.
Get the check, OK?

887
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,543
How you gonna tell ME
to get the check?

888
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:11,756
You want me to get the check?
I don't... I didn't order these nuts.

889
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,003
Coming out?

890
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,130
Going down?

891
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,091
Yes, please.

892
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,220
- Um, what floor?
- Oh, that'll do fine.

893
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,722
Er, OK.

894
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,901
- After you.
- Thank you.

895
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,682
Help. She's trying to kill me.

896
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,560
Look, she's a psychotic killer.
Look how tall she is!

897
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,981
Where's your friend gone
with Catalina?

898
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,608
Damn.

899
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,781
- Who is it?
- It's me.

900
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,742
Come along now, we haven't
got all day. Chop chop.

901
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,953
What did you do?
How did you bring her here?

902
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,414
I didn't bring her here.
She's got a gun.

903
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,584
Please. Please!

904
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,634
Alone at last.

905
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,305
Now, would you mind
closing those curtains?

906
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,853
You have a delectable accent.
Where are you from?

907
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,148
- I'm gonna try something.
- I'm from Canada.

908
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,694
I take back all the bad things
I've ever said about Canadians.

909
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,364
Now, how are you two involved?

910
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,783
We're private detectives.

911
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,666
I'm sorry.

912
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,337
Why does everybody react like that?

913
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,590
- Who is it?
- lvan for Cat.

914
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,764
I'm here for Cat. Is she here?

915
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,810
Do come in.

916
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:20,402
Hey, guys, Siegfried is looking for
a new Roy in room 432.

917
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,363
Wow!

918
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,950
Aha. Lovely.

919
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,370
Now, we're almost done.

920
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,250
- Ladies first.
- Please, I have a child.

921
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,876
Oh, my dear Catalina.

922
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:40,798
If I had a shilling for every time
someone said that, I wouldn't be here.

923
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,883
But someone else would.

924
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,510
Now,

925
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,095
do you need a moment?

926
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,640
Wait! My partner and I have a DVD

927
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,309
of you performing surgery,
a cockectomy,

928
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,937
on a dirty pimp,
with no medical licence.

929
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,398
You could be in a lot of trouble.

930
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,651
I'm getting old.

931
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,612
Don't beat yourself up.
It was bright outside.

932
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,407
- You couldn't see the light blink.
- Where's the tape?

933
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:11,078
Oh, OK. A question.
See? We're starting to negotiate.

934
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,914
I only need one of you
to tell me where the tape is.

935
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,836
I'm beginning to lose my patience.

936
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,760
I'm looking for Siegfried.
You must be his assistant.

937
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,390
Look.

938
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,103
Could you excuse me?

939
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,404
Come on!

940
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,166
Lady, get down!

941
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,923
ln. ln. ln.

942
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,145
What are you doing?
No, you're not. Dude.

943
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,737
OK. OK, this is crazy.

944
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,697
Oh, my God.

945
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,121
OK, give me the baby.

946
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,292
Oh!

947
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,838
Give me a second.
You don't want to see me naked.

948
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,635
What are you doing? Hurry up!

949
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,060
Oh, God. Shit!

950
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:04,358
Man! Help!

951
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,943
Out the way!

952
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,994
Hey, where are you going?

953
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,924
Oh, good work, Helen.

954
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,718
The money will be
in your account tomorrow.

955
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,263
We had a little collateral
along the way.

956
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,432
That's in the "shit happens" column.

957
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,185
Who's a good boy?

958
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,147
Mm. So, Daniel, tell me.

959
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,566
You didn't know that
those two pubescents

960
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:50,154
- were playing detective, did you?
- No, not until you told me.

961
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,114
There's no-one else on the job?

962
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,615
Of course not.

963
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,201
I know you like to work alone.

964
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,911
More than anything.

965
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,417
Mr Jakovic wanted me to extend
an invite to his fundraising party.

966
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:07,546
For the American
Secretary of Defense.

967
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,424
Ooh, a posh do. How delicious.

968
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,427
You know how I like to dress up.

969
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:19,057
Helen, have you ever regretted
that you and I...?

970
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,435
It's for the best, Daniel.

971
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,604
We'll always have Angola.

972
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,666
We're bringing someone else in.
Helen's done with this.

973
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,252
Yeah. We have full containment.

974
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,421
OK.

975

(SERBO-CROATIAN)
Such a brave little girl.

976
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:55,093
Are you having fun today
with your daddy?

977
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,942
Helen was a good soldier.

978
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,569
The best. An army of one.

979
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,489
Do you think she took a peek
at the hard drive?

980
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,282
Probably not.

981
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,660
But I couldn't take that risk.

982
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,871
It's all right, Bob.

983
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,998
Old soldiers never die.

984
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,501
They just get blown away.

Hello, Bob.
Tell her you'll call her back.

(SPEAKS IN SERBO-CROATIAN)

Do get in.

989
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,493
A nod to the wise, my dear.

990
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,830
You only need a little dab of
Acqua di Parma behind each ear.

991
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,833
And I gave up on
those old trip switches years ago.

992
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:11,378
Ten-second delay. Tut tut.
Dear, oh dear.

993
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,048
Now, all you need to do
is answer one or two questions,

994
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,092
and we can wrap this up.

995
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:21,054
Otherwise, I have
a lovely soundproof basement.

996
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,723
I can rig up a saline drip,

997
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,727
and we can make it last a
couple of crispy, crunchy weeks.

998
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,606
And after that, I'll go and find
that lovely daughter of yours, in...

Where is she? Lupiana?

Please don't hurt her.

Who's replacing me?

1002
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,113
Sean Moody.

1003
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,657
Ah, my favourite Scotsman.
Is he in town?

1004
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,868
He's at the Hotel Riviera.

1005
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,787
Marvellous. Thank you so much.

1006
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,914
It was nothing personal, Helen.

1007
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,627
Oh, no, of course not.
I always liked you, Bob.

1008
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,588
Now, do you need a moment?

1009

Look at you, sweetheart.

Fuck. Who the fuck is this?

1017

- Hello?
- It's Carver.

1018

- What?
- Carver. We found the girl.

we found your mom.

gymnastics for me?

Yeah? Side, side.

Chook, chook! Take my nose.

I don't need it.
I've smelled enough stuff.

Listen, Mr Moody, all due respect,
but why we not coming with you?

Well, um, he told us that
you are some terrorism specialist

a wee gobble,

you can all have a dose
of Mr Sweet Dreams here.

But if you will nae...

1081
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:17,243
well, then, I'm afraid,
it's going to get a wee bit messy.

1082
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,289
Sorry, but I don't understand
anything that you just said.

1083
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,916
For fuck's sake, man!

1084
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,294

in this fucking country?

I will kill you all quickly.

I will cut
soft lad's little prick off here

1091
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,610
and stuff it in his fucking mouth.

01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,737
Comprende?
Are you with me now?

1093
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,281
That's enough. Enough.
Leave her alone.

1094
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,703
Oh, Anthony, Anthony,
don't do anything, please.

1095
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,373
I don't usually like to interfere
but you're being a dick.

1096
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,083
You don't like to interfere?

1097
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,752
Hang on, son.
Hang on just a minute. Hang on.

1098
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,677
Ho ho ho!

1099
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,512
For fuck's sake, son!

1100
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,265
You just cannae get enough
of the ball-booting.

1101
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,100
You cannae get enough of it,
wee man.

1102
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,811
Cannae fucking get enough of it.
Sit doon.

1103
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,399
Now, where were we?

1104
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,695
Come on.
Say, keep that wean quiet.

1105
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,363
That's it. Lick your lips.

1106
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,491
Here comes the choo-choo.

1107
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,480
OK, what just happened?

1108
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,787
Shit.

1109
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,167
Who is it?

1110
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,752
It's Helen Bingham.

1111
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:34,130
I've just saved your lives.
Would you open the door, please?

1112
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,801
Or should I call room service

1113
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,553
to clean up
the dead body on your bed?

1114
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,933
I'm not going to kill you.

1115
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,311
You can put the gun away now.

1116
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,648
Who was that guy?

1117
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,692
That was a Mr Sean Moody,

1118
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,404
a priapic killer of some repute
and my proposed replacement.

1119
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,365
But why'd his head blow off?

1120
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,700
Sub-sonic explosive tipped round.

1121
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,745
He deserved to go out with a bang.

1122
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,918
What're you calling
me for now, ya bastard?

1123
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,003
We've got a situation, Moody.

1124
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,631
Bingham got away.
Watch your back.

1125
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,843
Thank you,
Daniel. I'll pass that along.

1126
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,055
Who's paying you to kill us?

1127
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:27,392
- And why should we trust you?
- Very good questions

1128
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,521
but right now, we need to get out
of the country. Come along.

1129
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,953
I'd very much appreciate it if
you didn't mention my profession.

1130
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,415
Or the... fact that I... smoke.

1131
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,128
- Hello, Mummy.
- Oh, Helen!

1132
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:58,423
- What a nice surprise!
- Happy birthday, Mummy.

1133
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,758
Oh, darling,
you never forget, do you?

1134
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,219
- Of course not.
- And you've brought friends.

1135
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,930
Come in, everybody.
Come in, all of you.

1136
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,974
There we go. There we...

1137
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,894
Oh, my goodness!

1138
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,022
What wonderful creature is this?

1139
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,815
His name is Alex.

1140
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:20,153
Alex. He's beautiful. May I?

1141
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,906
Mm, yeah.

1142
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,616
Ooh!

1143
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,827
My goodness.

1144
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,747
- He likes you.
- Babies love me.

1145
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,832
And I love babies.

1146
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,293
They're a blessing.

1147
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,130
They're life's way of making up
for the way it all inevitably ends.

1148
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,257
You know, we all start off

1149
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:44,677
being wide-eyed little angels
like him...

1150
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,347
don't we, Helen?

1151
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,600
- Yes, Mummy. Shall we go in?
- Of course. Come on.

1152
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,937
This cake is just scrumptious.

1153
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,608
I don't know how you did it
with what little I keep in.

1154
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,526
Oh, it's nothing.

1155
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,112
Helen, darling,
have you gained weight?

1156
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,240
I think perhaps you've
had enough of that sweet stuff.

1157
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,118
Darling,
you're not a young girl any more.

1158
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,287
You need to take care of yourself.

1159
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,083
I won't always be around
to look after you, you know.

1160
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,752
Yes. Mummy,
isn't it time you went back to bed?

1161
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,337
It's getting terribly late.

1162
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:23,257
Oh. All right, all right.
I know when I'm not wanted.

1163
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:27,762
And I do think all that sugar's
made me feel very tired.

1164
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,516
Now, you know where the extra
blankets and pillows are?

1165
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,101
Yes, course.

1166
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:37,021
Thank you all for a very,
very grand birthday party.

1167
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,731
Bless you. Darling.

1168
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,692
I do love you, you know.

1169
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,902
- Yes. Love you, too, Mummy.
- Good night.

1170
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,988
- Night-night.
- Good night.

1171
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,990
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Bingham.

1172
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,783
Well, that explains a lot.

1173
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,203
Now, we need to
get that hard drive back.

1174
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,789
Won't he have wiped it clean already?

1175
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:58,042
Jakovic's company makes
weapon systems for the military.

1176
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,378
He won't give that up.
It's leverage.

1177
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,256
But they'd both be finished
if the film got out.

1178
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:06,009
Krebb only needs to know
that Jakovic has it.

1179
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:09,387
He never needs to use it.
It's nuclear brinkmanship.

1180
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,687
Cat, what's wrong?

1181
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,605
Whoa!
Where are you going with that?

1182
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,566
- Cat?
- Fuck all this shit.

1183
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,276
You killed Grushenka.

1184
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,195
Put the gun away, child,
you'll hurt yourself.

1185
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,740
How can you just kill
innocent people?

1186
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,785
I don't know. I've never met
an innocent person.

1187
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,288
The only difference
between our professions

1188
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:39,959
is that when I blow people away,
they don't ejaculate on my breasts.

1189
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:47,800
Feeling better?

1190
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,178
Tell me why
I shouldn't just kill you now.

1191
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:55,016
Because there'll be another
Sean Moody along in a minute.

1192
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,060
Or another Helen Bingham.

1193
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:01,022
We are the only people who know
what's on that hard drive.

1194
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,691
If we don't find it
and expose it to the world,

1195
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,359
then we're all dead.

1196
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:09,614
I don't kill babies but my colleagues
would have no such compunction.

1197
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,449
They will find you and Alex,

1198
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:15,369
and kill you in the most creative
way they can possibly think of

1199
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,246
and you will just disappear.

1200
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,084
Now, shall we get back
to business, my dear?

1201
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,377
You are going to
get us into this party.

1202
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,463
Me?

1203
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:29,133
I hacked into the guest list.
One of your co-workers is on it.

1204
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,802
You need to give her a call

1205
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,429
and offer her
double what she's being paid.

1206
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,348
And how's your Scottish accent?

1207
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,974
Scottish... Oh, it's terrible.

1208
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,686
A wean? For fuck's sake.

1209
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,816
I've not seen a wean for ages.

1210
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,734
Oh, dear.

1211
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,486
I-I could try.

1212
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:56,994
Aye, is that a wean? Fuck's sake!
I've not killed a wean for ages.

1213
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,288
- Aye.
- Lovely.

1214
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,635
Hello there.

1215
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,178
lsabella?

1216
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,764
Ho ho!

1217
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,226
I could fall in love with you,
so I could.

1218
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:26,190
Maurice did good.
Driver, here's the parking pass.

1219
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,861
Do you speak English?

1220
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,577
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you stopping the car?

1221
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,538
Your regular driver
couldn't make it tonight.

1222
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,415
Hey?

1223
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,794
- Good evening.
- Who the fuck are y...?

1224
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:06,522
Could you open the trunk for us,
please?

1225
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,900
- Aye.
- Mr McPhee?

1226
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:13,196
Mr Angus Tyrone Denzel McPhee.

1227
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,114
(RUSSIAN) Good evening

1228
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,826
- You RSVPd one person, sir.
- One whore or two, who cares?

1229
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,622
- What difference does it make?
- (SPEAKS SPANISH)

1230
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,749
- (SHOUTS IN SPANISH)
- It doesn't matter!

1231
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,709
(SHOUTS IN SPANISH)

1232
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,961
Would you calm down?

1233
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,632
Move on. Move on, please.

1234
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,766
Don't be nervous.

1235
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,809
This is the fun bit.

1236
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,561
I'm fine.

1237
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,279
Here we go.

1238
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,073
Welcome.

1239
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,242
- Good evening.
- Aye, aye.

1240
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,086
Testing, testing.

1241
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,879
- Copy.
- Copy.

1242
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,092
- After you, my dear.
- I'm downstairs with the drivers.

1243
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,886
Come on through.

1244
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,269
Keep calm. Keep smiling.

1245
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,571
Oh, "Ave Maria". How lovely.

1246
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,828
Three security on the upper floor.

1247
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,290
Are you sure we're
going to get away with this?

1248
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,501
Aye.

1249
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,180
Thank you so much
for hosting this thing.

1250
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:06,976
It's a nice party, beautiful home,
stunning daughters.

1251
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,687
Would you like
a tour of the house?

1252
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:14,191
Honey, er, let him catch
his breath, take a drink.

1253
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,030
Everyone remember their assignments?

1254
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,324
I'm a bit terrified, honestly.

1255
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,617
Oh, stiff upper lip, bro.

1256
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:37,673
What, hoots, man. It's a braw,
bricht, moonlicht nicht.

1257
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,967
- You're Scottish?
- I be, aye.

1258
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,388
You heard of a black lrish? Well,
I be a black-eyed Scotsman, aye.

1259
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,266
- Of course I am.
- You don't look Scottish.

1260
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,477
I don't look Scottish?

1261
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,145
Is that what you said?

1262
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,481
You don't wanna know
what you look like.

1263
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:57,151
You look like a one-legged gypsy
whore of a goat herder.

1264
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,403
Don't make me slap you.

1265
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:03,616
I lift my kilt, you see my boots.
See my black snake moan. Sss.

1266
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,243
- It may bite you...
- Is there a problem?

1267
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,331
- Sir, we need you to calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

1268
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,626
Don't make me slap... Look
at me when I'm talking to you.

1269
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,462
Excuse me. You can't be up here.

1270
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,590
I was looking for the ladies.
I've broken my necklace.

1271
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,385
- Go downstairs, please.
- Would you hold that?

1272
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,018
All clear on the upper floor.

1273
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,767
On my way.

1274
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,323
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm good. Sorry.

1275
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,825
Then get out.

1276
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:58,212
Krebb's got a small army down here,
fully armed. Just a heads up.

1277
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,219
Come in.

1278
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,306
Am I interrupting anything?

1279
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:14,145
- Good evening, Daniel.
- Helen.

1280
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,522
I'm so glad you could make it.

1281
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,607
I like your new look.

1282
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:20,484
Well, thank you.

1283
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,154
You look... marvellous.

1284
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,240
You look very elegant, yourself.

1285
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,457
Is it morning already?

1286
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:36,125
Excuse me?

1287
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:39,420
I just saw the sun rise,
and it's blinding me.

1288
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:44,508
I have to introduce a political film,
same old stuff,

1289
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:49,305
- but afterwards, we could...
- Be terribly naughty?

1290
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,600
Oh, I'd like that.
I'd like that a lot.

1291
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,102
Sir, it's time for your speech.

1292
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:57,897
Promise me you'll wait?

1293
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,191
Say the magic word.

1294
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:30,471
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr William Krebb.

1295
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,727
Thank you so much.

1296
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,898
First, on behalf of myself and
all the people of the USA,

1297
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,735
thank you to our gracious hosts
for opening their beautiful home.

1298
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,946
Ivana and Branco Jakovic.

1299
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,822
How about a hand for them?

1300
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,037
Through my travels
throughout this region,

1301
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:59,250
I have felt only warmth
and welcome in their home,

1302
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:03,170
and have shown me an excellent time
in their beautiful country.

1303
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,632
Speaking of beautiful countries,
I don't know how you do it

1304
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,426
but the women here
are absolutely gorgeous.

1305
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,720
Must be something in the water.

1306
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,518
I don't suppose Razwell was
any trouble.

1307
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,728
No, no, no, Bob was a sweetheart.

1308
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,564
- Thank you, Daniel.
- My pleasure.

1309
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,817
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1310
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,569
Come in.

1311
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,156
- Who's this?
- I'm an associate.

1312
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,284
Hi, how are you?

1313
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,119
I'm fine.

1314
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:38,289
I'm assuming you have access
to various slush funds

1315
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,957
on behalf of your employer.

1316
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,294
If you'd transfer
all you can lay your hands on

1317
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,547
into this account,
I'd be most grateful.

1318
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,885
Now, I have
a little audio-visual programme,

1319
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,597
if I can figure out
how to work this.

1320
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,807
- Sir, can I help?
- This way? Yeah.

1321
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,687
- There you go.
- Well, that was easy. Thank you.

1322
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,773
I got the disk. I'm on my way.

1323
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:08,319
For the record, Helen,
it wasn't my idea.

1324
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,863
Of course not. Powers that be.

1325
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,781
Let's see how we've done.

1326
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,951
17 million and change.
Oh, yummy.

1327
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:21,248
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Damn you.

1328
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,758
As many of you know, I have
been travelling through the region

1329
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,845
assuring our allies that
the anti-ballistic missile shield

1330
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,640
will give our troops
and our allies in Eastern Europe

1331
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:40,059
a new level of safety and security.

1332
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,895
Queensberry Rules?

1333
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,480
Of course.

1334
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,456
Nice.

1335
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,969
(SERBO-CROATIAN)
What are you doing here?

1336
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,098
Need to replace the HDMl
and reroute the components.

1337
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,018
If we don't get 1080p video,
we're all dead. I'm with ATl.

1338
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:26,438
Understand?
It means, get the fuck out.

1339
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:30,317
We have been facing a challenging
and complex new set of threats

1340
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,902
for this region.

1341
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,948
lran's ballistic missiles prove to
be a significant risk to this area.

1342
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:40,077
The proposed ground-based...
interceptors...

1343
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:42,746
..will...

1344
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,417
Will what?

1345
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,963
Naughty, naughty.

1346
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:54,758
You didn't say the magic word.

1347
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,720
- You must be Mrs Jakovic.
- Yes.

1348
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:02,099
I can't believe I've been here
so many times and we never met.

1349
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,101
Who on earth is this person?

1350
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,729
I'm one of your husband's whores.

1351
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:14,653
Let's see, hmm.

1352
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,657
"America's commitment
to its allies."

1353
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:24,329
Well, if that commitment includes
covering up sodomy and murder,

1354
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:28,542
I guess Branco and Bill here
are your guys.

1355
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,510
- That's enough of that.
- No, it's not enough. Not nearly.

1356
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,971
Home movie time.

1357
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:53,192
Stop! What are you doing?

Oh, my God!

1359
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,782
What did you do?!

1360
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,868
Sabina! Sabina!

1361
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,661
Wake up.

1362
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,039
- Take this... Get it off now.
- Someone stop him!

1363
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,124
NOW!

1364
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,977
(SERBO-CROATIAN)
What are you doing? Come with me.

1365
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,687
Whoo!

1366
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,649
- You're beautiful.
- Ready for more?

1367
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,070
No-one in or out.
Full containment.

1368
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:41,573
- Full containment. Understood.
- OK, guys, we're on. Let's go.

1369
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,131
Do you need a moment?

1370
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,022
Stop. Hands up. Now.

1371

Who the hell are you?

1372

I'm Carver's man. How do you do?

1373
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:24,867
Ah, it's nice to finally meet you.

1374
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:27,578
Everybody
move into the main ballroom.

1375
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,454
Move, please.

1376
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:34,126
Let's go. Main ballroom. Move.

1377
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:37,129
You two, Pixie and Dixie,
how do you fit into all this?

1378
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,006
We're private investigators.

1379
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,968
That's great.

1380
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:45,888
Why is that funny?
Man, we got a website.

1381
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,891
Don't forget all those people
just saw that tape.

1382
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,935
Ah, yes, those poor people.

lnnocent victims
of another terrorist atrocity.

1384

What are you using there? C4?
HMX?

1385
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,027
What is this, 1982?

1386
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:03,322
This is ONC, Octanitrocubane.

1387
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,325
The most powerful non-nuclear
explosive in development.

1388
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,578
A sugar cube of this shit
would take out a tank.

My, my. You're really
going all the way, aren't you?

Yes, I'm all in on this hand.

may I have your attention?

We have an active situation.
Gunmen are on the premises.

We are keeping you in here
for your safety.

1395
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,181
We have refreshments for you.

1396

Hopefully, the matter will be
resolved quickly.

- Nobody wants any food.

01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,505
Sir, now's the time to leave.

1401
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,925
- Take care of them.
- Yes, sir.

1402
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,682
- Is the code all set?
- Yes, sir. Just hit send.

1403
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,558
Like to blow up
a lot of this country.

1404
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,686
Except for the beautiful women.

1405
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,733
What are you doing?

1406
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,488
Wait. Before you shoot us all,

1407
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:30,993
there's just one thing
I wanted to do before I die.

1408
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,132
Down! Down! Down!

1409
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,353
What's our contingency plan?

1410
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,981
We need to get you in the air
immediately.

1411
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,109
There's a bird standing by
at a private airstrip.

1412
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,196
I'm working on a plan
to make this all disappear.

1413
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,619
Pay attention.
Go out the back way.

1414
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,413
I have a little business
to attend to.

1415
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,291
Catalina. Take this.

1416
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,960
- What is it?
- Something for a rainy day.

1417
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,129
I'm sorry about your friend.

1418
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,923
It's the job.

1419
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,258
Numbs you.

1420
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,177
Look after Mummy, will you?

1421
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,725
Jesus.

1422
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,103
Come on. Go, go.

1423
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:25,524
Oh, man.

1424
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,360
AAAARGHHHH!

1425
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,637
God forgive me.

1426
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:59,141
Who am I kidding? Here goes.

1427
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,981
It's not connecting.

1428
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,859
- You push "send", right?
- Yes. The code is set.

1429
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:11,570
What the helI's wrong
with this thing?

1430
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,419
Are you OK?

1431
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:33,341
(SERBO-CROATIAN) I have a bomb!
Get back! Move!

1432
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,616
Ah, yeah, yeah, here it goes.

1433
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,831
- You got it?
- Yeah, let's go.

1434
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,922
- What the fuck?
- Spot of tea?

1435
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,634
Do you need a moment?

1436
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,970
Shit.

1437
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:33,526
I was just starting to like her, too.

1438
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:37,197
She was cool. Killer cool.

1439
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:53,046
Good afternoon.
Ju-An Detective Agency.

1440
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:54,798
Can you hold, please?

1441
01:40:54,798 --> 01:41:00,784


1442
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,600
Jeffrey Leeds on line three.

1443
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,338


1444
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,818
There it is. I'm on the news.

1445
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,822
Hey, baby, how's it going?

1446
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,365
Hi, there.

1447
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,033
Hey, we're on the news again.

1448
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:26,413
- Did Julian say anything stupid?
- I don't know yet. How's it going?

1449
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,416
Great.
I've found an amazing house.

1450
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:34,762


1451
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:37,924
Are you still
coming over next week?

1452
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,051
Yeah, the flight gets in at 1 1 .

1453
01:41:40,051 --> 01:41:45,004


1454
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,519
I gotta go. Julian's interview's
on. I'll see you on Friday.

1455
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,855
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Bye.

1456
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,940
What's going on?
What are you saying?

1457
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,151
Hey, man, check it out.

1458
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:57,902
You look good. You look sharp.

1459
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:59,821
I always look sharp.

1460
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,323
Oh, watch, watch.

1461
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,117
You're not supposed to look
in the camera.

1462
01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:07,672


1463
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,082
- That's cool.
- You gotta talk to her.

1464
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,294
- ..at www. ...
- And that's the shocking story.

1465
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,422
It's a little tacky,
using the news for advertising.

1466
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,468
You gotta strike while the iron
is hot. Carpe diem. Seize the day.

1467
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:25,467
You know? Feed the beast.
Get it while the getting's good.

1468
01:42:25,867 --> 01:42:32,206


1469
01:42:33,174 --> 01:42:39,264
