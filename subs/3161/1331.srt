{\fn方正舒体\fs29}跃马旅店

6
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,664
我快要渴死了 快点倒酒!
I'm dying of thirst over here. C'mon, come on!

7
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:57,832
给你
Here you are.

8
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,638
- 看着点!  - 对不起 亲爱的
- Watch it!  - Sorry, darling.

9
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:07,941
- 给你  - 啊 谢了
- Here you are.  - Ah, thank you.

10
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,447
介意我坐这里吗?
Mind if I join you?

11
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:49,847
我要一样的
I'll have the same.

12
00:02:56,205 --> 00:03:01,805
做个自我介绍吧 我叫甘道夫 灰袍甘道夫
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf, Gandalf the Grey.

13
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,605
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

14
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:08,005
是啊! 真巧啊 在这里遇到你
Well, now! This is a fine chance.

15
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,605
不知索林・橡木盾来布理有何贵干?
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

16
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:21,705
我听说 有人看见我父亲在登兰德附近的野外出现过
I received word, that my father has been seen wandering the wilds near Dunland.

17
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:26,805
我去找过 没有他的踪迹
I went looking, found no sign of him.

18
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:32,605
索林 很长一段时间以来 关于瑟莱因的消息全都是流言
Thorin, It has been a long time since anything but rumour was heard of Thrain.

19
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:36,605
我很肯定 他还活着
He still lives, I am sure of it.

20
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:43,955
我父亲失踪之前来找过你
My father came to see you before he went missing.

21
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,505
你对他说了什么?
What did you say to him?

22
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,605
我劝他出兵埃雷勃
I urged him to march upon Erebor.

23
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,305
统领矮人的七支军队
To run the seven armies of the dwarves.

24
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:55,505
打败巨龙 夺回孤山
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.

25
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,552
而现在我也要对你说同样的话
And I would say the same to you,

26
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:00,859
去夺回你们的家园
take back your homeland.

27
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,605
今天的相遇不是巧合 对吧 甘道夫?
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

28
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:12,400
不 不是
No. It is not.

29
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,953
我很担心孤山的事 索林 那条巨龙盘踞在那的时间够长了
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough.

30
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:23,037
黑暗势力迟早会盯上埃雷勃
Sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

31
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:27,944
我在绿大道上碰见了几位不速之客
I ran into some unsavory characters, whilst travelling along the Greenway.

32
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,754
他们把我当成了流浪汉
They mistook me for a vagabond.

33
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,520
我猜他们现在很后悔
I imagine they regretted that.

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,604
其中一人身上带着这个
One of them was carrying a message.

35
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,521
这是黑语
It is Black Speech.

36
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,719
一份悬赏布告
A promise of payment.

37
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,794
悬赏什么?
For what?

38
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,798
你的人头
Your head.

39
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,705
有人想要你的命
Someone wants you dead.

40
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:59,505
索林 你不能再等了 你是都灵王室的继承人
Thorin, you could wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin.

41
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:03,976
召集矮人的军队 只要团结起来 你们就有...
Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together, you have the might and power...

42
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,736
夺回埃雷勃的力量
to retake Erebor.

43
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,854
召开七大矮人家族的会议
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families. 

44
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,754
命令他们履行誓言
Demand they stand by their oaths.

45
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:14,827
这七支军队誓言效忠拥有国王宝石...
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's jewel...

46
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,027
阿肯宝石的人
the Arkenstone.

47
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,525
这是唯一能让他们团结起来的东西
It is the only thing that would unite them.

48
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:22,244
而且我得提醒你一句 那颗宝石已经被史矛革偷走了
And in case you've forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

49
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:29,705
要是我能帮你拿回来呢?
What if, I were to help you reclaim it?

50
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,160
怎么拿回来?
How?

51
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,547
阿肯宝石远在千里之外
The Arkenstone lies half a world away.

52
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:38,005
深埋在喷火的巨龙脚下
Buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.

53
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:43,805
是啊 所以我们才需要一个飞贼
Yes, it does. Which is why we are going to need a burglar.

54
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,631
12个月后

56
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,405
- 敌人离我们多远?  - 很近
- How close is the pack?  - Too close.

57
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,424
不超过几里格 但这不是最可怕的
A couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.

58
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,424
{\an8}"里格"为距离单位, 1里格约等于4.8公里

59
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,902
- 奥克斯闻到我们的气味了?  - 还没有 不过也快了
- Have the Orcs picked up our scent?  - Not yet, but they will do.

60
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,002
我们还有个问题
We have another problem.

61
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,095
他们看见你了吗? 他们看见你了?
Did they see you? They saw you?

62
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,295
没有 没看见我
No, that's not it.

63
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,149
那就好 瞧我怎么说的? 像老鼠一样安静
Good, what did I tell you? Quite as a mouse.

64
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,860
- 出色的飞贼人选!  - 你们听我说
- Excellent burglar material!  - Will you listen.

65
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,013
就不能听我说完吗?
Will you just listen?

66
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:07,085
我要告诉你们的是 那边还有别的东西
I'm trying to tell you, there is something else out there.

67
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:12,415
什么样的... 像熊一样的吗?
What form did it take... Like a bear?

68
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:16,799
是 差不多 不过要大得多!
Ye... yes, yes. But, bigger, much bigger!

69
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,805
你知道这个怪兽?
You knew about this beast?

70
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:24,205
- 我觉得我们应该原路返回  - 然后被一队奥克斯追杀?
- I say we double back.  - And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

71
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,627
有座房子
There is a house.

72
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:32,462
离这不是太远 我们可以到那里避一避
It's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

73
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,487
房子的主人是敌是友?
Whose house, a friend or a foe?

74
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,763
都不是
Neither 'en.

75
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:42,805
他要么会帮我们... 要么会杀死我们
He will help us... or he will kill us.

76
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,605
我们有别的选择吗?
What choice do we have?

77
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,905
没有
None.

Come on, lads!

00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,205
那是什么?
What is that?

90
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:15,805
那是房子的主人
That is our host.

91
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:22,805
他叫比翁
His name is Beorn.

92
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,705
是个换皮人
And he is a skin-changer.

93
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,572
有的时候 它是只大黑熊
Sometimes, he is a huge black bear.

94
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,837
有的时候 他是个强壮的人
Sometimes, he is a great strong man.

95
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:37,022
黑熊的行为无法预知 但那个人还是讲道理的
The bear is unpredictable. But the man can be reasoned with.

96
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:41,291
但是 他也不是特别喜欢矮人
However, he's not over fond of Dwarves.

97
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,076
他走了
He is leaving.

98
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,676
离那里远点!
Come away from there!

99
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,988
那东西不对劲 
It's not natural. None of it.

100
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,605
他一定是被施了邪恶的咒语
It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

101
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,005
别犯傻了
Don't be a fool.

102
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,438
除了他自己 没人能对他施法
He is under no enchantment but his own.

103
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,638
好了!
Alright, now!

104
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,275
大家睡会儿吧
Get some sleep, all of you.

{\fn方正姚体}我们要在路上截杀他们

{\fn方正姚体}那橡木盾怎么办?

{\fn方正姚体}战争即将爆发

{\fn方正姚体}你答应过我要取他项上人头的

{\fn方正姚体}死亡将笼罩一切

{\fn方正姚体}我们不追杀了吗?

{\fn方正姚体}博格!

127
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,512
{\fn方正姚体}我要交给你一个任务

128
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,417
{\fn方正姚体}你还想喝矮人的血吗?

129
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:54,605
所以 你就是橡木盾?

直到奥克斯从北方袭来
before the Orcs came down from the north.

135
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,705
亵渎者杀死了我大部分的家人
The Defiler killed most of my family.

136
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,912
还有些沦为他的奴隶
But some he enslaved.

137
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:22,693
不是为他工作 你明白吗? 是为了娱乐
Not for work, you understand? But for sport.

138
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:28,805
把换皮人关起来折磨 对于他来说是件乐事
Caging skin changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

139
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,705
还有像你一样的人吗?
There are others like you?

140
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,905
之前有很多
Once there were many.

141
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,705
现在呢?
And now?

142
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,805
只剩我一个了
Now, there's only one.

143
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:47,605
你们得在秋天结束之前到达孤山
You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.

144
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:50,662
是啊 要在都灵日之前
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

145
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,852
你们快没时间了
You are running out of time.

146
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,448
所以我们才必须穿过幽暗密林
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

147
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:58,276
黑暗笼罩着那片森林
A darkness lies upon that forest.

148
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:01,705
腐朽之物在树下蔓延
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

149
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:07,705
墨瑞亚的奥克斯和多尔古多的亡灵法师结成了联盟
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

150
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:12,205
除非不得已 我是不会冒这个险的
I will not venture there, except in great need.

151
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,316
我们走精灵大道 那条路还是安全的
We will take the Elven road. Their path is still safe.

152
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:17,646
安全?
Safe?

153
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,096
幽暗密林的木精灵和其他同族可不一样
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin.

154
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,506
他们没那么睿智 却更危险
They are less wise and more dangerous.

155
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:27,705
但这不重要
But it matters not.

156
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,605
这话什么意思?
What do you mean?

157
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,922
这片区域遍布着奥克斯
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

158
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,070
他们的数量在增长
Their numbers are growing.

159
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,605
而你们只靠走路 永远不可能活着到达那片森林
And you are on foot. You will never reach the forest alive.

160
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,705
我不喜欢矮人
I don't like Dwarves.

161
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,415
他们贪婪...
They are greedy...

162
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,847
盲目
and blind.

163
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,647
总是无视那些他们认为比自己低等的生命
Blind to the lives of those they deem less than their own.

164
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:09,205
不过我更恨奥克斯
But Orcs, I hate more.

165
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,805
你们需要什么?
What do you need?

166
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,605
快走吧 趁现在天亮
Go now, while you have the light.

167
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,605
你们的敌人就在后面不远处
Your hunters are not far behind.

168
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,805
精灵之门
The Elven Gate.

169
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,805
这就是穿过幽暗密林的路
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

170
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,929
附近没有奥克斯
No sign of the Orcs.

171
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,185
我们还算幸运
We have luck on our side.

172
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:09,605
松开矮种马吧 让它们回主人那去
Set the ponies loose, let them return to their master.

173
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:16,189
这片森林... 看起来不太好
This forest... feels sick.

174
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,218
好像生了病一样
As if a disease lies upon it.

175
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,905
没有其它路可走了吗?
Is there no way around?

176
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:27,605
除非我们多走两百英里去北边 或者多走两倍距离...
Not unless we go 200 miles north or twice that distance...

177
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,805
去南边
south.

178
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,705
阴影中有东西蠢蠢欲动 无法看清
Something moves in the shadows, unseen.

179
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,505
它隐藏在深处
Hidden from outside.

180
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,805
积蓄的力量与日俱增
Everyday it grows in strength.

181
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,605
要小心亡灵法师
Beware the Necromancer.

182
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,605
他并非表面的样子
He's not what he seems.

183
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,605
如果大敌归来 我们一定要知道
If our enemy has returned, we must know.

184
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,605
去山上的那座坟墓
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

185
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,605
鲁道尔高
The High Fells.

186
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,805
那好吧
So be it.

187
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:40,605
把我的马留下 我还有用
Not my horse, I need it.

188
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,620
你不是要离开我们吧?
You're not leaving us?

189
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,320
如果不是万不得已 我不会这么做的
I would not do this unless I had to.

190
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,805
你已经变了 比尔博・巴金斯
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.

191
00:19:56,705 --> 00:20:00,205
你不再是当初离开夏尔的那个霍比特人了
You're not the same hobbit as the one left the Shire.

192
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,805
我得告诉你...
I was going to tell you...

193
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:13,855
在哥布林的隧道里 我发现了一样东西
I found something in the goblin tunnels.

194
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,105
什么?
Found what?

195
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:21,705
你发现了什么?
What did you find?

196
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,805
我的勇气
My courage.

197
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:32,805
好啊 太好了
Good. That's good.

198
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,374
你会需要它的
You will need it.

199
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:40,946
我会在前面埃雷勃的望城之处等你们
I will be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor.

200
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,703
注意保管好地图!
Heed the map and keep it safe!

201
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,805
没有我 你们先不要进入孤山
Do not enter that mountain without me.

202
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,739
这不仅仅是绿林
This is not the Greenwood alone.

203
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,557
林中的空气浑浊不堪 使人迷幻
The very air of the forest is heavy, with illusion.

204
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,308
它会侵入你的意识...
It will seek to enter your mind...

205
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,068
- 让你误入歧途  - 误入歧途?
- and lead you astray.  - Lead us astray?

206
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:06,004
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

207
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:08,233
你们必须沿着路走!
You must stay on the path!

208
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,480
不要走岔路 如果你们走错了...
Do not leave it. If you do...

209
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,688
就永远都找不到路了
you'll never find it again.

210
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,849
无论发生了什么 待在大路上!
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

211
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,931
快走吧! 我们必须在都灵日日落之前到达孤山
Come on! We must reach the mountain, before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

212
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,177
这是我们找到那扇门的唯一机会
It's our one chance to find the hidden door.

213
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,454
这条路拐到了这边
The path turns this way.

214
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:04,949
这边
This way.

215
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:15,110
空气...
Air...

216
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,210
我需要空气
I need air.

217
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,290
我的头... 好晕!
My head... It's spinning!

218
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,490
- 出什么事了?  - 继续走
- What's happening?  - Keep moving.

219
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,180
诺里 为什么停下了?
Nori, why have we stopped?

220
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,590
路不见了!
The path, it's disappeared!

221
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,843
- 出什么事了?  - 我们迷路了!
- What's going on?  - We've lost the path!

222
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:34,477
快找路!
Find it!

223
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:37,449
所有人 快点 找找那条路在哪!
All of you, look. Look for the path!

224
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:49,338
我不记得了 这个地方好混乱
I don't remember, this place is a mess.

225
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:51,052
一点都不像是走过的
None of it is familiar.

226
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,186
应该就在这里啊
It's got to be here.

227
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,497
现在是什么时候了?
What hour is it?

228
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:58,612
不知道 我连今天是哪天都不知道
I don't know, I don't even know what day it is.

229
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:03,283
这该死的地方简直走不到头!
Is there no end to this accursed place!

230
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:48,553
瞧 一个烟袋
Look, a tobacco pouch.

231
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,801
这林子里还有别的矮人!
There's dwarves in these woods!

232
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,982
而且是蓝山来的矮人
Dwarves from the Blue Mountain, no less.

233
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,473
- 这和我的烟袋一模一样!  - 因为那就是你的
- This is exactly the same as mine!  - Because it is yours.

234
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,059
明白吗? 我们在兜圈子 我们迷路了
Do you understand? We're going around in circles, we are lost.

235
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,052
我们没迷路 我们一直在朝东走
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

236
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,987
可哪里是东边? 我们看不到太阳!
But which way is the east? We've lost the sun!

237
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:10,413
太阳
The sun.

238
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:14,433
我们得找到... 太阳
We have to find... the sun.

239
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:16,568
上面
Up there.

240
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:17,868
我们得...
We need to...

241
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,888
够了! 安静! 统统闭嘴
Enough! Quiet! All of you.

242
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,472
我们被盯上了
We are being watched.

243
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:23,185
我能看见... 一个湖!
I can... see a lake!

244
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,361
还有... 河流
And the... river.

245
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,649
还有孤山
And the Lonely Mountain.

246
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,145
我们就快到了!
We are almost there!

247
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:35,524
听见了吗?
Can you hear me?

248
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,764
我知道该往哪走了!
I know which way to go!

249
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:43,212
嘿?!
Hello?!

250
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:54,418
听到吗
Hello.

251
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,493
杀了他们! 杀了他们! 趁他们还活着 赶紧吃掉
<i>Kill them. Kill them! Eat them now while all their blood is running.</i>

252
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,193
他们的皮可真硬
<i>Their hide is tough.</i>

253
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,041
这只大概比较可口
<i>This could be smushy inside.</i>

254
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:00,310
快点搞定
<i>Finish it off.</i>

255
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,923
留活口有啥用... 杀了他 杀了他 杀了他 快!
<i>Who needs it alive... Let us kill him. Kill him, kill him, now!</i>

256
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:06,675
我们要好好享用... 享用... 享用
<i>Let us feast... feast... feast.</i>

257
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:10,158
美食... 美食!
<i>Feast... feast!</i>

258
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:21,858
那是什么?
<i>What is it?</i>

259
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,886
肥美多汁!
<i>Fat and juicy!</i>

260
00:28:35,351 --> 00:28:38,385
就尝一口!
<i>Just a little taste!</i>

261
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,964
该死的! 在哪儿? 在哪儿!
<i>Curse it! Where is it? Where is it?!</i>

262
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,170
这儿!
Here!

263
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,113
好痛... 嘶! 叮了一口好痛!
<i>It stings... Stings!</i>

264
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:04,724
刺叮
Sting.

265
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:06,817
这名字不错
That's a good name.

266
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:09,940
刺叮
Sting.

267
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,556
比尔博在哪?
Where is Bilbo?

268
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,181
我在这儿!
I'm up here!

269
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,903
在哪里? 在哪里?
Where is it? Where's it?

270
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:19,542
快点! 去哪儿了?
Come on! Where is it?

271
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,602
索林!
Thorin!

272
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,467
基利!
Kili!

273
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,452
我的!
Mine!

274
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,753
快点 跟上!
Come on, keep up!

275
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,535
没有危险了!
We are clear!

276
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:23,687
别以为我不会干掉你 矮人
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

277
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,013
我乐意奉陪
It would be my pleasure.

你要是以为我会给你武器 那就大错特错了 矮人
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf, you are mistaken.

嘿 拿回来! 这是私人物品!
Hey, give it back! That's private!

- 你兄弟?  - 那是我老婆!
- Your brother?  - That is my wife!

你不打算搜我的身吗?
Aren't you going to search me?

304
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,722
我裤裆底下可能还有东西?

Or, nothing.

这不是奥克斯的地牢 这是林地王国的宫殿
This is no Orc dungeon. These are the Halls of the Woodland realm.

315
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:25,220
没有国王的同意 谁也别想出去
No one leaves here, but, by the King's consent.

316
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:33,179
一些人以为 这将是一场神圣的征程
Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand.

317
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:38,390
屠杀恶龙 夺回家园
A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon.

318
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:44,152
我却怀疑 真正的动机并不那么高尚
I myself, suspect a more prosaic motive.

319
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,327
盗窃财宝...
Attempted burglary...

你找到了密道?
You have found a way in?

你妄图找回那颗赋予你统治权的珠宝

孤山里也有我想要的珠宝

白宝石 如星光般纯粹

我放你离开

条件是将我的东西归还于我
If you but return what is mine.

礼尚往来

我不会相信你 瑟兰杜伊

伟大的王 信守自己的诺言 直到世界终结

I've seen how you treat your friends. We came to you once...

忍饥挨饿 流离失所
Starving, homeless, seeking your help.

可你却转头离开!
But you turned your back!

343

我曾面对过... 北方的巨龙
I have faced... the great serpents of the north.

Keep our lands, clear of those foul creatures. That is your task.

414
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,268
如同你的承诺
Like your promise.

415
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:43,305
我曾漫步于星光之下
I have walked there sometimes.

416
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:46,684
越过森林 徜徉于夜空
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

417
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:51,469
我看到世界逐渐远去
I have seen the world full away.

418
00:43:52,149 --> 00:43:55,387
而纯白的光芒 渗透每一丝气息
And the white light, forever filled the air.

419
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,233
我曾见过一轮火月
I saw a fire moon once.

420
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:06,387
巨大的月亮从登兰德的小道边升起 金红的月光洒满天空
It rose off the path near Dunland. Huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.

421
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:12,510
我们当时正护送一队路因山脉的商人 他们...
We were in escort with some merchants in Ered Luin. They were...

422
00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:16,095
用银器交易皮毛 我们由绿大道向南
trading in silver work for furs. We took the Greenway south,

423
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:18,210
迷雾山脉在左侧绵延
keeping the mountain to our left.

424
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:20,398
紧接着 它出现了
But then, it appeared.

425
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:24,613
一轮巨大的火月照亮了道路
This huge fire moon lights in our path.

426
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,584
我真希望能让你看看...
I wish I could show you...

427
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,683
加立安 你这老混账! 我们酒快喝完了
Galion, you old rogue! We're running out of drink.

428
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:34,872
那些空木桶几小时前就该送去埃斯加洛斯
These empty barrels should have been sent to Esgaroth hours ago. 

429
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,718
巴德正等着呢
Bard have been waiting for them,

430
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:41,923
随你怎么说我们那对酒品味极高的坏脾气国王
Say what you like about our ill tempered King who has excellent taste in wine.

431
00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:44,890
来 爱洛斯 尝尝
Come, Elros, try it.

432
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:47,054
我还得监管矮人
I have the dwarves in my charge.

433
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:50,163
他们被锁着 能上哪儿去?
They're locked up, where can they go?

434
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:58,237
我敢打赌太阳升起来了 肯定快到黎明了
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

435
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,655
我们永远到不了孤山了 对吗?
We never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

436
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,594
能逃出去就不会了
Not stuck in here you're not.

437
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,358
比尔博!
Bilbo!

438
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,512
附近有守卫!
There are guards nearby!

439
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,615
- 那是什么?  - 你先走
- What's that?  - You first.

440
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,225
- 欧里!  - 不是那条路 往下走... 跟着我!
- Ori!  - Not that way. Down here... follow me!

441
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,793
- 往哪?  - 跟上 快!
- Which way?  - Come on, go!

442
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,164
这边走
This way.

443
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:08,085
- 快啊  - 简直不敢相信 我们在酒窖里!
- Come on.  - I don't believe, we're in the cellars.

444
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:10,073
你应该带我们逃得远远的... 逃去别的地方
You're supposed to be leading us unknown... further away.

445
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,752
- 我知道自己在干什么  - 嘘
- I know what I'm doing.  - Shhh.

446
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,648
好吧 这边 这边
Okay, this way. This way.

447
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,743
大家都爬进木桶里... 快!
Everyone, climb into the barrels... quickly!

448
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,577
你疯了? 他们会找到我们的
Are you mad? They will find us.

449
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:25,137
不 不会的! 我保证
No, no. They won't! I promise you.

450
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:28,610
拜托 拜托了... 你们必须相信我
Please, please... You must trust me.

451
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,494
照他说的做
Do as he says.

452
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:54,711
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

453
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:58,126
- 别呼吸  - 别呼吸... 你什么意思?
- Hold your breath.  - Hold my breath... What do you mean?

454
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,475
管地牢钥匙的人在哪儿?
Where is the keeper of the keys?

455
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,746
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}跟我来!
<i>Come now!</i>

456
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,458
干得好 巴金斯老爷
Well done, Master Baggins.

457
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:58,280
我们走 快点!
Go, come on let's go!

458
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:09,472
抓牢了!
Hold on!

459
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:23,248
比尔博!
Bilbo!

460
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:38,388
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}把门关上!

461
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,189
不!
No!

462
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:12,978
小心!
Watch out!

463
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,584
<i>Kill them! Quickly!</i>
{\fn方正姚体}杀了他们! 快点!

464
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,520
{\fn方正姚体}全给我杀了!

465
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:34,648
快到桥上去!
Get over the bridge!

466
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,916
去死!
Die!

467
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:14,579
基利!
Kili!

468
00:50:21,222 --> 00:50:22,045
基利!
Kili!

469
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:39,245
杀了她! 杀了那个女精灵!

470
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,661
<i>The dwarves are escaping!</i>
{\fn方正姚体}矮人要逃了!

471
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,583
{\fn方正姚体}追!

472
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:16,779
基利!
Kili!

473
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,943
诺里!
Nori!

474
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,832
砍断树干!
Cut the log!

475
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,800
邦博!
Bombur!

476
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:41,386
<i>Tauriel!</i>
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}陶瑞尔!

477
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:42,863
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}等等!

478
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:47,639
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}别杀他 留活口

479
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:52,574
{\fn方正姚体}追 宰了他们！

480
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:59,492
<i>Don't let them go away!</i>
{\fn方正姚体}别让他们跑了!

481
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,769
哦 是你啊
Oh, it's you.

482
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,969
干嘛叫我来这里 甘道夫?
Why am I here, Gandalf?

483
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:46,245
相信我 拉达加斯特 我不会平白无故叫你到这里来
Trust me, Radagast. I would not have call you here without good reason.

484
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:54,570
- 这可不是见面的好地方  - 没错
- This is not a nice place to meet.  - No.

485
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:58,247
的确不好
It is not.

486
00:56:58,326 --> 00:57:01,425
这些是邪恶咒语 甘道夫
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

487
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:04,583
很古老... 而且充满仇恨
Old... And full of hate.

488
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,783
这里埋的是谁?
Who's buried here?

489
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:09,518
如果他有名字 那也早被忘记了
If he had a name, it's long since been lost.

490
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:13,808
人们只知道他是侍奉邪恶的
He would've been known only as a servant of evil.

491
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,221
其中一人
One of a number.

492
00:57:22,836 --> 00:57:25,502
是九戒之一
One of nine.

493
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:29,518
为什么是现在 甘道夫?
Why now, Gandalf?

494
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:33,102
- 我不明白! - 戒灵已经被召唤去多尔古多
- I don't understand!  - The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

495
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:35,525
但召唤他们的不可能是亡灵法师
But, it cannot be the Necromancer.

496
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,791
人类法师无法召唤这种恶灵
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

497
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:41,479
召唤者不是人类
Who said it was human.

498
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,234
九戒只听从一人的差遣
And, Nine only answers to One Master.

499
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:49,484
我们都被蒙蔽了 拉达加斯特
We've been blind, Radagast.

500
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:50,879
在我们疏忽大意时...
And in our blindness...

501
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:54,461
大敌已当前
The Enemy has returned.

502
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:58,667
他在召唤自己的仆人
He is summoning his servants.

503
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,561
"亵渎者"阿佐格不只是个普通猎人
Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.

504
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:07,614
他是整个军队的首领
He is a commander, the commander of legions.

505
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:11,543
我们的大敌... 正为战争准备
The Enemy... is preparing for war.

506
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,997
战争会从东边开始 他定会攻下那座山
Which will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.

507
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:19,101
- 你要去哪儿?  - 和其他人会合
- Where are you going?  - To rejoin the others.

508
00:58:19,377 --> 00:58:21,006
甘道夫!?
Gandalf?!

509
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,876
一切因我而起 我不能丢下他们
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

510
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,587
他们现在命在旦夕
They're in grave danger.

511
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,965
如果你所言不虚
If what you say is true.

512
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:32,000
世界正面临巨大的危机
The world is in grave danger.

513
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,686
森林里的那股力量只会变得越来越强
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

514
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:40,700
你要我丢下自己的朋友
You want me to cast my friends aside.

515
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:44,751
有东西跟着吗?
Anything behind us?

516
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:46,219
我没有看到
Not that I can see.

517
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:54,016
- 我想我们甩掉奥克斯了  - 他们很快会追上来 
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.  - Not for long. We've lost the current.

518
00:58:54,486 --> 00:58:55,754
我们都快淹死了!
We are almost half drowned!

519
00:58:56,727 --> 00:58:58,201
上岸去!
Make for the shore!

520
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:00,366
快点! 我们走
Come on! Let's go.

521
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,678
我没事 没关系
I'm fine, it's nothing.

522
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:25,887
- 站起来  - 基利受伤了 得帮他包扎伤口
- On your feet.  - Kili is wounded. His leg needs binding.

523
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:28,647
一群奥克斯在追我们呢 不能停
There's an Orc pack at our tail. We keep moving.

524
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,643
- 去哪儿?  - 去孤山 我们都快到了
- To where?  - To the mountain. We are so close.

525
00:59:31,843 --> 00:59:34,868
中间还隔着一个湖
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

526
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:37,575
- 我们没法过去  - 那我们就绕过去
- We have no way to cross it.  - So then, we go arround.

527
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,423
奥克斯会很快就会追上来 时间也不够
The Orcs will run us down, as sure as daylight.

528
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,282
我们没有武器 不能自保
We have no weapons to defend ourselves.

529
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,482
快点帮他包扎好
Bind his leg, quickly.

530
00:59:45,522 --> 00:59:48,035
给你们两分钟
We have two minutes.

531
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:10,516
敢再来一次 你们的小命就没了
Do it again and you are dead.

532
01:00:12,397 --> 01:00:15,912
不好意思... 你是长湖镇来的吗?
Excuse me, but uh... You're from Lake-town?

533
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,112
如果我没搞错的话
If I'm not mistaken.

534
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,747
那边那艘驳船
That barge over there,

535
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:24,481
我们可不可以租下来?
it wouldn't be available for hire by any chance?

536
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,252
你从哪里看出来我会帮你?
What makes you think, I would help you?

537
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,355
你的靴子很旧了
Those boots have seen better days.

538
01:00:30,555 --> 01:00:32,348
大衣也很寒碜
As has that coat.

539
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:35,493
你家里应该有好几张嘴要喂吧
I've no doubts you have some hungry mouths to feed.

540
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,208
有几个人?
How many bairns?

541
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:40,545
一个男孩 两个女孩
A boy and two girls.

542
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:44,588
还有你夫人 我想她应该是个美人吧?
And your wife, I imagine she's as a beauty?

543
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,433
没错
Aye.

544
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,239
生前是
She was.

545
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:55,801
- 对不起 我不是有意...  - 哦 得了! 别再装好人了
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...  - Oh, come on! C'mon, enough with the niceties.

546
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:59,310
- 你们着急什么?  - 问这个干嘛?
- What's your hurry?  - What's it to you?

547
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,510
我想知道你们是谁
I would like to know who you are.

548
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,091
跑到这里来干什么
And what you are doing in these lands.

549
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:07,046
我们不过是商人 来自蓝山
We are simple merchants, from the Blue Mountains.

550
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:10,417
要去铁丘陵探望几个亲戚
Journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

551
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:13,580
你说你们只是商人?
Simple merchants, you say?

552
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,557
我们需要食物 供给 还有武器
We need food, supplies, weapons.

553
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:19,194
你能帮我们吗?
Can you help us?

554
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,805
我知道这些酒桶的来历
I know where these barrels came from.

555
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:30,128
- 怎么了?  - 我不知道你们和精灵做了什么生意
- What of it?  - I don't know what business you had with the elves.

556
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:32,951
不过看起来 结果不太好
But, I don't think it ended well.

557
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:37,261
只有镇长才能带人进镇子
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of the master.

558
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:40,647
和林地王国做生意 是他唯一的财源
All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.

559
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:43,878
为了不让瑟兰杜伊生气 他会把你们关进监狱 
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

560
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:46,699
多给他点好处
Offer him more.

561
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:52,251
我打赌肯定有不为人知的路进镇子
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

562
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:53,934
是啊
Aye.

563
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,964
但那样的话...
But for that...

564
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,319
- 你得找个蛇头  - 我们会付钱的
- you would need a smuggler.  - For which we would pay.

565
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,414
双倍价钱
Double.

566
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,955
邪恶本就如此
Such is the nature of evil.

567
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:18,244
在大地上 无知正愈演愈烈 跋扈横行
Out there in the vast, ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.

568
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:21,098
在黑暗中孕育着不详
A shadow that grows in the dark.

569
01:02:21,098 --> 01:02:26,668
这股不眠不休的邪恶力量 比即将到来的夜晚更加黑暗
A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.

570
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:32,334
过去如此... 未来亦是如此
So it ever was... So will it always be.

571
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:37,043
届时 所有的秽物都会出世
In time, all foul things come forth.

572
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:41,598
为什么你要跟着那十三个矮人?
You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves, why?

573
01:02:41,598 --> 01:02:45,054
现在没有十三个了
Not thirteen, not anymore.

574
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:49,244
那个黑头发的年轻弓箭手
The young one, the black head archer.

575
01:02:49,444 --> 01:02:52,473
我们用魔窟箭射中了他
We stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

576
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,462
毒素已进入他的血液
The poison's in his blood.

577
01:02:55,662 --> 01:02:57,480
很快 他就要小命不保了
He'll be choking on it soon.

578
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:00,022
我问什么 你答什么 下贱东西! 
Answer the question, filth!

579
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:03,107
{\fn方正姚体}我不跟狗讲话 女精灵!

580
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:07,930
千万别惹她
I would not antagonize her.

581
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,602
你喜欢杀戮 奥克斯?
You like killing things, Orc?

582
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:12,736
喜欢有人丧命?
You like death?

583
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:14,883
那就让我先送你上路!
Then, let me give it to you!

584
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:16,058
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}够了!

585
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,342
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}陶瑞尔 退下!

586
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,161
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}立刻退下

587
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:35,347
我不在乎那个矮人的死活 回答问题
I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

588
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:37,552
你没什么好怕的
You have nothing to fear.

589
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:41,538
把你知道的告诉我们 我就还你自由
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

590
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,550
有人命令你杀了他们 为什么?
You had orders to kill them, why?

591
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,861
索林・橡木盾跟你什么关系?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

592
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:51,170
- 那个矮人畜生永远当不了国王  - 当国王?!
- The dwarf runt will never be king.  - King?!

593
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,128
现在没有山下之王 以后也不会有
There is no king under the mountain, nor will there ever be.

594
01:03:54,775 --> 01:03:57,126
没人敢进埃雷勃
None would dare enter Erebor.

595
01:03:57,126 --> 01:04:00,463
- 只要那龙还活着 就没人敢进去  - 你什么都不知道
- Whilst the dragon lives.  - You know nothing.

596
01:04:00,663 --> 01:04:03,348
你的世界要完蛋了
Your world will burn.

597
01:04:03,348 --> 01:04:06,531
什么意思? 说!
What are you talking about? Speak!

598
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:09,959
我们的时代又要到了
Our time has come again.

599
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:15,161
我的主人 侍奉的是那位大人
My master serves... The One.

600
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:18,030
这样说你明白了吗 精灵?
Do you understand now, Elfling?

601
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,900
你的死期要到了
Death is upon you.

602
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:24,154
战火... 就要降临!
The flames... of war, are upon you!

603
01:04:27,214 --> 01:04:28,795
为什么这样做?
Why did you do that?

604
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,792
你保证过要还他自由
You promised to set him free.

605
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:32,365
我没有食言
And I did.

606
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:37,743
他可怜的脑袋自由了 离开了可憎的肩膀
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

607
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,537
他本来还能多告诉我们些事情
There was more the orc could tell us.

608
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:43,358
他能招的都招了
There was nothing more he could tell me.

609
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:46,755
战火是什么意思?
What did he mean by the flames of war?

610
01:04:46,955 --> 01:04:52,076
意思就是 他们会解放强力的武器 杀掉所有阻挡之人
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great, it will destroy all before it.

611
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:56,186
边境 所有道路 还有河道的守卫都要加倍
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.

612
01:04:56,186 --> 01:04:58,258
没有我的命令不准擅动
Nothing moves but I hear of it.

613
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,891
这个王国 没人能进来...
No one enters this kingdom...

614
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:03,199
也没人能出去
And no one leaves it.

615
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,234
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}把门关上!

616
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,719
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}把门封上 这是国王的命令

617
01:05:11,596 --> 01:05:12,768
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}陶瑞尔怎么办?

618
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:16,762
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}她怎么了?

619
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,371
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}她跑进森林里了...

620
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:20,984
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}穿着铠甲 带着弓箭

621
01:05:21,591 --> 01:05:23,178
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}还没回来

622
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:48,780
{\fn方正姚体}矮人的血!

623
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:50,203
{\fn方正姚体}他们来过这儿!

624
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,488
{\fn方正姚体}还有另一种气味...

625
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,108
{\fn方正姚体}人的味道!

626
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:06,296
{\fn方正姚体}他们找到了去湖对岸的方法

627
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:29,053
小心!
Watch out!

628
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:40,361
你打算干嘛 淹死我们?
What are you trying to do, drown us?

629
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:43,427
我就是在这片水域长大的 矮人老爷
I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf.

630
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:46,794
就算我想把你们淹死 也不会在这儿动手
If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.

631
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,389
我受够了这个嘴碎的船夫了
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy lake-man.

632
01:06:51,389 --> 01:06:52,904
要我说 我们把他从这里丢下去...
I say, we throw him off the side...

633
01:06:52,904 --> 01:06:56,227
- 这样就摆脱他了  - 别这样 人家有名字... 他叫巴德
- and be done with him.  - No, Bard... His name is Bard.

634
01:06:56,227 --> 01:06:57,333
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

635
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:01,839
- 我问过他  - 我不管他叫什么 我不喜欢他
- Ah, I asked him.  - I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.

636
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,463
我们不用喜欢他 付他钱就好了
We do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.

637
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:08,593
好了 兄弟们 把钱都交出来
Come on now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

638
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:12,748
- 我们怎么知道他不会背叛我们?  - 我们不知道
- How do we know he won't betray us?  - We don't.

639
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:17,094
嗯... 有点小麻烦
There's um... just a wee problem.

640
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:19,267
我们还差十个金币
We are ten coins short.

641
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:22,021
格洛因
Gloin.

642
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:24,880
别藏了 都交出来
Come on, give us what you have.

643
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,024
看我干嘛
Don't look to me.

644
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:30,996
这趟冒险要把我榨干了
I have been bled dry by this venture.

645
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:34,163
我投资的回报呢?
What have I seen for my investment?

646
01:07:34,363 --> 01:07:38,008
除了那些倒霉 糟糕玩意儿 还有...
Nought but misery, grief, and...

647
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:47,881
老天啊
Bless, my beard.

648
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:49,830
拿去
Take it.

649
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,192
全拿去
Take all of it.

650
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:57,565
钱呢 快拿来! 快给我
The money, quick! Give it to me.

651
01:07:57,565 --> 01:08:00,169
等到了地方 我们再付钱 之前免谈
We will pay you when we get our provisions. But not before.

652
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:02,924
如果你还想要自由之身 就照我说的办
If you value your freedom, you will do as I say.

653
01:08:02,924 --> 01:08:05,490
前面有守卫
There are guards ahead.

654
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:24,288
嘘 他在干嘛?
Ssh. What is he doing?

655
01:08:24,925 --> 01:08:26,617
他在跟人说话
He is talking to someone.

656
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:30,465
他... 正指着我们
He is... pointing right at us.

657
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:35,724
- 他们在握手了  - 什么?
- Now they're shaking hands.  - What?

658
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:38,160
他把我们给卖了
He's selling us out.

659
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:00,685
老天啊!
Oh, good God!

660
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:01,885
安静!
Quite!

661
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:06,129
我们要过收费站了
We are approaching the toll gate.

662
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:20,075
停船! 货物检查
Halt! Goods inspection.

663
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:22,570
请出示文件!
Papers, please!

664
01:09:23,404 --> 01:09:26,038
- 哦 是你啊 巴德!  - 早上好 珀西
- Oh, it's you, Bard!  - Morning, Percy.

665
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,731
- 有什么要报关的吗?  - 没有
- Anything to declare?  - Nothing,

666
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,945
但我又累又冷 很想回家
but I am cold and tired. I'm ready for home.

667
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:34,490
同感
You and me, both.

668
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:40,097
就这样 一切都好
There we are, all in order.

669
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,151
先... 等等
Not... so... fast.

670
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:46,193
受委托从林地王国
Consignment of empty barrels,

671
01:09:46,393 --> 01:09:48,319
运来木桶
from the Woodland realm.

672
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,322
只不过...
Only...

673
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:55,528
现在桶里有东西 对不对 巴德?
they are not empty, are they, Bard?

674
01:09:55,528 --> 01:10:00,024
如果我记得没错 根据登记 你是个船夫
If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman.

675
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:02,522
不是...
Not...

676
01:10:02,522 --> 01:10:04,102
渔民
a fisherman.

677
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:05,886
那跟你没关系
That's none of your business.

678
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:10,943
你错了 跟镇长有关的事情 就跟我有关系
Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

679
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,887
哦 得了... 阿尔弗雷德 发发善心 大家还得吃东西呢!
Oh, come on... Alfrid. Have a heart. People need to eat!

680
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:16,907
这些鱼是非法的
These fish are illegal.

681
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:18,735
把鱼倒进湖里
Empty barrels over the side.

682
01:10:18,735 --> 01:10:20,720
- 大家都听见了  - 倒进湖里
- You heard him.  - In the canal.

683
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:23,820
快点... 动手
Come on... Get a move on.

684
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:26,516
镇上的乡亲们正度日如年
Folk in this town are struggling.

685
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:28,951
时世艰难 食物短缺
Times are hard. Food is scarce.

686
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:30,754
那不关我的事
That's not my problem.

687
01:10:30,754 --> 01:10:34,461
要是人们听说镇长把鱼倒回湖里呢?
And when people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake?

688
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:36,733
他们起义怎么办?
When the rioting starts?

689
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:42,137
那就关你的事了吧?
Will it be your problem, then?

690
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:47,522
住手!
Stop!

691
01:10:50,102 --> 01:10:53,079
想做英雄是吗 巴德?
Ever the people's champion, eh, Bard?

692
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,634
保护老百姓 他们可能现在会拥护你 但是划船的
Protector of the common folk. You might have their favor now, bargeman,

693
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,329
好景不会太长
but it won't last.

694
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,437
升起闸门!
Raise the gate!

695
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:09,956
镇长一直盯着你呢 你最好记清楚了
The Master has his eyes on you. You'll do well to remember.

696
01:11:09,956 --> 01:11:11,707
我们知道你的住处
We know where you live.

697
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:12,907
这是个小镇 阿尔弗雷德
It's a small town, Alfrid.

698
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:17,158
大家都知道彼此的住处
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

699
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,808
镇上谣言满天飞
All this talk of civil unrest,

700
01:11:34,808 --> 01:11:36,980
有人唯恐天下不乱 大人
someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.

701
01:11:40,202 --> 01:11:41,520
痛风发作了吗 大人?
Gout playing out, Sire?

702
01:11:41,554 --> 01:11:43,527
湿气太重! 只可能是这个原因
It's the damp! It's the only possible explanation.

703
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,480
给我一杯白兰地
Now, get me a brandy.

704
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:49,566
大人 人们的情绪越来越糟
The mood of the people, Sire. It's turning ugly.

705
01:11:49,566 --> 01:11:50,766
他们不过是小老百姓 阿尔弗雷德
They are commoners, Alfrid.

706
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,887
他们的情绪一直很糟
They've always been ugly.

707
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:57,215
他们住在这个腥臊烂臭的地方又不是我的错
It's not my fault they live in a place that stinks of fish, oil and tar.

708
01:11:57,644 --> 01:12:02,995
工作 住房... 食物 总有他们抱怨的地方
Jobs, shelter... food. It's all they ever bleat about.

709
01:12:02,995 --> 01:12:06,938
大人 我认为他们是被闹事者鼓动了
It's my believe, Sire, they're being lead on by troublemakers.

710
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:11,894
我们一定要找到那些闹事者 将他们绳之以法
Then, we must find these troublemakers. And arrest them.

711
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,643
我也是这么想的 大人
My thoughts exactly, Sire.

712
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:17,216
所有流言必须终结
And all this talk of a change must be suppressed.

713
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:21,037
我们不能让那群乌合之众联合起来 引发麻烦
We can't afford to let the rabble band together, start making noises.

714
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,662
否则他们下一步就会开始质问我们
The next thing you know, they will start asking questions,

715
01:12:24,662 --> 01:12:26,049
成立委员会
forming committees.

716
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:28,950
调查我们
Launching enquiries.

717
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,843
或是用新人取代老人
Out with the old, in with the new.

718
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:33,043
什么?
What?

719
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,297
这是我听说的 大人
That's what I've been saying, Sire.

720
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:38,956
- 他们甚至在讨论... 改选  - 改选?
- There is even talk... of an election.  - An election?

721
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,566
荒唐可笑! 我绝对不会支持
That's absurd! I won't stand for it.

722
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:45,884
恐怕他们不会过问您的意见 大人
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

723
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:51,071
缩头乌龟 忘恩负义!
Shirkers, ingrates!

724
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:52,170
蛊惑人心的家伙!
Rabble rousers!

725
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,715
是谁胆敢质疑我的权威?
Who would have the nerve to question my authority?

726
01:12:55,915 --> 01:12:58,903
谁敢! 是谁?
Who would dare! Who?

727
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:05,049
巴德!
Bard!

728
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:10,334
你记着... 这个船夫一定是谣言背后的主谋
You mark my words, that... trouble making bargeman is behind all this.

729
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,779
把手拿开!
Get your hands off me!

730
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:28,736
你没见过他们 他们也从没来过
You didn't see them. They were never here.

731
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,741
这些鱼白送给你了
The fish, you can have for nothing.

732
01:13:34,445 --> 01:13:35,549
跟我来!
Follow me!

733
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:46,054
爸!
Da!

734
01:13:46,578 --> 01:13:49,091
我们家... 被人监视了!
Our house... It's being watched!

735
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:26,841
你可以告诉镇长 我今天的工作都完成了
You can tell the Master I am done for the day.

736
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:29,549
爸!
Da!

737
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:30,885
你去哪里了?
Where have you been?

738
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:34,120
父亲 你回来了! 我担心死了
Father, there you are! I was worried.

739
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,358
给你 西格丽德
Here, Sigrid.

740
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:37,653
巴恩 让他们进来
Bain, get them in.

741
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:49,529
如果你跟任何人说起这事 我就把你的手拧下来!
If you speak of this to anyone, I'll rip your hands off!

742
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,672
别碰我
Get it off.

743
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,589
从那上去
Up there.

744
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:07,383
爸 为什么这些矮人会从我们的马桶里爬出来?
Da, why the dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

745
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:09,461
他们会给我们带来好运吗?
Will they bring us luck?

746
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:15,886
衣服可能不怎么合身 但能让你们暖和起来
They may not be the best fit, but they will keep you warm.

747
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:18,534
没有关系 谢谢
Oh, it's fine. Thank you.

748
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,971
矮人的风弩!
The dwarvish wind-lance!

749
01:15:30,971 --> 01:15:32,171
你看上去像见到鬼了
You look like you've seen a ghost.

750
01:15:33,355 --> 01:15:35,523
确实是
He has.

751
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,456
我们最后一次看到这种弓弩时
The last time we saw such a weapon,

752
01:15:38,656 --> 01:15:41,729
镇上烽火四起
the city was on fire.

753
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,351
巨龙到来的那天
It was the day the dragon came.

754
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:50,391
也是史矛革摧毁长湖镇的那天
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

755
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:57,843
长湖镇长吉瑞安 召集他的弓箭手齐力进攻巨龙
Girion, the lord of the city, rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast.

756
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:02,850
但龙的鳞甲非常坚硬 比最结实的战甲还要坚硬
But, a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.

757
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:06,864
只有用风弩发射的黑箭
Only a black arrow fired from a wind-lance

758
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:09,572
才能穿透龙甲
could have pierced the dragon's hide.

759
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:12,913
但这种箭却很稀少
And few of those arrows were ever made.

760
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:22,742
当吉瑞安发起最后一击时 这种箭已经所剩无几
The store was running low when Girion made his last attempt.

761
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:32,224
如果那天吉瑞安真的射中了龙
The aim of men had been true that day,

762
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:35,335
一切都会不同了
much would be different.

763
01:16:38,957 --> 01:16:41,221
说得好像你当时在场似的
You speak as if you were there.

764
01:16:42,437 --> 01:16:44,772
所有矮人都知道这个传说
All dwarves know the tale.

765
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:47,278
那你应该知道吉瑞安射中了巨龙
And, you would know that Girion hit the dragon.

766
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,441
他在龙的左翼留下了一处伤疤
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

767
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:51,629
再多一击 就可以杀死巨龙
One more shot and he would have killed the beast.

768
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:56,015
这只是一个传说 仅此而已
That's a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

769
01:16:57,054 --> 01:16:59,462
你收了我们的钱
You took our money.

770
01:16:59,498 --> 01:17:01,996
那我们的武器呢?
Where are the weapons?

771
01:17:03,312 --> 01:17:04,897
在这等着
Wait here.

772
01:17:19,471 --> 01:17:21,305
明天就是秋天的最后一天了
Tomorrow begins the last days of Autumn.

773
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:23,777
都灵之日从后天早上开始
Durin's day falls the morning after next.

774
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,165
我们必须在那之前赶到孤山
We must reach the mountain before then.

775
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:27,502
要是我们没赶上呢?
And, if we do not?

776
01:17:27,702 --> 01:17:30,703
如果在时限之前 我们没能找到秘门
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time,

777
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:32,535
那这次远征就毫无意义了
then this quest has been for nothing.

778
01:17:44,056 --> 01:17:47,063
- 这是什么?  - 长矛钩
- What is this?  - Pike hook.

779
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:49,170
用旧鱼叉改造的
Made from an old harpoon.

780
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:51,146
- 这个呢?  - 我们叫它"柄锤"
- And this?  - A crowbill, we call it.

781
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:53,058
照着铁匠铺的锤子打造的
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

782
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:54,969
它拿在手里有些沉 但是...
It's heavy in hand, I grand. But...

783
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:58,240
自卫之时 聊胜于无
In defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

784
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,070
我们给你钱是买武器的
We paid you for weapons.

785
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:04,255
我们要的是真刀实枪的铁家伙!
Iron forged, swords and axes!

786
01:18:04,455 --> 01:18:06,134
这简直是儿戏!
It's a joke!

787
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,134
在镇上兵器库之外 你找不到更好的了
You won't find better outside the city armory.

788
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:12,965
所有的真家伙都被锁在兵器库里了
All iron forged weapons are held there under lock and key.

789
01:18:12,965 --> 01:18:16,784
索林 我们何不带上这些家伙什儿去偷呢?
Thorin, why not take what's on offer and go?

790
01:18:16,784 --> 01:18:19,143
我赤手空拳都可以 你们也是
I've made do with less, so have you.

791
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:24,109
- 要我说 我们现在就出发  - 你们哪也不能去!
- I say, we leave now.  - You're not going anywhere!

792
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:26,554
- 你说什么?  - 有探子在监视这所房子
- What did you say?  - There are spies watching this house,

793
01:18:26,554 --> 01:18:29,081
甚至镇上所有码头都可能被监视了
and probably every dock and wharf in the town.

794
01:18:30,057 --> 01:18:31,822
你们必须要等到天黑
You must wait till nightfall.

795
01:18:48,035 --> 01:18:49,789
索林
Thorin.

796
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:04,129
爸?
Da?

797
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:08,418
别让他们离开
Don't let them leave.

798
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,128
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}我以为你是奥克斯

799
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:36,991
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}如果我是奥克斯...

800
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,654
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}你早就死了

801
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,844
陶瑞尔...
Tauriel...

802
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:45,521
你不可能凭一己之力猎杀三十个奥克斯
You cannot hunt thirty orcs on your own.

803
01:19:45,521 --> 01:19:47,559
但我不是一个人在战斗
But I'm not on my own.

804
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,297
你知道我会跟来的
You knew I would come.

805
01:19:52,019 --> 01:19:53,996
国王很生气 陶瑞尔
The King is angry, Tauriel.

806
01:19:54,444 --> 01:19:57,700
六百年来 我父亲一直保护你 宠爱你...
For 600 years my father has protected you, favoured you...

807
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:01,079
你却违抗了他的命令 背叛了他的信任
you defied his orders. You betrayed his trust.

808
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,293
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}跟我回去吧...

809
01:20:04,293 --> 01:20:06,272
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}他会原谅你的

810
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:07,585
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}如果我回去

811
01:20:07,894 --> 01:20:10,673
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}我不会原谅自己

812
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:14,165
国王从未允许奥克斯进入我们的家园
The King has never let orc filth roam our lands.

813
01:20:14,165 --> 01:20:17,551
这次他却允许奥克斯越过我们的边境 追杀我们的囚徒
But he would let these orc packs cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

814
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,151
这不是我们的战斗
It is not our fight.

815
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:20,291
这就是我们的战斗
It is our fight.

816
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:23,106
它不会就此结束
It will not end here.

817
01:20:23,106 --> 01:20:26,083
它们每胜利一次 邪恶就会增长一分
With every victory, this evil will grow.

818
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:29,313
如果你父王固执已见 我们也束手无策
If your father has his way, we will do nothing.

819
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:31,469
我们只能东躲西藏
We will hide withing our walls.

820
01:20:31,469 --> 01:20:34,384
过着暗无天日的生活...
Live our lives away from the light...

821
01:20:34,384 --> 01:20:36,577
放任邪恶胡作非为
and let darkness descend.

822
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,975
我们不是这个世界的一份子吗?
Are we not part of this world?

823
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,295
告诉我 {\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs22}朋友
Tell me, <i>mellon</i>,

824
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:45,368
我们何曾允许邪恶凌驾于我们?
When did we let evil become stronger than us?

825
01:20:50,394 --> 01:20:52,836
你好 巴德 你在找什么?
Hello Bard, who are you after?

826
01:20:54,457 --> 01:20:55,997
这里曾经有一块挂毯
There was a tapestry.

827
01:20:56,217 --> 01:20:57,447
很古老的那种
An old one.

828
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,160
- 哪去了?  - 你说的是什么挂毯?
- Where is it gone?  - What tapestry are you talking about?

829
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:01,687
就是这个!
This one!

830
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:05,215
我跟你们说 他们是凭空冒出来的一群矮人
They were dwarves I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.

831
01:21:05,215 --> 01:21:08,787
满脸络腮胡子 个子很矮 我从没见过长那样的人
Full beards, fierce eyes. I've never seen the like.

832
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:13,034
- 矮人到我们这里来干什么?  - 这是预言
- What are dwarves doing in these parts?  - It's the prophecy.

833
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,583
- 什么预言?  - 关于都灵族矮人的预言
- What prophecy?  - Prophecy of Durin's folk.

834
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:26,553
预言?
Prophecy?

835
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:30,875
预言
Prophecy.

836
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:32,900
那个古老的传说看来是真的了
The old tales may come true.

837
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,096
巨额的金银财宝!
Vast golds and treasure!

838
01:21:35,096 --> 01:21:38,859
真的吗? 银泉之王要回归了吗?
Can it really be true? Has the Lord of Silver Fountains returned?

839
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:42,713
银泉之王
The Lord of Silver Fountains.

840
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:44,968
石雕之王
The King of Carven Stone.

841
01:21:46,797 --> 01:21:49,615
孤山之王...
The king beneath the mountain...

842
01:21:49,615 --> 01:21:51,959
将回归他的王国
shall come into his own.

843
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:57,507
欢乐的钟声将会响起 庆祝孤山之王的回归
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.

844
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,787
然而世间万物将化为乌有
But all shall fade in sadness.

845
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:05,061
长湖镇终将生灵涂炭
And the lake will shine and burn.

846
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:09,639
- 爸 我已经尽力阻止他们了  - 他们离开多久了?!
- Da, I tried to stop them.  - How long have they been gone?!

847
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,653
嘘 小声点
Shh. Keep it down.

848
01:22:15,653 --> 01:22:18,350
我们一拿到武器就直接往孤山赶
As soon as we have the weapons, we'll make straight for the mountain.

849
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,550
快... 快... 快!
Go... go... go!

850
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:25,690
下一个!
Next!

851
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:42,524
- 你行吗?  - 没问题
- Are you alright?  - I can manage.

852
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:43,724
赶紧离开这里
Let's just get out of here.

853
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,210
快跑!
Run!

854
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:30,503
这是什么情况?
What is the meaning of this?

855
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:32,687
我们当场抓住了偷兵器的 大人
We caught them stealing weapons, Sire.

856
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:35,826
哦 我们的敌人... 嗯?
Ah, enemies of the state... eh?

857
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:39,088
他们可能是一群雇佣兵 大人
A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, Sire.

858
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,777
闭嘴!
Hold your tongue!

859
01:23:42,945 --> 01:23:45,745
你知不知道你在跟谁说话!
You do not know to whom you speak!

860
01:23:45,745 --> 01:23:47,750
这可不是寻常的小偷
This is no common criminal.

861
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:51,243
他是索林 是瑟莱因之子...
This is Thorin. Son of Thrain...

862
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:52,443
瑟罗尔之孙
Son of Thror.

863
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:58,182
我们是埃雷勃的矮人
We are the dwarves of Erebor.

864
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:03,163
我们来重夺我们的家园
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

865
01:24:08,517 --> 01:24:11,630
我还记得长湖镇昔日繁华的盛景
I remember this town in the great days of old.

866
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:17,326
港口停泊着满载丝绸和宝石的船队
Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems.

867
01:24:17,326 --> 01:24:20,201
那时的长湖镇丝毫不显破败...
This was no forsaken town on a lake...

868
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:24,810
这里曾是整个北方的贸易中心
This was the center of all trade in the north.

869
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:27,905
我希望看到繁华再现
I will see those days returned.

870
01:24:27,905 --> 01:24:30,438
我希望重振矮人族的雄风
I would relight the great forges of the dwarves

871
01:24:30,849 --> 01:24:34,884
让财富再次从埃雷勃的大殿内流淌出来!
and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!

872
01:24:37,562 --> 01:24:38,903
死亡!
Death!

873
01:24:38,903 --> 01:24:41,583
这才是你将带给我们的
That is what you will bring upon us.

874
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,983
毁灭一切的龙焰
Dragon fire and ruin.

875
01:24:46,244 --> 01:24:48,718
如果你惊醒了那头巨兽
If you awaken that beast,

876
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:50,783
它会杀光我们所有人
it will destroy us all.

877
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:54,631
你们也可以听这个唱反调的 但我向你们保证
You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this:

878
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,579
如果我们成功了
If we succeed,

879
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:03,194
我们将共享孤山的财富
all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

880
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:11,408
你们将拥有黄金万两 足以重建埃斯加洛斯十次!
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!

881
01:25:13,269 --> 01:25:16,039
各位 请听我说!
All of you, listen to me!

882
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:19,574
请务必听我说 大家忘了曾经发生在长湖镇的事了吗?
You must listen. Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?

883
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,879
难道忘了那些葬身火海的人了吗?
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?

884
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:25,037
没有!
No!

885
01:25:26,438 --> 01:25:28,124
这个人为什么要重返孤山?
And for what purpose?

886
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,680
是因为他那想成为孤山之王的野心
The blind ambition of a Mountain King,

887
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,581
他被贪婪驱使 被自身的渴望蒙蔽了双眼!
so driven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

888
01:25:37,259 --> 01:25:43,646
安静 安静! 大伙儿谁都别急着推卸责任
Now, now! We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame.

889
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:49,157
大家别忘了 是长湖镇长吉瑞安
Let us not forget, that it was Girion, lord of Dale,

890
01:25:49,157 --> 01:25:53,609
也就是你的祖先没能把龙杀死!
your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast!

891
01:25:56,297 --> 01:25:59,536
他是对的 大人 我们都知道这个故事
He is true, Sire. We all know the story.

892
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:05,924
他射了一箭又一箭 但都没能命中
Arrow after arrow, he shot. Each one missing it's mark.

893
01:26:12,326 --> 01:26:13,882
你没有权力
You have no right.

894
01:26:15,223 --> 01:26:17,266
没有权力进山
No right to enter that mountain.

895
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:21,667
我是唯一有权力进去的
I have the only right.

896
01:26:27,293 --> 01:26:30,626
敢问长湖镇镇长
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.

897
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:32,619
你愿意看到预言成真吗?
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

898
01:26:34,136 --> 01:26:39,736
你愿意分享我族的巨大财富吗?
Will you share in the great wealth of our people?

899
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:46,071
你说呢?
What say you?

900
01:26:49,253 --> 01:26:52,755
我会对你说...
I say unto you...

901
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:55,628
欢迎!
welcome!

902
01:26:55,628 --> 01:27:01,063
欢迎归来! 欢迎孤山之王!
Welcome and rise! Welcome, King Under the Mountain!

903
01:27:12,815 --> 01:27:14,225
你知道我们少了一个人吧?
You do know we're one short?

904
01:27:14,225 --> 01:27:16,775
- 波弗在哪?  - 他不在这 我们要把他留下
- Where is Bofur?  - He is not here, we'll leave him behind.

905
01:27:16,775 --> 01:27:17,975
我们必须如此
We will have to,

906
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:21,431
才能在黄昏前找到大门 我们耽搁不起了
if we are to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.

907
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:27,458
你不能上
Not you.

908
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:30,424
我们必须快速前进 你会拖慢我们
We must travel at speed. You will slow us down.

909
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,273
你说什么呢? 我要跟你们一起走
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

910
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:34,273
不 不行
No, no.

911
01:27:39,761 --> 01:27:42,047
大门开启时我要在场
I'm going to be there when that door's opened.

912
01:27:42,047 --> 01:27:44,405
当看到父辈的大厅时我要在场 索林...
When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...

913
01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:48,965
基利 留在这... 好好休息
Kili, stay here... rest.

914
01:27:48,965 --> 01:27:51,168
痊愈了之后再加入我们
Join us when you're healed.

915
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:59,750
我要跟他一起 我的任务是照顾病人
I'll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.

916
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,950
舅舅...
Uncle...

917
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:04,912
我们听着孤山的故事长大 是你告诉我们的...
we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us...

918
01:28:04,957 --> 01:28:06,779
你不能剥夺他亲眼见证的机会
You cannot take that away from him.

919
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:08,602
- 菲利  - 必要的话 我可以背着他
- Fili.  - I will carry him, if I must.

920
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:11,279
等你有天成为了国王 你就明白了
One day you will be King and you will understand.

921
01:28:11,849 --> 01:28:15,204
我不能为了一个矮人而置远征的结果于不顾
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf.

922
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,331
是我的亲人也不行
Not even my own kin.

923
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:25,224
菲利 别傻了 你应该跟大伙一起
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

924
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:26,474
我要跟弟弟在一起
I belong with my brother.

925
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:41,942
天啊! 时间到了!
By my beard! Is that the time!

926
01:28:43,227 --> 01:28:46,375
带着我们的祝福上路吧
Go now with our good will.

927
01:28:48,558 --> 01:28:54,236
- 愿你们带着财富归来与众共享!  - 等等!
- and may your return bring fortune to all! - Wait!

928
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,634
再见!
Goodbye!

929
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,823
你们也错过上船时间了吗?
Did you miss the boat as well?

930
01:29:16,823 --> 01:29:18,023
基利? 基利!
Kili? Kili!

931
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:25,033
不 我受够矮人了 走开!
No. I am done with dwarves. Go away!

932
01:29:25,378 --> 01:29:26,850
别 别 求你了!
No, no. Please!

933
01:29:26,885 --> 01:29:28,938
没人帮助我们 基利病了
No one will help us. Kili is sick.

934
01:29:31,568 --> 01:29:33,474
病得非常严重
He is very sick.

935
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:15,329
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

936
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:17,604
曾经是河谷城所在
It was once the city of Dale.

937
01:30:18,591 --> 01:30:20,121
现在只是一片废墟
Now, it is a ruin.

938
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:25,407
- 史矛革荒漠  - 太阳快到中天了
- The Desolation of Smaug.  - The sun will soon reached mid-day.

939
01:30:25,407 --> 01:30:28,326
在太阳下山之前 我们必须找到进山的秘门
We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets.

940
01:30:28,326 --> 01:30:31,234
- 这边!  - 慢着 这是... 望城之处吗?
- This way!  - Wait. Is this... the overlook?

941
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:35,268
- 甘道夫说在这里会和 千万别自己...  - 你看到他了吗?
- Gandalf said to meet him here, on no account were we to...  - Do you see him?

942
01:30:35,268 --> 01:30:37,697
我们没时间等巫师了
We have no time to wait on our wizard.

943
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,780
我们得靠自己了 走吧!
We are on our own. Come!

944
01:30:56,774 --> 01:30:58,945
多尔古多
Dol Guldur.

945
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:01,248
法师的巢穴
The hill of sorcerer.

946
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,607
看起来完全荒废了
It looks completely abandoned.

947
01:31:03,607 --> 01:31:05,651
本该如此
As it is meant to.

948
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:09,958
这个地方被施了封锁咒
A spell of concealment lies over this place.

949
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:13,967
说明大敌尚未准备好显露真身
Which means our Enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself.

950
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:20,308
他还没有完全恢复力量
He has not regained his full strength.

951
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,552
拉达加斯特 我需要你带信给加拉德瑞尔女士
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to Lady Galadriel.

952
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:26,143
告诉她 我们必须逼他出手
Tell her, we must force his hand.

953
01:31:26,343 --> 01:31:28,716
- 什么意思?  - 我要一个人进去
- What do you mean?  - I am going in alone.

954
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:31,835
千万不要跟着我
On no account come after me.

955
01:31:37,722 --> 01:31:41,532
- 保证吗?  - 好 好... 我保证

956
01:31:53,362 --> 01:31:55,060
甘道夫 等等!
Wait Gandalf!

957
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,955
如果是陷阱怎么办?
What if it's a trap?

958
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:00,718
转过身去...
Turn around...

959
01:32:00,753 --> 01:32:03,393
不要回头
and do not come back.

960
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,187
这无疑是个陷阱
It's undoubtedly a trap.

961
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:47,942
{\fn方正硬笔行书简体\fs23}藏匿于此的恶魔...

962
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:51,385
{\fn方正硬笔行书简体\fs23}我命你现身!

963
01:32:52,487 --> 01:32:55,123
{\fn方正硬笔行书简体\fs23}我命你现出真身!

964
01:33:10,059 --> 01:33:13,721
<i>Ce na ulco sis nurtaina...</i>
{\fn方正硬笔行书简体\fs23}藏匿于此的恶魔...

965
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,772
<i>I ettuluvas caninye!</i>
{\fn方正硬笔行书简体\fs23}我命你现身!

966
01:33:16,851 --> 01:33:19,303
{\fn方正姚体}巫师来了

967
01:33:19,684 --> 01:33:21,555
{\fn方正姚体}他在解除咒语...

968
01:33:21,925 --> 01:33:23,255
{\fn方正姚体}他会找到我们的!

969
01:33:23,757 --> 01:33:26,519
{\fn方正姚体}没错... 他会的

970
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,728
- 找到了吗?!  - 没有!
- Anything?!  - Nothing!

971
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:43,899
如果地图是真的 秘门就在我们正上方
If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us.

972
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:50,503
在上面!
Up here!

973
01:33:58,683 --> 01:34:01,526
眼睛很敏锐啊 巴金斯老爷
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

974
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:34,131
肯定就是它了
This must be it.

975
01:34:36,318 --> 01:34:37,774
隐蔽之门
The hidden door.

976
01:34:42,029 --> 01:34:46,710
让那些怀疑我们的人 后悔去吧!
Let all those who doubted us, rue this day!

977
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:54,672
嘿 我们有钥匙
Hey, we have a key.

978
01:34:56,284 --> 01:35:00,253
也就是说 某处有个锁眼
Which means, there'is somewhere there is a key hole.

979
01:35:01,006 --> 01:35:04,389
都灵之日的最后一束光...
The last light of Durin's day...

980
01:35:05,771 --> 01:35:07,722
将会照射在锁眼之上

981
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:18,490
- 诺里  - 好
- Nori.  - Yeah.

982
01:35:25,318 --> 01:35:27,176
光线要消失了 快!
We are losing the light, come on!

983
01:35:33,717 --> 01:35:36,334
安静 你拳打脚踢的 我听不清!
Be quiet. I can't hear when you're thumping!

984
01:35:36,334 --> 01:35:37,347
我找不到!
I can't find it!

985
01:35:38,964 --> 01:35:41,707
不在这! 根本不在这!
It's not here! It's not here!

986
01:35:43,049 --> 01:35:44,206
把门砸开!
Break it down!

987
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,654
加把劲!
Come on!

988
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:51,940
日光消失了
We lost the light.

989
01:35:52,473 --> 01:35:53,642
没用的!
It's no good!

990
01:35:53,642 --> 01:35:56,955
门被封闭了 用蛮力是打不开的!
The door is sealed. It can't be opened by force!

991
01:35:58,025 --> 01:35:59,705
上面有强大的魔法
Powerful magic on it.

992
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,044
不可能!
No!

993
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,755
"都灵之日的最后一束光
"The last light of Durin's day,

994
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:20,858
将会照射在锁眼之上"
will shine upon the keyhole."

995
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:27,995
上面就是这么说的
That is what it says.

996
01:36:31,474 --> 01:36:33,181
我们遗漏了什么?
What did we miss?

997
01:36:36,614 --> 01:36:39,003
我们漏了什么?
What did we miss?

998
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:40,203
巴林?
Balin?

999
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:42,690
光已经消失了
We have lost the light.

1000
01:36:44,889 --> 01:36:47,727
我们无能为力
There is no more to be done.

1001
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:50,136
我们只有一次机会
We had but one chance.

1002
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:56,116
走吧 大伙 我们走
Come away, lads. Let's move on.

1003
01:36:57,221 --> 01:36:58,631
等等 干嘛...
Wait a minute. What...

1004
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:03,213
他们去哪啊?
Where are they going?

1
01:37:05,225 --> 01:37:07,386
不能现在放弃!
You can't give up now!

2
01:37:21,867 --> 01:37:23,357
索林...
Thorin...

3
01:37:25,195 --> 01:37:27,329
现在不能放弃
you can't give up now.

4
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:44,696
画眉鸟敲击之时 站在灰色石头旁
Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks.

5
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:47,332
都灵之日的...
The setting sun...

6
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:50,786
最后一束阳光将会照耀
and the last light of Durin's day will shine.

7
01:37:52,511 --> 01:37:54,113
最后一束阳光...
The last light...

8
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:58,121
最后一束光
Last light.

9

这就是最后一束光!
And the last light!

10
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:47,020
锁眼!
The keyhole!

Come back! Come back!

12
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,896
是月亮的光 秋日里最后的月光!
It is the light of the moon. The last moon of autumn!

13
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,202
钥匙呢? 钥匙...
Where is the key? Where is the...

14
01:39:02,738 --> 01:39:04,334
刚才... 刚才还在这
It was... it was here.

15
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,293

这墙壁...
These walls...

20
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:32,874
这石块
this stone.

21
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:38,418
你记得吗 巴林?
You remember it, Balin?

22
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:44,183
房间里金光闪闪
Chambers filled with golden light.

23
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,058

这里坐落着都灵一族的第七个王国
Here in lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.

25
01:41:07,626 --> 01:41:15,014
愿山之心团结所有的矮人保卫家园
May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.

26
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:18,231
国王的宝座
The throne of King.

27
01:41:22,133 --> 01:41:25,009
上面那个是什么?
And what's that above it?

28
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:31,016
阿肯宝石
The Arkenstone.

29
01:41:31,935 --> 01:41:33,473
阿肯宝石
Arkenstone.

30
01:41:37,104 --> 01:41:38,917
那又是什么?
And what's that?

31
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:44,288
这个 飞贼先生 就是你此行的目的
That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.

32
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:05,281
你不能做点什么吗?
Can you not do something?

33
01:42:05,281 --> 01:42:07,919
我需要草药 能退烧的东西
I need herbs. Something to bring down this fever.

34
01:42:08,194 --> 01:42:10,847
我这里有龙葵 野甘菊...
I have nightshade, feverfew...

35
01:42:10,847 --> 01:42:13,374
这些都没用 你有王叶草吗?
They are no use to me. Do you have any kingsfoil?

36
01:42:13,374 --> 01:42:16,219
没有... 那是种杂草 我们都喂猪了
No... It's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

37
01:42:16,419 --> 01:42:20,486
猪? 杂草... 有了
Pigs? Weed... right.

38

别动
Don't move.

39
01:42:25,283 --> 01:42:29,306
你想让我... 去找宝石?

一颗又大又白的宝石 没错!

41
01:42:35,751 --> 01:42:38,356
就这样? 只是... 我觉得下面肯定有不少宝石
That's it? Only... I imagine there's quite a few down there.

42
01:42:38,356 --> 01:42:42,043
只有一颗阿肯宝石
There is only one Arkenstone.

43
01:42:42,243 --> 01:42:43,897
你见到了自然认得出
You will know it when you see it.

44
01:42:45,513 --> 01:42:46,490
好吧
Right.

01:42:50,355 --> 01:42:52,222
说实话 伙计...
In truth lad...

46
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:57,116
我... 不知道你到了下面会看到什么
I... do not know what you will find down there.

47
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:02,434
你不想的话可以不去 回头没什么好丢人的
You needn't go if you don't want to. There's no dishonor in turning back.

48
01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:04,312
不... 巴林!
No... Balin!

49
01:43:05,052 --> 01:43:07,067
我答应了会做
I promised I would do this.

50
01:43:07,633 --> 01:43:09,280
我必须得试试
And I think I must try.

51
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:16,959
- 这总是让我很欣赏  - 什么?

霍比特人的勇气

55
01:43:37,563 --> 01:43:40,905

真的有条活龙
a live dragon down there,

57
01:43:46,548 --> 01:43:49,165
别吵醒它
don't waken it.

58
01:44:30,952 --> 01:44:34,980
<i>Ce na ulco sis nurtaina...</i>

62
01:45:01,718 --> 01:45:03,589

{\fn方正姚体}我们军团遍地!

01:45:30,686 --> 01:45:32,710
{\fn方正姚体}结束了

{\fn方正姚体}给我追

69
01:45:57,883 --> 01:46:00,081
{\fn方正姚体}巫师 没有什么光芒...

01:46:01,908 --> 01:46:05,509
{\fn方正姚体}可以战胜黑暗

01:52:47,441 --> 01:52:50,742
现身吧
Step into the light.

91
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:55,830
嗯...
Hhmmm...

92
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:01,158
你... 有点奇怪
There is... something about you.

93
01:53:03,242 --> 01:53:06,002
是你带的某样东西
Something you carry.

94
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:09,075
金子打造之物
Something made of gold.

95
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:14,855
但却无比... 珍贵!
But far more... precious!

96
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,710
你在这啊
There you there,

97
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:24,729
阴影中的小偷
thief in the shadows.

98
01:53:27,185 --> 01:53:29,658
我不是来偷您东西的
I did not come to steal from you.

99
01:53:29,858 --> 01:53:33,646
史矛革 拥有无人能及的财富
Oh Smaug, the unaccessibly wealthy.

100
01:53:33,646 --> 01:53:36,535
我只是想瞻仰一下您的威严
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence,

101
01:53:36,535 --> 01:53:40,560
看您是否像古老传说中那样伟大
to see if you really were as great as the old tales say.

102
01:53:40,932 --> 01:53:42,637
我不相信那些故事
I did not believe them.

103
01:53:51,912 --> 01:53:56,423
那么 现在呢?!
And, Do you now?!

104
01:53:57,177 --> 01:53:58,684
是真的
Truly.

105
01:53:59,523 --> 01:54:02,787
那些故事和歌谣
The tales and songs,

106
01:54:02,787 --> 01:54:07,443
还远未表出您的凶猛 史矛革啊...
fall utterly short of your enormity, oh Smaug...

107
01:54:07,443 --> 01:54:08,889
巨龙之躯
the Stupendous.

108
01:54:08,889 --> 01:54:12,225
你以为奉承可以让你活命吗?
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

109
01:54:12,754 --> 01:54:15,214
- 不... 没有  - 确实不会
- No... no.  - No, indeed.

110
01:54:17,915 --> 01:54:24,945
你看来很熟悉我的名字 但我却不曾闻到过你这种气味
You seem familiar with my name, but I don't remember smelling your kind before.

111
01:54:25,145 --> 01:54:29,402
你是谁 从哪而来?
Who are you and where do you come from?

112
01:54:29,402 --> 01:54:31,893
恕我好奇
May I ask?

113
01:54:41,266 --> 01:54:45,331
- 我从山下而来  - 山下?
- I come from under the hill.  - Under hill?

114
01:54:48,385 --> 01:54:52,230
我翻越了千山万岭
And under hills and over hills my path has led.

115
01:54:52,801 --> 01:54:54,237
然后... 
And... and

116
01:54:54,237 --> 01:54:56,574
在空气中穿梭 我可以隐身行走
through the air, I am he who walks unseen.

117
01:54:56,881 --> 01:54:58,478
令人敬佩
Impressive.

118
01:54:58,678 --> 01:55:01,832
你还有什么名头?
What else do you claim to be?

119
01:55:01,832 --> 01:55:02,549
我是...
I am...

120
01:55:05,822 --> 01:55:07,545
幸运随身者...
Luck wearer...

121
01:55:09,189 --> 01:55:13,482
- 谜语 谜语编造家  - 可爱的名头 继续
- Riddle, riddle maker.  - Lovely titles, go on.

122
01:55:14,085 --> 01:55:20,034
- 骑桶者  - 木桶 越来越有趣了
- Barrel rider.  - Barrels. Now that is interesting.

123
01:55:20,234 --> 01:55:25,076
那你的小矮人朋友呢?
Then what about your little dwarve friends?

124
01:55:25,076 --> 01:55:27,806
他们藏在哪儿?
Where are they hiding?

125
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:31,437
矮... 矮人?
Da... dwarves?

126
01:55:31,867 --> 01:55:36,444
不 不 不 这里没有矮人 你搞错了
No. No, no. No dwarves here. You've got that all wrong.

127
01:55:36,444 --> 01:55:41,080
我没搞错 骑桶者
I don't think so, barrel rider.

128
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:47,295
他们打发你来做些坏事 自己却躲在外面
They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.

129
01:55:47,908 --> 01:55:54,674
你真的搞错了 最令人敬畏的史矛革
Truly, you are mistaken, oh Smaug, chiefest and greatest of calamities.

130
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:01,200
你很有做小偷和骗子的潜质
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar.

131
01:56:02,556 --> 01:56:06,574
没有人比我更清楚
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

132
01:56:06,574 --> 01:56:08,586
矮人的品行了
No one better.

133
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,677
他们为金子而来
It is the gold,

134
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:16,272
他们爱金子 就像苍蝇爱腐肉
they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

135
01:56:18,585 --> 01:56:22,016
你以为我不知道会有这么一天吗?
Did you think I did not know this day would come?

136
01:56:23,427 --> 01:56:31,068
不知道总有一天那群伪善的矮人会爬上山来吗?
That a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain?

137
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:38,862
- 是地震吗?  - 这动静 伙计...
- Was that an earthquake?  - That, my lad...

138
01:56:41,993 --> 01:56:43,717
是条龙
was a dragon.

139
01:56:52,068 --> 01:56:54,486
- 爸?  - 从山上传来的
- Da?  - It's coming from the mountain.

140
01:56:58,593 --> 01:57:02,222
你先走吧 带上你的孩子离开这里
You should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.

141
01:57:02,422 --> 01:57:03,722
去哪儿?
And go where?

142
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:06,817
没有地方可以去
There is no where to go.

143
01:57:08,276 --> 01:57:10,441
我们会死吗 爸?
Are we going to die, Da?

144
01:57:12,044 --> 01:57:13,133
不会的 亲爱的
No, darling.

145
01:57:13,133 --> 01:57:15,549
那条龙会杀了我们的
The dragon, it's going to kill us.

146
01:57:26,153 --> 01:57:28,722
我先杀了它就不会了
Not if I kill it first.

147
01:57:29,701 --> 01:57:33,388
山下之王已经死了
The king under the mountain is dead.

148
01:57:33,388 --> 01:57:39,834
我登上了他的王座 吃了他的人民... 就像羊群中的狼
I took his throne, I ate his people... like a wolf among sheep.

149
01:57:42,951 --> 01:57:48,188
无论何时何地 我想杀就杀
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

150
01:57:48,188 --> 01:57:51,773
我的盔甲坚不可摧!
My armour is iron!

151
01:57:59,884 --> 01:58:03,257
刀枪不入!
No blade can pierce me!

152
01:58:06,237 --> 01:58:07,089
好 走吧
Alright.

153
01:58:07,505 --> 01:58:10,373
一支黑箭 为什么你没和我说过?
A Black Arrow. Why did you never tell me?

154
01:58:10,373 --> 01:58:12,026
因为你没必要知道
Because you did not need to know.

155
01:58:19,597 --> 01:58:23,262
好好听着 我需要你引开卫兵
Listen to me carefully, I need you to distract the guards.

156
01:58:24,126 --> 01:58:27,455
我一登上塔顶就会把箭装上
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I'll slip the arrow to the bow.

157
01:58:27,455 --> 01:58:29,824
他在那! 卫兵 追他!
There he is! Guards, after him!

158
01:58:29,824 --> 01:58:32,766
- 快点! 在下面! 快!  - 拦住他!
- Quickly! Down there! Go!  - Stop him!

159
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:40,415
拦住他!
Stop him!

160
01:58:48,587 --> 01:58:51,699
- 把箭藏好 不要让人找到  - 不!
- Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find  - No!

161
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:54,680
- 我来对付他们 现在快跑!  - 我不能离开你!
- I'll deal with them. Now, go!  - I can't leave you!

162
01:58:58,086 --> 01:58:59,916
- 布拉加?  - 你已被逮捕
- Braga?  - You are under arrest.

163
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:03,231
- 什么罪?  - 镇长说是什么罪就什么罪
- On what charge?  - Any charge the Master chooses.

164
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:48,135
- 比尔博怎么办?  - 给他点时间
- What about Bilbo?  - Give him more time.

165
01:59:48,335 --> 01:59:51,008
给他时间干嘛? 等着被杀吗?
Time to do what? To be killed?

166
01:59:52,701 --> 01:59:53,950
你怕了吗?
You are afraid?

167
01:59:55,657 --> 01:59:58,291
对... 我怕了
Yes... I'm afraid.

168
01:59:59,161 --> 02:00:01,818
我怕你现在的样子
I fear for you.

169
02:00:01,818 --> 02:00:04,261
那件宝藏会带来贪欲
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

170
02:00:04,261 --> 02:00:06,751
你的祖父就是那么疯的!
A sickness which drove your granfather mad!

171
02:00:06,751 --> 02:00:10,096
- 我和我的祖父不一样  - 你连自己都迷失了!
- I am not my grandfather.  - You're not yourself!

172
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:15,228
- 我认识的索林会毫不犹豫进去的  - 我不会... 
- The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.  - I will not risk this quest...

173
02:00:15,228 --> 02:00:18,435
为救一个飞贼而冒险的
for the life of one, burglar.

174
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:24,080
他有名字... 叫比尔博
Bilbo... His name is Bilbo.

175
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:33,027
是橡木盾...  那个可恶的矮人篡位者...
It's Oakenshield... That filthy dwarvish usurper...

176
02:00:35,075 --> 02:00:40,458
是他派你来拿阿肯宝石... 对吧?
He sent you in here for the Arkenstone... Didn't he?

177
02:00:40,458 --> 02:00:41,979
不! 不... 不
No! No... no.

178
02:00:41,979 --> 02:00:44,385
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

179
02:00:44,585 --> 02:00:46,521
不用否认了
Don't bother denying it.

180
02:00:46,521 --> 02:00:49,774
我早就猜到了他的阴谋诡计
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

181
02:00:51,259 --> 02:00:57,531
但没关系 橡木盾的计划不会得逞
But it matters not. Oakenshield's quest will fail.

182
02:00:58,567 --> 02:01:04,896
黑暗即将来临 淹没世界的每一个角落!
A darkness is coming. It will spread to every corner of the land!

183
02:01:35,862 --> 02:01:39,910
{\fn方正姚体}可恶的小矮人就在附近
<i>The filthy dwarf rats are somewhere here.</i>

184
02:01:40,478 --> 02:01:43,203
{\fn方正姚体}我闻到了
<i>I can smell them.</i>

185
02:01:47,818 --> 02:01:51,053
躲在阴影里的小偷 你被利用了  
You have been used, thief in the shadow.

186
02:01:51,053 --> 02:01:54,937
你永远只是达到目的的手段而已
You were only ever a means to an end.

187
02:01:55,733 --> 02:02:01,922
胆小的橡木盾衡量过你的生命价值了...
The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found...

188
02:02:01,922 --> 02:02:03,957
你一文不值!
it worth nothing!

189
02:02:03,957 --> 02:02:06,610
不 不 
No. No.

190
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:10,922
- 不 你在说谎  - 他向你承诺什么了?
- No, you're lying.  - What did he promise you?

191
02:02:10,922 --> 02:02:13,216
分你一份宝藏吗?
A share of his treasure?

192
02:02:13,967 --> 02:02:16,253
说得好像宝藏是他的一样
As if it were his to give.

193
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:23,585
我不会放弃一个子儿 一个都不会放弃!
I would not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it!

194
02:02:27,242 --> 02:02:30,251
我的牙齿尖如利剑!
My teeths are swords!

195
02:02:30,451 --> 02:02:33,895
我的爪子利如长矛!
My claws are spears!

196
02:02:35,972 --> 02:02:41,064
我的双翼... 强如暴风!
My wings... are a hurricane!

197
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,518
传说是真的
So, it is true.

198
02:02:48,106 --> 02:02:50,183
黑箭确实命中了目标
The black arrow found its mark.

199
02:02:50,183 --> 02:02:53,386
- 你说什么?  - 我只是说...
- What did you say?  - I was just saying...

200
02:02:53,386 --> 02:02:54,879
我久闻您的大名
your reputation preceeds you.

201
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:57,648
噢 君主史矛革...
Oh Smaug, the tyrannical...

202
02:02:58,003 --> 02:03:02,787
您确实是世上无人能及的
truly, you have no equal on this earth.

203
02:03:05,993 --> 02:03:10,165
为了看到橡木盾痛苦
I am almost tempted to let you take it,

204
02:03:10,165 --> 02:03:14,237
我差点让你拿到宝石了
if only to see Oakenshield suffer.

205
02:03:14,905 --> 02:03:21,155
这样就能看着宝石毁灭他 吞噬他的心灵...
Watch it destroy him. Watch it corrupt his heart...

206
02:03:21,155 --> 02:03:24,228
让他发狂!
and drive him mad!

207
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,919
但我想还是不要了 小游戏到此结束吧
But I think not, I think our little game ends here.

208
02:03:32,677 --> 02:03:38,773
小偷 告诉我 你想怎样死? 
So tell me, thief. How do you choose to die?

209
02:04:26,883 --> 02:04:28,243
{\fn方正姚体}矮人在那里!
<i>Dwarves!</i>

210
02:04:50,715 --> 02:04:52,798
爸? 是你吗 爸?
Da? Is that you, Da?

211
02:06:40,889 --> 02:06:43,088
{\fn方正姚体}橡木盾不在这!

212
02:06:44,147 --> 02:06:45,127
{\fn方正姚体}撤退!

213
02:06:45,525 --> 02:06:46,820
{\fn方正姚体}桥上集合!

214
02:07:05,422 --> 02:07:07,577
- 你把他们都杀了  - 还有其他的
- You've killed them all.  - There are others.

215
02:07:08,276 --> 02:07:09,504
陶瑞尔 走
Tauriel, go.

216
02:07:14,915 --> 02:07:17,404
他快死了!
We are losing him!

217
02:07:19,884 --> 02:07:20,903
陶瑞尔?
Tauriel?

218
02:07:44,743 --> 02:07:45,877
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}阿茜拉斯草(即王叶草)!
<i>Athelas!</i>

219
02:07:48,826 --> 02:07:50,575
{\fn方正苏新诗柳楷简体\fs23}阿茜拉斯草...
<i>Athelas...</i>

220
02:07:51,104 --> 02:07:52,957
你要做什么?
What are you doing?

221
02:07:55,064 --> 02:07:57,405
我要救他
I'm going to save him.

222
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:19,237
- 你还活着!  - 活不了多久了!
- You are alive!  - Not for much longer!

223
02:08:19,237 --> 02:08:21,115
- 你找到阿肯宝石了吗?  - 龙追来了!
- Did you find the Arkenstone?  - The dragon's coming!

224
02:08:21,115 --> 02:08:22,925
阿肯宝石呢?
The Arkenstone?

225
02:08:25,303 --> 02:08:26,930
你找到了吗?
Did you find it?

226
02:08:32,347 --> 02:08:33,727
没有 我们要赶紧离开
No. We have to get out.

227
02:08:37,021 --> 02:08:38,501
索林?
Thorin?

228
02:08:41,751 --> 02:08:43,310
索林!
Thorin!

229
02:09:13,408 --> 02:09:16,447
我要烧死你们!
You will burn!

230
02:09:24,573 --> 02:09:25,703
快点 比尔博!
Come on, Bilbo!

231
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:39,711
快走
Come on.

232
02:09:56,744 --> 02:09:58,135
压住他
Hold him down.

233
02:10:06,774 --> 02:10:10,486

嘘 小声点
Ssh. Ssh-ssh.

245
02:11:18,138 --> 02:11:23,177
- 我们甩开它了  - 不 它可狡猾了
- We've given him the slip.  - No. He is too cunning for that.

246
02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:28,212
- 那现在去哪儿?  - 西边的警卫室
- So, where to now?  - The western guard room.

247
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:30,192
可能有路可逃
There may be a way out.

248
02:11:30,758 --> 02:11:34,812
- 那里太高了 没可能逃出去  - 那是我们唯一的机会
- It's too high, there's no chance that way.  - It's our only chance.

249
02:11:36,426 --> 02:11:37,898
我们只能放手一搏
We have to try.

250
02:11:54,486 --> 02:11:55,696
来
Come on.

251
02:12:43,235 --> 02:12:46,752
我听过精灵神药的传说
I've heard tales of the wonders of elvish medicine.

252
02:12:47,128 --> 02:12:49,782
今天有幸亲眼看到了
That was a privelege to witness.

253
02:12:52,263 --> 02:12:53,444
陶瑞尔
Tauriel.

254
02:12:57,596 --> 02:12:58,964
躺着别动
Lie still.

255
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:08,250
你不可能是她
You cannot be her.

256
02:13:11,812 --> 02:13:13,887
她在遥远的地方
She is far away.

257
02:13:15,891 --> 02:13:22,140
她... 离我很远很远
She... she is far, far away from me.

258
02:13:23,022 --> 02:13:25,553
她行走在...
She walks...

259
02:13:25,553 --> 02:13:29,540
另一个世界的星光之下
under the stars in another world.

260
02:13:33,494 --> 02:13:35,505
只是个梦而已
It was just a dream.

261
02:13:47,261 --> 02:13:50,343
你觉得她爱过我吗?
Do you think she could've loved me?

262
02:13:56,769 --> 02:13:57,974
跟紧一点
Stay close.

263
02:14:07,999 --> 02:14:11,799
到尽头了 无路可走
That's it then. There's no way out.

264
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:20,363
我们同胞的尸骨
The last of our kin.

265
02:14:24,301 --> 02:14:26,733
他们肯定带着巨大的希望...
They must have come here...

266
02:14:26,733 --> 02:14:30,136
来到这里
hoping beyond hope.

267
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:41,397
在我生命的最后几天
We could try to reach the mines.

268
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:44,278
也许我们可以找到金矿
My last few days.

269
02:14:46,536 --> 02:14:48,065
不
No.

270
02:14:50,913 --> 02:14:53,351
我不会这样死去的
I will not die like this.

271
02:14:54,468 --> 02:14:58,005
蜷缩... 挣扎着 奄奄一息
Cowering... clawing for breath.

272
02:15:03,003 --> 02:15:06,418
- 我们引它去熔炉  - 它会看到我们的 必死无疑
- We make for the forges.  - He'll see us, sure as death.

273
02:15:06,418 --> 02:15:08,057
如果我们分头行事就不会
Not if we split up.

274
02:15:08,057 --> 02:15:11,028
索林 我们绝对逃不掉了
Thorin, we will never make it.

275
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:12,590
也许有人能逃掉
Some of us might.

276
02:15:13,124 --> 02:15:15,732
引它去熔炉
Lead him to the forges.

277
02:15:16,155 --> 02:15:19,427
我们要杀掉恶龙
We kill the dragon.

278
02:15:19,824 --> 02:15:24,452
若一切注定焚尽 那我们也将同赴火海
If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.

279
02:15:26,132 --> 02:15:27,314
这边!
This way!

280
02:15:32,173 --> 02:15:35,144
逃吧! 逃吧!
Flee! Flee!

281
02:15:35,344 --> 02:15:38,233
逃命吧!
Run for your lives!

282
02:15:38,233 --> 02:15:43,514
- 你们无处可藏了  - 看你背后! 
- There is nowhere to hide.  - Behind you!

283
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:54,753
这里!
Here!

284
02:16:25,992 --> 02:16:28,539
{\fn方正姚体}送口信去多尔古多...

285
02:16:28,903 --> 02:16:31,698
{\fn方正姚体}橡木盾到达孤山了!

286
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,518
{\fn方正姚体}去吧!

287
02:16:44,292 --> 02:16:46,281

288
02:18:51,768 --> 02:18:53,851
这边! 是这边!
This way! It's this way!

289
02:18:53,851 --> 02:18:55,540
来!
Come on!

290
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:57,031
索林!
Thorin!

291
02:19:01,626 --> 02:19:02,718
跟着巴林!
Follow Balin!

292
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:05,604
快!
Come on!

293

接着!
Hold on!

295
02:20:10,456 --> 02:20:11,992
走! 走!
Go! Go!

296
02:20:15,934 --> 02:20:19,841
这个计划行不通! 这些熔炉是冰冷的
The plan's not gonna work! These furnaces are stone cold.

297
02:20:19,841 --> 02:20:23,678
他说得对 我们没有火能点着熔炉
He is right. We've no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

298
02:20:26,249 --> 02:20:28,046
我们没有吗
Have we not.

299
02:20:29,175 --> 02:20:31,909
我不觉得你会那么容易以智取胜!
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!

300
02:20:36,151 --> 02:20:39,161
你年老糊涂...
You are growing slow and fat...

301
02:20:40,116 --> 02:20:42,493
越来越迟钝臃肿
in your dotage.

302
02:20:42,493 --> 02:20:44,625
懒鬼!
Slug!

303
02:20:45,765 --> 02:20:47,810
躲起来 快!
Take cover. Go!

304
02:21:14,757 --> 02:21:17,829
邦博! 让火烧得更猛些! 快!
Bombur! Get those billows working! Go!

305
02:21:32,381 --> 02:21:34,364
比尔博! 上去那儿
Bilbo! Up there.

306
02:21:34,364 --> 02:21:36,490
听我指令 拉那条杠
On my mark, pull that lever.

307
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:49,415
巴林 你还能配制出闪火吗?
Balin, can you still mix a flash flame?

308
02:21:49,415 --> 02:21:51,285
可以 只需要一会儿!
Aye, it will only take a jiffy!

309
02:21:51,285 --> 02:21:52,285
来!
Come on!

310
02:21:53,651 --> 02:21:55,032
我们没有时间了
We don't have a jiffy.

311
02:22:06,955 --> 02:22:08,462
硫磺在哪儿?
Where's the sulfur?

312
02:22:08,462 --> 02:22:10,187
你确定自己在做什么吗?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

313
02:22:22,138 --> 02:22:23,534
快点!
Come on!

314
02:22:45,119 --> 02:22:46,314
拉杠!
Now!

315
02:24:42,666 --> 02:24:44,589
引它去众王之廊
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

316
02:25:32,593 --> 02:25:34,896
不要停下来 比尔博! 跑!
Keep going, Bilbo! Run!

317
02:26:20,702 --> 02:26:25,962
你以为骗得了我吗 骑桶者?
You think you can deceive me, barrel rider?

318
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:30,382
你来自长湖镇
You have come from Lake-town.

319
02:26:31,795 --> 02:26:37,387
这是可恶的矮人和悲惨的长湖人...
This is some sordid scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves...

320
02:26:37,387 --> 02:26:40,057
策划的阴谋
and those miserable tarp trading lakemen.

321
02:26:41,188 --> 02:26:47,519
那些带着长弓和黑箭哭哭啼啼的胆小鬼
Those sniveling cowards with their long bows and black arrows.

322
02:26:48,161 --> 02:26:53,275
也许我该拜访一下他们
Perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. 

323
02:26:53,316 --> 02:26:54,157
不
No.

324
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,889
这不是他们的错
This isn't their fault.

325
02:26:57,889 --> 02:27:00,689
等等! 你不能去长湖镇
Wait! You cannot go to Lake-town.

326
02:27:02,505 --> 02:27:06,555
你在乎他们 对吧?
You care about them, do you?

327
02:27:07,037 --> 02:27:11,866
那就好 让你眼睁睁看着他们死去!
Good. Then you could watch them die!

328
02:27:16,365 --> 02:27:20,660
这里! 你这个无知的废物!
Here! You witless worm!

329
02:27:26,148 --> 02:27:28,313
你!
You!

330
02:27:28,313 --> 02:27:32,132
我要拿回你偷的东西
I am taking back what you stole.

331
02:27:34,792 --> 02:27:40,378
你什么也拿不回去 矮人!
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf!

332
02:27:41,196 --> 02:27:46,040
我打败了你们老一辈的战士
I laid low your warriors of old.

333
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:50,577
在人们心中植入恐惧
I instill terror in the hearts of men.

334
02:27:51,799 --> 02:27:57,194
我是... 孤山之王
I am King... under the mountain.

335
02:27:57,646 --> 02:28:02,045
这不是你的王国 这是矮人之地...
This is not your kingdom. These are Dwarf lands...

336
02:28:02,817 --> 02:28:05,085
这是矮人之金
This is Dwarf gold.

337
02:28:06,243 --> 02:28:10,532
我们要... 报仇
And we will have... our revenge.

338
02:29:30,241 --> 02:29:35,124
报仇! 报仇!
Ah, revenge! Revenge!

339
02:29:35,932 --> 02:29:41,246
我要让你知道什么叫报仇!
I will show revenge!

340
02:30:17,421 --> 02:30:18,789
听我说!
Listen to me!

341
02:30:18,989 --> 02:30:21,197
你难道不知道是怎么回事吗?
Do you not know what is coming?

342
02:30:23,693 --> 02:30:27,766
我满腔怒火
I am fire.

343
02:30:28,647 --> 02:30:31,783
我... 是...
I... am...

344
02:30:33,365 --> 02:30:34,633
死神!
Death!

345
02:30:43,405 --> 02:30:45,538
我们都做了什么!
What have we done!

346
