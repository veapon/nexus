00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,481
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.

57
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:13,772
- So... There has been some interest, and...
- Your friend is modest.

58

Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

- What is the subject of your book?

- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's... It's a novel.

- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

62
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:28,085
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...

63
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:31,088
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

64
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,420
Good. I like nonfiction.

65
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,925
There is so much to know
about this world.

66
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:39,464
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

67
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,899
That's an interesting perspective.

- Oh, well, I like them both.

that I prefer the dark.

Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,961
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,971
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,633
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

78
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:27,473
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

79
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,480
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?

80
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:34,211
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

81
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,652
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

82
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:41,658
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,160
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

84
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,163
No. It's a long shot.

85
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,757
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

86
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,768
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

87
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,770
You know? I've stopped caring.

88
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,773
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

89
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,038
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

90
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,545
I think this is the one. Huh?

91
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,548
I'm really proud of you, man.

92
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,641
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

93
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:10,882
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

94
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,514
- I've been saving it. Don't...
- All right. I won't open it.

95
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,525

I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

103
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,480
Yeah. Me too.

104
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,483
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

105
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,577
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

106
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,588
That's 100% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

107
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,590
They don't even make it anymore.

108
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,557
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,560
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh, Jesus.

110
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,562
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

111
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,929
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
- Just tell me.

112
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,935
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

113
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:01,870
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...

114
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,943
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation...

115
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,946
[Miles]
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

116
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,947
- [Jack] Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- And?

117
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,949
It's great.

118
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,952
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

119
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:18,352
Just seems... I don't know,
more congealed or something.

120
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:22,917
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

121
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:27,556
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

122
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,566
There is no new ending.

123
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:32,569
Page 750 on is exactly the same.

124
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,168
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

125
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,904
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

126
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,980
Yeah! That must be it!

127
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,717
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

128
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,720
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

129
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,723
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

130
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,725
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?

131
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,058
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.

132
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,997
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay.!

133
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,001
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?

134
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:08,072
Uh, oh... 70-something.

135
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,577
[Groans]

136
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,178
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

137
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:34,966
Thank you.

138
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,266
[Doorbell Rings]

139
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,911
- Surprise.!
- Surprise!

140
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,913
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

141
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:53,746
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

142
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:57,253
What a surprise!

143
00:09:57,356 --> 00:10:01,190
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

144
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,193
Happy birthday, Mom.

145
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,195
They're from both of us.
[Chuckling]

146
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:09,996
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

147
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,663
- Don't I feel special?
- [Jack] And champagne.!

148
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,935
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

149
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,942
Isn't that nice.

150
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:22,377
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

151
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,382
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.

152
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:29,386
Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:33,515
- Well, you were wonderful in that show.!
- [Laughs]

154
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:38,858
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

155
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,398
Oh, now, Miles...

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,527
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

157
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,537
Look how I'm dressed!

158
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,039
I've gotta run and put my face on.

159
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:52,042
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

160
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,668
Oh, stop it!

161
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,679
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- [TV: Announcer, Faint]

162
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,682
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

[TV: Announcer Continues]
Along with the battle casualties...

164
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,620
Just a snack.

165
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,622
The Germans lost almost a million men.

166
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:09,091
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

167
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,297
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

168
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,801
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

[Chuckles]
L-Is this chicken?

170
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:22,806
I could have made something fancier...

171
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,809
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

172
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:29,870
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.

173
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,642
It was a surprise, Mom.

174
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,150
And I could've already put clean sheets...

175

on the other bed and the foldout.

at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

178
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,523
They do a magnificent job there.

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,531
- You talked to Wendy?
- Just now.

180

She's thrilled! And the twins...

No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

Well, you boys do what you want.

186
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,917
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

And what was that other one you did?

192
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
The one where you were the jogger.

Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.

Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

My main man.

Two years ago, buddy.

I'm gonna show you a good time.

We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...

we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frere.

256
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:20,128
And get your bone smooched.

257
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,414
You know what?

258
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:42,111
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?

259
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,688
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

260
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,690
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.

261
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,192
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

262
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:53,196
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

263
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:56,927
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

264
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,869
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

265
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,874
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

266
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:08,309
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

267
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,904
and it just cools down the berries.

268
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,848
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

269
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:17,444
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

270
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,458
[Miles]
Let me show you how this is done.

271
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,461
First thing... hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

272
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,724
You're looking for color and clarity.

273
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,232
- Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

274
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:33,327
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

275
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,303
- Okay?
- Okay.

276
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,306
Now tip it.

277
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,868
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

278
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,881
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

279
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,883
It's usually
more important with reds.

280
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,885
- Okay?
- Okay.

281
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,887
Now stick your nose in it.

282
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,389
- [Sniffs] Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

283
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:55,755
Really get your nose right in there.
Really...

284
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,420
Mmm. A little citrus.

285
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:02,557
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

286
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,395
Passion fruit. Mmm.

287
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:09,405
And... Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

288
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:13,068
[Sniffs]
Soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and...

289
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:16,147
There's a... just a flutter of, like, a...

290
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,080
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

291
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,175
- Wow.
- [Sniffs]

292
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,186
Mmm!

293
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,188
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

294
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,417
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

295
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:30,426
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

296
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,428
Oxygenating it opens it up.

297
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,192
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

298
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,632
- Smell again.
- [Both Inhaling]

299
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,636
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of'em.

300
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,206
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

301
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:47,905
Mmm! Ahh.

302
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,544
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

303
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,313
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...

304
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,321
but this one is pretty damn good.

305
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:02,291
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
- Just released two months ago.

306
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,293
- Nice job.
- We like it.

307
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:06,659
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

308
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,665
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

309
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,428
[Chuckles]

310
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,504
Are you chewing gum?

311
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:53,476
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

312
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:55,478
Whoa!

313
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,981
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

314
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,415
I mean, you've been there.

315
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,421
Well, you know, l... I think that you
waited for some good reason...

316
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,424
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

317
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,926
so I think it's great.

318
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,929
It's time.

319
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,932
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

320
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:19,936
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

321
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:22,939
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

322
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,943
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

323
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,947
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

324
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,949
So I'm thinking about it.

325
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:34,951
But I don't know.

326
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,953
Might get a little incestuous.

327
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:39,956
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

328
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:42,458
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

329
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,290
This would just provide some stability.

330
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:49,025
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

331
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,034
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

332
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,036
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

333
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:55,765
No. No.

334
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,913
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

335
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:05,915
- Miles!
- Sir.

336
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,417
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

337
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,420
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

338
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:14,423
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

339
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:16,925
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

340
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:19,929
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:22,932
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

342
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,934
[Laughs]
Absolument.

343
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:27,937
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

344
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,007
Very special. Thank you.

345
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,012
Mmm!

346
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:38,605
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

347
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,553
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

348
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,021
Pour us a couple, will ya.

349
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,218
Yeah. It's tight.

350
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,829
There you are, gentlemen.

351
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,900
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

352
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:01,569
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

353
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,572
It's gonna be great.

354
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,642
Here's to us.

355
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,083
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

356
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,585
Check out that chick.

357
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,281
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

358
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,291
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

359
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:25,988
- You know that chick?
- Yes. Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

360
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,292
You know?
It's practically my office.

361
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:31,300
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

362
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:35,304
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year, year and a half.

363
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:37,306
She's incredibly hot.

364
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,672
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

365
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,677
Check out the rock.

366
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,679
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

367
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,681
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

368
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,513
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

369
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,520
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

370
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:56,525
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

371
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,960
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

372
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,965
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

373
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,161
Calm down. Let's just eat.

374
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,502
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

375
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,510
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

376
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:17,240
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

377
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,942
Uh... no, actually.

378
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:22,849
But... thank you.
[Chuckles]

379
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:25,422
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

380
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,423
You guys been out tasting?

381
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,686
Oh, you know it. You know it.

382
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:31,887
Oh, this is my friend, Jack. Jack, Maya.

383
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:33,896
- Hiya.
- Hi.

384
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:36,592
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

385
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:39,192
Oh. Back to work.

386
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,273
- Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

387
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,275
And she's obviously into you.

388
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,277
What else do you know about her?

389
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,506
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

390
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,551
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

391
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:57,553
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

392
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:00,123
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton, Jack.

393
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:02,124
How is that ever gonna work out?

394
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,524
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

395
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:08,360
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

396
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,067
You're blind, dude. Blind.

397
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:16,128
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

398
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,244
Hey, Gary.

399
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,246
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

400
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,248
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

401
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,250
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

402
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,252
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

403
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,720
Please. Light up, light up.

404
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:38,324
In fact, would you like to join us?

405
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,892
Sure.

406
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,737
- [Clears Throat]
- So, how's that book coming, Miles?

407
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,740
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

408
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:56,176
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

409
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,180
It's getting published.

410
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:01,581
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

411
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,177
Well, congratulations.

412
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:06,188
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

413
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,258
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

414
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,360
Are you a writer too?

415
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:13,362
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

416
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:15,864
Really. What kind of stuff?

417
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,867
Mmm, a lot of TV.

418
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:21,370
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

419
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:26,034
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

420
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,043
Anything I might know?

421
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:30,705
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

422
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:35,115
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. Financing!

423
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,119
[Laughing]
That's hilarious!

424
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,122
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

425
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,124
- You are not.
- He is.

426
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,387
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

427
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,395
Side effects may include oily discharge...

428
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:48,397
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

429
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:51,559
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...

430
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:53,569
you're dead, asshole!

431
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,571
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

432
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:57,800
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

433
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,074
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

434
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:06,206
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

435
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:10,253
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

436
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:12,379
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

437
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,390
Uh, the Windmill.

438
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:16,460
Windmill.

439
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,395
The girl is looking to party...

440
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:22,398
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

441
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,400
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack.

442
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:26,902
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

443
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:28,904
She lit up like a pinball machine...

444
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,406
when she found out
your novel was getting published.

445
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,909
Now I have another lie to live down.

446
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:36,912
- Thanks, Jack.
- Just trying to get you a little action.

447
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:39,414
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

448
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:42,918
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

449
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,420
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

450
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:48,424
And, by the way, I was right...
she's not married.

451
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:50,585
- How do you know?
- No rock.

452
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:54,324
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

453
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,634
Oh.

454
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,452
[Sighs]

455
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:19,249
What's the plan for today, Miles?

456
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,256
Aha.

457
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,952
Good. Um, we head up north...

458
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,961
Begin the grape tour up there...

459
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:27,963
work our way south...

460
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:29,965
so that the more we drink...

461
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,126
the closer we get to the motel.

462
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,465
What's your problem?

463
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,182
What is it?

464
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:51,353
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...

465
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:54,356
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

466
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:59,088
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

467
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,027
[Chuckles]
Oh.

468
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:04,158
Well, now the cards are on the table.

469
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:06,168
Yes, they are.

470
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,762
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

471
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:14,538
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?

472
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,946
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

473
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,948
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

474
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,280
It's, uh, your party, evidently.

475
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,286
Why don't you just, uh...

476
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:28,290
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

477
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,292
No, Miles!

478
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,862
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

479
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:34,863
We should both be cutting loose.

480
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:38,799
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

481
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:42,603
It's something we should share.

482
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:18,134
[Man]
This is our Syrah.

483
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,210
Okay.

484
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,610
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

485
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,545
That's a big one.

486
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:38,094
[Woman] But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

487
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:41,596
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

488
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,226
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

489
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:48,169
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

490
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,800
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

491
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,428
[Woman]
This is our estate chardonnay.

492
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:21,629
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

493
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,639
Stephanie.

494
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,709
Stephanie. Nice.

495
00:31:27,544 --> 00:31:29,444
So, what do you think?

496
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:31,446
Mmm. Quaffable.

497
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:33,778
But, uh, far from transcendent.

498
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,784
I like it. Tastes great.

499
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,786
Oak-y.

500
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,753
This is a cabernet franc.

501
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,758
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

502
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,420
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

503
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,429
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

504
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,432
and it was a silver medal winner...

505
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,434
at Paso Robles last year.

506
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,096
Hmm.

507
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,139
Mmm.

508
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:59,141
Well, I will tell you something.

509
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:02,576
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

510
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,581
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe...

511
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:08,083
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

512
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,551
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

513
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:14,215
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

514
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:16,725
We're just over in Buellton.

515
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:18,727

516
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:20,729
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

517
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:23,732
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

518
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,735
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

519
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:29,362
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

520
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:31,373
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

521
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,375
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?

522
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:35,445
Sure.

523
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:39,377
This is our estate Syrah.

524
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:45,417
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

525
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:48,491
I know. I need to be spanked.

526
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,728
Excuse me.

527
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,066
The Syrah?

528
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:07,906
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.

529
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:09,912
- You have the keys.
- I do?

530
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:11,914
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

531
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,916
- So, we're on.
- What?

532
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:18,079
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

533
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:20,088
- Wi... With Maya?
- Yeah.

534
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,590
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

535
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,593
This chick Stephanie?

536
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,596
She's got it all goin' on.

537
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,598
Well, she is cute, yeah.

538
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,600
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.

539
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:35,536
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?

540
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:49,451
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

541
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:52,647
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

542
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,791
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

543
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,225
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

544
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,786
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

545
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:06,632
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

546
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:10,571
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

547
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:15,376
- Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.
- [Sighs]

548
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,606
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

549
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:21,115
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

550
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,778
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

551
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,788
She got remarried.

552
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,858
She what?

553
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,461
When?

554
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:35,088
About a month ago.

555
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,099
Maybe six weeks.

556
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:41,001
To that guy...
that guy with the restaurant?

557
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,313

558

Miles.

559
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,753
I'd like to go home now.

560
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:59,755
Miles, get out of the car.

561
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:02,291
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

What do you think?

565
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,001
Why didn't you tell me
about this before, Jack?

566
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:16,903
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

567
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,908
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,188
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

620
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,418
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

621
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:59,324
Yeah. I miss you too.

622
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:02,398
Yeah. I love you too.

623
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,295
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

624
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:09,304
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

625
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,306
People love that guy.

626
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:14,309
And don't forget...
your novel is coming out in the fall.

627
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:17,312
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

628
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:19,382
Come here, Miles. Come here.

629
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,887
Do not sabotage me.

630
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,890
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

631
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,893
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

632
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,896
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

633
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,399
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

634
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,902
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

635
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,904
Jesus. No merlot.

636
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,133
Did you bring your Xanax?

637
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,710
- [Pills Rattle]
- All right.

638
00:39:48,812 --> 00:39:50,712
Come here.

639
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:53,374
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

640
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:56,384
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

641
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:59,284
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

642
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:06,294
Hi. Just looking for some friends.

643
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:09,365
- ¢Ü¢Ü[LightJazz]
- [Murmuring, Chattering]

644
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,774
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

645
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,776
- Hi, Miles.
- [Stephanie] Good. How are you?

646
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:25,279
Hello, Maya.
[Sighs]

647
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,283
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- [Maya] Thank you.

648
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,979
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

649
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:32,987
[Jack]
So, what's good here?

650
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:36,320
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

651
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:39,395
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

652
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:42,397
- What time did you close up at Ka... Is it...
- Kalyra.

653
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:46,560
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

654
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,571
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were...

655
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:52,073
- That's nice.
- It's aged 12 months in oak.

656
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:54,075
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

657
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:56,077
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

658
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:59,342
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

659
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,577
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

660
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:06,884
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

661
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,981
- Right.
- Just... small stuff.

662
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,992
Uh, hints of clove.

663
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,994
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

664
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,326
Yeah. Mmm.

665
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,332
Sorry. It's good.

666
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,698
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

667
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:21,703
Good. [Chuckles] Okay.

668
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,705
[Stephanie]
Oh, that's... that...

669
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:26,537
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

670
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,543
I didn't hear him say that.

671
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:33,048
- Whenever I say something he said...
- [Laughs] Very good.

672
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:35,549
No, actually... No. That one.
N-Not this one...

673
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:38,086
[Jack, Stephanie Laughing]

674
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:40,952
[Jack]
I'm having that too.

675
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:43,252
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

676
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,952
That's what I'm saying.

677
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:46,961
For our soup we have corn chowder...

678
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:50,464
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

679
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,627
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

680
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,637
And finally...

681
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:58,640
- [Maya] I have to explain my credentials.
- [Stephanie] Yes.!

682
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:01,074
Miles, what does this remind you of?

683
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:04,078
"Red wine. Red wine."

684
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,479
[Jack]
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

685
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:11,452
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

686
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:13,455
Right.

687
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:16,458
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

688
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,460
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

689
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:20,154
Wow, Miles.!

690
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,390
- Ohh.!
- [Maya] Well, in that case...

691
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,903
[Conversations Continue,
Faint, Indistinct]

692
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:35,872
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

693
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:38,948
[Maya, Stephanie Laughing]

694
00:42:40,216 --> 00:42:42,116
[Miles]
Ancient way of treating the grape.

695
00:42:42,218 --> 00:42:45,312
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

696
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:49,688
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

697
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:52,421
[Stephanie]
So everyone's going back to that.

698
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:05,840
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

699
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:08,843
- It's not a... It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:10,845
Your lips look soft.

701

[Phone: Line Ringing]

702
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:15,850
- The whole area is...
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

703
00:43:15,952 --> 00:43:18,921
- What do they call the...
- [Phone: Line Continues Ringing]

704
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:26,528
Malibu... It's Malibu Canyon.

- [Laughs]
- [Phone: Line Continues Ringing]

706
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:32,632
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.

- [Line Picks Up]
- [Woman] Hello?

714
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:09,171
Victoria?

715
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,907
Miles?

716
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:16,467
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

717
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:20,610
What... Uh... What's on your mind?

718
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:22,617
Oh, nothin'. L...
[Chuckles]

719
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,914
Just heard that you got remarried.

720
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:27,216
Congratulations. I, uh...

721
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:30,224
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

722
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:32,226
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.

723
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:35,229
Oh, just a little local pinot,
you know.

724
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:39,233
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.
[Laughs, Clears Throat]

725
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:42,736
- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

726
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,740
New owners. Cozy ambience, uh...

727
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:49,039
Excellent food too.
You should, uh... You should try it.

728
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:53,445
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

729
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,218
Hello?

730
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,481
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's...

731
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:02,422
All right, I just...
I wanted to let you know...

732
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:06,427
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

733
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:12,092
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...

734
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:14,102
well, you worry no more...

735
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:16,104
because I'm not gonna be there.

736
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:19,733
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

737
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:22,141
What is his name?

738
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:25,279
Ken.

739
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:27,281
Ken! Right.

740
00:45:27,383 --> 00:45:29,283
Ken.

741
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:31,285
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.

742
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:34,720
No... You know, it's just...
l-l-I heard about this...

743
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:37,486
for the first time, uh, today.

744
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:39,494
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.

745
00:45:39,596 --> 00:45:43,999
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.

746
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,160
Just... hard to believe.

747
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,670
[Chuckles]

748
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:53,209
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

749
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:55,209
for us somewhere down the road.

750
00:45:55,311 --> 00:45:57,711
And I just, uh...
[Sighs]

751
00:45:57,814 --> 00:45:59,714
- Miles.
- Huh?

752
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:02,717
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.

753
00:46:05,488 --> 00:46:08,389
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

754
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:10,459
You're the boss.

755
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:23,305
Huh? I don't know.

756
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,170
[Laughs]
Welcome back.

- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.

760
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:35,084
Thank you.

Sure.

- Mmm.
- All right.

Yeah. Don't take too long.

00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:51,432
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls. [Chuckles]

What the fuck?
What is up with you?

767
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:56,104
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah...

768
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:59,232
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

Bathroom.

Did you drink and dial?

how small she could make you feel?

Um...

891
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:06,207
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

904

from the point of view of the father.

and thrive even when it's neglected.

956

No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

957

And, in fact, it can only grow...

in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

Oh, l... I think l...

977
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:40,080
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

978
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:44,050
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

979
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:46,053
- You know?
- Right.

980
00:57:46,155 --> 00:57:49,886
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

981
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:51,892
And the more I drank...

982

the more I liked
what it made me think about.

Like what?

984

Wow.

about the life of wine.

00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah.

988
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,910
How it's a living thing.

989
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:12,546
I like to think about...

990
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:16,049
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...

991
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,483
how the sun was shining...

992
00:58:18,587 --> 00:58:20,555
if it rained.

993
00:58:21,757 --> 00:58:23,657
I like to think about...

994
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:27,126
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

995
00:58:27,229 --> 00:58:31,689
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

996
00:58:34,203 --> 00:58:37,434
I like how wine continues to evolve.

997
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,441
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...

998
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:44,570
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

999
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,083
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

1000
00:58:49,184 --> 00:58:54,144
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

1001
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:58,251
That is, until it peaks...

1002
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,260
like your '61.

1003
00:59:01,597 --> 00:59:04,828
And then it begins its steady...

1004
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,835
inevitable decline.

1005
00:59:07,937 --> 00:59:10,462
Hmm.

1006
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:14,702

She said she had a fun time too.

Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1116
01:08:47,978 --> 01:08:49,946
God, it was so awesome.

1117
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,346

a handle on the whole process.

The selection to the harvest.

01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:01,391
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1121
01:09:01,492 --> 01:09:03,790
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1122
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:06,556
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

1123
01:09:06,663 --> 01:09:08,722
They were a little sour...

01:09:33,323 --> 01:09:35,553
Does she know about Saturday?

Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

I haven't told her I'm available.

is only for a few days.

Oh, you've been thinking. And?

Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1142

Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

But life is short, Miles.

I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

That's not just for my sake.

for Christine's feelings too.

has completely opened my eyes.

She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

- She fucks different.
- Okay.

from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

01:17:03,773 --> 01:17:05,968
But you haven't heard anything yet...

1239
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:09,637
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

1240
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:13,648
Hmm? All right. You know,
fuck the New York publishers.

1241
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,218
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

1242
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,152
Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed.

1243
01:17:19,256 --> 01:17:22,555
Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

- Shut up.

It's all about stillness.

1248
01:17:36,606 --> 01:17:40,042
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1249

Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

- God.
- What's with the hostility, man?

1252
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:51,946
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now...

1253

- but you can choose to be less hostile.

Uh? Uh-huh.

Oh. Oh, check it out.

I don't wanna talk about it, please.

She's perfect for you.

I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

Don't you want to feel that cozy little box
grip down on your johnson?

Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1272
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:14,935
A woman finds out how I live...

1273
01:19:15,038 --> 01:19:18,405
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially...

any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

1275

If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

1276
01:19:25,915 --> 01:19:29,510
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

1277
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:33,578
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

1278
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,716
Abattoir. Huh.
But you know what?

1279
01:19:36,826 --> 01:19:38,794
You are gonna be
a published author...

1280
01:19:38,895 --> 01:19:42,126
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

Oh, yeah. No. I mean, uh, yeah.

1290
01:20:13,196 --> 01:20:15,824
I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

1291
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:17,832
- I had class.
- Oh.

1292
01:20:17,934 --> 01:20:20,562
Well, nice to see you now.

You didn't know that?

[Maya Laughing]

1299
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:48,689
[Man] The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps...

1300
01:20:48,798 --> 01:20:52,165
since antiquity in Burgundy.

1301
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:54,964
And it is precisely this ancient...

1302
01:20:55,071 --> 01:20:58,336
and inherited winemaking
knowledge...

1303
01:20:58,441 --> 01:21:01,001

Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...

1325
01:25:12,528 --> 01:25:14,428
on Saturday night?

1326
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:18,660
It's kind of pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1327
01:25:18,768 --> 01:25:21,236
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

1328
01:25:21,337 --> 01:25:24,534
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1329
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,608
What rehearsal dinner?

1330

some story, but I didn't.

Just take me home.

Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

1336
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:50,726
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1337
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:54,963
How she's the only woman that's ever
rocked his world, how he adores Siena...

1338
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:59,371
how he wants to move here and
get a place with the two of them
and commute when he has to.

1339
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:02,205
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1340

Please believe me.

1341

I was on the verge
of telling you last night, but...

But you wanted to fuck me first.

Yeah.

You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life...

trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception...

and I'm doing just fine.

1348
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:44,479
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce...

1349
01:26:44,587 --> 01:26:47,556
so this has been a big deal for me,
Maya.

1350
01:26:47,657 --> 01:26:51,923
Hanging out with you and, uh...
and last night.

01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,871
[Miles] This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1389
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:24,208
I just want to go home.

1390
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:27,650
I know what you need.

1391
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:28,344
I know what you need.

1392
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,919
[Jack] How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1393
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,580
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1394
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:37,989
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1396
01:30:12,928 --> 01:30:15,556
[Miles] It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. School bus.

1397
01:30:15,664 --> 01:30:18,098
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1398
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,668
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1399
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:23,068
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1400
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:26,972
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1401
01:30:27,076 --> 01:30:29,044
Fuckin' Raid.

1402
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:32,570
Tastes pretty good to me.

1403
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:35,809
Hmm. Look.
They have a reserve pinot.

1404
01:30:35,918 --> 01:30:38,682
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1405
01:30:38,788 --> 01:30:42,121
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

- Oh, hi, Miles.

- Hi.
- Let me see if I can get her.

01:30:53,069 --> 01:30:55,037
Okay.

1411
01:30:55,137 --> 01:30:58,436

- Okay.

- Hi, Evelyn.

It's your favorite client.

- How's the trip?
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1415
01:31:08,084 --> 01:31:10,780
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1416
01:31:10,886 --> 01:31:13,354
- It's very nice.
- Right.

1417
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:16,118
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

1418
01:31:16,225 --> 01:31:18,216
Well, actually, there is word.

1419
01:31:18,327 --> 01:31:20,795
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

1420
01:31:20,896 --> 01:31:22,796
Right. And?

1421
01:31:22,898 --> 01:31:25,423
And... they're passing.

1422
01:31:27,103 --> 01:31:31,437
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

1423
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:35,601
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

1424
01:31:35,711 --> 01:31:38,771
He said it was a really tough call.

1425
01:31:40,349 --> 01:31:42,249
Oh. Right.

1426
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:44,979
- I'm sorry, Miles.
- [Sighs]

1427
01:31:45,087 --> 01:31:47,282
So I don't know where that leaves us.

1428
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:51,951
I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

1429
01:31:52,061 --> 01:31:56,157
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now...

[Evelyn's Voice]
The whole industry's gotten gutless.

It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.

1433
01:32:06,008 --> 01:32:08,203
It's only about the marketing.

- Excuse me. Could I get
a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.

Thanks.

Excuse me.
Could you just pour me a full glass?

1439
01:32:33,736 --> 01:32:35,704
I'll pay for it, okay?

then go outside?

- I told you I need a drink,
so I'm going to help myself.

- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

how much I enjoyed
