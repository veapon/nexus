an audience.

好吧
Okay.

第三街上的餐厅现在还没关门吧？
You think the kitchen
will still be open
on Third?

Harry, what's going on?

Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck
in two weeks.

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,603
我们拿什么去吃饭？
How we gonna eat?

74

- 他们已经跑了
They're not getting away
with this!
They just did.

对不起，安妮
I'm sorry, Annie.

82
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,939
从你小时候开始
人们就不断让你失望
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

83
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,905
你现在得为自己想想
You gotta
think of yourself now.

84
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,771
你应该去试试那个角色
You should try out
for that part.

85
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,848
噢，我知道你在想什么
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

86
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,818
每当你去争取一样心爱的东西…
Every time you reach out
for something
you care about...

87
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,619
…命运之手就将它从你面前夺走
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

88
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,283
不过这一次不会的，安妮
But not this time, Annie.

89

这一次不会的
Not this time.

- 噢，上帝！
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

91
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,805
听着，小姐，我已经跟你说过了
给我办公室打电话
Look, miss,
I told you already,
call my office.

92
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,807
把你的简历给我的秘书
Leave your resume
with my secretary.

93
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,935
我们可以面谈的情况下
我还有必要那么做吗？
Now, why would I want to
do that when we can
talk about it in person?

94
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,639
因为一个聪明的女孩子会那么做的
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

95
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,182
可我已经把简历给你了
你没有打开就退回来了
But I already
sent you my resume.
You returned it unopened.

96
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,275
我能怎么办？杰克・德里斯库
对跟他合作的演员是非常挑剔的
What can I say? Jack
Driscoll's very particular
about who he works with.

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,014
求你，就一次试镜而已
这是我所有的请求
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

98
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,282
上帝啊，你不会放弃的，是吧？
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?

99
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,914
威斯顿先生，我对那个角色烂熟于胸
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,959
呃，太糟了
我们刚把那个角色给了别人
Well, that's too bad,
'cause we just gave the part
to someone else.

101
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,427
抱歉，孩子，这出戏已经满员了
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

102
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,194
我知道现在生计艰难
I know times are tough.

103
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,260
想听我的建议吗？
You want my advice?

104
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,665
用用你的本钱，你长得不难看
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

105
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,369
你这样的女孩子不至于挨饿
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

106
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,070
有个新地方，刚刚开业
There's a new place.
It just opened.

107
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,281
现在听着，公主殿下
这地方可不是什么宫殿，明白吗？
Now listen, princess,
this gig ain't the Palace,
you understand?

108
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
找肯尼・凯，就说是我叫你去的
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,051
把戏做好，把钱拿到手…
Just play the date,
take the money...

110
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
然后忘记你曾经去过那里
forget you was ever there.

111
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,096
还有多长？
How much more is there?

112
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,361
还有五盘胶片
Another five reels.

113
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,065
开灯！
Lights up.

114
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,341
就是这个？
This is it?

115
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,242
丹汉姆，就是这花了我们四万美元？
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denam?

116
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,941
你的另一部冒险电影？
Another one of your
safari pictures?

117
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,110
你向我们许诺说会有布鲁斯・巴克斯特
和玛琳・麦肯济的浪漫场面
You promised us romantic
scenes with Bruce Baxter
and Maureen McKenzie!

118
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,881
少来了，伙计们
你们清楚我们的协议
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

119
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,546
我们都同意用玛琳的第一次约会
做卖点…
We agreed to push
Maureers start date...

120
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,180
那样她就可以给她的牙整形了
so she could
get her teeth fixed.

121
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,090
这不是原则的问题，是钱的问题
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,720
卡尔，你已经开拍两个月了
Carl,
you've been in production
for over two months.

123
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,458
相信我，只要一上船…
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up
the screen...

124
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,432
…布鲁斯和玛琳
就会开始在银幕上大放光彩了
once we get them on the ship.

125
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,533
什么船？
What ship?

126
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,431
就是我们租的
要载我们去目的地的那条船
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

127
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,306
什么目的地，卡尔！
你本应该在布景上拍的
What location? Carl!
You're supposed to be
shooting on the back lot.

128
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,900
是的，我明白
Yes, I understand that.

129
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,344
伙计们
不过我们现在不拍那部电影了…
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

130
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,676
…我来告诉你们为什么
and I'll tell you why.

131
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,581
故事改变了，剧本改写了
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

132
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,778
真实的生活介入了
Life intervened.

133
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,246
我得到了一份地图
I've come into possession
of a map.

134
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,688
一座连海图上都没有的小岛
唯一一份现存的证据
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

135
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,888
一个被认为只在神话里存在的地方
A place that was
thought to exist
only in myth.

136
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,222
直到今天
Until now.

137
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,324
喂，卡尔，慢点
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

138
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,732
他是要更多的钱吗？
Is he asking for more money?

139
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,397
他是让我们掏钱赞助竹篮打水
He's asking us
to fund a wild-goose chase.

140
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,932
我所说的是一个原始世界
从没有人见过
I'm talking about
a primitive world
never before seen by man.

141
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,103
一个完整文明的遗迹
The ruins
of an entire civilization.

142
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,283
你们所见过的最壮观的景象
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

143
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,810
那里才是我的片场
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

144
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,189
那会有奶子吗？
Will there be boobies?

145
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,655
奶子？
Boobies?

146
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,825
颤动的乳房，煽情的镜头
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,694
根据我的经验，大家都是奔着…
In my experience,
people only go
to these films...

148
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,135
…土著姑娘的裸体去看这种电影的
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

149
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,772
你是白痴吗？
What are you, an idiot?

150
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,037
你觉得他们会问德米尔
他会不会浪费时间在裸体镜头上？
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time
on nudie shots?

151
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,739
不会的，他们尊重电影工作者！
他们是有品味的
No! They respected
the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

152
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,271
你当然不会明白，贱种！
Not that you'd know
what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

153
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,048
你能不能出去一会儿，卡尔？
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

154
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,293
索尔曼联合公司
Zelman and Associates.

155
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,534
把那个给我，快点
Give me that, quick.

156
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,232
你不会喜欢的，这里面没有酒精
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

157
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,440
普雷斯顿
关于电影工业你还有很多东西要学！
Preston, you have
a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.

158
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,977
不要把他打入冷宫，伙计们
毫无疑问他是头脑发热…
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

159
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,988
…不过卡尔・丹汉姆
还是拍过一些很有趣的作品
but Carl Denam's made
some interesting pictures.

160
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,354
他有很多作品都…接近成功
He's had a lot of
near-success.

161
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
他是个自我标榜的自大狂
He's a preening self-promoter.

162
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,226
他有野心，但是没有才华
全身都透着失败
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser"
written all over him.

163
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,787
我可以理解你的失望…
I understand
your disappointment...

164
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,992
他根本不会导演，他根本没那个脑子
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

165
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,866
他算是完蛋了，地球人都知道
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

166
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,367
这个跳梁小丑会让我们破产的
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

167
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,272
这些关于动物的样片能卖出价钱吗？
The animal footage has value.

168
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,777
当然，环球公司非常想要资料片镜头
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

169
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,245
那就卖了它，取消拍摄
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

170
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,679
我们得从这次惨败中收回点什么
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

171
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,180
让他进来
Get him back in.

172
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,815
丹汉姆先生
Mr. Denam.

173
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,026
我需要剧组人员和船员一小时内上船
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

174
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
不，卡尔，你不能这么干
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

175
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
告诉他们制片方催我们提早出发
Tell them the studio
pressured us into
an early departure.

176
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,559
- 这是不合法的
- 你想怎么着？告我，嗯？
It's not ethical!
What are they gonna do,
sue me?

177
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,729
让他们排队去吧
They can get in line.

178
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,237
我不会让他们就这样砍掉我的电影
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

179
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,742
你知不知道船上
现在一件摄像设备都没有？
You realize that none of
the camera equipment
is on board?

180
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
我们没有许可，没有签证
We have no permits,
no visas.

181
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,306
这就是我雇你的理由，普雷斯顿
That's why I have you,
Preston.

182
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,474
我们没有保险，没有外国货币
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

183
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,483
实际上我们什么货币也没有
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

184
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,540
他在那儿
He's there.

185
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,450
- 进去！
- 谁来付船的费用？
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay
for the ship?

186
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,613
进去！
Get in.

187
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,088
- 你给我出来！出来！
- 踩油门！踩油门！
You get out of there!
Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

188
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,222
滚出来！你完了，丹汉姆！
Get out!
You're finished, Denam!

189
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,434
别担心，这样的场面我见的多了
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice
at this.

190
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,067
以恶制恶，这个我最拿手
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

191
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,502
80度的红牌威士忌…
Red Label, 80% proof...

192
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,409
装在标记“柠檬水”的箱子里
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,538
好的
You got it.

194
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
告诉玛琳
她可没有六个小时的时间化妆
Tell Maureen
she doesn't have six hours
to put on her face.

195
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,349
如果她想演这部电影的话
她就得上船
If she wants to be
in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

196
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,048
她不想演这部电影
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

197
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,817
- 玛琳不干了
- 她不干了？
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

198
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,986
昨天的事，我告诉你了
Yesterday. I told you.

199
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,694
你是跟她说我们要在新加坡拍，对吧？
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

200
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,755
你是这么跟她说的吧？
That's what you told her.

201
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,827
我知道，可我们不在新加坡拍啊
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

202
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,203
该死的，普雷斯顿
你只需要看着她的眼睛扯个谎就行了
God damn it, Preston,
all you had to do was
look her in the eye and lie.

203
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,999
我得找个电话，和哈劳的经纪人谈谈
I got to get to a phone,
talk to harlow's people.

204
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,510
哈劳没有空档
She's unavailable.

205
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
梅那・罗伊？克莱儿・波？梅・韦斯？
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

206
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,774
她哪能穿得下4号衣服？
You'll never get her
into a size four.

207
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,411
你得找个能穿玛琳的戏服的女孩子
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into
Maureers costumes.

208
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,983
菲是穿4号
Fay's a size four.

209
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,549
没错，可她现在
正拍着一部雷电华公司的片子
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

210
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,628
库珀是吗？
Cooper, huh?

211
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,161
我应该想到的
I might have known.

212
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,936
你根本没听我说，我们得推迟计划
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

213
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,471
暂停拍摄，今晚我们走不了
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

214
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,972
- 没门！
- 卡尔
Not an option.
Carl.

215
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,508
我说了我能找到那个女孩子
I said I'd find a girl.

216
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,840
看在上帝的分上，普雷斯顿
你需要有成功者的思维方式
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

217
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,744
给杰克打电话
我需要那个该死的剧本
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

218
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,675
失败永远只是暂时性的
Defeat is always momentary.

219
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,711
（仅限成人）

220
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,711
怎么了？
What?

221
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,711
（艳舞秀 所有座位25美分）

222
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,306
嘿！你要为这个付钱的
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

223
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,910
打扰一下
Excuse me.

224
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
女士，我想你掉了这个
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.

225
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,688
歌舞杂耍，是吗？
Vaudeville, huh?

226
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,788
我参与过一回，观众非常挑剔
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

227
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,663
你不尽快搞定他们，他们就会搞定你
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

228
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,201
丹汉姆先生…
Mr. Denam...

229
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,226
我想告诉你…
I want you to know...

230
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,102
…我不是习惯于接受陌生人施舍的人
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity
from strangers.

231
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,039
或者换句话说…
Or, for that matter...

232
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,667
拿不属于我的东西
taking things
that don't belong to me.

233
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,645
刚才显然是可怕的误解
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

234
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,682
只是我已经很长时间没有拿到过工资了
It's just that
I haven't been paid
in a while.

235
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,150
太糟了，不管怎样，安…
我可以称呼你安吗？
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

236
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,623
有没有什么可能，你是穿4号的衣服？
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

237
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,186
不，不，上帝，不
No, no. Oh, God, no.

238
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,789
你完全误会我了，丹劳小姐，拜托
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

239
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,959
我根本不是你想象的那种人
I'm not that type
of person at all.

240
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,730
那么你是哪种人？
What type of person are you?

241
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
我是你可以信任的人，安
我是个电影制片人
I'm someone
you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

242
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,901
相信我，我和那些低级趣味
绝对不是一个档次，请坐
Believe me, I am on
the level. No funny business.
Please sit down.

243
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,543
拜托，拜托
Please. Please.

244
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,542
好的
Okay.

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,078
安，我要你想象…
Ann, I want you to imagine...

246
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,817
一个前往远东的英俊探险家
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

247
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,189
你们要在远东拍摄？
You're filming
in the Far East?

248
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,758
新加坡
Singapore.

249
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
在船上，他遇到了一个神秘的女郎
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

250
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,495
她迷人，纤弱，心神不宁
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

251
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,267
她无法摆脱这样一种感觉――
一种她无法控制的力量…
And she can't
escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control...

252
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,243
…在将她推向一段不归路
are compelling her
down a road from which
she cannot draw back.

253
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,504
就好像她的前半生
都只是这一刻的序幕…
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude
to this moment...

254
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,253
这改变了一切的，宿命的相遇
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

255
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
理所当然地，有违她理性的判断…
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

256
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650
她坠入了爱河
She falls in love.

257
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,420
没错
Yes.

258
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,554
但她对这段感情并没有信心
But she doesn't trust it.

259
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
她甚至不能确定
她是不是相信真爱的存在
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

260
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,160
呃…
Uh...

261
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,431
是吗？
really?

262
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,971
如果她爱上一个人
命中注定是没有结局的
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

263
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,440
为什么呢？
Why is that?

264
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,434
美好的事物从来都是短暂的
丹汉姆先生
Good things never last,
Mr. Denam.

265
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,517
那么你是感兴趣的
好，这个就算说定了
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

266
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,112
我不想催你
但是我们在时间方面比较紧迫
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under
some time pressure.

267
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,624
- 呃，我真的…
- 安！跟你说吧…
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

268
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,023
你是最完美的人选，看看你
you're perfect. Look at you.

269
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,085
你是我见过的最悲情的女孩子
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

270
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,258
你能让他们哭泣
安，你能让他们心碎
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna
break their hearts.

271
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,626
看，丹汉姆先生
这就是你搞错的地方
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denam.

272
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,297
我的工作是让人们笑
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

273
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,933
祝你的电影好运
Good luck with your picture.

274
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,340
安，丹劳小姐，拜托
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

275
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,813
我会付你给钱的
I'm offering you money.

276
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,545
冒险，名誉，值得一生回味的经历
还有海上的长途旅行
Adventure, fame,
the thrill of a lifetime,
and a long sea voyage.

277
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,711
你想要看剧本的话？
You want to read a script?

278
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,847
我们谈话的同时
杰克・德里斯库正要交稿呢
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

279
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
杰克・德里斯库？
Jack Driscoll?

280
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,624
当然，怎么了？
Sure. Why?

281
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,686
等等，你认识他？
Wait. You know him?

282
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,325
哦，不认识
我看过他的剧作
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

283
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,403
出色的作家，对吗？
我告诉你吧，安…
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

284
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,496
杰克・德里斯库可不希望
随便什么人来演他的电影
Jack Driscoll does not
want just anyone
starring in this picture.

285
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
他对我说，“卡尔…”
He said to me, "Carl...

286
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,375
“有个女孩子是为了这个角色而生的”
"somewhere out there
is a woman
born to play this role."

287
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,845
我一看到你，就明白了
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

288
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,481
明白什么？
Knew what?

289
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,750
那个女孩子只可能是你
It was always
going to be you.

290
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
- 我还欠你多少？
- 25美分
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

291
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,928
零钱不用找了
Keep the change.

292
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,772
这就是我们的摄影船？
Is this
the moving picture ship?

293
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
不完全是
Not exactly.

294
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,278
实际上是这边的这艘
It's actually
this one over here.

295
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:08,278
（冒险号）

296
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,954
不要被表面现象蒙蔽了
船上实际宽敞许多
Don't let appearances
deceive you. It's much more
spacious on board.

297
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,890
- 这就是所有设备？
- 对
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

298
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,056
- 全都在这里了？
- 对
This is all of it?
Yeah.

299
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,724
- 我们带上“贝灵巧”影像设备了吗？
- 是的
We're taking
the Bell & howell?
Yeah.

300
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,496
- 很好，你拿了所有的镜头？
- 当然
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

301
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,128
- 卡尔？
- 我在这里
Carl!
Yes!

302
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
- 上船吧，伙计们，快
- 来吧
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

303
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,368
不好了，不好了
It's bad, it's bad.

304
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,345
他们正在路上，我刚刚听说
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

305
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
- 谁？
- 穿制服的
Who?
Men in uniform.

306
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,709
电影公司叫了警察
The studio called the cops.

307
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,212
安格霍恩！解缆！
Englehorn! Cast off!

308
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,189
升帆，起锚…
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

309
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
随便你怎么办
我们得出发了！
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

310
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,054
这个我办不到
I cannot do that.

311
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
我们在等舱单
We are waiting
on the manifest.

312
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,932
等谁？请说英语，谢谢
What? Who? English, please.

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,065
必须的文件，丹汉姆先生
Paperwork, Mr. Denam.

314
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,765
现在走的话我再给你一千
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

315
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,273
开始的一千你还没有给呢
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

316
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,506
我们能不能以后再说？
Can we talk about this later?

317
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,410
你没看见我们有贵宾在这里吗？
Can't you see
we're in the company
of a VIP guest?

318
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,516
女士
Ma'am.

319
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,786
我是安・丹劳
Ann Darrow.

320
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,949
那么你准备好这次旅行了，丹劳小姐？
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

321
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,319
当然
Sure.

322
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,458
紧张吗？
Nervous?

323
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,001
紧张？不紧张
Nervous? No.

324
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,303
为什么这么问？我应该紧张吗？
Why? Should I be?

325
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,470
不是每个女人都愿意冒这样的险
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

326
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,546
为什么不让我来领丹劳小姐
去她的舱位呢？
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

327
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,415
好主意，谢谢，普雷斯顿
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

328
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,919
丹劳小姐，如果您不介意…
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

329
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,314
嗨，我叫普雷斯顿，卡尔的助手
hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

330
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,427
说好了两千，你收支票吗？
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

331
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,759
我有其它选择吗？
Do I have a choice?

332
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,332
请跟我来
Please follow me.

333
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,665
如果你有任何需要…
借过一下，伙计们
If there's anything
that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

334
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,638
如果你有任何需要，请尽管开口
If there's anything
that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

335
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,491
噢，上帝！杰克，你吓死我了
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

336
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,964
听着，如果有任何人来敲门，别开
你也从来没有见过我
Listen. If anyone comes
to the door, don't open it.
You haven't seen me.

337
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,624
就说我得了抑郁症自杀了
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

338
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,897
说我把头浸在了马桶里
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

339
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,897
- 想来点吗？
- 不行，卡尔，我得走了
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

340
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,000
我有个排练
已经迟到三个小时了
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

341
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,243
- 这是什么？
- 剧本
What's this?
It's the script.

342
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,010
这就是剧本？
This is a script?

343
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,883
杰克，只有15页
Jack, this is 15 pages.

344
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,582
我知道，可它们都很精彩
你拿到了精彩的15页，卡尔
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages
there, Carl.

345
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
我可是要拍一部全长的电影
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

346
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,126
你原来跟我说还有更多时间的
抱歉，我得走了
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

347
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,220
不行，杰克，你不能这么对我
我有了开端…
No, Jack, you can't
do this to me.
I have a beginning...

348
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,891
…可我需要经过和结局
我得有东西可拍
but I need a middle
and an end. I gotta have
something to shoot.

349
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,163
听着，你有我的注释
我得走了，朋友，回头见
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

350
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,132
好，好吧，你也许想了结一下
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

351
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,010
你要付我钱？
You're gonna pay me?

352
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,013
不会让朋友吃亏的
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

353
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,015
我从来不知道，你还会主动给人钱
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

354
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,917
两千怎么样？
How's $2,000 sound?

355
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,023
太好了
Sounds great.

356
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,820
我觉得也是
I thought it might.

357
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,418
- 太好了
- 好吧
Sounds great.
Okay.

358
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,294
拉起缆绳！
Raise the spring line!

359
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,957
注意船尾！
Watch the aft!

360
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,101
好了
And voila.

361
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,972
谢了
Thanks.

362
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,841
卡尔，你…你写的是“两千”
You've written "two grand."

363
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,682
可不是嘛，抱歉
我们从头再写一次
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from
the beginning.

364
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,457
“贰仟美元”
"Two thousand dollars."

365
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,028
今天是29号，对吗？
It is the 29th, isn't it?

366
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,900
少来，是25号，是25号
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

367
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,502
上帝，真抱歉，只需要多花点时间
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

368
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,735
行了，卡尔，等你回来再付我钱吧
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me
when you get back.

369
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,175
好吧
All right.

370
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,651
巴克斯特先生
您的舱位在左手边最后一间
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

371
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,222
请允许我表达
对您回到我们中间的兴奋之情
And may I just say how
excited we are to have you
back with us, sir?

372
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,095
省省吧，帮把手好吗？
Be a sport
and lend a hand here,
would you?

373
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,635
抱歉，我得…我必需要下…
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

374
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,433
上帝！
Christ!

375
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,141
非常感谢你的帮助，伙计
Appreciate the help, fellow.

376
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
我来给您开门
Let me get the door for you.

377
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,604
欢迎来到您的客房，先生
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

378
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,213
双机极低速前进，赫斯先生
Dead slow ahead both,

Still won't tell me

is the way
you've captured the voice

这个嘛，我的工作就是如此
Well, that's my job.

I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

478
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,960
如果你不介意的话，我想说…
if you don't mind me
saying...

00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,088
你和照片上一点也不象
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

- 等等，安…
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

he's so much
younger in person.

Ann, stop. Stop right there.

483
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,737
你知道，我只是担心你或许是…
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

484
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,610
…是那种自恋的“作家”
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

485
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,514
- 抱歉，我不是…
- 你知道…
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

见到你也很高兴，丹劳小姐
It's nice to meet you, too,

She's standing
at the railing.

490
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,561
她还不知道…
She doesn't know it yet...

491
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,299
但是他们正向灾难驶去
写下来了吗？
But they are sailing
towards disaster.
You got that?

492
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,206
好，那么她转过身来…
Okay, so she turns...

493
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,413
大副向她摇晃着走来
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

494
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,344
刀从他的背后直透前胸
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

495
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,354
等等，我们要把大副干掉？
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

496
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,085
我们首先得假设她知道大副是谁
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

497
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,991
少来了，杰克
这只是个正直的过失
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

498
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,621
安是个近视眼，谁都有可能
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened
to anyone.

499
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,289
我是在开玩笑，卡尔
I was joking, Carl.

500
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,665
关键在于她非常害怕，她向别处看去
The point is,
she's horrified.
She has to look away.

501
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,499
就在这时她看到了它
And that's when she sees it.

502
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,041
看到了什么？
Sees what?

503
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,404
什么呀？
What?

504
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,317
那个岛
The island.

505
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,427
我们现在要到某个岛上去拍摄？
什么时候决定的事？
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

506
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,596
嘘，杰克，小点声
Jack, keep your voice down.

507
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,659
我不想要船员毛骨悚然
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

508
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,261
为什么他们会毛骨悚然？
岛叫什么名字？
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

509
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,363
好吧
那个岛有个当地的名字…
All right.
It has a local name...

510
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,965
不过我警告你，杰克，它可不怎么好听
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

511
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,739
他们叫它骷髅岛
They call it Skull Island.

512
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,540
你明白了吗？
Did you get that?

513
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,679
这地方有什么问题？
What's wrong
with this place?

514
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,479
这个地方没有什么经官方证实的问题
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

515
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,053
因为从技术角度讲，它还没有被发现呢
Because, technically,
it hasn't been
discovered yet.

516
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,426
好，好吧
Okay. All right.

517
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,892
那么我们就到了这个地方
So we arrive at this place.

518
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,692
S...
S...

519
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,528
K...
K...

520
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,934
U...
U...

521
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,132
L...
L...

522
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,903
L...
L...

523
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,746
骷髅岛
Island.

524
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,114
好的，上面的人注意，开始！
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

525
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,354
实在太让人兴奋了
我以前从来没坐过船
I think this is
awfully exciting! I've never
been on a ship before.

526
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
我以前从没坐过有女人的船
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

527
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,556
我想你们在船上不太会想女人，对吗？
I guess you don't think
much of women
on ships, do you?

528
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,596
是啊，她们太麻烦了
No, they're a nuisance.

529
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,333
- 我会尽量不给你们添麻烦的
- 你在我们周围就已经是麻烦了
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

530
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,673
停！
Cut!

531
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
非常好
It's great.

532
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,517
布鲁斯，演得非常好
你可以放松10分钟
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

533
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,491
表演非常自然，我都被感动了
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

534
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,118
你觉得怎么样，德里斯库
对白现在不那么生硬了，对吧？
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some
flow now, huh?

535
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,027
真是完全的感情流露啊
It was pure effluence.

536
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,861
我加了点善意的嘲弄而已
I beefed up the banter.

537
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,060
还是克制这种冲动吧
Try to resist that impulse.

538
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,364
只是一点幽默感罢了，朋友
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

539
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,906
你是什么？布尔什维克吗？
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

540
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,168
演员哪
Actors.

541
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,608
踏遍整个世界，却只能看到一面镜子
Travel the world,
but all they ever see
is a mirror.

542
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,423
好漂亮的腿（也是晕船的意思）
Good legs.

543
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,689
是晕船的意思，呃，你知道，晕船
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

544
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,291
耶
Yeah.

545
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,997
不是说你没有漂亮的腿
只是不小心说出来了
Not that you don't
have good legs.
Just making conversation.

546
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,370
上帝啊，丹劳小姐！
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

547
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,867
今天你和布鲁斯的那场戏…
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

548
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,776
我知道你不是那么写的…
I know it wasrt
what you wrote...

549
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,874
可巴克斯特先生强烈地认为
如果一个男人喜欢一个女人…
but Mr. Baxter
felt very strongly that
when a man likes a woman...

550
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
那么他一定要忽视她的存在
he must ignore her.

551
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,120
如果敌意真的变得很深…
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

552
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,184
不会吗？
No?

553
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,987
这是个有趣的理论
Interesting theory.

554
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,719
我知道，我应该…
I know. I should have...

555
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
这并非我本意，不过…
It wasrt
what I had intended, but...

556
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,689
抱歉，我…
I'm sorry. I was...

557
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,758
你做了自己的诠释
And you made it your own.

558
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,226
我当时好紧张
I was nervous.

559
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
- 当时很滑稽，实际上
- 你当时是很滑稽
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

560
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,306
拜托别再说下去了，晚安
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

561
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,776
丹劳小姐
Miss Darrow.

562
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,613
你不用紧张
You don't have to be nervous.

563
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,488
谢谢你
Thank you.

564
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,020
我们再…
Let's take it...

565
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,426
你可不可以…
我们这儿正在拍，谢谢
Would you please...
We're trying to
shoot a scene.

566
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,124
- 好的
- 多谢
Okay.
Thank you.

567
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,658
好的，再来
Okay, again.

568
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
我们快到了，转向西南
We're close. Turn southwest.

569
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
西南方向上千英里内都没有陆地
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

570
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,514
我们离正常航线越来越远
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

571
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
我不能摸黑在这片水域行驶
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

572
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,358
我会补偿你的
I'll make it
won'th your while.

573
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,690
那里什么也没有
There's nothing out there.

574
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,835
那样的话，你也不会失去什么
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

575
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,841
如果有人对你说
这条船没有驶向新加坡…
If someone were to tell you
this ship was headed
for Singapore...

576
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,050
…你会怎么说？
what would you say?

577
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,920
我会说千真万确，赫斯先生
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

578
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
昨天晚上我们转向西南了
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

579
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,292
先生们，拜托
Gentlemen, please.

580
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,225
- 我们不想找麻烦
- 不
We're not looking
for trouble.
No.

581
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,971
你们在找别的什么东西
You're looking
for something else.

582
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,742
对，你说得对
Yes, we are.

583
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,779
我们要找到骷髅岛
We're going to find
Skull Island.

584
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,216
找到它，拍摄下来，展示给整个世界
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

585
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,986
只要花25美分
你就可以看到地图上最后的空白
For 25 cents,
you get to see the last
blank space on the map.

586
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,586
我不知道那是不是好事
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

587
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,522
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

588
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
七年前我和赫斯先生
一起工作在…
Seven years ago,
me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

589
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,491
…一艘挪威帆船上
on a Norwegian bark.

590
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
我们从水中救起了一个海难的幸存者
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

591
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,503
他已经漂了很多天了
He'd been drifting for days.

592
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,974
他们的船在一个岛上搁浅了
在苏门答腊以西很远的地方
His ship had run aground
on an island
way west of Sumatra.

593
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,502
一座隐藏在迷雾中的岛
An island hidden in fog.

594
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,546
他说起一道巨大的城墙…
He spoke of a huge wall...

595
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,582
建于久远的年代…
built so long ago...

596
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
没有人知道是谁建造了它
no one knew who'd made it.

597
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,258
墙高100英尺…
A wall 100 foot high...

598
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,360
现在仍然和建成时一样坚固
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

599
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,122
他们为什么要建一道墙呢？
Why'd they build the wall?

600
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
那个幸存者，他说起一个生物…
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

601
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,768
既非野兽，也非人类…
neither beast nor man...

602
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,543
但的确有可怕的生物
就活在那座墙后
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

603
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,942
一头老虎或者狮子？
A lion or a tiger.

604
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,216
或者是吃人的家伙？
所有故事都是这么开始的
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

605
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
他还说什么了？
What else did he say?

606
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,548
什么也没说
Nothing.

607
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,387
第二天早晨我们发现
他的心脏上插了一把刀
We found him
the next morning. He'd stuck
a knife through his heart.

608
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,722

Mmm-hmm.

609
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,954
抱歉，伙计们，编故事编好点
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do
better than that.

610
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,463
怪兽，只在B级电影里才出现
Monsters belong in B movies.

611
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,559
如果你找到这个地方…
If you find this place...

612
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,506
如果你和你的朋友们
还有你们的摄像机一起上岸的话…
if you go ashore
with your friends
and your cameras...

613
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,370
你们就永远也回不来了
you won't come back.

614
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,869
只是想要你们明白这一点
Just as long as
you understand that.

615
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:09,269
（迷雾）

616
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,593
你认为我们会在这里待多长时间？
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

617
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,432
你在写一出舞台喜剧？
You're writing a stage comedy?

618
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,471
我为你而写的
I'm writing it for you.

619
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,506
你为什么要这么做？
Why would you do that?

620
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
- 为什么我要为你写一出戏？
- 是啊
Why would I write
a play for you?
Yes.

621
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,576
这还不明显吗？
Isn't it obvious?

622
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,651
对我来说不是
Not to me.

623
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,686
这个嘛…
Well...

624
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,025
在潜台词里已经说明了
it's in the subtext.

625
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,995
那我一定是没看到
I guess
I must have missed it.

626
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,903
不是言语上的
It's not about words.

627
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,042
给你的，船长
Message for you, Captain.

628
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,065
出什么事情了？
What's going on?

629
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,673
赫斯
我们为什么要改变航向？
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

630
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,509
- 安格霍恩，你不能…
- 外面说！
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

631
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,179
你的逮捕证已经下发了
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

632
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,148
这个你知道吗？
Did you know that?

633
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,220
我已经下命令转驶向仰光了
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

634
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,697
再给我一个星期
我的电影还没有拍成
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

635
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
求求你，我把我的一切都押上了
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

636
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,104
不，丹汉姆，你把我的一切都押上了
No, Denam.
You risked everything I have.

637
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,273
你想要什么？
What do you want?

638
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,610
告诉我你想要什么？
我什么都可以给你
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

639
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,615
我想要你下船
I want you off my ship.

640
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,677
设定到仰光的航向，赫斯先生
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

641
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,762
我完蛋了
I'm finished.

642
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,096
对我来说结束了，杰克
It's over for me, Jack.

643
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,326
你认为会有怎样的结局呢，卡尔？
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

644
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,489
检查一下我们的位置，用星星
Check our position.
Use the stars.

645
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,264
天上没有星星，船长
There are no stars, Captain.

646
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,107
这是什么？
What is that?

647
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,171
- 什么东西？
- 这个
What?
That.

648
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,812
这个，就在这儿
That right there.

649
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,617
不知道，是什么？也许是咖啡渍吧
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

650
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,788
守好前方观望台
告诉我测深索的深度
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth
by lead line.

651
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,559
是，船长
Aye, Captain.

652
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,998
30英寻，没见底！
（注 英寻为长度单位）
30 fathoms, no bottom!

653
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,811
减速，只用低速
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

654
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,444
双机低速前进
Dead slow ahead, both.

655
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,475
你应该停船
You should stop the ship.

656
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,651
左舵15度
15 degrees port.

657
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,254
赫斯先生，我们会走出去的
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

658
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,454
我们会找到没有雾的区域的
We'll find clear conditions.

659
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,654
测到海底了！
We have seabed!

660
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,894
25英寻！
25 fathoms!

661
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,241
水越来越浅了！
We're shallowing!

662
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,674
右舵20度！
20 degrees starboard!

663
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
船长，你根本不知道你正驶向哪里！
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

664
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,506
再去读个深度！
Get me another reading!

665
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,342
再读一次深度！
Another reading!

666
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,617
22英寻！
22 fathoms!

667
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,217
- 把灯关掉
- 是，船长
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

668
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,638
10英寻！
10 fathoms!

669
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,016
城墙！正前方有堵墙！
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

670
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,762
关闭发动机！
Stop engines!

671
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,867
给我点动力！半速前进！
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

672
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,031
半速前进，船长！
Half astern both, Captain!

673
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,805
礁石！
Rocks!

674
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,076
礁石！
Rocks!

675
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,816
右舷有礁石，船长！
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

676
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,690
左舷也有礁石！到处都是礁石！
To port! Rocks everywhere!

677
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,452
你来掌舵，赫斯
Take the wheel, hayes.

678
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
抓住！
Hang on!

679
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,668
全速前进！
Full ahead!

680
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,377
左舷有礁石，船长！
Rocks to port, Captain!

681
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,111
- 躲过了，船长
- 右舷！右舷！
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

682
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,831
啊！
Ah!

683
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,129
把这个洞堵上！
Shore up that breach!

684
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,470
给我找更多人下来！
来吧，快点，快！
Get me more men
down here now!
Come on, move, move!

685
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,809
- 赫斯！
- 船被狠狠撞了一下！
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

686
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,515
推进器怎么样？
What about the prop?

687
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,778
如我们现在所知，主轴没弯
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

688
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,082
我们卡在礁石上了！
But she struck hard
against the rock!

689
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,317
船长！
Captain!

690
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,754
你最好快点上来！
Better come up quick!

691
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,027
就在那儿！
Right there!

692
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,937
你想让我带他们回来吗？
Want me to bring them back?

693
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,275
卡尔・丹汉姆关我屁事
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denam.

694
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,840
下次涨潮之前要把这条船修好！
I want this ship fixed
and ready to float
on the next high tide!

695
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,546
快点，加油干！
Come on, move it.

696
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,712
我们要走了，赫斯先生
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

697
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,224
你能相信吗，杰克？
Can you believe this, Jack?

698
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,401
我们的电影拍成了
We've got our picture.

699
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,725
为什么马洛非要逆流而上呢？
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

700
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
他为什么不回头？
Why doesn't he turn back?

701
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,370
有一个“他”想要那么做，吉米
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

702
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,871
他心底有个声音在发出警告
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

703
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,773
可是那另一个“他”…
But there's another part...

704
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,645
需要去探索个究竟
that needs to know.

705
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,721
好打败那让他恐惧的东西
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

706
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,892
“我们过去无法理解
因为我们身在遥远的彼方…”
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

707
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,958
“我们也早已淡忘…”
"and could not renenber...

708
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,559
“因为那旅行
是穿过史前时代的长夜…”
"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...

709
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,701
“而那时代早已远去…
"of those ages
that are gone...

710
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,602
“了无踪迹，也没有回忆”
"leaving hardly a sign,
and no nenories.

711
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,706
“我们已经司空见惯了…”
"We are accustoned to look...

712
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
“带着沉重枷锁的被征服的巨兽…”
"upon the shackled forn
of a conquered nonster...

713
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
“但在那里…”
"but there...

714
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:29,054
“在那里你会见到
一个凶残并且无拘无束的它”
"there you could look
at a thing
nonstrous and free."

715
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,299
这不是个冒险故事…
It's not
an adventure story...

716
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,498
对吗，赫斯先生？
is it, Mr. Hayes?

717
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,839
对，吉米
No, Jimmy.

718
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,343
不是
It's not.

719
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,235
- 这是个荒废了的地方
- 这当然是个被荒废的地方
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

720
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,740
睁开眼睛看看，普雷斯顿
这地方就是个废墟
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

721
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,973
成百上千年没有人住过了
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

722
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,343
丹汉姆先生，我想我们该回去了
Mr. Denam,
I think we should go back.

723
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,150
这个我来处理
I will handle this.

724
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:44,222
（牛奶巧克力）

725
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,222
看，巧克力
Look. Chocolate.

726
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,194
你喜欢巧克力吗？
You like chocolate?

727
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,630
很好吃的
It's good to eat.

728
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,235
想要吗？
You want?

729
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,475
拿着吧
Take it.

730
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,589
这里，拿在手里吧，拿着
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

731
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,098
看在上帝的份上，丹汉姆
别跟这些土著纠缠了
For God's sakes, Denam,
leave the native alone.

732
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,465
她不想要你的巧克力
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

733
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,666
啊！
Aah!

734
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,059
没事的！
All right!

735
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,920
只是女人和老人！
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

736
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,361
不会有危险的！
They're harmless!

737
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,175
安！
Ann!

738
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,764
杰克！
Jack.

739
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,386
这下开眼了吧
Seen enough?

740
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,891
给船减轻重量！
Lighten the ship!

741
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,062
不是必需的东西都扔下去！
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

742
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,895
举起来！
Just heave it!

743
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,668
我们逃出来了
We got away.

744
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,471
我们得心存感激，先生们
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

745
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,309
那麦克呢？他可没逃出来
他现在都还在那儿呢！
What about Mike?
He didn't get away!
He's still there!

746
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,313
麦克死得其所！
他的死不是没有价值的
Mike died doing
what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

747
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,445
我再告诉你一件事
我会为了麦克把这部电影拍完的！
And I'll tell you
something else. I'm gonna
finish this film for Mike!

748
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,522
我会把它拍完的…
I'll finish it...

749
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,730
我还要把影片的收益捐给…
and I'll donate
the proceeds...

750
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
他的妻子和孩子
to his wife and kids.

751
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,231
因为那人是个英雄
他应该得到这样的荣誉
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

752
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,440
听啊，听！
Hear, hear!

753
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,348
除了土豆，把能扔的都扔掉
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

754
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,722
- 这到底是怎么了
- 抱歉，莎士比亚
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

755
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,592
来吧，老兄，来吧，快点
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

756
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,241
把那些多余的缆绳扔掉！快啊，扔掉！
Drop those
spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

757
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,821
- 安在哪里？
- 什么？
Where's Ann?
What?

758
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,056
安在哪里？
Where's Ann?

759
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,425
安！
Ann!

760
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,554
脱离困境了！
She's free!

761
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,492
双机全速前进！
Full ahead, both engines!

762
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,207
安！
Ann!

763
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,699
不！停船！回去！
No! Stop! Turn back!

764
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
停船！
Stop!

765
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,969
我们必须掉头
We have to turn back.

766
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,835
他们抢走了安
They've taken Ann.

767
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,340
No!

768
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,349
刚！刚！刚！
Kong! Kong! Kong!

769
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:48,435
全体人员准备上岸！报告位置！
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

770
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,173
快点，快点，先生们！
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

771
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,574
我们正在快，赫斯先生！
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

772
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,650
来吧，快点！
Come on, move it!

773
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,333
用力划！
Pull harder!

774
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,575
划啊！划啊！
Row! Row!

775
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,972
加油！
Come on!

776
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,918
刚
Kong.

777
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,099
散开来，找到她！
Spread out! Find her!

778
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,278
丹劳小姐！
Miss Darrow!

779
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,279
- 去那边找，吉米！
- 所有人不要走散了！
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

780
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,745
安！
Ann!

781
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,653
她应该就在附近！
She's here somewhere!

782
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,195
上帝啊，那是什么东西？
What in God's name was that?

783
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,164
在城墙后面！
Behind the wall!

784
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,499
城墙后面！
Behind the wall!

785
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,526
她不见了！
She's gone!

786
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,269
卡尔，怎么了？
Carl, what is it?

787
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,576
你见到什么了？
You saw something.

788
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,555
赫斯带15个人跟你们去
You can take hayes
and 15 others.

789
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,024
我派人守卫城门，直到你们回来
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

790
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,588
其他人在船上等
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

791
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,791
老崔！
Choy!

792
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,127
吉米，你不去
Not you, Jimmy.

793
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,364
不要这样，赫斯先生，看看他们
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

794
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,202
没人会用枪
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

795
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,605
你呆在这里
Stay here.

796
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,578
- 丹劳小姐需要我！
- 不！
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!

797
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,816
带上三角架跟其他拍摄设备
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

798
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,320
你要六寸长焦镜头吗？
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

799
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,189
普通广角镜足够了
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

800
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,132
你们有枪，有食物，有弹药
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

801
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,398
给你们24小时！
And you got 24 hours!

802
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,303
24小时啊
24 hours?

803
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,699
明天这个时候我们启锚
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

804
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,688
丹劳小姐！
Miss Darrow!

805
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,193
安！
Ann!

806
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,004
丹劳小姐！
Miss Darrow!

807
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:14,644
丹劳小姐！
Miss Darrow!

808
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,361
那是什么？
What is it?

809
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,172
开火！
Fire!

810
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,514
阻止它
Cut it out.

811
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,243
停火
Hold your fire.

812
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,011
停止开火！
Hold your fire!

813
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,019
趴下，妈的，趴下
Stay down, damn it.
Stay down.

814
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:44,900
来啊，来啊
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

815
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,496
打的好，赫斯先生
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

816
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,045
这些东西不是绝种了么？
Arert these things supposed
to be extinct?

817
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,614
他们现在是了
They are now.

818
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,949
这他妈到底是什么地方？
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

819
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:51,904
丹劳小姐！
Miss Darrow!

820
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,701
丹劳小姐！

821
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,670
安！
Ann!

822
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,210
不！
No!

823
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,135
- 安！
- 丹劳小姐！
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

824
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,809
安！
Ann!

825
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,253
Ann!

826
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,666
好家伙，这里好像流着血的坟场
Christ,
it's a bleeding boneyard!

827
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,538
他们都被分肢了
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

828
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,808
安！安！
Ann! Ann!

829
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,320
赫斯先生，继续走就是了
当没看见我
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

830
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,383
- 耶稣基督啊，吉米
- 我需要那把枪
Jesus, Jimmy.
Hey, I need that!

831
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,689
我不会给你枪的
I'm not giving you a gun!

832
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,787
他们发枪给你的时候比我还小！
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

833
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,425
我那是在陆军里，有教练士官教我
I was in the Army.
I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

834
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,030
我想帮忙找她回来
I wanna help bring her back.

835
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,847
不要让我后悔
Don't make me regret it.

836
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:49,163
节省弹药
Conserve your ammunition!

837
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:00,007
我都累死了
I'm knackered.

838
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:04,380
- 我不能呼吸了
- 我需要人工呼吸
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

839
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:05,923
伙计们，没时间了
Fellows, we don't have
time for this.

840
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,459
我们已经延误了，起来吧！
We've lost too much ground
already. Come on, get up!

841
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:11,963
他们需要休息，放松一下
They're not about to
quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

842
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:14,429
你们可以休息5分钟
All right,
you got five minutes!

843
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,600
所有人都在待在我的视线以内
Everybody stay in sight.

844
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:24,042
到这边来
我要给峡谷拍一个广角
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

845
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:55,638
血腥诺拉！
Bloody Nora!

846
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:05,011
就是这东西抓走了丹劳小姐？
Is that
what took Miss Darrow?

847
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:12,717
只有一种生物可以
留下这么大的脚印
There's only one creature
capable of leaving
a footprint that size.

848
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:21,064
恐怖的雪人
The abominable snowman.

849
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:25,364
是啊，雪人，我们是刀板上的鱼肉了
Yeah, a snowman.
We dead meat.

850
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,471
那东西得多大，20，25英尺高？
It's got to be what,
20, 25 feet?

851
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,009
卡尔看到过
Carl saw it.

852
01:22:33,412 --> 01:22:34,902
我们问问他
Let's ask him.

853
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:38,209
丹汉姆！
Denam!

854
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,048
他跑哪里去了？
Where'd he go?

855
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,037
走过去，布鲁斯
Walk forward, Bruce.

856
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,373
- 什么？
- 你是片子主角
What?
You're the star
of this picture.

857
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,505
进入角色，走向那群动物
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

858
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:18,248
这里到底是他妈的什么地方啊
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

859
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:30,799
你确定这能行吗，丹汉姆？
Are you sure about this,
Denam?

860
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,362
这种事没替身的吗？
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

861
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,373
我要你在镜头里
不然别人说这是假的
I need you in the shot,
or people will say
they're fake.

862
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,636
没人会说这是假的
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

863
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:49,310
你让它们紧张了，别突然乱动
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

864
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,685
我没动
I'm not moving.

865
01:23:56,461 --> 01:23:58,793
上帝他妈啊
Mother of God.

866
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:22,117
怎么回事？
What's this?

867
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:49,813
怎么了，怎么了？卡尔在哪？
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

868
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:52,679
卡尔？他…他在那边，拍电影
Carl?
He's up there, filming.

869
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:04,527
小心！
Bugger this!

870
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:06,627
Watch out.

871
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:13,734
跑啊，杰克！
Run, Jack!

872
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,066
耶稣基督啊，快走，吉米，跑啊！
Holy Christ.
Go, Jimmy, run!

873
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:21,468
跑，跑，跑啊！
Run, run, run!

874
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:29,945
- 你放手
- 我不会丢下摄影机的
Let go!
I'm not leaving the camera!

875
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,318
快放手，你个笨蛋
Let go, you idiot!

876
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:33,220
卡尔，快跑
Carl, run!

877
01:25:46,671 --> 01:25:47,933
趴下
Look out!

878
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:49,798
看着点！
Look out!

879
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,649
过来了！
Coming through!

880
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:46,981
不！
No!

881
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:48,921
Come on.

882
01:28:30,068 --> 01:28:32,798
卡尔！卡尔！
Carl! Carl!

883
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:38,499
起来！快走，快走
Get up! Come on. Come on.

884
01:28:53,325 --> 01:28:55,987
丹汉姆先生！丹汉姆先生！
Mr. Denam! Mr. Denam!

885
01:28:56,695 --> 01:28:59,289
赫伯，赫伯！快点！
Herb! Herb, come on!

886
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:01,093
抓住三角架！
Take the tripod!

887
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,561
来啊！
Come on!

888
01:29:03,768 --> 01:29:06,328
我把你拉上来，抓紧了支脚
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

889
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:07,428
走吧！
Go!

890
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:09,200
不，没你我哪儿也不去
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

891
01:29:09,874 --> 01:29:12,536
- 你应该离开我
- 闭嘴，抓住了
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

892
01:30:20,278 --> 01:30:22,007
吉米，算算人头数
Jimmy, do a head count.

893
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,605
我想知道有多少人受了伤
伤势如何
I want to know how many
are injured and how bad.

894
01:30:24,682 --> 01:30:25,944
受伤？
Injured?

895
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,115
我们死了4个人！
Four of us are dead!

896
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:37,590
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

897
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:40,725
发生在赫伯身上的事，不是谁的错
What happened to herb
is no one's fault.

898
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,599
你说的很对，普雷斯顿
You're absolutely right,
Preston.

899
01:30:44,002 --> 01:30:46,402
我再告诉你一件事情
And I'll tell you
something else.

900
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:48,769
赫伯没有无谓的死去
Herbert didn't die
for nothing.

901
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:51,972
他死得其所，我要纪念他
He died for
what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

902
01:30:52,043 --> 01:30:56,104
他死是因为相信世界上还有些奥秘
He died believing
there was still some mystery
left in this world.

903
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:59,175
而我们大家
都有可能了解到其中的一部分…
And we could all
have a piece of it...

904
01:30:59,384 --> 01:31:01,909
只消一张门票的价钱
for the price
of an admission ticket.

905
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:05,850
该死的，普雷斯顿
我们要为赫伯完成这部片子
God damn it, Preston,
we're gonna finish this film
for herb.

906
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:07,918
我们要完成它…
We'll finish it...

907
01:31:08,026 --> 01:31:10,927
把收益捐给他的妻子和孩子
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

908
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:20,433
伙计们，我们还需要更多的绳子
Come on, guys.
We need more rope.

909
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:24,364
好吧，我们得回去了
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

910
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:28,139
- 安格霍恩会在9小时后开船
- 那又怎样？我们要找到丹劳小姐
Englehorn sails
in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

911
01:31:28,213 --> 01:31:30,841
嘿！你在听我讲吗？
我们会被困在这里的
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be
stranded here.

912
01:31:32,684 --> 01:31:36,085
听着，伙计们，丹劳小姐是好姑娘
毫无疑问
Miss Darrow was a great gal,
no question.

913
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,283
她是很好的人
And she was
a wonderful person.

914
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:41,587
她的死是可怕的损失
我们都会想念她的
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

915
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:45,795
我就知道你不是银幕上
所演的那种硬汉形象
I always knew you were
nothing like the tough guy
you play on screen.

916
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:47,593
我只是没想到你居然是个懦夫
I just never figured you
for a coward.

917
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:49,792
嘿，伙计，嘿，醒醒吧
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

918
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,803
真实生活里的英雄不像我这样
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

919
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:56,432
真实生活里他们都有坏牙跟啤酒肚
In the real world,
they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

920
01:31:56,508 --> 01:32:00,035
我只是个拿枪的演员
并且失去了动力
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

921
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,969
回头见
Be seeing you.

922
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:05,580
还有谁吗？
Anyone else?

923
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:09,086
- 好吧，回见
- 别…
Well, see you.
Come on.

924
01:37:05,783 --> 01:37:06,977
不！
No!

925
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,118
我说了，不！
I said no!

926
01:37:16,594 --> 01:37:20,155
到此为止，没有了
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

927
01:39:42,573 --> 01:39:45,371
赶他们下船！赶他们下船！
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

928
01:39:47,678 --> 01:39:49,202
继续划啊！
Keep paddling.

929
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:28,017
到底是什么东西？
What the hell was that?

930
01:41:09,226 --> 01:41:11,592
来啊，把它们赶跑！
Come on.
Get them out of there!

931
01:41:13,397 --> 01:41:14,728
普雷斯顿！
Preston!

932
01:41:19,904 --> 01:41:21,531
给我你的手
Give me your hand.

933
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:23,165
杰克！
Jack!

934
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:29,943
杰克！
Jack!

935
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,016
- 老崔！
- 救命！
Choy!
Help!

936
01:41:36,187 --> 01:41:38,178
游啊，你个脏虫子！
Swim, you filthy bugger.

937
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,781
老崔！
Choy!

938
01:42:50,694 --> 01:42:51,718
跟着他
Stay with him.

939
01:42:51,796 --> 01:42:53,229
尽快游到河岸去！
Swim to shore
as fast as you can!

940
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:54,525
坚持住，普雷斯顿！
Hold on. Preston!

941
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,326
不管发生什么，别丢了摄像机！
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

942
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,460
别丢了摄像机！
Don't let go
of the camera!

943
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:09,075
快点，起来，离开水
Come on,
get up out of that water.

944
01:43:10,014 --> 01:43:11,242
起来！
Get up!

945
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:53,059
来啊，来啊！
Come on, come on.

946
01:44:05,316 --> 01:44:07,284
普雷斯顿，普雷斯顿
Preston. Preston.

947
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:20,520
还能用
It's working.

948
01:44:38,483 --> 01:44:40,542
你有拍到是吧？
Did you get that, did you?

949
01:45:40,878 --> 01:45:42,243
不！
No!

950
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:44,005
不
No.

951
01:45:48,519 --> 01:45:49,543
不
No.

952
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:41,097
怎么了？
What is it?

953
01:46:45,877 --> 01:46:47,174
赫斯先生？
Mr. Hayes?

954
01:46:50,748 --> 01:46:53,342
如果有什么不测，我希望你赶快跑
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

955
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:55,113
明白了？
You understand?

956
01:46:55,687 --> 01:46:58,656
我不是懦夫，我才不会跑呢
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

957
01:47:00,191 --> 01:47:02,159
这并非什么勇敢，吉米
It's not about
being brave, Jimmy.

958
01:47:30,788 --> 01:47:31,812
回去！
Go back!

959
01:47:33,858 --> 01:47:35,257
回去木桥那边！
Back across the log!

960
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:38,020
- 我不能就这么跑掉！
- 把吉米带走！
I ain't gonna run!
Get Jimmy out of here!

961
01:47:38,263 --> 01:47:39,560
- 不！
- 后退！后退！
No!
Get back! Get back!

962
01:47:44,469 --> 01:47:45,800
Move back!

963
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,014
- 不！不！
- 呆着别动
No! No!
Stay back.

964
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:04,779
不！
No!

965
01:48:10,061 --> 01:48:11,358
看着我
Look at me.

966
01:48:13,598 --> 01:48:16,158
- 放他走！
- 你要跑了，吉米
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.

967
01:48:20,338 --> 01:48:21,703
按我说的做
Do as I say.

968
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,440
跟杰克一起走
Go with Jack.

969
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:27,936
跑啊！
Run!

970
01:48:31,482 --> 01:48:33,916
- 不！
- 开枪射他！
No!
Shoot him!

971
01:48:35,453 --> 01:48:36,442
不！
No!

972
01:48:51,502 --> 01:48:54,300
这里，在这边！
Here! Over here!

973
01:49:12,423 --> 01:49:14,391
坚持住！坚持！
Hold on! Hold on!

974
01:49:18,496 --> 01:49:20,760
兰皮！救我！
Lumpy! Help me!

975
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,399
他妈的地狱，老崔！
Bloody hell, Choy!

976
01:54:46,057 --> 01:54:47,115
不！
No!

977
01:54:51,295 --> 01:54:52,489
哦，我的神啊！
Oh, my!

978
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:29,255
等等我
Wait!

979
02:02:18,775 --> 02:02:19,901
卡尔
Carl.

980
02:02:24,982 --> 02:02:26,574
吉米！吉米！
Jimmy. Jimmy.

981
02:02:27,451 --> 02:02:28,440
吉米！
Jimmy.

982
02:02:29,553 --> 02:02:30,713
你还好吗？
You all right?

983
02:03:20,671 --> 02:03:21,933
不
No.

984
02:04:14,424 --> 02:04:16,449
下去，下去！
Get off! Get it off!

985
02:04:23,767 --> 02:04:24,791
下去！
Get off!

986
02:04:38,682 --> 02:04:39,774
下去！
Get it off!

987
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:41,344
Get it off! Get it off!

988
02:05:45,716 --> 02:05:46,842
杀了它！
Kill it!

989
02:05:58,929 --> 02:06:00,328
别动
Stop moving!

990
02:06:20,384 --> 02:06:22,113
把它从我脸上弄走
Get it off my face!

991
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,486
- 站着别动
- 我没动
Stay still.
I am standing still.

992
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:29,788
- 等一下
- 小心！
Hold on.
Be careful!

993
02:07:04,628 --> 02:07:07,256
别动，离崖壁远点
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

994
02:07:07,931 --> 02:07:09,455
脱险了！
Coming through!

995
02:07:17,908 --> 02:07:20,502
现在离开那儿！往上爬！
Get out of there now! Climb!

996
02:07:27,584 --> 02:07:29,381
没人能挡我的道
Nobody get in my way.

997
02:07:32,489 --> 02:07:34,286
来吧，吉米，我们走
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

998
02:07:34,357 --> 02:07:36,848
爬上绳子，快
Get up the rope.
Let's go. Hurry up.

999
02:08:03,353 --> 02:08:05,617
吉米，我们走了
Jimmy, let's go.

1000
02:08:09,893 --> 02:08:11,520
- 快来啊
- 好的
Come on.
Okay.

1001
02:08:15,165 --> 02:08:16,154
走
Go.

1002
02:08:21,071 --> 02:08:23,301
就在你下沉…
Just as you go down...

1003
02:08:24,007 --> 02:08:26,475
到第三也是最后一次时…
for the third
and final time...

1004
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:30,311
就在你的头淹没在浪头下…
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

1005
02:08:30,947 --> 02:08:33,177
你的肺也充满了水…
and your lungs fill
with water...

1006
02:08:33,783 --> 02:08:37,981
在你淹死前，你知道那仅存的珍贵的
几秒钟都发生了什么吗？
do you know what happens
in those last precious seconds
before you drown?

1007
02:08:38,154 --> 02:08:41,021
来吧，兄弟，爬上绳子去，来啊
离开这，来吧
Come on, buddy.
Get up the rope. Come on.
Get out of here. Come on.

1008
02:08:41,091 --> 02:08:43,787
你的整个人生会在眼前一晃而过
Your whole life passes
before your eyes.

1009
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,328
而如果你活得像个真正的美国人…
And if you've lived
as a true American...

1010
02:08:46,596 --> 02:08:48,996
你会看到那是有色彩的
you get to watch it all
in color.

1011
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:51,425
哦，你会的
Oh, and you will.

1012
02:08:51,501 --> 02:08:54,026
现在，你干嘛不爬上绳子呢？快点
Now, why don't you climb
up the rope, huh? Come on.

1013
02:08:59,509 --> 02:09:01,636
来吧，德里斯库，我们走
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

1014
02:11:56,319 --> 02:11:57,843
真美丽
It's beautiful.

1015
02:12:19,309 --> 02:12:20,640
美丽
Beautiful.

1016
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:33,452
美丽
Beautiful.

1017
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:22,064
那边
There.

1018
02:13:25,141 --> 02:13:26,233
感谢上帝
Thank God.

1019
02:13:26,309 --> 02:13:28,277
别谢上帝，要谢巴克斯特先生
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

1020
02:13:28,378 --> 02:13:30,346
他坚持要救你们
He insisted on
a rescue mission.

1021
02:13:31,681 --> 02:13:35,139
我？我就知道你不会有事
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

1022
02:13:36,452 --> 02:13:38,716
这就是蟑螂的特点
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

1023
02:13:38,788 --> 02:13:42,224
不管你把它们从厕所里冲走多少次…
No matter how many times
you flush them
down the toilet...

1024
02:13:42,291 --> 02:13:44,782
它们总是爬回到碗里来
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

1025
02:13:45,728 --> 02:13:48,561
嘿，伙计，我从碗里出来了
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.

1026
02:13:49,332 --> 02:13:51,994
我在晾干我的翅膀
正沿着碗盖散步呢
I'm dryir off my wings
and trekkir across the lid.

1027
02:13:59,942 --> 02:14:01,170
德里斯库！
Driscoll!

1028
02:14:02,645 --> 02:14:06,308
别犯傻！放弃吧，没用的！
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

1029
02:14:07,583 --> 02:14:08,948
她死了
She's dead.

1030
02:14:11,754 --> 02:14:13,312
她没死
She's not dead.

1031
02:14:17,226 --> 02:14:19,456
杰克会救她回来…
Jack's gonna bring her back...

1032
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:23,024
那猩猩会紧追不放的
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

1033
02:14:23,733 --> 02:14:26,258
我们还有机会翻本，好吧？
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

1034
02:14:28,871 --> 02:14:30,429
还有的赚
More than okay.

1035
02:14:31,674 --> 02:14:33,232
想想吧
Think about it.

1036
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:36,142
你有一整船的氯仿可用
You got a boat
full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1037
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,980
你想抓那猩猩
You wanna trap the ape?

1038
02:14:45,822 --> 02:14:47,449
我可不这么想
I don't think so.

1039
02:14:48,024 --> 02:14:51,460
这不是你拿手的吗？活捉动物
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

1040
02:14:52,962 --> 02:14:54,725
我听说你是最好的
I heard you were the best.

1041
02:15:02,839 --> 02:15:03,965
杰克！
Jack!

1042
02:15:07,043 --> 02:15:08,806
照顾好你自己！
Look after yourself!

1043
02:15:09,445 --> 02:15:11,072
把城门开着，可以吗？
Keep the gate open, will you?

1044
02:15:11,447 --> 02:15:12,846
没问题，伙计
Sure thing, buddy.

1045
02:15:13,883 --> 02:15:15,214
祝你好运！
Good luck!

1046
02:15:28,498 --> 02:15:29,863
对不起
I'm sorry.

1047
02:18:08,724 --> 02:18:09,782
安
Ann.

1048
02:19:18,327 --> 02:19:19,419
杰克！
Jack!

1049
02:19:20,296 --> 02:19:21,388
快跑！
Run!

1050
02:19:51,694 --> 02:19:53,321
杰克，杰克！
Jack, Jack!

1051
02:20:01,036 --> 02:20:02,196
杰克
Jack.

1052
02:20:11,247 --> 02:20:13,215
安，没事的
Ann, it's okay.

1053
02:20:14,049 --> 02:20:16,449
安，我们走，我们走，来吧！
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!

1054
02:20:29,732 --> 02:20:31,097
我们要走了，来吧
Let's go. Come on.

1055
02:20:31,834 --> 02:20:33,062
来啊！
Come on!

1056
02:22:05,327 --> 02:22:06,419
卡尔！
Carl!

1057
02:22:06,595 --> 02:22:09,291
有人吗，请帮帮我们！
Please! Somebody help us!

1058
02:22:11,433 --> 02:22:12,900
他们走了
They've gone.

1059
02:22:14,470 --> 02:22:16,529
卡尔，上帝啊！
Carl. Christ.

1060
02:22:17,106 --> 02:22:18,198
卡尔！
Carl!

1061
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:21,202
把吊桥放下，现在就放
看在上帝份儿上！
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1062
02:22:21,277 --> 02:22:22,505
还不是时候
Not yet.

1063
02:22:23,946 --> 02:22:25,038
等着
Wait.

1064
02:22:25,714 --> 02:22:26,806
等着
Wait.

1065
02:22:30,953 --> 02:22:32,045
等着！
Wait!

1066
02:22:42,765 --> 02:22:43,993
来啊！
Come on!

1067
02:23:56,472 --> 02:23:57,962
就现在！扔钩子啊！
Now!
Throw them!

1068
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:59,439
扔啊！
Throw!

1069
02:24:00,309 --> 02:24:01,333
不要！
No!

1070
02:24:03,712 --> 02:24:04,940
抓住他
Hold him!

1071
02:24:05,014 --> 02:24:06,504
你疯了吗？
Are you out of your mind?

1072
02:24:15,224 --> 02:24:17,351
- 住手！
- 抓住绳子
Stop!
Hold the line!

1073
02:24:18,093 --> 02:24:19,492
把他压住！
Keep him down!

1074
02:24:25,067 --> 02:24:26,056
拉啊！
Heave!

1075
02:24:27,102 --> 02:24:28,433
求你了！
Please!

1076
02:24:28,904 --> 02:24:30,599
不要！停手！
No! Stop!

1077
02:24:30,939 --> 02:24:31,928
杰克
Jack.

1078
02:24:33,008 --> 02:24:34,270
- 住手
- 把她带走…
No.
Get her out of...

1079
02:24:34,343 --> 02:24:36,243
- 他们会杀了他的！
- 我们什么也做不了
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

1080
02:24:36,311 --> 02:24:38,279
- 不！
- 把她带出它的视线！
No!
Get her out of his sight!

1081
02:24:38,347 --> 02:24:40,281
- 太迟了
- 扔啊！
It's too late.
Throw it!

1082
02:24:42,551 --> 02:24:43,643
留神啊！
Look out!

1083
02:24:45,954 --> 02:24:47,421
放开我
Let go of me.

1084
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:53,187
我们得走了，来吧
We gotta go. Come on.

1085
02:24:53,762 --> 02:24:54,956
- 来吧
- 住手
Come on.
Stop it.

1086
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:56,554
放开我！
Leave me alone!

1087
02:24:57,733 --> 02:24:59,257
安，求你，走吧
Ann, please come on.

1088
02:25:06,575 --> 02:25:08,406
- 打死它！
- 不要！不！
Kill it!
No. No!

1089
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:10,874
结束了，你个疯子
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!

1090
02:25:13,082 --> 02:25:14,606
所有人，逃命！
All of you, run!

1091
02:25:14,683 --> 02:25:16,344
加油，加油！
Come on. Come on!

1092
02:25:33,102 --> 02:25:34,399
Look out!

1093
02:25:45,681 --> 02:25:47,308
跑啊！跑啊！
Move it! Move it!

1094
02:25:49,685 --> 02:25:51,050
快，快点！
Come on, come on!

1095
02:25:59,962 --> 02:26:01,589
- 待在那！
- 他要的是我！
Stay there!
It's me he wants!

1096
02:26:01,663 --> 02:26:03,858
- 求你制止这一起！
- 快走，拦住她！
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!

1097
02:26:03,932 --> 02:26:06,594
- 安，走吧
- 求你了，我可以制止他！
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!

1098
02:26:06,668 --> 02:26:08,192
- 不！
- 安，待在那儿！
No!
Ann, stay there!

1099
02:26:10,672 --> 02:26:12,071
离开这儿！
Get it out!

1100
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:16,675
赶快他妈的离开这儿！
Get the hell out of here!

1101
02:26:16,745 --> 02:26:18,736
- 来吧！
- 吉米，别犯傻了！来吧
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

1102
02:26:18,814 --> 02:26:20,111
别犯傻了
Don't be crazy.

1103
02:26:21,316 --> 02:26:22,408
让我走！
Let me go!

1104
02:26:23,752 --> 02:26:25,219
起锚！
Cast off!

1105
02:26:27,523 --> 02:26:28,785
来啊，卡尔！
Come on, Carl!

1106
02:26:30,259 --> 02:26:32,090
- 划船
- 等等
Row!
Wait.

1107
02:26:32,361 --> 02:26:34,488
划船，他妈的！
Row, God damn it!

1108
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:45,866
回去
Go back.

1109
02:26:52,781 --> 02:26:53,907
吉米，不！
Jimmy, no!

1110
02:27:00,889 --> 02:27:01,878
不！
No!

1111
02:27:18,974 --> 02:27:20,805
不！别开枪！放他条生路！
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1112
02:27:20,876 --> 02:27:22,400
躲在后面！
Hide out in the back!

1113
02:27:44,967 --> 02:27:46,594
- 等一下！
- 不！
Wait!
No!

1114
02:27:47,302 --> 02:27:49,896
不！求你了！不要！
No! No! Please don't!

1115
02:29:48,123 --> 02:29:50,648
全世界都会要付钱看它
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1116
02:29:53,395 --> 02:29:55,386
我们是百万富翁了，弟兄们！
We're millionaires, boys!

1117
02:29:55,697 --> 02:29:57,597
我会跟你们所有人共享的！
I'll share it with all of you!

1118
02:29:58,433 --> 02:30:02,927
几个月之内
它的名字会在百老汇的灯光里出现
In a few months
his name will be up
in lights on Broadway!

1119
02:30:05,107 --> 02:30:09,203
金刚！世界第八大奇迹！
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1120
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:20,120
(金刚，世界第八大奇迹）

1121
02:30:21,039 --> 02:30:24,227
（金刚，卡尔・丹汉姆的巨型怪兽）

1122
02:30:43,277 --> 02:30:45,857
（看安妮・丹劳被奉献给“野兽”）

1123
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:01,006
（售完）

1124
02:31:09,671 --> 02:31:10,797
Mr. Denam!

1125
02:31:12,507 --> 02:31:14,532
我能说什么？我能说什么？
What can I say?
What can I say?

1126
02:31:14,609 --> 02:31:16,008
有什么想法，先生？
Any comments, Mr. Denam?

1127
02:31:17,345 --> 02:31:18,972
市长大人，谢谢你
The Mayor, thank you.

1128
02:31:20,182 --> 02:31:21,171
准备好
Ready.

1129
02:31:21,349 --> 02:31:22,680
我是谁？
What am I?

1130
02:31:23,085 --> 02:31:24,814
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

1131
02:31:28,657 --> 02:31:30,147
习惯了就好
Get used to it.

1132
02:31:30,358 --> 02:31:31,995
非常高兴见到你，你准备好了吗？
Listen, it's great to see you.
Ready?

1133
02:31:32,095 --> 02:31:33,565
谢谢你的关心…
I'm really
appreciating that...

1134
02:31:33,628 --> 02:31:35,095
看看你！我记得你
Look at you!
I remember you.

1135
02:31:35,163 --> 02:31:38,155
- 你真是好运气，丹汉姆先生
- 可不是好运吗？
You're a lucky guy, Denam.
Am I a lucky guy?

1136
02:31:38,233 --> 02:31:40,030
或许你就是个幸运儿
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1137
02:31:53,849 --> 02:31:55,009
卡尔！
Carl!

1138
02:31:56,885 --> 02:31:58,079
- 索尔曼！
- 我跟你说了！
Zelman!
I told them.

1139
02:31:58,153 --> 02:31:59,620
- 我知道你会来的
- 我真的很喜欢
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1140
02:31:59,688 --> 02:32:01,679
让我们来照相
Let's get a shot of this.

1141
02:32:02,157 --> 02:32:03,283
来吧
Come on.

1142
02:32:04,025 --> 02:32:06,357
大笑一下
耶！这真是太棒了！
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!

1143
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:11,665
看看你自己，看看你成了什么样
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've becone.

1144
02:32:12,667 --> 02:32:14,931
- 没有女人值得你这样
- 这个女人值得
No woman is won'th this.
This woman is won'th it.

1145
02:32:15,003 --> 02:32:16,994
我不管什么代价，一定要赢得她
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1146
02:32:17,072 --> 02:32:18,300
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?

1147
02:32:18,373 --> 02:32:20,034
她才不会买这个呢
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.

1148
02:32:20,108 --> 02:32:22,303
闭嘴，把那个葡萄柚给我
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!

1149
02:32:24,446 --> 02:32:27,108
- 你在写一部喜剧？
- 没错
You're writing a conedy?
Yes, I an.

1150
02:32:27,849 --> 02:32:29,783
是为你写的
I'n writing it for you.

1151
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,585
你为什么要这么做？
Why would you do that?

1152
02:32:34,589 --> 02:32:36,989
为什么我要为你写一出戏？
Why would I write
a play for you?

1153
02:32:40,395 --> 02:32:42,022
这还不明显吗？
Isn't it obvious?

1154
02:32:42,297 --> 02:32:43,787
哦，对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

1155
02:32:45,033 --> 02:32:46,898
我无意间听到的
I couldn't help but overhear.

1156
02:32:50,405 --> 02:32:53,135
于是，他领我去了那豪华法国餐馆…
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1157
02:32:53,208 --> 02:32:56,006
吃饭当间，他抓住了我的手
and halfway through
the hors d'oeuvres,
he clutches my hand.

1158
02:32:56,077 --> 02:32:58,272
就是他向你表白的时候了吧
他感觉怎样？
And that's when he told you
how he felt?

1159
02:32:58,346 --> 02:33:01,076
- 不，他一直没说
- 他一直没说吗？
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1160
02:33:01,149 --> 02:33:03,117
他大概以为不用说了吧
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1161
02:33:03,185 --> 02:33:05,210
那她怎么知道这就是认真的呢？
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

1162
02:33:05,287 --> 02:33:08,745
- 他说不必用言语
- 有没有搞错
He said it was
not about the words.
Oh, please!

1163
02:33:08,957 --> 02:33:13,087
心里有感动，就说出来
其实很简单的
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1164
02:33:13,461 --> 02:33:17,761
他说以后再说，只是，不会有以后了
He said we'd talk
about it later.
Only there was no later.

1165
02:33:19,501 --> 02:33:21,059
从来没有说出口过
It never happened.

1166
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:23,833
就这么结束了
That's how it ended.

1167
02:33:23,972 --> 02:33:27,703
他让你就这么走了？
他没有试图挽留？
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1168
02:33:29,578 --> 02:33:32,945
老实说
我觉得事情或许真的有结果了…
I honestly believed
things might actually
work out...

1169
02:33:34,049 --> 02:33:36,040
那就是真的很…
which was really very...

1170
02:33:39,321 --> 02:33:40,549
愚蠢
foolish.

1171
02:33:40,789 --> 02:33:43,417
男人呐，哦，他会给女人整个世界…
Men.
Oh, they'll give you
the world...

1172
02:33:43,491 --> 02:33:45,891
却让最重要的事情…
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1173
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:47,861
…溜过指尖
slip through their fingers.

1174
02:33:47,929 --> 02:33:49,157
太常见了
Typical.

1175
02:33:49,764 --> 02:33:53,427
他们太忙于展示他们的勇敢
以至于忘了用用他们的脑子
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use
their brains.

1176
02:33:54,402 --> 02:33:56,302
浪漫，谁需要？
Romance. Who needs it?

1177
02:34:21,029 --> 02:34:22,360
谢谢
Thank you.

1178
02:34:23,198 --> 02:34:24,563
谢谢
Thank you.

1179
02:34:27,502 --> 02:34:28,833
谢谢
Thank you.

1180
02:34:30,639 --> 02:34:32,004
谢谢
Thank you.

1181
02:34:33,808 --> 02:34:35,275
女士们，先生们…
Ladies and gentlemen...

1182
02:34:36,878 --> 02:34:39,369
我来这里
是要给你们讲述一个奇异的故事
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1183
02:34:40,148 --> 02:34:41,877
一个有关我们的历险的故事…
The story of our adventure...

1184
02:34:42,717 --> 02:34:45,686
17名探险队员惨死…
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1185
02:34:46,655 --> 02:34:48,145
他们献出了自己的生命…
their lives lost...

1186
02:34:48,923 --> 02:34:51,016
去追寻一只野兽…
in pursuit of
a savage beast...

1187
02:34:52,193 --> 02:34:54,787
一只大自然创造的狂大怪物
a monstrous aberration
of nature.

1188
02:34:56,031 --> 02:34:58,158
但即使是最难对付的畜生
也会被驯服
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.

1189
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:01,198
是的女士们先生们，你们将要看到…
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1190
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:03,331
野兽并不能抵挡…
the beast was no match...

1191
02:35:03,938 --> 02:35:05,496
一个女孩的魅力
for the charms of a girl.

1192
02:35:08,977 --> 02:35:10,569
一个来自纽约的女孩…
A girl from New York...

1193
02:35:13,782 --> 02:35:15,579
她融化了他的心…
Who melted his heart...

1194
02:35:16,284 --> 02:35:18,878
这让我们想起古老的阿拉伯诗句…
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...

1195
02:35:20,822 --> 02:35:23,985
“看啊，野兽端详着美女的面庞…”
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

1196
02:35:25,026 --> 02:35:26,926
“而美女静立于他的掌中”
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1197
02:35:28,229 --> 02:35:32,097
“从那天开始，他便如行尸一般了”
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1198
02:35:39,874 --> 02:35:43,332
现在女士们先生们
我要向你们展示…
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1199
02:35:43,478 --> 02:35:46,470
你们所见过的最伟大的事物
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1200
02:35:47,615 --> 02:35:52,279
他是世界之王，他知道
但它在你们面前则是囚犯
He was a king in the world
he knew, but he comes to you
now a captive.

1201
02:35:53,488 --> 02:35:55,149
女士们先生们…
Ladies and gentlemen...

1202
02:35:55,223 --> 02:35:59,751
我向你们推出
金刚，世界第八奇迹！
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1203
02:36:09,137 --> 02:36:12,265
不必惊惶，这是绝对安全的
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1204
02:36:12,574 --> 02:36:16,010
这些锁链是用铬钢做的！
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1205
02:36:36,765 --> 02:36:38,562
敬请观看…
Observe, if you will...

1206
02:36:41,836 --> 02:36:43,804
我手碰到野兽了
I am touching the beast.

1207
02:36:44,105 --> 02:36:48,337
我的手放在25英尺高的大猩猩身上
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1208
02:36:55,483 --> 02:36:57,110
伙计们，把它拉起来
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1209
02:37:16,438 --> 02:37:18,633
今晚在观众席中…
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1210
02:37:18,706 --> 02:37:20,333
有一位神秘嘉宾
a surprise guest.

1211
02:37:21,142 --> 02:37:23,337
故事里的真正英雄
The real-life hero
of this story.

1212
02:37:23,745 --> 02:37:26,179
追猎到强大金刚的人！
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1213
02:37:27,849 --> 02:37:32,616
冒着生命危险去解救
身处绝境的女性的人
The man who risked all
to win the freedom
of a helpless female.

1214
02:37:33,788 --> 02:37:36,120
为布鲁斯・巴克斯特先生鼓掌
A big hand for
Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1215
02:37:41,996 --> 02:37:44,055
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

1216
02:37:44,732 --> 02:37:45,892
谢谢
Thank you.

1217
02:38:13,595 --> 02:38:15,028
他说得对
He was right.

1218
02:38:16,598 --> 02:38:19,396
关于世界上仍有很多奥秘…
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...

1219
02:38:20,568 --> 02:38:22,866
我们大家
都可以了解到其中的一部分…
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1220
02:38:23,238 --> 02:38:25,502
只消一张门票的价钱
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1221
02:38:27,075 --> 02:38:29,373
你现在了解卡尔了吧
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1222
02:38:31,479 --> 02:38:34,880
他那无穷无尽
破坏他钟爱的事物的能力
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things
he loves.

1223
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:51,924
女士们先生们，请保持镇定…
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1224
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,299
现在是这原始的祭祀仪式的高潮
for we now come
to the climax of
this savage ritual.

1225
02:38:55,503 --> 02:38:57,994
供奉一位年轻美丽的女孩！
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1226
02:38:58,773 --> 02:39:02,402
她被献给强大的金刚
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1227
02:39:03,645 --> 02:39:07,706
请为我所见过的
最勇敢的女孩热烈鼓掌！
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl
I've ever met!

1228
02:39:08,449 --> 02:39:09,711
安・丹劳小姐
Miss Ann Darrow.

1229
02:39:57,699 --> 02:39:59,428
把我从野兽手上救出来！
Save me from the beast!

1230
02:40:08,309 --> 02:40:09,537
救我！
Help me!

1231
02:40:13,681 --> 02:40:14,978
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1232
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:17,708
- 安在哪里？
- 我不知道
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.

1233
02:40:17,785 --> 02:40:21,186
我听说他们出一大笔钱
但她干脆地拒绝了
I heard he offered her
all kinds of money
and she turned him down flat.

1234
02:40:21,255 --> 02:40:25,954

这就是你们的故事，先生们
here's your story, boys.

1245
02:41:08,403 --> 02:41:11,497
“美女和从野兽手里拯救他的男人”
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1246
02:41:17,245 --> 02:41:18,234
不

1247
02:41:26,587 --> 02:41:28,452
我们赶快把人弄出去
We have to get these people
out of here.

1248
02:41:28,523 --> 02:41:30,514
所有人出去了，走吧
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1249

让他吼吧，这镜头很精彩
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

1250

往出口走
Head for the exits.

1251
02:41:37,398 --> 02:41:39,832
你自己买座位，伙计，别打我的主意

You're not having mine.

1252
02:41:48,009 --> 02:41:49,237

Taxi! Follow that ape.

1265
02:45:19,754 --> 02:45:21,244
来吧，老兄，我们要转移他的注意力
Come on, pal,

这里是纽约，是神圣的地方
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1277
02:52:48,869 --> 02:52:50,268
你听见我说的了？
You hear me?

1278
02:52:50,771 --> 02:52:53,467
这里是人类建造的
也是为人类建造的
It was built for humans,
by humans.

1279
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:56,168
不是给长虱子的臭猩猩建的
Not for stinking
lice-infested apes.

1280
02:52:56,243 --> 02:52:58,074
如果一只变种猩猩想…
The thought
of sone nutant gorilla...

1281
02:52:58,145 --> 02:53:02,479
踩烂这座美丽城市的每一寸土地
都会令我厌恶
crapping all over the streets
of this fair city,
fills ne with disgust.

1282
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:04,718
所以这就是它的下场
So this is how it's gonna be.

1283
02:53:04,785 --> 02:53:07,117
我们找到它，我们就杀了它
We find it. We kill it.

1284
02:53:07,454 --> 02:53:11,618
砍掉它丑陋的头颅，砸碎它…
We cut its ugly head off
and we ram it up...

1285
02:53:30,778 --> 02:53:32,336
不，不

03:01:17,611 --> 03:01:19,238
你不能进去！
You can't go in there!

1293
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:21,569
嘿！
Hey!

03:01:23,683 --> 03:01:24,980
抓住他！
Stop him!

1295
03:01:28,088 --> 03:01:30,352
嘿！回来！你不能进来！
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

1296
03:01:30,423 --> 03:01:32,084
- 怎么回事？
- 快走！
What's going on?
Go!

1297
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:15,277
不！

求你！不！
Please! No!

1300
03:05:28,595 --> 03:05:29,789
不！
No!

1301
03:08:26,406 --> 03:08:28,704
安，安
Ann. Ann.

1302
03:09:18,024 --> 03:09:19,321
走开
Move along.

1303
03:09:19,792 --> 03:09:21,692
就拍一下，拍一下！
Just one shot! One shot!

1304
03:09:22,362 --> 03:09:24,455
- 过来，过来！
- 伙计们，照张相怎么样？
Come, come!

1305
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:25,519
看着我
Look at me.

1306
03:09:25,631 --> 03:09:27,360
来吧，看着相机
Come on, watch the camera.

1307
03:09:30,203 --> 03:09:31,727
站得再近一点
Come a little closer.

1308
03:09:32,405 --> 03:09:34,600
好了，伙计们，完事了，退后
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!

1309
03:09:34,674 --> 03:09:36,869
清理现场，就这样，退后，兄弟们
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1310
03:09:37,577 --> 03:09:39,135
为什么它要那样？
Why'd he do that?

1311
03:09:39,445 --> 03:09:41,913
爬那么高，把自己困住了
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

1312
03:09:41,981 --> 03:09:44,313
猩猩肯定知道是什么下场
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1313
03:09:44,384 --> 03:09:47,046
它就是个蠢动物，啥都不懂
He's just a dumb animal.
Didrt know nothing.

1314
03:09:53,259 --> 03:09:55,989
它算个麻烦吗？飞机收拾了它
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1315
03:09:58,564 --> 03:10:00,532
不是飞机
It wasrt the airplanes.
