小朋友在床上大哭特哭
Your little ones in their bunk bed

你需要武器
但首先你需要手电筒
You'll need a weapon.
But first, you'll need a flashlight.

8
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,253
可是黑得要命
But you're in the dark!
What are you gonna do?

9
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,294
要怎么找？我告诉你

But, seriousIy, isn't it true
that just two years ago,

17
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,482
你两年前还是博物馆的夜班警卫？
you were working as a night guard
at some dusty museum?

18
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:22,321
对，你是两次世界重量级冠军
That is true, two-time worId

I was just a reguIar Joe

28
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,071

Gina, give this back to Stewart.
I don't trust his math, okay?

29
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,731

Okay, then, you know what?

不好意思，擅闯的人
HeIIo! Excuse me!

50
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,670
这可不是发达先生吗？

又跑来怀旧吗？我几个月没看到你了
Come for one of your nostaIgia tours?
I haven't seen you for a few months.

52
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:27,779
我很忙，这里是怎么回事？
Yeah, I've been busy.

53
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,951
他们所谓的进步

然后轮到下一个男生或女生
Then let the next little boy or girl
have their turn.

58
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,546
好，你在哪里出生？
Okay, where were you born?

59
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:58,973
就在纽约20街
Right here in New York City,

October 27th,
the year of our Lord 1858.

61
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:08,686
扯个不停，历史啊、学习啊
BIah, bIah, bIah.
History, history. Learning, Iearning.

62
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,985
让美国儿童渐渐蜕变
Changing America, one chiId at a time.

63
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,329
太好了，你们要增加互动式展览？
That's great. So you're adding
some new interactive exhibits?

64
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,295
不是增加，是取代旧的展品
No, Mr. DaIey, not adding.
RepIacing the oId exhibits.

65
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,966
-它们要去哪？
-送走
-Where are they going?
-Away.

66
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,838
我们要拿掉实景展览、蜡像
We're getting rid of aII this junk.
The dioramas, the waxworks,

67
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,641
破旧的动物也是，比方这只瘦猴
even some of the shabbier animaIs,
Iike this scrawny IittIe monkey.

68
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,513
小心，它是卷尾猴
You shouId be carefuI. He's a capuchin.

69
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,473
它是猴子
It's a monkey.

70
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:36,487
卷尾猴是稀有品种，不只是猴子
He's a rare breed. He's a capuchin.
He's not just a monkey.

71
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,790
猴子就是猴子，这么仔细干嘛？
''Monkey'', then. I said ''monkey''.
Why be specific?

72
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,019
猴子都要丢了，不需要拉丁学名
When you're throwing away a monkey,
you don't need the Latin name.

73
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,660
你们是要把它丢掉还是送走？
Are you throwing him away
or are you moving him?

74
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:47,955
你是灵长类垃圾警察吗？
宝贝，算了吧
What are you, the Primate
Garbage PoIice? Let it go, baby.

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,358
-这是谁的主意？
-我啊
-Whose idea was this?
-Me, of course.

76
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,300
我跟董事会负责
I'm in charge. Me and the board.

77
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,766
主要是董事会的决定
MainIy the board.

78
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,069
总之，你干嘛在乎？
Anyway, why do you care?

79
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,073
大家喜欢这些东西
No, it's just that peopIe
Iove this stuff.

80
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,208

PeopIe, Mr. DaIey, Iove ''What's next?''

81
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,673
你应该最清楚，你离开了
You shouId know that. You Ieft.

82
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,774
我的情况变了，事业起飞
My situation changed.
My business took off...

83
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:09,514
你成功了
如果我是夜班警卫，我也会走
Yeah, you became a success.
So wouId I, if I was a night guard.

84
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,822
这些家伙要去哪里？
So where are these guys going?

85
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:15,391
放到联邦档案室保存
Deep storage. FederaI Archives.

86
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,492
-那在哪里？
-华府
-Where's that?
-Washington, D.C.

87
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,596
史密森尼博物馆
The Smithsonian.

88
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,331
我们一定有办法解决
There's got to be something
that we can do.

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,270
事情解决了
他们明天早上送走，就这样
It's done!
They Ieave tomorrow morning. It's over.

90
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,005
老朋友，你好吗？你想怎么样？
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
How you doing with aII this?

91
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,712
你想要里头的东西？
You want what's in here?

92
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:15,685
我有东西要给你吗？
你以为我有绳子？
You think I got something for you?
You think I got a IittIe rope?

93
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,551
你以为你比我强？
Think you're stronger than me, huh?

94
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,213
你就只有这么一点力气吗？
Is that aII you got, huh?

95
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,874
劳伦斯，小子，很高兴见到你
Lawrence! Good to see you, Iad!

96
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,413
泰迪，我也是
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

97
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,545
布鲁克林的守护者回来了
The Guardian of BrookIyn has returned!

98
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,852
麦菲跟我说情况了

-对呀
-I had no idea.
-Indeed.

100
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:53,187
你上次来过后发生很多事情
A Iot has transpired, Lawrence, since
your Iast visit. One wouId say that...

101
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,591
-等我一下
-你身上有蟋蟀声
-Just...

102
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:01,396

00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,249
嘉地雅，我听说了
我不知道怎么会这样
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look,
I don't even know how this happened.

109
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,945
对，这件事情超让人不解的
Yeah. Yeah, reaI mystery
how this happened.

110
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,491
说不定你手上的魔术盒有答案
Maybe the answer's on that magic
buzzing box there in your hand!

111
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,827
巨无霸，你不在这里才会发生这种事
You weren't here, Gigantor!
That's how it happened!

112
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,226
没啥好不解的
Ain't no mystery!

113
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:35,256
开放时间
The fact is, Larry, there's no one eIse
here to speak on our behaIf

114
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,561
没人替我们说话
during business hours.

115
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,933
一个都没有，笨笨
None, none, dum-dum.

116
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,570
各位，没关系
Hey, guys! It's okay!

117
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,042
我早上打给董事会

I'II caII the board in the morning,

I'II handIe this.
We're gonna be okay here.

119
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,479
我们？你听到白日梦先生的话了吗？
''We''? Did you hear that?
You hear Daydream Johnny?

120
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:54,440
谁跟你一体了
There ain't been a ''we'' ever since
you put us on the ''pay no mind'' Iist.

121
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,817
你不理我们了耶
And that's a coId pIace to be, boy.

122
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,116
赖瑞，能做的都做了
Larry, what's done is done.

123
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,927
连罗马的光荣也会告终
Even the gIory of Rome
had to come to an end.

124
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,260
你可以不要夸张地望向远方吗？
WouId you pIease not Iook dramaticaIIy
off into the middIe distance

125
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,925
让我感觉更糟
when you say that?
It makes me feeI worse.

126
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,097
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're taIking about.

127
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,295
你在看哪里？我在这啊
Where are you Iooking?
Where are you Iooking? I'm over here.

128
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,872
看墙壁
Just a bit of waII.

129
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,637
说不定事情没那么糟
Look, guys, maybe it won't be so bad.

130
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,742
说得好
Yes, you make a good point.

131
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,080
我们说的可是史密森尼博物馆耶
But this is the Smithsonian
we're taIking about here.

132
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,645
德克斯，这你可不知道
Dexter, you don't know that.

133
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:34,390
巨无霸，你没搞清楚重点
我们要被运走
You're missing the point, Gigantor!
They're shipping us out!

134
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,820
我知道你想安慰我们
Larry, I know you're trying
to make us feeI better.

135
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:39,790
我看得出你有点不安
I can see that you're genuineIy
sIightIy bothered,

136
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,959
不过情况再也不一样了
but it's never going to be the same.

137
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,567
我们不会一起在这里了
AII of us here, together,
in this pIace.

138
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,137
史密森尼永远不会是我们的家
It ain't never gonna be home, boy.

139
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:53,672
嘉地雅，拜托
劳伦斯，大家都很感伤
Jedediah, pIease! Lawrence, these
are emotionaI times for aII of us.

140
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,574
但这是我们一家人最后一晚相处
But it is our Iast night as a famiIy,

141
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:59,480
我不希望大家自怨自艾
and I don't want to see it squandered
in seIf-pity.

142
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:05,279
谁要跟我去逛最后一次？
So who wiII join me for one finaI stroII
through these haIIowed haIIs?

143
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,926
-你想去散步吗？
-不想
-Do you want to go for a waIk?
-No.

144
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:13,489
我要自怨自艾
I'm just gonna
squander it in seIf-pity.

145
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,659
亲爱的，走吧
My dear, shaII we?

146
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,020
亲爱的，一路顺风
Safe journey, my Iove.

147
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,929
德克斯，需要帮忙吗？
Hey, Dexter, want some heIp there?

148
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,941
好了，大家别伤感情，好吗？
Hey, come on, man.
No hard feeIings, aII right?

149
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,877
不会有事的
It's gonna be fine.

150
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,213
劳伦斯，天快亮了
It's aImost dawn, Lawrence.

151
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,942
泰迪，你的箱子呢？
Yeah. So, where's your crate, Teddy?

152
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,885
劳伦斯，我不会去
I won't be making this journey,
Lawrence.

153
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:15,619
看来我、暴龙跟几个著名展品
It seems myseIf, Rexy,
and a few of the signature exhibits

154
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,287
暂时会留下来
wiII be staying here for now.

155
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,597
刻写板也会送走吗？
Without the tabIet?

156
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,294
事实上
In truth, Lawrence,

157
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:31,408
阿卡曼拉的刻写板会跟他留下来
Ahkmenrah's tabIet
wiII be remaining here with him.

158
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,169
什么？
What?

159
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,975
朋友，刻写板不跟他们一起送去
They're going without
the tabIet, my friend.

160
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,481
今晚恐怕是他们的最后一夜了
I'm afraid this night is their Iast.

161
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,348
你没告诉他们
You didn't teII them.

162
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:47,584
有时候撒点小谎
比隐瞒痛苦的事实高尚
Sometimes it's more nobIe to teII a
smaII Iie than deIiver a painfuI truth.

163
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,998
-你不会有事吧？
-我会尽力而为
-Are you gonna be okay?
-I shaII do my best.

164
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,938
谁知道呢
And who knows?

165
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,882
有时，大改变会带来更大的契机
Sometimes the greatest change
brings about even greater opportunity.

166
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:15,478
劳伦斯，看看你
Look at you, Lawrence.

167
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:19,284
你离开这里后，人生过得很精彩
You Ieft this pIace
and created quite a Iife for yourseIf.

168
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,718
我猜是吧
Yeah, I guess so.

169
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,323
朋友，不要猜
I shouId hope
you'd do more than guess, my friend.

170
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:29,889
你是工业大王，你呼风唤雨
You're a captain of industry.
The worId at your fingertips.

171
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,560
生活如意
It seems to me
you have everything you wanted.

172
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,795
是，我知道
Yeah, no, I know.

173
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:37,397
你才不知道
No, you don't. If I may, Iad,

174
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,500
请容我给你一点忠告
aIIow me to offer you
one piece of advice.

175
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:45,047
真正幸福的关键在于…
The key to happiness,
to true happiness, is...

176
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,046
等我一下
Hang on one sec. I just gotta...

177
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,318
我要处理日本的生意
I got this Japanese deaI.

178
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:56,724
我关机了，抱歉
No, okay, I'm turning this off.
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:58,886
幸福的关键是什么？
The key to happiness?

180
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,732
泰迪，再见了
I'II see you, Teddy.

181
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,121
自然历史博物馆

182
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:41,435
他们走了？你不能想办法吗？
So they're gone?
There's nothing you can do?

183
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,769
我希望可以，我什么都试了
I wish there was, man.
I'm teIIing you, I tried everything.

184
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,312
我去找麦菲谈，打给董事会
可是他们今天早上被送走了
I taIked to McPhee, I caIIed the board,
but they shipped them out this morning.

185
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,937
爸，你买了好多菜
This is a Iot of food, Dad.

186
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,642
我同事艾德要过来谈点事情
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna come by.
I thought I toId you.

187
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,911

We just have to go over
a coupIe of IittIe work things.

188
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:58,319
-你今晚要工作
-我以前每天晚上都要工作
-So you're working tonight.
-I used to work every night, remember?

189
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,050
那是全世界最酷的工作
That was when you had
the cooIest job in the worId.

190
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,659
酷不能帮你买吉他之神6
Yeah, weII, ''cooI'' doesn't pay
for your Guitar God Vl or whatever.

191
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:08,065
-喂？
-巨无霸，是我啦，嘉地雅
-HeIIo?
-Gigantor! lt's me, Jedediah!

192
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:10,623

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,502
阿嘉，你是怎么拨电话的？
Jed, what are you...
How did you diaI the phone?

195
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:17,073
说来话长，那只泼猴偷了刻写板
Long story! That brazen IittIe monkey
stoIe the tabIet,

196
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,268
这下我们惨了！
and now we're in a worId of hurt, boy!

197
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,505

-Kahmunrah!

198
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:24,479

-Kahmunrah?
-Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

199
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,641
-相信我，他很不友善！
-休想！
-And trust me, not a friendIy!
-Never!

200
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,446
重复，他很不友善！
I repeat, not a friendIy!

201
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,350
-那是阿提拉吗？
-不知道…
-Is that AttiIa, Jed?
-l don't know how much longer

202
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:31,979
-还要战多久，不！
-阿嘉，你还好吗？
-we can fight them off! No!
-Jed? Are you okay?

203
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,614
-放开我，救命啊！
-阿嘉
-Let go of me! Help!
-Hey, Jed.

204
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,522
-放开我，救命啊！
-阿嘉？
-Let go! No, you let go of me! Help!
-Jed?

205
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:39,319
怎么回事？
What was that about?

206
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,927
我不知道
I don't know.

207
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,303
走，我带你去你妈家
Here, come on.
Gonna drop you off at your mom's.

208
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:52,036

-What's going on, Dad?
-I'm gonna go find out.

00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:56,843
麦菲说联邦档案室在史密森尼
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the

210
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:58,381
我到底要去哪里？

Nicky, pIease focus.

Not in, under. It Iooks Iike it runs
underneath the entire Smithsonian.

217
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,669

220

-Don't worry about it.

Of course. Just be a historicaI document

Put your hand on it and touch it.
'Cause I stand there

249
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:26,950
我等你这种娘泡一整天了
and I wait aII day
for a IittIe girI Iike you to come in

250
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:30,152
拿做的美美的指甲去碰展品
and put her precious naiI-poIished naiIs
aII over the exhibits.

251
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,890
美国不是自由国家吗？
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought
we Iived in a free country, so...

252
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,191
-我们不是
-不是吗？
-No, we don't.
-No?

253
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,664
不是，这是个“非礼勿碰”合众国
It's the United States of Don't Touch
That Thing Right in Front of You.

254
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,361
我总可以看吧
I just want to...
I'm aIIowed to Iook at it here, okay?

255
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,868
你摸摸看啊
See what happens when you touch it!

256
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,235
布兰登，你在威胁我吗？
So you're threatening me?
You're threatening me, Brandon?

257
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,240
-我叫布朗登
-什么？
-It's ''Brundon.''
-Excuse me?

258
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,809
-布朗登
-布朗登？
-''Brundon''!
-''Brundon''?

259
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,576
-布朗登
-布朗登
-''Brundon.''
-''Brundon.''

260
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,340
你的名字拼错了吗？
What, did they run out of U's
on your namepIate maker?

261
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:51,745
你的笑话好冷喔
I don't know, did they run out of jokes

262
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,680
没笑话可说了吗？
at the interesting-joke store
that you shop at?

263
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,981
看起来是布兰登没错啊
Sorry, it Iooks Iike ''Brandon'', but...

264
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,044
我不是你的语言治疗师
这是布朗登！
I'm not here to be your
speech therapist. It's ''Brundon''!

265
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,884
-好吧，布朗登
-你没听过这名字吗？
-''Brundon.'' Okay...
-You never heard of the name before?

266
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,151
没听过“布朗登”
''Brundon''? No.

267
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,524
去查1984年最红的宝宝名字
是“布朗登”
Look up most popuIar baby names
in 1984. ''Brundon.''

268
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:07,223
好，布朗登，你在威胁我吗？
Okay. Are you threatening me, Brundon?

269
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,662
我不知道，娘泡王子，我有吗？
I don't know, Princess Jasmine. Am I?

270
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,199

-是啊
-Oh, wow. Lunabeam nine-voIt.

-对，这是朗纳光9号
-很炫
-That's their titIe, Lunabeam Nine.
-Great.

273
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,907
我喜欢美格光LED手电筒
不过那是我个人喜好
I prefer the MagIite LED myseIf,
but that's just me.

274
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,909
-帮个忙
-什么？
-Do me a huge favor.
-What?

275
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:24,004
手放口袋里，态度好一点
Shove your hands into your pockets,
put your attitude way down,

276
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,878
对人客气一点
and, aIso, be nice to peopIe.

277
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,514
我能问你一件事吗？
Great. But couId I just ask you
one thing?

278
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,349
-好啊
-我要说清楚
-Yeah.
-Okay, so just to be cIear,

279
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:33,618
-我不能这么做，对吗？
-好，太夸张了
-so, I can't do this, right?
-Okay, that's actuaIIy crazy.

280
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,522
你打算早死吗？
Did you just make a decision
to possibIy end your Iife
earIier than you were expecting?

281
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:37,891
我要用手电筒揍你罗
I'm gonna hit you with the fIashIight.

282
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,953
-你在威胁我喔
-不要碰！
-Now you are threatening me. Okay.
-Do not touch it!

283
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,622
-别碰我
-不要碰！
-Don't touch me.
-Do not touch it!

284
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,029
-不要碰！
-别碰我！
-Do not touch it!
-Don't touch me!

285
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,397
我要整天拿手电筒戳你
I'II touch you with my fIashIight
aII day.

286
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:46,026
手电筒的功能是照明
No, your fIashIight
is meant to iIIuminate.

287
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,594
我要租露营车到处开
I wiII IiteraIIy rent a camper,

288
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:51,197

and we wiII drive across America
with my fIashIight on your chest.

289
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,209
-不要这么做
-不要做什么？
-Don't do that.
-Don't do what?

290
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:54,943
你想看我再做一次吗？
Want to see what happens
when I do it one more time?

291
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,980

-你乖乖看我这么做吧
-Let's see what happens.
-Watch you do nothing.

292
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:58,878
你乖乖看我这么做
Let's watch you do nothing
when I do this.

293
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,045
说真的，布兰登，不要…
SeriousIy, Brandon...

294
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,314
-是布朗登
-好，布朗登
-Brundon.
-Brundon,

295
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,151
你搞不清楚我是谁
you do not know who you're deaIing with.

296
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,748
你以为你当警卫很行吗？
You think you know what it means
to be a guard, huh?

297
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,953
相信我，你不懂当警卫的意义
Trust me, you don't know
the meaning of the word.

298
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,093
我碰过你想像不到的事情
I have seen things
that you couId not imagine.

299
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,962
-比如说什么？
-不告诉你
-Like what kind of stuff?
-I'm not gonna teII you.

300
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,797
-你必须放开手电筒
-拜托告诉我
-But you're gonna drop the fIashIight...
-The way you said it,

301
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,768
你本来好像要说很酷的事
it sounded Iike you were gonna say
something cooI.

302
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,829
我不说给你听
Yeah, weII, you don't get to hear it.

303
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,430
放开手电筒
Drop the fIashIight.

304
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,583
我们没事吧？
We cooI?

305
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,185
你刚刚做的事挺酷的
That's actuaIIy pretty cooI,
what you just did.

306
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:38,619
谢谢
Thank you.

307
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,486
别伤和气吧？
No hard feeIings?

308
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:43,287
-抱歉，好不好？
-好
-AII right? Sorry.
-Okay.

309
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,352
-我才抱歉
-是我的错，我不该…
-I'm sorry.
-No, It's my fauIt. I shouIdn't have...

310
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,488
两股相对的力量才能引起冲突
No. It takes two opposing forces
to cause friction, and...

311
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,190
你只是尽职责
And you're just doing your job, aII right.

312
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,133
-老兄，保重了
-你也一样
-Take it easy, man.
-Yeah!

313
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,036
那家伙很棒
That guy's great.

314
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,323
更衣室

315
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,879
-我进来了
-好，你在哪里？
-Okay, buddy, I'm in.

直走到底右转
At the end of the haII, turn right,

320
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,861
你会在左手边看到楼梯

321
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,930
-了解

-Got it.
-Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

322

有通道连接到不同的建筑
Those underground tunneIs
connect a bunch of different buiIdings.

323
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:59,393

你是谁？

of ancient history,

342

我复活了
I have come back to Iife!

343
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:30,598
你可能没听到我说的话
Perhaps you did not hear
what I just said.

344
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:36,169
我是古埃及的法老王
我原本死了
I am a centuries-oId Egyptian Pharaoh.
I was dead,

345
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:40,683
但是我复活了！
but now I have come back to Iife!

346

-可不是吗？
-Yeah, good kid.
-Isn't he just?

352
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:08,040
爸妈把最好的都给他
You know, Mother and Father aIways
gave him the best of everything,

353
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,343
全都给他，连王位都给他了
and I do mean everything.
They even gave him the throne.

354
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,214
王位是我的才对
The throne which was rightfuIIy mine!

Never mind, just hand me the tabIet.

358
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,391
-巨无霸，不能给他！
-不能给他！
-Don't give it to him, Gigantor!
-Keep him away!

359
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,956
里面的人，给我安静！

360
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,205

-Don't make me come in there!
-No! I won't be muzzIed!

361
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,499
刻写板比你达理小发明的赖瑞达理
Look, that tabIet is more powerfuI

362
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:43,069
想像的法力强大
than you, Larry DaIey of DaIey Devices,

363
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:47,249
复活只是小把戏
Bringing things back to Iife
is just a parIor trick.

364
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,548
有了它，我能打开阴间之门
With it, I shaII unIock
the Gate to the UnderworId

365
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:54,250

and bring forth my army
from the Land of the Dead.

366
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,259
所以，不麻烦的话
So, if it's not too much troubIe...

367
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,164
请你交出来
...hand it over.

368
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,300
好，拿去
Okay, here you go.

369
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,397
聪明的决定
Wise decision.

370
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,407
抱歉，我以为你想要方块
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought
you wanted the Cube, but...

371
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,439
方块？
The Cube?

372
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,552
魔术方块
The Cube of Rubik.

373
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:33,023
好，什么是魔术方块？
AII right, what is
this Cube of Rubik, then?

374
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,067
这个方块能把反对者化为灰烬
The Cube. You know, the one
that turns aII who oppose you to dust?

375
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,069
那个呀
That one? Whatever. I thought...

376
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,162
算了，是我的错
It was my bad, 'cause...
You know what? By the way,

377
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,867
对了，安全起见
your brother didn't want
to mess with it, either.

378
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,306
你弟也不想碰
Yeah, he wanted to pIay it safe, too.

379
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:49,402
你让我觉得是勇于冒险的人
Just, you sort of struck me
as a next-IeveI sort of guy, so I was...

380
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,880
赖瑞，我可不是我弟
I am not my brother, Larry.

381
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:58,443
我会马上杀了你跟你的朋友
I wiII kiII you and your friends
in the bIink of an eye.

382
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,157
带我去找魔术方块吧
Now take me to this Cube of Rubik.

383
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,562
-在那里
-打开吧
-Here it is.
-Open it.

384
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:40,052
回来，把刻写板还我
Come back here!
Come back here with my tabIet!

385
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,688
你的朋友还在我手里！
I stiII have your friends!

386
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,662
-你来骑！
-什么？
-Take the wheeI!
-What?

387
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:26,265
我叫你骑，开战了，我喜欢
I said, take the wheeI! Oh, we're
in it now! I Iove it! I Iove it!

388
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:28,404
好好骑，其余的交给我处理
Just keep her straight,
I'II handIe the rest.

389
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:30,503
冲啊！
Now, charge!

390
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,448
-你的计划是什么？
-美国人不计划的，做就对了
-Okay, so what's the pIan here?
-We're Americans! We don't pIan, we do!

391
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,288
抓稳了！
Now hoId on!

392
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:58,267
看到了吗？做了再说，每次都管用
See that? Act first, think Iater!
Works every time!

393
00:32:58,342 --> 00:32:59,707
有我罩你！
You're in good hands!

394
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:03,540
美国第七骑兵队的卡士达将军
GeneraI George A. Custer
of the Fighting U.S. 7th CavaIry,

395
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,274
随时为你服务
at your service.

396
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:12,011
我很好，开快点啊，笨蛋！
I'm good, I'm good! FIy, you fooI!

397
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,897
英雄，大家在吵什么？
What's the rumpus, ace?

398
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,332
小姐，走开
Look, Iady, couId you
get out of the way?

399
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,996
你叫谁小姐？我叫爱蜜莉亚
Lady? Who are you caIIing Iady?
The name is AmeIia.

400
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:37,069
爱蜜莉亚埃尔哈特
你听过我吗？
AmeIia Earhart!
Perhaps you've heard of me?

401
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,944
对，你是有名的飞行员什么的
Oh, right.
You're a famous piIot or whatever.

402
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,746
飞行员？
我是第一个飞越大西洋的女人
PiIot? I was the first woman
to fIy the AtIantic!

403
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,445
十字飞行勋章第一个女得主
First woman to receive the FIying Cross,

404
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,546
开直升机横越48州第一个女人
first woman to fIy across the 48 states
in a gyroprop.

405
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:50,457
请你表情放轻松
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent
Iook of aIarm off your kisser,

406
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,758
跟我说我在哪里
I was wondering if you might be so kind
as to teII me exactIy where I am.

407
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,231
你在博物馆里头，其实是底下
You're in a museum.
Or, actuaIIy, under it.

408
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,098
我目前处境危险
And I'm in kind of a dangerous
situation right now,

409
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,638
你最好不要接近我
so you might not want to be
anywhere near me.

410
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,110
-你的速度好快
-你叫什么名字？
-Wow, you're fast.
-What's your name, fIyboy?

411
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,938
我叫赖瑞达理
My name is Larry DaIey.

412
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,915
赖瑞达理，你没在听吗？
WeII, Larry DaIey,
in case you weren't Iistening,

413
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,110
我不是会闪避危险的人
I'm not one to shy away from danger.

414
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:18,944
那矛呢？你会闪避矛吗？
How about spears?
Are you one to shy away from spears?

415
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:23,815
快走吧，我们来找乐子吧
Let's ankIe, skipper!
Now we're gonna have some fun.

416
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:31,595
98、99，好了
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, bingo!

417
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,462
就像金羊毛一样
Like a GoIden FIeece.

418
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,968
好了，你们的敌人抓我
AII right, troops,
when your enemies captured me,

419
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,204
他们也成了我的敌人
they made themseIves
my enemies as weII.

420
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:45,675
大错特错啊
Big mistake. Big mistake.

421
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:50,478
好，这是我的计划
AII right, here's the pIan.

422
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:55,189
第三次号角响起时，我会大喊攻击
On the third bugIe bIast,
I shaII IoudIy announce, ''Attack! ''

423
00:34:58,128 --> 00:35:03,395
这时候，我们就从这里冲出去
At which point,
we wiII aII jump out of this box

424
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:06,693
展开攻击
and attack.

425
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,178
吓死他们，你们觉得怎样？
Mind bomb. What do you think?

426
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,174
你，莎卡佳瓦娜瓦佳达佳达
You, Sacaja...

427
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,480
这不是我的名字
That is not my name.

428
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:25,578
-莎卡佳米雅
-不对
-Sacajamea.
-No.

429
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,919
-盒子里的小莎
-不是
-Sack-in-a-box.
-No.

430
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:30,754
-辛可梅雅
-我知道你是有名的将军
-Cinco de Mayo.
-I know you are a famous generaI...

431
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,193
没事，我跟你一样是普通人
That's aII right, that's aII right.
I'm a person, just Iike you.

432
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:36,298
可是大喊攻击
But won't yeIIing, ''Attack! ''
aIert the enemy

433
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,026
不就是通知敌人我们要攻击吗？
that we are about to attack?

434
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:39,866
什么？
What?

435
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:50,278
对，我想是吧
Yeah, I guess so.

436
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:58,151
达理先生，你挺红的嘛
You're quite the popuIar feIIow,
Mr. DaIey.

437
00:35:58,221 --> 00:35:59,711
你为什么不落跑？
Why don't you just skedaddIe?

438
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,757
我不行，我朋友被关在底下
I can't skedaddIe.
My friends are being heId down there.

439
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,554
我得另外找路下去
I got to go get them.
I got to find another way down.

440
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,106
哇，之前没遇过
This is new.

441
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:26,472
没事，我不会伤害你们
Hey, it's aII right.
I don't want to hurt you.

442
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:31,243
达理先生，他们怕的不是你
I don't think it's you
they're afraid of, Mr. DaIey.

443
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,994
跟你交换，谢了
Trade you. Thanks.

444
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:43,930
退后，给我退后！
Back off! Just back off!

445
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:46,762
我戳你们喔
I wiII fork you!

446
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,593
你呢？
How about you, huh?

447
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,136
千万别派男孩做女人的事
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

448
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,939
我在密克罗尼西亚玩过长矛打猎
I spent two weeks spear-hunting
with a tribe in Micronesia.

449
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,872
那里的人反应比较慢
The Micronesians had
much sIower refIexes.

450
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:04,542
快走！
Come on!

451
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,292
结束了！结束了！
It's over! It's over! It's aII over!

452
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,563
太了不起了
WeII, this is one humdinger
of a hootenanny.

453
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,075
抱歉，对不起
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

454
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,008
1945年收讯满格耶
Wow, four bars in 1945.

455
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,744
-喂？
-爸，你终于接电话了
-HeIIo?
-Dad, finally!

456
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,478
我研究了档案室的平面图
I've been studying
these pIans to the Archives.

457
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,152
你下楼以后…
Looks Iike once
you get down the stairweII...

458
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,189
我离楼梯可远了
Oh, I'm way past the stairweII, Nicky.

459
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,384
-你找到大家了吗？
-算是
-So you found everyone?
-Sort of.

460
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,357
那是什么玩意？
What is that fIibberty-widget
you are taIking to?

461
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:46,395
-那是谁？
-爱蜜莉亚埃尔哈特
-Who's that?
-It's AmeIia Earhart.

462
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:48,157
你找到爱蜜莉亚埃尔哈特？
You found AmeIia Earhart?

463
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,391
嘿！
I... Hey!

464
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:53,367
-等一下
-你急什么？
-Wait a minute!
-Buddy, what's your hurry?

465
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:56,667
-战争结束了
-抱歉，这些人在追我
-Didn't you hear? The war's over!
-Sorry. These guys are chasing me.

466
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,573
这是在办嘉年华吗？
What? What am I Iooking at, Mardi Gras?

467
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:03,009
-你是哪个单位的？
-我是布鲁克林人
-What unit are you from?
-I'm from BrookIyn.

468
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,379
你说真的？我住中布鲁克林耶
What? Are you serious?
I'm from FIatbush! Hey, feIIas!

469
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:09,678
各位，这些人想扁我朋友
These so-and-so's are trying
to rough up my paI here

470
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:11,084
因为他是布鲁克林人
just 'cause he's from BrookIyn!

471
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:12,916
-谢了
-没问题，打啊！
-Thank you!
-You got it! Fight!

472
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,350
先生，你忘了你的…
Hey, mister! You forgot your...

473
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,628
这是什么鬼东西啊
What the heck is this thing?

474
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,468
抱歉，介意我卡位吗？
Excuse me. Mind if I get in here?

475
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,948
达理先生，就等你了
Any time you're done, Mr. DaIey.

476
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:42,880
-打电话给我！
-谢啦
-CaII me!
-Thank you for that.

477
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,079
达理先生，你很会施展魅力喔
So you're quite the smooth operator,
aren't you, Mr. DaIey?

478
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:46,887
快点！
Quick!

479
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,623
-有用耶
-接下来呢？
-That actuaIIy worked.
-What's next?

480
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:59,167
我没别的意思
Look, nothing personaI, but I'm kind of
in the middIe of something here

481
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,759
不过我的混战不该扯上你
that's not reaIIy your fight.

482
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,566
是因为我是女人吗？
It's because I'm a woman, isn't it?

483
00:39:02,772 --> 00:39:06,333
不是
是因为死而复活的坏法老王想杀我
No, it's because I've got this ancient
raised-from-the-dead eviI Pharaoh guy

484
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:09,469
好夺走刻写板
who's wiIIing to kiII me and probabIy
anyone near me to get this tabIet

485
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:10,807
这样他才能统治世界
so he can ruIe the worId.

486
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,814
果然是因为我是女人
So it is because I'm a woman!

487
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:14,315
-我…
-等等，要不是我
-Look, I...
-No, you Iook, Mr. DaIey!

488
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,817
你还在那团黑白大混乱里面
If it weren't for me, you'd stiII be
Iost in that monochromatic mayhem !

489
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,286
-什么？
-黑白照啦，笨蛋
-Lost in what?
-BIack and white photo, you boob!

490
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,517
听好，我可以帮你
Now Iisten, and Iisten good.
I can heIp you.

491
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:24,616
我想帮不是因为我喜欢你
我目前并没有
I want to heIp you, and not because
I Iike you, which so far I don't,

492
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:28,289
而是因为我闻到冒险的味道
我想参一脚
but because I smeII adventure,
and, damn it, I want in.

493
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,867
好，出了事可别怪我
Okay. Don't bIame me
if something happens to you.

494
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:34,935
我好幸运喔
I shouId be so Iucky.

495
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:40,499
我是卡曼拉，我是半个神
I am Kahmunrah. I am haIf god,

496
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,778
我妈这边的一等亲
once removed on my mother's side,

497
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:48,375
埃及的合法统治者
rightfuI ruIer of Egypt,
future ruIer of...

498
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,944
未来要统治一切
WeII, everything eIse.

499
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:54,114
我损失一些人马
Now, I have Iost some men.

500
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:59,787
所以我需要新的将军
So, I am in need of some new generaIs
to join me in my IittIe pIan

501
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:01,854
加入我征服世界的计划
of conquering this worId.

502
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:04,126
恐怖伊凡
Ivan the TerribIe.

503
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:08,233
拿破仑波拿巴
NapoIeon Bonaparte.

504
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,363
跟年轻的艾尔卡彭
And young AI Capone.

505
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,464
没错
Yeah.

506
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:17,343
历史上最卑鄙、最可怕的领导者
Some of the most despicabIe,
most feared Ieaders in aII of history.

507
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,513
各位
GentIemen,

508
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:23,649
很高兴认识你们
reaIIy, it's just fantastic
to meet you aII.

509
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,210
-我们也是
-我也是
-And us, too.
-And me, you.

510
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:30,592
你们效忠我，我就会以世界做为回报
AII I ask is your aIIegiance,
and in return, I offer you the worId.

511
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,121
有问题吗？
LiteraIIy. Are there any questions?

512
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:36,130
我有一个问题，你为什么穿洋装？
Yeah, I got one.
How come you're wearing a dress?

513
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:38,731
这不是洋装，这是束腰外衣
This is not a dress. This is a tunic.

514
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:42,227
这是三千年前流行的穿着
It was the height of fashion
3,000 years ago, I assure you.

515
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,072
还有其他问题吗？
Are there any other questions?

516
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,871
我们也要穿
Da. This dress you're wearing,

517
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:50,208
你穿的这种洋装吗？
do we have to wear one of these, too?

518
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,242
不用，你们没在听吗？
Were you not Iistening?
I just toId Mr. Capone here

519
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:55,944
我刚跟卡彭说这不是洋装
that this is not a dress.

520
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:59,715
这是束腰外衣，跟洋装差别很大
It is, in fact, a tunic.
Very big difference.

521
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,581
还有其他问题吗？
Are there any other questions?

522
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,559
跟洋装或束腰外衣
Any questions not about the dress?

523
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,660
无关的问题
Tunic?

524
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,299
那好，月光在消逝
AII right, then. MoonIight is wasting,

525
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,425
-时间很短
-短？
-and the time is short.
-Short?

526
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:15,800
你干嘛看着我说短？
Why do you Iook at me
when you say ''short''?

527
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,269
抱歉，我是无心的
Sorry. It sIipped out.

528
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:25,409
如果要称霸世界
Da. If we are taIking
about worId domination,

529
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,313
我当然很有兴趣
then of course, I am interested.

530
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:31,180
不过我要先澄清一件事
让大家清楚我的为人
But first I want to cIarify something
so you know what you are getting.

531
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:34,857
大家老是说恐怖伊凡很恐怖
PeopIe aIways say,
''Ivan the TerribIe, he's so terribIe.

532
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,654
我好怕伊凡，碰到他就惨了
''I'm so scared of Ivan. He's bad news.''

533
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,593
事实上，正确的翻译是
When in fact,
the correct transIation is

534
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,524
神奇伊凡
''Ivan the Awesome''.

535
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,261
神奇伊凡？
Ivan the Awesome?

536
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:48,929
这样不太顺口吧
It's not reaIIy as catchy, is it?

537
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,872
恐怖伊凡真的很响亮
I mean, ''Ivan the TerribIe'',
that reaIIy pops.

538
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:55,633
可是我不恐怖，我是有效率的领导者
But I wasn't terribIe. In fact,
I was quite an effective Ieader.

539
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:59,375
了解
DuIy noted. Now, I'd Iike to wrap up
the oId meet-and-greet

540
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:01,814
这场会面就以一个问题结束吧
by asking you gentIemen a question.

541
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:04,183
你们要加入我吗？
Are you with me?

542
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:06,111
-好啊
-好
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Oui.

543
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:10,952
-可是…
-那就把达理小发明的赖瑞达理
-Da, but...
-Then bring Larry DaIey of DaIey Devices

544
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,996
跟阿卡曼拉的刻写板带来给我！
and the GoIden TabIet of Ahkmenrah
to me!

545
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,630
我会带你回去找你朋友
We'II get you back down
to your chums, Mr. DaIey.

546
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:22,296
跟着爱蜜莉亚埃尔哈特不会走丢
You won't get Iost
foIIowing AmeIia Earhart.

547
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,872
快躲起来
Quick, get down.

548
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:31,313
达理先生，我喜欢你搂我的方式
WeII, weII, Mr. DaIey,
I quite Iike the way you're hoIding me.

549
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:35,473
抱歉，我不是要…
No. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

550
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,543
达理先生，别再鬼扯了
Oh, pIease,
stop beating your gums, Mr. DaIey.

551
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,884
我们认识后
You haven't been abIe
to take your cheaters off my chassis

552
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,581
你就一直瞄我
since the moment we met.

553
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:43,989
我真的不知道你在说什么
I IiteraIIy didn't understand
one word of that.

554
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:51,225
我幻听吗？还是有音乐？
Is it just me
or is there music in the air?

555
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:55,862
我们能永远放光芒
...my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever...

556
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,772
小天使，安静
You! LittIe fIying angeI things! Quiet!

557
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,400
他们是爱神丘比特
They're cupids, Mr. DaIey. Gods of Iove.

558
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:05,208
爱神，闭嘴，我们想躲起来
Great. Gods of Iove, wouId you shut up?
PIease shut up. We're trying to hide.

559
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:09,145
耶，十足女人，耶
Yeah! More than a woman! Yeah!

560
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:14,451
不用换风格
唱原来那首歌，安静
No, don't change the arrangement,
it's not about the arrangement. Quiet!

561
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:16,456
耶，超酷、超
Kick the chorus, y'aII!

562
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,186
十足女人
More than a woman

563
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,553
夜班警卫，秀出你的本事吧
Yo, show me what you got,
night guard!

564
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,961
快走
AII right, come on. Let's go.

565
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,693
对我来说是十足女人
More than a woman to me

566
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,263
十足女人
More than a woman

567
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,702
她是十足女人
She's more than a woman

568
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:41,080
小矮个，小老鼠扑向
And so, the IittIe tiny man who
couId not be a smaIIer or shorter mouse

569
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,914
大猫的爪子了
runs into the cIaws of the giant cat!

570
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,754
你真的超在意高度的
You're reaIIy hung up
on the height, aren't you?

571
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,654
-这跟高度没有关系
-你很在意
-No, it's not about height, see...
-Yes, you are.

572
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,750
你说我是老鼠，你是大猫
You're saying I'm a IittIe mouse,
you're a giant cat.

573
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:53,819
-我是大猫呀
-我没别的意思
-I am the giant cat.
-No offense, I just...

574
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,831
你是拿破仑，你有矮子情结
You're NapoIeon.
There's a compIex named after you.

575
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,026
你矮得出名
You're famous for being IittIe,
and it's true. Look.

576
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,695
你这个天真的美国小子
Oh, you naive American man-boy.

577
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:04,671
我们没要开打，所以不该…
Look. Neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon, right?

578
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:07,106
这根本没啥好争的
So it's not Iike we shouId...
It's not even an issue.

579
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:11,704
这跟高度没关系，而是精明的计划
It's not about height or something eIse.
It's a pIan. It's a briIIiant pIan.

580
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:14,873
-计划喔
-皇帝，聪明的计划
-So it was a pIan.
-Snazzy maneuver, Emperor.

581
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,587
小姐，谢谢
Merci, mademoiselle.

582
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,818
麻烦你男友跟我走吧
Now, if your boyfriend
wouId kindIy come with me...

583
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:23,290
我不是她的男友
I'm not her boyfriend.

584
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:26,989
-不是她的男友
-不是
-Not her boyfriend.
-No.

585
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:28,786
只是朋友吗？
Just friends?

586
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:35,464
-对，朋友
-认识，朋友
-Yeah, friends.
-Acquaintances. Friends.

587
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:39,568
你们是大学朋友
Were you guys, Iike, friends in coIIege

588
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:42,144
害怕告诉对方
and just afraid now
to both ruin your reIationship

589
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,577
你想要不只是朋友
by teIIing the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

590
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:46,205
会打坏关系吗？
that you Iike-Iike each other?

591
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:51,845
再说一次，好吗？
抱歉，我没听懂
One more time?
I'm sorry. I didn't catch the...

592
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:54,382
你们是大学朋友
Were you guys, Iike, friends in coIIege

593
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,321
害怕告诉对方
and now both afraid
to ruin your reIationship

594
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:59,156
你想要的不只是朋友
by teIIing the other person
that you want to be more than friends,

595
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:01,253
会打坏关系吗？
that you Iike-Iike each other?

596
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,763
-没有
-没有吗？
-No.
-No?

597
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:08,928
我最爱把关系搞清楚，法国人都这样
I just Iove the nitty-gritty of
reIationships. AII us French do.

598
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:10,596
-对
-爱情
-Great.
-Yes. Amour!

599
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,935
-现在…
-是
-Now.
-Yeah?

600
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:14,339
-…你不跟我走就受死
-好
-This way, or you die.
-Yes.

601
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,082
-我跟你们去
-我们的战争跟你无关
-Wait, I'm coming with you!
-No! Our fight is not with you.

602
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:29,380
-再下注
-好
-...so you gotta bet a second time.
-AII right. Okay.

603
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,991
我的头发在欧洲可是能卖钱的
My hair is currency
in certain parts of Europe.

604
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:37,157
没错，就像黄金跟纸钞有价值
It's true.
Currency, Iike goId or paper money.

605
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,166
有教堂拿一撮就卖了
The Duomo was purchased
with just one Iocket.

606
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:41,634
听着，他很瞎
Listen up, kemosabe.

607
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:45,572
松饼跟苍蝇拍傻傻分不清楚
This rodeo cIown wouIdn't know
a fIapjack from a fIyswatter.

608
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,939
巨无霸在外面为我们拼命
Now, Gigantor's out there
risking his hide for us.

609
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,978
我们得帮他
The Ieast we can do
is give him some heIp.

610
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,743
我们困在里头可帮不了忙，是吧
Some big heIp. But we can't very weII do
that if we're stuck in here, now, can we?

611
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:57,183
我们得逃出去
We need to escape.

612
00:45:58,287 --> 00:45:59,447
松饼是什么？
What's a fIapjack?

613
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:01,956
就像饼干或司康饼
It's Iike a biscuit or a scone.

614
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:04,424
-击胸吧
-耶
-Chest bump?
-Yeah.

615
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:07,258
你看
Then deadIy. Watch.

616
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:10,359
牌看好，现在下注
Guard your cards, okay? Now you bet.

617
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:13,026
好，出牌
Okay, now you got
to throw some cards down.

618
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,370
-准备好了吗？
-好了
-Ready?
-Ready.

619
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:21,643
一点都不好玩
Say something. Say anything.
This is no fun. You're supposed to...

620
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,280
-你们在干嘛？
-屋大维，快跑
-Hey! What are you two doing out here?
-Octavius, go!

621
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,477
-快跑啊，我来拖住他们
-我不会抛下你的
-You, make a run for it, I'II hoId them off!
-I wiII not Ieave you!

622
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:32,817
没空管道义了，快走吧
Ain't no time for your Roman meIodrama !
Now, get! Go!

623
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,950
我不会有事的
OId Jedediah wiII be fine.

624
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,321
你现在自身难保了
Now, you're in reaI troubIe.

625
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:43,491
这不是真的红宝石
Why, these aren't reaI rubies at aII.

626
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:46,064
什么红宝石鞋嘛
Ruby sIippers indeed.

627
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:53,966
不过不管你是谁，你的宝座还真舒服
But, whoever you are, Archie Bunker,
you had one comfortabIe throne.

628
00:46:54,977 --> 00:46:56,308
老大
Hey, boss.

629
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:59,644
我抓到这个想从一个洞落跑的
Caught this one trying to escape
through a rust hoIe in the crate.

630
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:01,546
他的小朋友溜了
One of his IittIe friends got away.

631
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:05,178
拜托，他们哪有杀伤力
Oh, pIease.
What damage couId they possibIy do?

632
00:47:05,254 --> 00:47:09,190
他们跟米粒一样大，不是吗？
Why, they're no bigger than
a IittIe grain of couscous. Aren't you?

633
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:11,488
我听你说话想到两个词
You know, two words come to mind
when I hear you taIk.

634
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:14,021
神经病跟怪喀
''DeIusionaI'' and ''weirdo''.

635
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,964
要说第三个的话是瞎，很瞎
And if I had to say a third, ''goofy''.
Just goofy.

636
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:21,959
你不放我走，我就要发火罗
Now you Iet oId Jedediah out of here
or he's gonna get angry.

637
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:23,963
嘉地雅，说得好
WeII pIayed, Jedediah!

638
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,771
抱歉，我没办法把你当一回事
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriousIy.
You're just adorabIe,

639
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,472
你连恐吓我都很可爱
even when you're threatening me.
It's hiIarious.

640
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,710
是我个人喜好吗？
还是这些家伙可爱到不行？
Is it just me,
or are these guys unbeIievabIy cute?

641
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:35,910
等一下
Now hoId it a second, now.

642
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:38,715
你抓我刑求我都行
Now, you have a right to keep me
as your captive, torture me, even,

643
00:47:38,788 --> 00:47:41,222
千万别说我可爱
but don't caII me cute! I ain't cute!

644
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,318
冷静啊，朋友
活下去，我会来找你的
Steady, my friend!
Just stay aIive! I wiII find you!

645
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,595
巨无霸，不
Gigantor. No!

646
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:58,469
达理先生，很高兴又见面了
HeIIo, Mr. DaIey. Nice to see you again.

647
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:03,675
不介意的话，我要拿走刻写板
Now, if you don't mind,
I shaII take that from you.

648
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:05,646
谢谢
Thank you.

649
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:11,242
过了三千年，终于到手了
FinaIIy. FinaIIy! After 3,000 years,

650
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:18,455
我的地狱邪恶大军，我美丽的军队
my eviI army of the damned,
my beautifuI, beautifuI army,

651
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:23,294
终于要倾巢而出了
shaII be unIeashed!

652
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,341
爸妈恐怕把密码
I'm afraid that Mother
and Father may have

653
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,436
偷偷改掉了
sIightIy changed the combination on me.

654
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,949
你们没要接管底下世界了
I guess this whoIe
unIeashing-the-underworId thing

655
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:43,281
你一定很闷，是吧？
isn't reaIIy working out for you, huh?

656
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:46,549
因为你等了
It must be reaIIy frustrating,
'cause you've waited thousands of years

657
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:48,453
几千年才复活
to come back from the dead
and everything,

658
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:51,891
结果你现在却打不开
and now you can't get it open.

659
00:48:52,628 --> 00:48:55,859
别怕，必要的话我会再等一千年
Fear not, for I shaII wait
a thousand more if I must.

660
00:48:55,965 --> 00:49:00,026
很好，因为再过几小时
你就会在很闷的姿势僵住
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'II be
standing here in a frustrated position,

661
00:49:00,136 --> 00:49:03,594
我会跟我朋友闪人，事情就落幕了
frozen, and I'II waIk out of here
with my buddies and that'II be that.

662
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:04,968
所以，我有整晚的时间
So, I got aII night.

663
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,635
整晚是吗？
ReaIIy? AII night? WeII!

664
00:49:09,178 --> 00:49:10,668
他就没有了
He doesn't.

665
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:21,880
把笼子打开
Open that cage.

666
00:49:21,991 --> 00:49:25,051
-你在干嘛？
-不要碰我！
-What are you doing?
-No touching! No touching!

667
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:26,594
别弄我啊
Don't you manhandIe me!

668
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:29,827
-你看，他在发小脾气
-阿嘉？
-Look, he's having a IittIe tantrum.
-Jed?

669
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,193
别乱扭，这样对你只会更糟
Don't you squirm ! Don't squirm.
It'II onIy be worse for you.

670
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,500
-把他放下来！
-别怕
-Put him down!
-Don't be afraid.

671
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:38,164
我不会伤害你
I shan't hurt you.

672
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,573
糟糕，我瞎掰的
I Iied.

673
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:45,278
达理先生，他可没整晚的时间
I don't think he has aII night
at aII, Mr. DaIey.

674
00:49:45,848 --> 00:49:50,114
看样子，我认为他有一个多小时
From the Iooks of things,
I'd say he has a IittIe over an hour.

675
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:51,846
放我出去！
Take me out of here!

676
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:57,683
你是警卫，你清楚刻写板
You were the guardian!
You know aII about this tabIet.

677
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,957
你显然比大家都聪明
You're obviousIy much more cIever
than the rest of us.

678
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,123
不管你知不知道密码
You may or may not
know the combination,

679
00:50:03,232 --> 00:50:06,497
我给你一小时搞定
but I am going to give you
exactIy one hour to figure it out.

680
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,538
不然，我就杀了你的朋友
If you do not,
I shaII kiII your friends.

681
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:13,564
你别想逃，我会看着你
And pIease don't think about escaping,
for I shaII be watching you.

682
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:15,439
我根本不会
Look, I don't even know how to begin

683
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:17,705
破解这东西
to decipher this thing,
aII right? ReaIIy.

684
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,407
可惜啊，你的小牛仔朋友
What a pity.

685
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:23,316
看起来是大好人一个
And your IittIe cowboy friend seemed
Iike such a charming IittIe feIIow.

686
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:29,557
达理先生，时间紧迫
计时开始了
Ah, weII. Tick-tock, Mr. DaIey.
Your hour has begun.

687
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:34,426
伙计，你行的，我知道你行
Hey! You got this, partner.
I know you do.

688
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,801
你行的！
You got this!

689
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,172
你在这里，你还好吗？
我担心死了
There you are! Are you aII right?
I've been worried sick! Sick I teII you.

690
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,049
-我没事
-我们的下一步是什么？
-No, I'm fine.
-So what's our next move, partner?

691
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,782
我不知道，我得解读刻写板
I don't know. I just got to get
this tabIet transIated.

692
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:03,850
太好了，又是这家伙
Oh, great! This guy again.

693
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:06,759
听着，我们不想惹事，好吗？
Look, buddy,
we don't want any troubIe, aII right?

694
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:19,204
你看
Look at that!

695
00:51:19,308 --> 00:51:22,835
大胆的章鱼不喜欢离开水
I guess our sassy cephaIopod was just a
fish who didn't Iike being out of water.

696
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:25,680
它其实没那么坏
He's not such a baIIywagger after aII.

697
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:32,051
好，你开心我就高兴了
Okay. GIad you're happy.

698
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,728
哈罗，帮个忙好吗？
HeIIo? A IittIe assistance?

699
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:46,558
-是泰迪，太好了！
-是！
-Hey, Teddy! Perfect!
-Yes!

700
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:47,795
说不定你能帮我们
Maybe you couId heIp us.

701
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,462
重要的事先解决
I'd Iove to heIp you,
but first things first.

702
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,870
我鼻子痒到快发疯了
My nose is so itchy,
it's driving me insane.

703
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:55,239
我不想麻烦你
不过我的身体少了几截
I hate to ask, but, as you see,
I'm missing a few body parts.

704
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:58,541
-你能帮忙抓一下吗？
-好啊
-CouId you pIease give us a scratch?
-Yeah, sure.

705
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:02,541
太好了，好爽，过去一点
Oh, yes! That's exquisite.
A IittIe over there...

706
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:03,845
-还要吗？
-继续
-Yes!
-More?

707
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:06,183
喔，太棒了
Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, that's...

708
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:09,414
好爽
Sweet rutabaga pie, that was divine.

709
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:11,483
希欧多罗斯福在此为你服务
Theodore RooseveIt, at your service.

710
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:14,421
第26任美国总统、游骑兵
Twenty-sixth President
of the United States, Rough Rider,

711
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:16,556
国家公园的创办人什么的
founder of the nationaI parks,
and a whoIe bunch of other stuff.

712
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:20,696
-我们见过吗？
-没有，有另一个泰迪
-Have we met?
-No, there's another Teddy.

713
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:25,331
-纽约有个你
-真的？另一个我是什么样子？
-We have one of you in New York.
-ReaIIy? What's he Iike, this other me?

714
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:28,669
差不多，除了…
He's pretty much the same,
except with...

715
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,837
除了什么？有身体吗？
Except what? Say it.
Except with a body?

716
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:33,347
-对，他有身体
-可恶，太痛苦了！
-Yes. He has a body.
-Oh, dash it, the pain!

717
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,780
-他还有一匹马…
-麻烦一下
-And a horse.
-Excuse me!

718
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,513
我们需要人翻译上面的文字
We reaIIy need someone to transIate
what's written on this tabIet.

719
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:42,118
-你看得懂象形文字吗？
-小姐，我懂
-Do you read hierogIyphics?
-Yes, I do, missy.

720
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:43,953
这很简单
That's a simpIe one.

721
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:48,086
鸟、持矛的人、横的鱼
甲虫、瓶子
Bird. Man with spear.
Sideways fish. BeetIe. Vase.

722
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:50,795
这是什么意思？
Okay, and what does that mean?

723
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,960
意思是…这只是大概的翻译
It means, and this is
just a rough transIation,

724
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:58,966
一个持矛的人抓了一只鸟跟横鱼
放进瓶子里
''A man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase.

725
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,971
“还有一只甲虫”
''And there was aIso a beetIe.''

726
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:08,016
-我觉得不是这样
-这是一个可能的翻译
-I don't think that's it.
-That's just one possibIe transIation.

727
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,607
另一个是
Another possibIe transIation is,

728
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,653
想找到密码
''You wiII find the combination you seek

729
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,554
“就要先解开法老王陵寝中心之谜”
''if you figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.''

730
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:18,791
-这是什么意思？
-我是出谜题的吗？
-Okay, and what does that mean?
-I don't know! What am I, the Sphinx?

731
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:21,091
你怎么不问纽约的泰迪
''What's this? What's that?''
Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

732
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:23,563
他一定会很想动手碰
I'm sure he'd Iove to get his grabby
IittIe fingers aII over that thing!

733
00:53:23,632 --> 00:53:25,259
搞不好还让他的马舔一舔
ProbabIy Iet his horse Iick it, too!

734
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:27,734
我们应该去雕像馆了
Mr. DaIey, we shouId be going
to the scuIpture gaIIery.

735
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:29,964
那里有个人可能会有更好的想法
I think there's someone there
who might have a better thought on this.

736
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:32,707
我们要找的人就在底下
The feIIow we're Iooking for
is just down here.

737
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:36,108
-晚安
-哈罗，小姐
-Bonsoir.
-HeIIo, young Iady.

738
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:39,672
抱歉，我们可以走了吗？
Hey, excuse me.
CouId we keep moving, pIease?

739
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:42,808
可以啊，可是这样会错过难得的机会
We certainIy couId, but then
we might miss a rare opportunity.

740
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:45,443
达理先生，她可是窦加的作品
I mean, she is a Degas, Mr. DaIey.

741
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:47,682
可是我有个朋友困在沙漏里
Okay, it's just I got a IittIe buddy
stuck in an hourgIass,

742
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,519
早上还要开会，快走了
I got a pitch meeting
at WaI-Mart in the morning...

743
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,992
-我们走吧…
-他就在这里
-It wouId be great if we couId...
-He's right here.

744
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:55,523
我觉得他对这件事会有想法
I think he'II have a thought on this.

745
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:56,656
沉思者铜像-1902年作品
罗丹-生于1840逝于1917
Mr. Thinker, we're sorry
to interrupt your contempIation,

746
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,757
沉思者，抱歉打扰你沉思了

747
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:01,064
我们得解开
but we reaIIy need
to figure out the secret

748
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:03,263
法老王陵寝中心之谜
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

749
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:06,502
沉思啊，我在沉思
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

750
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:09,501
我在想
I'm thinking.

751
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:14,883
-想啊想
-不行，他是逊咖
-I'm thinking.
-It's not happening with him.

752
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,916
喔，哇
Oh, wow.

753
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,353
不会吧，你看，有漂亮美眉耶
You've gotta be kidding me.
Check that out!

754
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,318
-喔，耶
-嘿，嘿！
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey! Hey!

755
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:26,054
老兄，看这里，事情很严重
Buddy! Over here! This is serious.

756
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,959
关系到生死
ApparentIy, it's a matter
of Iife and death.

757
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,195
我告诉你什么关系到生死
I'II teII you
what's a matter of Iife and death.

758
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,994
那位辣妹
That beautifuI Iady over there.

759
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:35,525
宝贝，看我的肌肉
Hey, baby! Check out the gun show
going on over here!

760
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,563
火力十足
Firepower!

761
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:41,033
他不是爱因斯坦
He's certainIy no Einstein.

762
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:43,976
-二头肌！三角肌…
-你说得对
-Biceps! DeItoids...
-Yeah.

763
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:47,311
-等等，我有看到一堆
-一堆什么？
-Wait a minute. I saw a bunch of those.
-A bunch of whats?

764
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:49,180
-小爱因斯坦
-在哪里？
-LittIe Einsteins.
-Where?

765
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,210
在那边，航太馆
Over there, in Air and Space.

766
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:54,817
我们得过去
I gotta get over there.

767
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:56,483
干嘛？
What?

768
00:54:56,558 --> 00:55:00,050
-没事
-好，那你瞪着我干嘛？
-Nothing.
-Okay. Then why are you staring at me?

769
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,391
我不想错过这一刻
I don't wanna miss a moment.

770
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:04,830
我们得走了，因为…
AII right, good, but we shouId
get going, 'cause we...

771
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:08,469
-干嘛
-你话太多了
-Why?
-You taIk too much, ace.

772
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:14,908
我不知道我为什么亲你
I don't know why I did that, Mr. DaIey.

773
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,104
我觉得我睡了好久
I just feeI as if I've been asIeep
for a Iong time and now, suddenIy,

774
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,742
突然醒了过来
I'm awake.

775
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:21,880
这点我可以解释
I can expIain that...

776
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:24,514
我真的可以
But reaIIy, I couId. I reaIIy...

777
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:26,945
又来了，为什么？
Again, why?

778
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:33,525
太好了，你们回来了
Great, you're back.

779
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:40,533
好，很好
Okay. Yeah. Great.

780
00:55:40,602 --> 00:55:43,696
太好了，是《铁达尼号》主题曲
好听，可是不适合
Love theme from Titanic.
Good, but not reaIIy appropriate.

781
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:50,273
你不喜欢享乐，对吗？
You don't Iet yourseIf enjoy things
much, do you, Mr. DaIey?

782
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:53,938
不是歌选得不好
Okay, you know what?
It's not reaIIy the song choice.

783
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:55,984
而是你们唱得不太准
And by the way, you're a IittIe pitchy.

784
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:59,446
我觉得你们很棒，造型抢眼
WeII, I thought you were amazing,
and you Iook wonderfuI.

785
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,023
拜托你们飞走好吗？
CouId you just fIy away, pIease?

786
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:05,622
继续冒险吧
And so the adventure continues.

787
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:11,794
我是怎么说的，够了！
What did I teII you? Enough!

788
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:24,274
我是拳王阿里
我的确觉得像只飘逸的蝴蝶
You know, I do sort of feeI
Iike a fIoating butterfIy.

789
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:27,204
你完全疯了
You are crazier than a road Iizard.

790
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:31,343
埃及先生
这两个听说我们要接管世界
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard
that we're taking over the worId

791
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:34,388
他们想参一脚，我不知道他们是谁
and they want in.
I don't know who they are,

792
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,857
不过他们也是这里的展品
but they're on exhibit here,
too, apparentIy.

793
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:40,888
我根本搞不清楚他们是什么
I don't even know what they are.

794
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:46,127
抱歉，今天恶魔的名额满了
I'm sorry, but we're aII fuII up
in our axis of eviI today. Sorry.

795
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:49,364
别这样，我很坏耶
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

796
00:56:49,471 --> 00:56:51,962
我能使坏给你看
Hey, I couId show you how bad I am !

797
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,070
怕我吧！
Fear me!

798
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,840
抱歉，我不信
I'm sorry. I'm just not buying it.

799
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:03,351
你看起来不是坏
你只是看起来不太爽
You don't seem very bad. You just seem
sort of vagueIy grouchy to me.

800
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:05,652
真是的
Oh, boy.

801
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:10,018
你在干嘛？这是什么？
What are you doing?
What is that? What is this?

802
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:12,356
这是啥意思？我被你搞糊涂了
What does it mean? You've Iost me.

803
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:16,091
这是你的呼吸声吗？
吵得我不能想事情
Is that you breathing?
Because I can't hear myseIf think.

804
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:19,858
我可以给个建议吗？
Can I make one suggestion
to you, my friend? Just simpIify.

805
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:22,369
简单一点，你搞得太复杂了
There's just too much going on here.

806
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:26,932
你邪恶、有气喘、还是机器人
这斗蓬是干嘛的？
You're eviI, you're asthmatic, you're
a robot... And what is the cape for?

807
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:29,602
我们要去听歌剧吗？没有吧
Are we going to the opera?
I don't think so.

808
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:31,838
抱歉，再见
Sorry! Goodbye.

809
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:33,438
注意了！
Attention!

810
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:35,414
他拿着刻写板走了
He's Ieaving with the tabIet!

811
00:57:36,118 --> 00:57:37,676
哪里？
Where?

812
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,454
给我
Give me that.

813
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:45,050
他没要解开密码，他是要落跑
He's not trying to figure out the...
He's trying to escape!

814
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:49,188
大家快去，杀了他
把刻写板拿回来
Go. Go! AII of you! KiII him !
And bring me that tabIet.

815
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:52,958
快点啊
没有刻写板，我们就没局了
Come on, peopIe! Let's go!
Without that tabIet, we've nothing!

816
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,797
步兵，快去！
Streltsy! Go!

817
00:57:57,406 --> 00:58:00,807
赖瑞达理，你以为你逃得掉吗？
Thought you couId get away,
didn't you, Larry DaIey?

818
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,809
我们没救了乎
Criminy, we're jimmy-jacked.

819
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:13,046
-没救了乎？
-这是我说话的方式
-Jimmy-jacked? ReaIIy?
-It's the way I speak.

820
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:15,385
就连你说听起来都像瞎掰的
Yeah, I know, but that one
sounds made up, even for you.

821
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:19,553
“不会吧，坏人挡了我们的路”
这样说不好玩
''Oh, no, our path has been bIocked
by bad peopIe.'' What's the fun in that?

822
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:22,390
重点是我们进不了航太馆
The point is, we're not getting into
the Air and Space right now.

823
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:24,489
-你说得对
-我们没救了乎
-You're right. We are jimmy-jacked.
-Jimmy-jacked.

824
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,332
走吧
Come on.

825
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:38,643
听说这里的总统是好人
They say a good man ruIes this union.

826
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:41,580
我答应嘉地雅我会搬救兵
I promised Jedediah I wouId bring heIp,

827
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:44,085
我一定会搬来
and heIp I wiII bring.

828
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:50,921
冲啊！
Charge!

829
00:59:03,939 --> 00:59:05,839
我算错距离了
Misjudged the distance.

830
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,144
谁在那里？
Who's there?

831
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:18,646
朱比特，保护我啊
Jupiter, protect me.

832
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:26,418
千万不要动
Remain very stiII.

833
00:59:27,162 --> 00:59:29,460
它们能察觉动作
They can sense movement.

834
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:34,399
它们也能听到我自言自语
ApparentIy, they can aIso hear me
taIking to myseIf.

835
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:38,635
我不是松果
I'm not a nut.

836
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:41,901
不！
No!

837
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:50,876
我们能在里头躲一会
We shouId be okay in here for a whiIe.

838
00:59:55,924 --> 00:59:58,188
你当博物馆警卫多久了？
So, how Iong
have you guarded antiquities?

839
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,922
什么？我不是警卫…
What? Oh, no,
I don't actuaIIy work at the...

840
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:02,826
你的制服很帅
I just thought
with the fancy getup and aII...

841
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:05,022
这是我借来的
No, I borrowed this.

842
01:00:05,534 --> 01:00:10,062
我在纽约是当过警卫
可是那有一段时间了
I mean, I was a guard back in New York,
but that was a whiIe ago.

843
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,104
你为什么辞职？你做得不开心吗？
So why did you Ieave?
Did you not enjoy it?

844
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:15,836
我很喜欢
No, I Ioved it. I just...

845
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:18,778
只是情况变了
Things sort of took off
in a different direction, so...

846
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,338
-你现在做什么？
-我…
-So what do you do now?
-WeII, I sort of...

847
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:26,083
设计b品来卖
WeII, I sort of design products
and seII them.

848
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:28,284
-你是发明家
-对
-You're an inventor!
-I am.

849
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,255
我是发明家，我发明东西
I am an inventor, yeah. I invent stuff.

850
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,049
例如火箭吗？
Like the rocket ship?

851
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,788
-不是
-水上飞机
-No.
-The sea pIane.

852
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:36,693
-飞船？
-不是飞行器
-The dirigibIe?
-No, not aircraft.

853
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,563
是比较小的东西，例如…
Sort of Iike more
smaII-scaIe stuff, Iike...

854
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:43,860
发光手电筒，那是我的发明
WeII, the GIow-in-the-Dark
FIashIight, that was mine.

855
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:47,569
你喜欢你的新工作吗？
So this new job, do you Iike it?

856
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:51,738
我很喜欢，很刺激
Yeah, I Iike it a Iot.
It's exciting. It's...

857
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:55,646
-干嘛
-我搞不懂
-What?
-I'm just confused, is aII.

858
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:57,946
如果你觉得不刺激干嘛做
If you're not excited by it,
why do you do it?

859
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:02,150
-我觉得很刺激啊，我刚说…
-我知道你说什么
-I am excited by it. I just said...
-I know what you said, Mr. DaIey,

860
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:05,590
可是你看起来没啥活力
but what I see in front of me
is a man who's Iost his moxie.

861
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:09,056
我没有…
I have not Iost my...

862
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:11,229
我有活力啊
I got my moxie.

863
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:13,090
你知道我为什么去当飞行员吗？
Do you know why I became a piIot?

864
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,637
-我不知道
-因为好玩
-I don't, no.
-For the fun of it.

865
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,642
不然做那些事情干嘛？
Why eIse wouId anyone do anything?

866
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:25,837
不会吧
Great Gatsby!

867
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:30,910
该死的鸽子，吵个不停
BIast these pigeons
and their incessant cooing!

868
01:01:30,986 --> 01:01:33,921
-总统先生，不要！
-该来巡视…
-No! Mr. President! Sir!
-AII right. Time to see the state...

869
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:37,254
-请您不要起来！
-…这个伟大的国家了
-PIease don't get up!
-...of this great union! I aIways say,

870
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:41,022
我一向说，今日事今日毕啊
Ieave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today.

871
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:43,154
先生，你出去会吓死人
Sir, if you go out there,
you're gonna freak a Iot of peopIe out!

872
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:47,031
吓人？我又不是怪物
Freak? I assure you, sir,
I am no freak.

873
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:51,538
-我不是说你是怪物
-小家伙，过来
-No, I didn't mean you're a freak...
-Come here, IittIe one.

874
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:55,672
怪物应该是你吧
In fact, if anyone is freakish,
I'm afraid it's you, sir.

875
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:59,011
其实，你小只到不行
The truth is, you are very smaII.

876
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:01,810
连对中等体型的人来说都是
And I mean
even for a reguIar-sized human.

877
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:04,647
什么？你为什么这么说？
What? Why wouId you even say that?

878
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:07,114
我不能说谎
I must be honest.

879
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:10,556
对，你是诚实的林肯
抱歉，太好了
Right. Okay, Honest Abe.
Of course. I'm sorry. Great.

880
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:12,957
总统先生，把这小男人放下来
Come, now, Mr. President,
put the IittIe man down

881
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:15,292
坐回你的宝座吧
and Iet's sit our fanny back
in that throne of yours.

882
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:18,855
你的态度很积极，我就照办吧
You have a can-do attitude,
and I shaII do as you ask.

883
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,559
谢谢
Thank you.

884
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:22,734
-好，放回去
-谢谢
-There you go.
-Thank you.

885
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:27,241
美国就是有这种积极的精神
It's that very can-do spirit that has
defined this remarkabIe nation of ours.

886
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,832
-告诉你…
-他们来了
-Interesting story.
-They're coming.

887
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,207
有一晚在盖茨堡…
One night in Gettysburg...

888
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:32,041
总统先生，请你别动
Mr. President, we're gonna need you
to hoId stiII now.

889
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:33,876
-什么？
-林肯，定格！
-What?
-Abraham, freeze!

890
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:35,745
定格？我…
Freeze? I...

891
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:45,083
-谢谢
-不客气
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

892
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:47,684
-我们去航太馆吧
-我觉得你们两个
-Come on, Iet's get to Air and Space.
-If I may,

893
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:51,199
-很登对
-不，我们不是
-you two make an adorabIe coupIe.
-Oh, no, we're not...

894
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:52,927
我们不是，我是说…
No, we're not a...
I mean, we're not a...

895
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:56,231
“我们不是，我是说…”
吵死了！
''We're not a... I mean, we're not a...''

896
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:57,862
我从来不说谎的！
I never Iie!

897
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:01,733
事实是，你们两个很登对
The truth is,
you two are adorabIe together.

898
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:03,276
谢谢，晚安
Thank you. Good night.

899
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:08,839
再见，漂亮的小姐跟小只男人
FareweII, IoveIy Iady
and smaII, IittIe man.

900
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:10,441
航太博物馆

901
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:13,283
去找爱因斯坦吧
Now Iet's see if we can find
these Einsteins of yours.

902
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:32,973
人类的一大步
One giant leap for a mannequin...

903
01:03:33,675 --> 01:03:38,669
华府，这里是航太馆
我们恢复通讯与运作了
D.C., this is Air and Space. We are
back online and fully operational.

904
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:47,846
黑色部队又出动了
The Tuskegee Airmen
are on the march once again.

905
01:03:47,923 --> 01:03:51,916
别再说我们的事迹了，活在当下吧
Can you stop narrating everything
we're doing? Just Iive in the moment.

906
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,554
黑色部队活在当下
The Tuskegee Airmen
are Iiving in the moment!

907
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,063
-埃尔哈特小姐？
-是
-Miss Earhart?
-Yes.

908
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:59,293
-我想谢谢你
-为什么？
-I wanna say thank you.
-What for, Captain?

909
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,665
很多人也认为我们不懂飞行
A Iot of peopIe didn't think
we couId fIy, either.

910
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,931
多谢你开路
Thanks for cIearing the runway, ma'am.

911
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:09,672
-看谁先到巴黎？
-拼了
-Race you to Paris?
-You're on!

912
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:11,109
不，先不要！
No! Not now! We gotta...

913
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,443
-过个大西洋就到了
-要赶快找到爱因斯坦
-It's just a quick jaunt over the pond.
-No. Gotta find the Einsteins.

914
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:16,609
我们没时间，走吧
Come on, we gotta go.
We don't have time. Come on!

915
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:19,017
抱歉，本性难移
Sorry, it's in the bIood.

916
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:21,346
达理先生，它在那里
There she is, Mr. DaIey.

917
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:25,085
这架飞机带我横越大西洋
OId Bessie, the oId famiIy bus.
That gaI took me across the AtIantic!

918
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,128
我想爱因斯坦在这里
Okay. I think the Einsteins
are over here, though.

919
01:04:27,195 --> 01:04:29,891
这是任务控制中心，飞行检查完成
This is Mission Control.
Flight check complete.

920
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:32,456
-他们去哪里了？
-准备动
-Where'd you go? Where'd they go?
-You are clear for launch.

921
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,001
动！
Contact!

922
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:36,002
华府，这是任务中心
D.C., this is Mission Control.

923
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:39,865
-不！不！
-一切就绪，准备发射
-No, no! No!
-All systems go and green for lift-off.

924
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:42,443
收到，准备发射
Roger that.
We are green for lift-off.

925
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:45,274
不，我们没要发射任何东西！
No, we're definiteIy not green
for any kind of Iift-off!

926
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:49,147
-我要知道能不能发射
-不发射，不能发射
-I want a ''go, no-go'' for Iaunch.
-I say no-go. Let's not go.

927
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:50,309
发射！
Go!

928
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:52,353
发射！
Go!

929
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,112
-发射！
-不！不能发射
-Go!
-No! No go!

930
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,385
旋转角度
Torquing angles incoming.

931
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:59,551
不要旋转
Tone it down with the torque.
Torque it down.

932
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:01,219
慢下来
De-torque. De-torque.

933
01:05:03,131 --> 01:05:04,962
展开动程序
Commence ignition sequence.

934
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,558
-收到
-执行发射
-Roger that, fIight.
-We have Iaunch commit.

935
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:09,830
-不，不
-10…
-No. No, no, no!
-Ten,

936
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,169
9、8、7…
nine, eight, seven...

937
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,333
-喂，那是我的
-不要执行
-Hey, that's mine.
-No, we do not have commit.

938
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,344
我们不要进行发射
Repeat. We are decommissioning
the committal of the launch

939
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:23,078
现在进入不飞不发射阶段
and it is now a negatory launch phase.
We are in a no-fly, no-go phase.

940
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:27,883
这是飞也不飞阶段
That is a November-Gorgon phase
of non-flying!

941
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:29,854
-好啦！
-晚安
-Fine!
-And we're gonna say good night.

942
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:32,450
大家表现很好，完毕
Thank you. Good work. Over and out.

943
01:05:33,828 --> 01:05:35,728
-抱歉
-可恶，真让人失望
-Sorry.
-Damn, that was disappointing.

944
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:37,924
走吧，我请你喝咖啡
Come on. I'II buy you
a cup of coffee.

945
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:40,262
嘿，小太空猴子
Hey, IittIe space monkey.

946
01:05:41,336 --> 01:05:42,701
阿布
 AbIe.

947
01:05:42,771 --> 01:05:45,740
你是阿布，你好吗？
You're AbIe. Okay, good. How you doing?

948
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:48,706
很好，稍息
Yes, good. At ease. AII right.

949
01:05:50,578 --> 01:05:52,944
你是有礼貌的小家伙
You're a poIite IittIe feIIa,
aren't you?

950
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,176
你知道爱因斯坦摇头公仔在哪吗？
Hey, you happen to know where those
IittIe Einstein bobbIehead guys are?

951
01:05:57,485 --> 01:05:59,953
达理先生，我找到爱因斯坦了
Mr. DaIey! I found your Einsteins.

952
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:01,884
太好了
Great. Hey...

953
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:05,586
各位，我们得破解刻写板的密码
GentIemen, we're trying to crack
the combination of this tabIet doodad,

954
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:08,185
上面说我们想知道
and the writing here says we'II find it

955
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:11,721
就得解开法老王陵寝中心之谜
if we figure out the secret
at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

956
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:16,568
很简单，答案就在问题里
That's an easy one.
The answer's in the question.

957
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:18,903
-什么意思？
-想想看
-What does that mean?
-''Figure out''.

958
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:21,568
是一个号码
It's a figure! I.e., a number.

959
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:24,476
法老王陵寝是金字塔
And the Pharaoh's tomb,
i.e. the pyramids.

960
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:27,139
还不懂吗？你们要找金字塔中心
Don't you get it, kid?
You're Iooking for the secret number

961
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:29,113
的秘密号码
at the heart of the pyramids.

962
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:31,915
有了，这个号码是圆周率
WeII, whistIe me Dixie, the answer's pi!

963
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:35,814
-圆周率？
-准确地说是3.14159265
-Pi?
-3.14159265, to be exact.

964
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:38,984
3.1495265吗？
Yes! 3.1495265.

965
01:06:39,094 --> 01:06:42,154
不是，3.14159265
No, no, no, 3.14159265.

966
01:06:42,263 --> 01:06:44,322
好，3.14…
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

967
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,434
我看不懂，这是对还不对？
I'm sorry, I can't teII.
Is it yes or no? Cause you just...

968
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:49,231
我知道这很难，麻烦一下好吗？
I know it's hard, couId you just...

969
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:50,635
不要碰我的头发
Don't touch the hair.

970
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:54,300
-对不起，我看不出这是点头还…
-我是摇头公仔耶，笨蛋
-Sorry, I can't teII if it's up or...
-I'm a bobbIehead, dummkopf,

971
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:57,572
我们就喜欢这样，大家一起来！
and that's the way we Iike it.
AII together, now!

972
01:06:57,645 --> 01:07:01,672
我们就喜欢这样
That's the way
We like it

973
01:07:01,783 --> 01:07:03,774
不是大家都是爱因斯坦嘛
You know,
we can't aII be Einsteins, so...

974
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:05,012
-我是
-我们是啊
-I can!
-We are!

975
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,644
-你是
-我也是
-He is!
-Me, too!

976
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,518
-好吧
-好，再说一次
-Okay, aII right.
-Okay, here it is.

977
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:11,091
-好，你们可以说慢一点吗？
-好啦
-Can you sIow it down a IittIe bit?
-Okay.

978
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:14,322
3.14159265
3.14159265.

979
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:16,920
-好，3.14…
-我记下了
-Okay. 3.14...
-I've got it.

980
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:19,466
-爱因斯坦，谢谢
-谢谢了
-Thank you, Mr. Einsteins.
-Thank you.

981
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:26,298
好，我这个聪明有名的将军
AII right. Now, Iike the briIIiant
and famous generaI that I am,

982
01:07:26,374 --> 01:07:28,467
苦思了你说的话
I thought Iong and hard
about what you said,

983
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:32,536
我想出改良的新战略了
and I've come up with a brand-new
and improved battIe pIan!

984
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:36,348
好
Okay.

985
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:41,612
我要大喊我们不攻击
I wiII IoudIy announce that we are not

986
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:44,556
然后…
going to attack, and then...

987
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,893
等着喔
Wait for it.

988
01:07:46,995 --> 01:07:52,126
“神奇的卡士达要说啥？
真希望他是我的朋友…”
''What's the amazing Custer about to say
now? I hope he's my friend, or...''

989
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,291
我们就进攻！
We attack!

990
01:07:57,906 --> 01:08:01,501
想不到你的朋友会落跑吧？
Didn't expect your friend
to run off Iike that, did you?

991
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:04,208
他会回来啦
He's coming back, Ka-Ka-Ro.

992
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:08,078
他铁定会来的啦
Sure as moon shines on a mongoose,
he'II be here.

993
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:11,375
如果我是你，就会省口气
I wouId save my breath if I were you.

994
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:13,647
你的气数不多了
You don't have many Ieft.

995
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:19,159
我们有10分钟可以救阿嘉
We've got about 10 minutes
to get over there to Jed.

996
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:22,060
我们是好团队，不只是团队吧
I think we make a good team,
perhaps more than a team.

997
01:08:22,163 --> 01:08:24,154
等等
Wait. Okay, wait.

998
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:25,927
你不喜欢亲我吗？
What's the matter?
You didn't Iike kissing me?

999
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:29,936
没有，那很棒，巴掌是有点痛啦
No, I did. It was great. I mean,
the sIapping hurt a IittIe bit, but...

1000
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:34,407
-所以你不喜欢我
-我当然喜欢你，你棒透了
-So you don't Iike me, then.
-Of course I Iike you. You're incredibIe.

1001
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:36,841
你是很棒的人
I think you're an amazing person.
You're...

1002
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:40,847
只是有一些状况让我们不能…
It's just there are certain issues
that wouId prevent us from...

1003
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:45,181
-因为你不是…
-达理先生，我不是什么？
-I just... You're not...
-I'm not what, Mr. DaIey?

1004
01:08:48,022 --> 01:08:51,014
好，你是那个做的…
Okay. You're made of...

1005
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,725
什么做的？
Made of...

1006
01:09:03,304 --> 01:09:06,933
很棒的东西，你很棒
WonderfuI things.
You're made of good, wonderfuI things.

1007
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,141
快点，步兵，快上
Come on.

1008
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,952
各位，拜托你们拖延他们
GentIemen, couId you
buy us some time pIease?

1009
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:28,626
非得成功不可
It'II have to do.

1010
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:32,963
这是举世第一架飞机耶
No! That's the first pIane ever made!

1011
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:35,729
这是轻木跟纸做的
It's made out of baIsa wood and paper.

1012
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:39,330
这是云杉、帆布做的
还有旧式的美国设计
It's made out of spruce and canvas and
good oId-fashioned American ingenuity.

1013
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:41,942
你来不来？
Are you coming, or what?

1014
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:49,917
-让开！
-办不到
-Out of our way!
-I don't think so.

1015
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:52,984
他们跑了！
They're getting away!

1016
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,288
达理先生，抓稳，好玩的来了
Hang on, Mr. DaIey.
Things are about to get interesting.

1017
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:10,033
女飞行员！太夸张了！
A Iady piIot! Preposterous!

1018
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:13,436
-小子，再考虑一下
-她很行
-Think again, boys!
-Oh, she's good.

1019
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:33,126
喔，喔，怎么了？
What? What?

1020
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:35,355
一条电线卡住了，我得松开
One of the wires is jammed.
I'm going to have to Ioosen it.

1021
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:37,658
-你来操纵
-不行！我不要！
-Here, take the stick!
-No! I'm not gonna... No!

1022
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:39,290
我知道你的活力还在
I know you've got moxie in you yet.

1023
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:42,962
靠活力不能开飞机
有飞行执照的人才能开飞机
Moxie doesn't fIy pIanes! PeopIe
who have piIots' Iicenses fIy pIanes!

1024
01:10:43,037 --> 01:10:44,561
-好不好？
-交给你了
-Okay.
-She's aII yours.

1025
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:48,971
我不要开！
I don't want it! I don't want the stick!

1026
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:55,509
别往下看，你在开飞机
Don't Iook now, Mr. DaIey,
but you're fIying an airpIane!

1027
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:08,722
阿布，开门！
AbIe! The doors!

1028
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,673
-好了！
-抓稳了！
-Got it!
-PuII!

1029
01:11:30,918 --> 01:11:32,283
往上拉！
PuII up!

1030
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:39,519
好啊！
Yes!

1031
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:41,289
爱蜜莉亚埃尔哈特，祝你顺利
Godspeed, AmeIia Earhart!

1032
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:42,795
祝你顺利
Godspeed.

1033
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:23,734
你看起来有点紧张喔
Look a IittIe nervous there,
Ramen NoodIe.

1034
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:26,000
因为这对我来说跟水疗没两样
'Cause for me,
this is Iike a spa treatment.

1035
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:30,605
沙浴可以活化肌肤、去角质
Sand baths are reaIIy rejuvenating
for the skin. ExfoIiates.

1036
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:32,745
你放弃了吗？
Giving up yet?

1037
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:34,745
还没
Not quite yet, no.

1038
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:39,546
来看看我们能不能让时光飞逝吧
In fact, Iet's see
if we can't make time fIy.

1039
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:47,187
那是什么怪声音？
What is that funny sound?

1040
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,542
停！
Stop!

1041
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:14,119
停在那里，达理先生
Right there, pIease, Mr. DaIey.

1042
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:16,317
好，很好
WeII. WeII, weII, weII!

1043
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:18,882
你很会热闹登场嘛
You certainIy know how to make
an entrance, Mr. DaIey.

1044
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:20,392
搬救兵的时候到了
Time to recruit some backup.

1045
01:13:20,495 --> 01:13:22,963
为了你的小人国朋友
I hope for your
IittIe friend's sake, here,

1046
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,396
希望你破解密码了
that you aIso figured out
the combination.

1047
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,024
-把阿嘉交出来
-不行
-Give me Jed.
-Oh, no, no, no.

1048
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,865
先把密码跟刻写板给我
First, give me the combination
and hand over that tabIet.

1049
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:31,563
等你放了我朋友
I'II give you the tabIet
and the combination

1050
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:33,333
把他交出来再说
when you reIease my friends
and give him back to me.

1051
01:13:33,474 --> 01:13:37,308
我什么时候想放谁都在于我
I shaII reIease what I want to reIease
the moment I want to reIease it.

1052
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,005
我也什么时候想交什么
Great. And I'II reIease
what I want to reIease

1053
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,809
也在于我
at the exact moment
that I want to reIease it, okay?

1054
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:43,578
现在就把密码跟刻写板交出来
TeII me the combination
and give me that tabIet right now

1055
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:45,652
不然我杀光你朋友
or I shaII kiII aII of your friends,

1056
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,518
第一个就是乱发小牛仔
starting with the IittIe
shaggy-headed IittIe cowman here.

1057
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:51,990
我的头发才不乱
巨无霸，让我对付这家伙！
I ain't shaggy-headed!
Gigantor, Iet me take this guy!

1058
01:13:52,059 --> 01:13:54,687
这家伙交给我，你不交出我的朋友
Don't worry, I got this handIed.
You don't want to give me my friends,

1059
01:13:54,762 --> 01:13:56,662
就拿不到密码跟刻写板
then you're not gonna get
your combination or your tabIet.

1060
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:58,164
-好，告诉你…
-好
-AII right, I'II teII you what.
-Good.

1061
01:13:58,232 --> 01:14:01,099
说话算话的卡曼拉
大家可不是白叫的
They didn't caII me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy for nothing.

1062
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:03,864
我的封号不是说话算话的卡曼拉
Here you go. They didn't caII me
Kahmunrah the Trustworthy!

1063
01:14:03,938 --> 01:14:05,872
是嗜血的卡曼拉
They caIIed me
Kahmunrah the BIoodthirsty,

1064
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,569
不乖乖听话的，他就通杀
who kiIIs whoever doesn't
give Kahmunrah exactIy what he wants

1065
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:11,975
时间随我挑，就是现在
in the moment that he wants it,
which is right now,

1066
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:15,243
所以最好把密码跟刻写板交给我
when I had aIso better get
the combination and the tabIet!

1067
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,842
-大家这么叫你？
-埃及话说起来比较短
-That's what they caIIed you?
-It was shorter in Egyptian.

1068
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,649
把他交出来我就给你密码
Great, I'II give you
the combination after you give him back.

1069
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:23,781
好大的胆子，你再碰一次就没命
How dare you? If you touch that again,
I shaII kiII you right now.

1070
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:25,485
-好
-不要碰
-Okay.
-Do not touch this.

1071
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,427
-这一区禁止碰触
-好，那…
-This is a no-touching zone!
-Good. WeII, then...

1072
01:14:28,496 --> 01:14:32,523
天啊，我不敢相信你又越界了
Oh, my God! I can't beIieve
you reached across Iike that again!

1073
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,036
不会吧，我要杀了你
I can't even beIieve it!
Oh, God, I want to kiII you right...

1074
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:39,834
你不知道密码就死定了
If you didn't know this combination,
you'd be so dead right now,

1075
01:14:39,907 --> 01:14:42,899
-会死得很惨
-可是我知道密码耶
-it wouId be unbeIievabIe.
-Great, but I do know the combination.

1076
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:47,069
手不准越线！
Don't cross this Iine with your hand!

1077
01:14:47,181 --> 01:14:52,949
好大的胆子，如果你再说一次
How dare you! If you
speak again, I'm going to kiII you.

1078
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:54,681
再说一次我就杀了你，了解吗？
Do you understand this?

1079
01:14:54,755 --> 01:14:56,620
不要！我看你准备开口罗
Don't say it!
Oh, God, I see you getting ready.

1080
01:14:56,724 --> 01:14:58,851
-我没有要说…
-我的天，别说话
-I wasn't gonna say anything.
-Oh, my God, don't say anything.

1081
01:14:58,926 --> 01:15:01,053
你再开口我就给你死
I shaII murder you if you taIk again.

1082
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:06,259
把刻写板给我，告诉我密码
Now give me that tabIet
and teII me the combination.

1083
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:09,196
你先交出阿嘉，放了我朋友才行
Okay. After you give me Jed
and reIease my friends.

1084
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:11,470
-你三项都破了
-什么？
-You did aII three!
-What?

1085
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:13,472
你说话，还把手伸过来
You spoke
and you reached your hand across!

1086
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:15,439
我可以说一整晚
Look. I can taIk to you about this
aII night, okay?

1087
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:16,908
-这样好了…
-给我…
-How about this?
-Look, just give...

1088
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,276
我现在先不杀你，其实我实在很想
How about I don't kiII you right now,
Iike I reaIIy, reaIIy want to,

1089
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,405
我限你五秒内
and I give you preciseIy five seconds

1090
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:24,212
给我刻写板跟密码
to give me that tabIet
and teII me the combination?

1091
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:27,880
我们已经拿到密码了，是圆周率
We aIready got the combination. It's pi.

1092
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:32,988
-3.14159265
-不！
-3.14159265.
-No!

1093
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:34,721
-嘿
-对不起
-Hey.
-Sorry.

1094
01:15:35,463 --> 01:15:41,493
这头发爆乱的人说的
他说得可开心了
So Crazy Hair here, he sang.
Oh, did he sing! Like a canary.

1095
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:43,669
赖瑞，对不起
I'm sorry, Larry.

1096
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:46,262
够了，记得上次怎样吗？
Enough out of you!
Remember what happened Iast time?

1097
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:48,165
-够了
-白痴
-That's enough.
-Stupid man.

1098
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:53,679
-你没事吧？
-没事，谢了
-You okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

1099
01:15:53,781 --> 01:15:56,249
赖瑞，你一定很闷
Must be a reaI bummer for you, Larry,

1100
01:15:57,184 --> 01:16:01,245
你的努力到头来都白费了
knowing that aII of your vaIiant efforts
were, in the end, for naught.

1101
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:06,320
你一定对自己很失望
What a terribIe disappointment
you must be to yourseIf.

1102
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:18,028
大家听到声音了吗？
Do you hear that humming sound?

1103
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,665
知道这是什么声音吗？
Do you know what that sound is?

1104
01:16:23,778 --> 01:16:25,211
我只是强调
It's rhetoricaI.

1105
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,509
这是世界末日的声音
That is the sound of the End.

1106
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:38,882
阿嘉，对不起
I'm sorry, Jed.

1107
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:41,655
你尽力了，巨无霸
You did your best, Gigantor.

1108
01:16:42,296 --> 01:16:44,560
该死，我们差点就赢了
Dadgum it, we aImost had him, too.

1109
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:47,862
没有，抱歉我这几年没待在博物馆
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around
the Iast coupIe of years at the museum.

1110
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:52,405
-说不定就不会变成这样
-巨无霸，你没搞懂耶
-Maybe none of this wouId have happened.
-You don't get it, do you, Gigantor?

1111
01:16:52,506 --> 01:16:54,906
我打给你不是因为需要你帮忙
I didn't caII you
'cause we needed your heIp.

1112
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:56,670
我们的确碰到麻烦
Sure, we were in a IittIe pickIe,

1113
01:16:56,744 --> 01:16:58,234
不过这不是我第一次
but it wouIdn't have been the first time

1114
01:16:58,346 --> 01:17:00,974
杀出重围了
I had to wrestIe my way
out of a root sack.

1115
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:04,818
我打给你是因为你需要我们
No, partner.
I caIIed you 'cause you needed us.

1116
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:09,020
这些年你穿着高级西装到处招摇
That fancy suit you've been parading
around in these past coupIe years,

1117
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,183
那是上绞架穿的西装
that there's a hanging suit.

1118
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:14,159
很高档，却是行尸走肉
AII gussied up, but dead inside.

1119
01:17:14,762 --> 01:17:16,093
这不像你
That ain't you.

1120
01:17:16,998 --> 01:17:19,558
-我再告诉你一件事
-什么事？
-And I'II teII you another thing.
-Yeah.

1121
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,328
今晚还没结束
This night ain't over yet.

1122
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:25,199
我这个午夜小牛仔还有门志
This IittIe Midnight Cowboy's
got some fight Ieft in him.

1123
01:17:25,272 --> 01:17:28,435
我认为你也有
Something teIIs me you do, too. Ho, now!

1124
01:17:57,438 --> 01:18:02,205
欢迎莅临卡曼拉的新疆土
WeIcome to the new,
extended reign of Kahmunrah,

1125
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:04,073
我是埃及第五任国王
Fifth King of Egypt

1126
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:06,909
现在统治全世界！
and now the worId!

1127
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:10,882
赫鲁斯神、拉神，战士们，来吧
Horus, Ra, my warriors, come forth!

1128
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:16,322
替赖瑞达理跟他的朋友送终！
Send Larry DaIey
and his friends to their doom !

1129
01:18:41,148 --> 01:18:42,775
停！
HaIt!

1130
01:18:43,784 --> 01:18:46,651
伟大的屋大维回来了
The mighty Octavius has returned!

1131
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:52,158
我骑乘自然界最可怕的动物而来
I ride on the back of nature's
most fearsome creature! I ride

1132
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,459
我骑的是松鼠！
the squirreI!

1133
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,126
骏马，往前冲吧！
Forward now, my mighty steed!

1134
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:08,340
小心
Whoa, girI! Easy.

1135
01:19:08,442 --> 01:19:10,603
你们想光荣投降吗？
Do you wish to surrender honorabIy?

1136
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:13,943
还是要流血收场？
Or must this end
with the spiIIing of your bIood?

1137
01:19:16,117 --> 01:19:18,745
这就是你的大救兵？
This? This is your big rescue?

1138
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:22,622
不是，这才是！
Oh, no. This is!

1139
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:36,662
那是什么东西？
What is that thing?

1140
01:19:36,737 --> 01:19:38,864
我叫林肯
The name is Abraham LincoIn.

1141
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:42,409
-先生，你惨了
-攻击他！
-And you, sir, are in a heap of troubIe!
-Attack it!

1142
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,613
恶心的鸽子！
Disgusting haIf-pigeons!

1143
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,731
不！哈罗？
No, no, no! HeIIo?

1144
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:07,164
掰啦，鸟头们
Adios, bird brains!

1145
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:08,929
等等，不！
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!

1146
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:11,027
再见，奇怪的鸟人
Goodbye, strange birdmen.

1147
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,106
不要回去阴间啊！
Do not return to the UnderworId!

1148
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:15,198
对，快回阴间吧
Yes, yes, do go back
into the UnderworId!

1149
01:20:15,276 --> 01:20:16,834
谢谢光临，晚安
Thank you for coming! Good night!

1150
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:17,969
不！
No, no!

1151
01:20:26,587 --> 01:20:29,681
喔，好尴尬
Oh, this is awkward.

1152
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:32,788
看来我的工作完成了
It appears my work here is done.

1153
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,855
孩子，记住，家和才能万事兴
Just remember, son, a house divided
against itseIf cannot stand.

1154
01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:42,659
再见
FareweII.

1155
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:47,397
-现在呢？
-我不确定
-What now?
-You know, I'm not quite sure.

1156
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:52,204
我们应该先看着他死吧
I suppose we shouId probabIy start
by watching him die.

1157
01:20:53,414 --> 01:20:56,713
步兵，给他死！
Streltsy! Make him dead!

1158
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:01,550
现在又怎样了？
Now what?

1159
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:07,086
我们不攻击
We are not going to attack right

1160
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:10,289
就是现在！
now!

1161
01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:20,903
去逮他们！
Get them !

1162
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:43,290
赖瑞，别怕，我会帮嘉地雅
Fear not, Larry!
I wiII heIp Jedediah!

1163
01:21:43,364 --> 01:21:45,025
从后面进攻
You come at them from behind!

1164
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:49,334
-你在干嘛？
-躲起来
-Hey, what's going on?
-I'm hiding.

1165
01:21:49,436 --> 01:21:51,666
什么？走吧，我们需要你
Hiding? What are you doing?
Come on, we need you.

1166
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:55,801
-我很没用
-你才不是
-I'm a faiIure.
-No, you're not.

1167
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,640
你有带领208名弟兄
Did you fooIishIy Iead
208 Americans to their deaths

1168
01:21:58,746 --> 01:22:00,441
在小巨角战死吗？
at the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn?

1169
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:06,086
-没有
-一点都不好
-No.
-No? Not good. Not good at aII.

1170
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:08,587
-是不好
-我很会纸上谈兵
-That's not good.
-Sure, I taIk a good game,

1171
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:11,420
但我配不上这几颗星
but the truth of the matter is,
I don't deserve these stars.

1172
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:16,260
我会永远因为我最大的失败出名
I wiII aIways be famous
for my biggest faiIure.

1173
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:20,255
别这样
Hey.

1174
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:22,825
过去的都过去了，好吗？
The past is the past, okay?

1175
01:22:23,537 --> 01:22:26,267
此时此刻，这一晚
Right now, this moment, this night,

1176
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:29,641
这是大家会记得的你
this is what you're gonna be
remembered for.

1177
01:22:31,378 --> 01:22:33,039
这是你的最后战役
This is your Iast stand.

1178
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:53,222
-他们需要领导
-没错
-They need a Ieader.
-Yeah, they need a Ieader.

1179
01:22:55,169 --> 01:22:57,399
你想当他们的领导吗？
Yeah? You want to be their Ieader, huh?

1180
01:22:58,472 --> 01:23:00,235
-我想
-那就来吧
-Yeah, I do.
-Let's do this!

1181
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:02,000
-好吗？
-好耶
-AII right?
-Yeah.

1182
01:23:02,076 --> 01:23:03,441
走吧！
Let's go!

1183
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:07,145
不好了
Not good!

1184
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,637
赖瑞！
Larry!

1185
01:23:09,383 --> 01:23:10,475
嘿，阿布
Hey, AbIe!

1186
01:23:10,551 --> 01:23:11,540
我想帮忙
I want to help!

1187
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:12,777
好啊
Oh, great.

1188
01:23:12,853 --> 01:23:14,548
你是谁？这是我的博物馆
Who are you?
This is my museum!

1189
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:16,685
他是我朋友，走开！
Well, he's my human.
Back off!

1190
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:18,448
丛林小子，你们需要所有的援兵
You need all the help you can get,
Jungle-Dweller!

1191
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,048
少拽了，太空势利鬼
Get over yourself space snob!

1192
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:21,151
嘿，你们
Guys! Hey, guys!

1193
01:23:21,228 --> 01:23:23,093
现在不是吵架的时候
This is not the time
to get into this, aII right?

1194
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:26,697
德克斯，这样不好
Dexter, you know better.

1195
01:23:28,669 --> 01:23:30,534
这是你打人的下场
AII right?
That's what happens when you do that!

1196
01:23:30,604 --> 01:23:31,935
懂吧
You get that.

1197
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:41,511
住手，给我住手，住手！
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

1198
01:23:42,082 --> 01:23:45,074
你们两只卷尾猴听着
Now, Iisten. You're both proud capuchin!

1199
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,750
专心打敌人
You need to concentrate
on sIapping the enemy!

1200
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:52,922
振作起来，好吗？
Keep it together, aII right?

1201
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:54,927
快走吧，来吧
Come on, Iet's go! Let's do it!

1202
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:59,730
-嘉地雅，他们需要我们
-我不行了
-Jedediah! They need us!
-I ain't gonna make it!

1203
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:02,602
牛仔我撑不住了
Afraid this cowboy's been
to his Iast hoedown.

1204
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:08,939
屋大维，你要记住我的自由狂野
还有…
Octavius, remember me as I was,
wiId, and free, and...

1205
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,646
-不用说遗言吧
-我还没说完
-No need for finaI words.
-I'm not finished yet.

1206
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:15,844
我想聊我们的关系
I want to get
to the story of our reIationship,

1207
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:18,214
化敌为友
the evoIution from enemy to friends.

1208
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:20,717
-不！
-会让你痛哭喔
-No!
-It'II make you cry!

1209
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:24,053
不，因为你会活下去！
No! Because you are going to Iive!

1210
01:24:35,035 --> 01:24:37,503
-干活吧
-剑给你
-Let's go to work.
-Have a sword.

1211
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,072
剑来！
Sword!

1212
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:58,785
小心！
Incoming!

1213
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:19,137
好痛
That smarts.

1214
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,780
你打，你踢，你打，你踢
You smack, you kick!
You smack, you kick!

1215
01:25:25,853 --> 01:25:29,186
你打，你踢
团结合作，太棒了
You smack, you kick!
Teamwork, feIIas! Wunderbar!

1216
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:34,492
你们好吗？
How you doing, feIIas?

1217
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:07,388
-你还好吗？
-好的不得了
-Are you aII right?
-Never better.

1218
01:26:07,494 --> 01:26:09,655
我打暗号你就开门
Listen, when I give you the signaI,
I want you to open the gate.

1219
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,563
-你有计划吗？
-我要让家不和
-I take it you have a pIan.
-I'm gonna divide the house.

1220
01:26:17,704 --> 01:26:20,172
刻写板，快！
The tabIet! Now!

1221
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,673
好，告诉我谁当家
Okay, sure, you can have it.

1222
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:23,733
我就交出来
Just teII me who the boss is
and I'II give it to you.

1223
01:26:23,844 --> 01:26:26,335
这要交给卡曼拉吗？
他好像是你的主子
Or shouId I give it to Kahmunrah?
He's your master, right?

1224
01:26:26,613 --> 01:26:30,276
-他不是我们的主子
-是吗？他的行为像你们的主子啊
-Nyet! He is not our master!
-ReaIIy? 'Cause he acts Iike he is.

1225
01:26:30,384 --> 01:26:32,375
好，告诉我谁当家
But fine, just teII me who the boss is
and you can have it.

1226
01:26:32,452 --> 01:26:34,852
那就是我
Hey! That'd be me.

1227
01:26:36,223 --> 01:26:39,386
这人是平民，我可是贵族出身
This man is a peasant!
I am the onIy one here of nobIe birth!

1228
01:26:39,459 --> 01:26:42,428
他的勋章比较多，帽子也比较大
ReaIIy? 'Cause he's got more medaIs
and a bigger hat, but...

1229
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:44,554
-谢谢
-你的勋章是比较多
-Thank you.
-You might got a Iot of medaIs,

1230
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:47,259
不过你再拿你的小手碰刻写板一次
but you put one of your
IittIe chiId hands on that tabIet again,

1231
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:50,200
你以后就没有手摸东西了
it'II be the Iast thing them tiny
IittIe mitts of yours ever touch.

1232
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:52,135
你干嘛碰小拿？
Why wouId you touch IittIe Nippy?

1233
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,573
我能处理
I can handIe this, okay?

1234
01:26:55,642 --> 01:26:58,736
你什么都不能处理
你连话都说不好
You can handIe nothing!
You can bareIy speak, you fooI!

1235
01:26:58,812 --> 01:27:02,748
你知道吗？没问题
我来帮你，看吧
You know what? No probIem.
I'II give it to you. You see that?

1236
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,212
你是精神抖擞的小家伙
Oh, you're a spunky IittIe feIIa !

1237
01:27:12,426 --> 01:27:17,830
达理先生，算你聪明
让他们起内讧
Very cIever, Mr. DaIey, getting them
to fight amongst themseIves.

1238
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:21,731
不是我的功劳，这是林肯的主意
Yeah. I can't reaIIy take credit.
It was Abraham LincoIn's idea.

1239
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:24,168
家和才能万事兴
You know, a house divided can't...

1240
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,996
-家不和万世穷
-说得好
-Doesn't do weII.
-Yes, weII,

1241
01:27:27,107 --> 01:27:30,804
你应该趁机救自己的
you shouId have saved yourseIf
when you had the chance,

1242
01:27:32,412 --> 01:27:34,676
因为我现在亲手杀你
because now I shaII have
the tremendous pIeasure

1243
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:36,413
会很乐！
of kiIIing you myseIf!

1244
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,565
你是何方神圣？
What are you?

1245
01:28:30,737 --> 01:28:32,170
我是夜班警卫
I'm the night guard.

1246
01:28:32,839 --> 01:28:35,637
不！
No!

1247
01:28:44,818 --> 01:28:46,752
我们胜利了！
Victory is ours!

1248
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:49,511
耶！
Yeah!

1249
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:57,357
这就对了
That's what I'm taIking about!

1250
01:28:58,165 --> 01:28:59,154
耶！
Yeah!

1251
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:06,605
我觉得有人找回活力了
I'd say somebody found his moxie.

1252
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:10,540
史密森尼之战
The BattIe of the Smithsonian.

1253
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:15,580
全世界永远不会知道的伟大战役
Perhaps the greatest battIe
the worId wiII never know.

1254
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:19,282
我们知道
We'II know.

1255
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:24,281
对
Yeah.

1256
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:28,891
再一小时就天亮了，我得送你们回去
Oh, man, I got an hour tiII sunrise.
I got to get you guys back.

1257
01:29:28,962 --> 01:29:32,955
你忘了吗？他们不要我们了
In case you forgot, Gigantor,
they don't want us there anymore.

1258
01:29:33,066 --> 01:29:34,431
我要啊
WeII, I do.

1259
01:29:38,105 --> 01:29:40,801
你能送我们一程吗？
Hey, think you couId hook us up
with a ride?

1260
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:43,940
这是我的荣幸
My pIeasure, of course.

1261
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:48,237
等一下，我还要处理一件事
Hang on a second.
One Iast thing I got to take care of.

1262
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:52,150
快点，小子，来啊
Come on, boy! Come on, come on!

1263
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:54,080
进去
Get in there!

1264
01:29:56,957 --> 01:29:58,390
很舒服吧？
FeeIs good, right?

1265
01:30:01,495 --> 01:30:05,397
不客气
天亮前要回去，好吗？
You're weIcome!
Just get back inside by sunrise, okay?

1266
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:22,047
现在真是充满希望啊
These are promising days, indeed.

1267
01:30:45,205 --> 01:30:46,866
来吧
AII right. Hey, come on, guys.

1268
01:30:46,973 --> 01:30:50,033
记住，跟好
Remember, stay with your buddy,
aII right?

1269
01:30:50,143 --> 01:30:51,508
很好
Good, good.

1270
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:04,218
你回到你的地方了
WeII, you're back where you beIong.

1271
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:08,156
我想是
Yeah. Think so.

1272
01:31:14,968 --> 01:31:16,458
我该走了
I guess I shouId be going.

1273
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:20,396
爱蜜莉亚
Hey, AmeIia.

1274
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:25,639
我刚刚想跟你说的事
That thing that I was trying
to teII you about earIier...

1275
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:30,973
我很难开口
There's not reaIIy
an easy way to put this,

1276
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:36,079
-不过，到了早上…
-达理先生，我知道会怎样
-but, in the morning...
-I know what's coming, Mr. DaIey.

1277
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:37,554
我一直都知道
I've aIways known.

1278
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:41,021
不过无所谓
But it doesn't matter.

1279
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:45,053
你在这一晚给了我最精彩的冒险
You've given me the adventure
of a Iifetime in one night.

1280
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,601
而且我有预感日出会很美
And I have a feeIing
it's going to be a beautifuI sunrise.

1281
01:31:58,945 --> 01:32:00,435
活得开心
Have fun.

1282
01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:11,054
谢谢
Thanks.

1283
01:33:02,275 --> 01:33:06,075
我不知道你们怎样
不过这牛仔上二垒了
I don't know about you feIIas, but
this oId cowboy just got to second base.

1284
01:33:08,982 --> 01:33:11,382
-她走了
-直奔…
-There she goes.
-Straight towards...

1285
01:33:12,953 --> 01:33:14,648
加拿大
Canada.

1286
01:33:15,655 --> 01:33:17,486
她要去加拿大
She's heading to Canada.

1287
01:33:19,826 --> 01:33:21,794
她改变航线了
No, now she course-corrected.

1288
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:27,730
你们去楼下吧
Here, head on downstairs, guys.

1289
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:29,268
-好啦
-赖瑞，晚安
-AII righty.
-Good night, Larry.

1290
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:30,803
小子，你好吗？
Hey, boy, how's it going?

1291
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:35,169
劳伦斯，你把他们带回来了
Lawrence! BIess you
for bringing them back.

1292
01:33:35,275 --> 01:33:37,971
你做得太好了
And might I say,
a hearty weII-done is in order.

1293
01:33:38,078 --> 01:33:41,514
不过我跟你说
他们不能永远躲在地下室
And may I aIso point out, they
cannot hide in the basement forever.

1294
01:33:41,581 --> 01:33:43,208
我搞定这件事了
Yeah. No, I think I got that
figured out.

1295
01:33:43,283 --> 01:33:44,409
-真的？
-是
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

1296
01:33:44,484 --> 01:33:46,281
太阳出来了，笨笨
Sun come, dum-dum.

1297
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:49,482
石像朋友说得对，天快亮了
Our moai friend is right.
The dawn wiII soon be upon us.

1298
01:33:49,589 --> 01:33:51,022
泰迪
Hey, Teddy.

1299
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:52,581
记得前晚你说到
Remember the other night
you were saying something

1300
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:53,956
幸福的关键吗？
about the key to happiness?

1301
01:33:54,027 --> 01:33:55,756
-我有吗？
-你说幸福的关键是…
-Did I?
-You said, ''The key to happiness is...''

1302
01:33:55,829 --> 01:33:58,297
结果日出你就定格了
And then the sun came up and you froze.

1303
01:33:58,365 --> 01:34:00,128
-我想我知道了
-很好
-I think I got it figured out.
-Yes?

1304
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:03,933
那就是跟你爱的人一起做你爱做的事
It's doing what you Iove, isn't it?
With peopIe you Iove.

1305
01:34:06,206 --> 01:34:08,037
我本来要说运动
ActuaIIy, I was going to say
''physicaI exercise'',

1306
01:34:08,141 --> 01:34:09,540
不过爱这个想法很好
but the Iove thing's good, too.

1307
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:17,476
-劳伦斯
-是
-Lawrence!
-Yeah.

1308
01:34:19,819 --> 01:34:21,480
小子，欢迎你回家
WeIcome home, son.

1309
01:34:23,857 --> 01:34:25,290
谢了
Thanks.

1310
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:42,674
各位，等待结束了
经过两个月的整修
WeII, foIks, the wait is over.
After two months of renovation,

1311
01:34:42,742 --> 01:34:43,834
现在开放

1312
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,641
自然历史博物馆在今天晚上
重新对外开放
tonight, The Museum of NaturaI History
reopens its doors to the pubIic.

1313
01:34:47,714 --> 01:34:50,080
纽约人蜂拥而至
As you can see,
New Yorkers are fIooding in,

1314
01:34:50,183 --> 01:34:52,708
很期待看到馆内的改变
eager to see
just what changes are in store.

1315
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:54,548
晚上开放时间延长
With its new, extended night hours,

1316
01:34:54,654 --> 01:34:57,350
据说博物馆会更加生动
we're toId the museum
wiII be more IiveIy than ever.

1317
01:35:06,366 --> 01:35:10,598
-你看看，你看看
-嗨
-WeII, weII, weII, weII!
-Hey.

1318
01:35:11,438 --> 01:35:14,066
过了这么多年，制服还很合身
I see the uniform stiII fits
after these Iong, Iong years.

1319
01:35:14,174 --> 01:35:16,540
也没那么久啦
Yeah, yeah.
ReaIIy hasn't been that Iong, but...

1320
01:35:17,444 --> 01:35:21,403
我们怎么请得动你回来？
So, to what do we owe
this ''triumphant'' return?

1321
01:35:21,514 --> 01:35:24,950
不适合企业丛林？被炒鱿鱼了？
Not cut out for the ''corporate'' jungIe
after aII. Got fired.

1322
01:35:26,753 --> 01:35:29,722
其实，我把公司卖了
No, actuaIIy, I soId my company.

1323
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:32,758
世界的变化果然神秘
The worId doth move in mysterious ways.

1324
01:35:32,859 --> 01:35:35,692
之前还说要全面汰旧换新
One day, we've got to get rid
of everything oId,

1325
01:35:35,762 --> 01:35:41,792
结果出现一个匿名捐款人
给了我们天文数字的捐款
the next, a rich, anonymous donor
gives a huge endowment.

1326
01:35:41,901 --> 01:35:45,860
附带条件是一切维持原状
With a proviso:
everything stays the same. So...

1327
01:35:50,543 --> 01:35:52,909
-也不算没有完全一样啦
-不算
-WeII, not exactIy the same, obviousIy.
-No.

1328
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:55,914
各位先生女士，我叫罗斯福
BuIIy, Iads and Iadies,
the name is Theodore RooseveIt,

1329
01:35:55,982 --> 01:36:00,817
我是博物学家、游骑兵
以及美国第26任总统
naturaIist, Rough Rider and twenty-sixth
President of these great United States.

1330
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,412
来吧，准备打猎了
嗨，劳伦斯
Come aIong, Iad. The hunt is afoot.
Lawrence.

1331
01:36:09,963 --> 01:36:12,830
笨笨，有带泡泡糖给我吗？
Hey, you dum-dums bring me gum-gum?

1332
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:24,006
3千年前，我爸妈给了我刻写板
My parents gave me this tabIet
some 3,000 years ago,

1333
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:28,274
把埃及最珍贵的财b交给我
entrusting me with one of my peopIe's
most prized possessions.

1334
01:36:28,348 --> 01:36:31,181
-它有作用吗？
-有作用？
-Does it do anything?
-Do anything?

1335
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:33,309
如果没作用要干嘛？
Yeah. What's the point
if it doesn't do anything?

1336
01:36:34,454 --> 01:36:35,546
告诉他们
Tell 'em

1337
01:36:35,622 --> 01:36:40,150
它的魔法能让所有的展品复活
ActuaIIy, it has a magicaI power
that brings aII the exhibits to Iife.

1338
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,693
说真的啦，它有什么作用？
No, reaIIy, what's it do?

1339
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:45,854
没有，只是装饰
Nothing. It's just for decoration.

1340
01:36:45,965 --> 01:36:47,296
我就知道
I knew it.

1341
01:36:48,468 --> 01:36:52,336
这地方超逊的，这东西看起来好假
This pIace is Iame.
This thing doesn't even Iook reaI.

1342
01:36:52,438 --> 01:36:55,532
说真的，这些电子傀儡好烂
SeriousIy, dude,
these animatronics suck.

1343
01:37:05,018 --> 01:37:06,451
-长毛象吗？
-是呀
-Mammoth?
-Yeah.

1344
01:37:06,519 --> 01:37:07,952
绝种了
Extinct!

1345
01:37:08,321 --> 01:37:10,687
-我追不上今日的科技
-栩栩如生
-Today's technoIogy is beyond me.
-I know. It's so IifeIike.

1346
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:12,724
-对呀，对呀
-了不起
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Something eIse.

1347
01:37:13,126 --> 01:37:14,957
你会留下来吗？
You'II stick around
a bit Ionger this time,

1348
01:37:15,028 --> 01:37:17,690
还是见好就跑？
or you gonna run away again
when you get something better?

1349
01:37:18,798 --> 01:37:20,231
-我要留下来
-长期留下来
-I'm gonna stay.
-Stay, for a Iong time.

1350
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,527
-对
-对
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1351
01:37:22,168 --> 01:37:27,697
好，很好
因为就夜班警卫而言…
Good. 'Cause,
as night guards go, you're...

1352
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:30,805
-什么？
-…你是最棒的
-What?
-The best.

1353
01:37:32,045 --> 01:37:33,637
真的
Excuse me.

1354
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:41,215
小朋友，不要抱展品
You, the toddIer!
Don't hug the dispIays.

1355
01:38:17,924 --> 01:38:18,982
嗨，对不起
I'm sorry. Hi.

1356
01:38:19,058 --> 01:38:21,049
我不是故意要盯着你
I don't mean to stare. I just...

1357
01:38:21,394 --> 01:38:24,591
你好像我认识的一个人
You Iook a Iot
Iike somebody I know, and...

1358
01:38:25,365 --> 01:38:26,764
我常听到这句话
I get that a Iot.

1359
