1
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:14,461
片名：博物馆惊魂夜

2
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:18,682
喂！小心点
Hey, watch it

3
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,049
（故障
这招没用！）

4
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,799
不会吧
oh, come on

5
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:45,842
嘿
麦克
Hey, Mike!

6
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,643
赖瑞，你好吗？
-Hey, Larry.
-How you doing?

7
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,012
尼克呢？
Have you seen Nicky?

8
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,813
他跟雅莉回去了
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was hALf day today

9
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:54,456
今天是职场家长日，只读半天
Parent career Day

10
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,289
（职场家长日）

11
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,489
-嘿
-嘿，进来吧
-Hey.
-Hey. come on in

12
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,192
-你还好吧？
-还好
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah

13
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,168
怎么没人跟我说
今天是职场家长日？
why didn't anybody tell me
it was career Day?

14
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,604
什么？
尼克说他会告诉你的
what do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you

15
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,570
我想他忘了
oh, okay, I guess he forgot

16
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:19,078
他来了
你好吗，赖瑞？
There he is. How are you, Larry?

17
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,274
很好，你呢，唐恩？
Good. How are you doing, Don?

18
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,141
很好
Good

19
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,451
你说这天气够怪的吧？
can you believe this weather?

20
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,888
冷冰冰，像冷冰冰的酷企鹅
chilly, right? chilly, chilly,
chilly willy the penguin

21
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:37,963
别吵啦
我会跟小可爱说你来了
Leave me ALone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here

22
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,568
好，谢了
Great. Great, that's great. Yeah, thanks

23
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:46,137
你未婚夫腰上挂的家伙可真多
wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt

24
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,640
-别闹了
-什么？
-Stop it.
-what?

25
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,745
什么？我是说
他就好像K
what? No, it's like he's...

26
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,575
股票市场的武林至尊
...the Batman of stockbrokers

27
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:55,718
-他是债券交易员
-债券交易员，抱歉
-Bond trader.
-Bond trader. Sorry

28
00:04:55,885 --> 00:05:00,254
你的虚拟高球练习场进度如何？
Hey, how's it going with that virtuAL-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

29
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:03,483
技术面还有待克服
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up

30
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,321
这不简单，有很多移动的物品
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts

31
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:10,394
你想尼克会喜欢皇后区吗？
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

32
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,263
噢，不，赖瑞
你不会又被赶出来了吧？
oh, no, Larry. You didn't get evicted again,
did you?

33
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,432
我没有K
I didn't...

34
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,598
被赶出来，我没有
不，我是说K
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't...

35
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:22,802
-不，我还没有被赶出来
-赖瑞，听我说
-No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
-Larry, listen to me

36
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,844
尼克不能再忍受这一切了
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take

37
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:27,642
每隔几个月就换新工作、新住所
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment

38
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:31,082
要不是为了尼克，我不会管你
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it

39
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,950
这么不安定对他不好
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him

40
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,648
我正在设法解决问题
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

41
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:42,921
你要知道
You know...

42
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,593
我不认为尼克该跟你在一起
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you

43
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,330
-什么？
-除非你安定下来
-what?
-Just until you get really settled

44
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,296
嘿，爸
Hey, Dad

45
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,136
-准备去冰上溜达了？
-酷啊
-Hey, ready to carve it up?
-cool

46
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,613
好耶，尼克
抄球盘！冲出去！
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

47
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,350
-你搞什么啊？
-小乖，你还好吧？
-what are you doing?
-Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

48
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,890
-你没事吧？
-我很好，你下去好吗？
-You okay?
-I'm fine. would you get off the ice?

49
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,499
听着，他们的左卫很弱
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater

50
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,501
往左去，你就有机会射门
好吗？
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goAL. okay?

51
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,832
-谢了
-好
-cool, thanks.
-All right, man

52
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:29,944
没事，我们很好
继续比赛吧
we're good here. we're good.
All right. As you were, skaters

53
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,504
加油！
Game on!

54
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,974
我没事
I'm good

55
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,415
你今天表现得超精彩
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today

56
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:40,078
当职业选手绝对没问题
Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility

57
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:42,986
我不想打曲棍球了
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore

58
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,196
-好吧，那你想做什么？
-债券交易员
-All right. what do you wanna be?
-A bond trader

59
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:50,960
债券交易员？
A bond trader?

60
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:55,070
唐恩就是做那个的
他带我去过他办公室
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week

61
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:57,202
好吧
That's cool

62
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:00,035
你想每天穿西装打领带？
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

63
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,076
像个机器人？
Like an automaton robot?

64
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,946
办公隔间里不能打球，太窘了
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward

65
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,444
他有一间很大的办公室
well, he's got a pretty big office

66
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,520
那不是重点，你喜欢曲棍球的
That's not the point.
come on, you love hockey

67
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,817
我还是喜欢
但当交易员是我的退路
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback

68
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,755
你的退路？
Your fallback?

69
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:20,862
等等，你还没大到要有退路
wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

70
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,794
还有你是从哪听到这字眼的？
And ALso, where did you ever
even hear that word?

71
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:27,026
妈跟唐恩有谈过你的阴谋
Mom was tALking to Don
about all your different schemes

72
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,568
她说是阴谋？
She called them schemes?

73
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:31,639
她说你该找个退路了
She said it was time
you found a fallback

74
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:37,309
你真的又要搬家了？
Are you really moving again?

75
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,680
我不知道，再说吧
I don't know. we'll see. I mean...

76
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,286
皇后区有些地方挺酷的
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens

77
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,049
-是啊
-嘿
-Yeah.
-Hey

78
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,920
尼克，看着我
Hey, Nicky, look at me

79
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,592
看着我
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something

80
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:56,994
我知道我最近状况很多
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

81
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,929
你并不好过
...and that's been hard for you

82
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,031
不过我觉得我就快成功了
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

83
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:05,197
到那时，一切都会很顺利
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

84
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,637
万一你弄错了呢？
what if you're wrong...

85
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,404
万一你只是个
需要找份工作的普通人呢？
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

86
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,417
这个嘛
All right, well...

87
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,382
我会搞清楚的，好吗？
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

88
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:27,959
好了，我们去找你妈吧
All right? come on,
let's get you back to Mom's

89
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:38,703
达理先生，我敢说
我从事这行43年
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

90
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,673
从未看过你这种履历
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours

91
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,906
好耶
All right

92
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,373
那并不是赞美
That wasn't a compliment

93
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,148
上面写你当过执行长
It says here you were the cEo...

94
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,514
叫“啪哒集团”
...of Snaptime Industries

95
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:54,546
能说明一下吗？
care to elaborate on that?

96
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:59,590
当然，那是我发明的出品集团
啪哒弹指器
Sure. well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper

97
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,356
弹一下指头，灯就开
弹一下指头，灯就关
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off

98
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,558
这不是早就上市了？
Didn't they ALready make that?

99
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:11,100
不，那是拍掌器
那很显然是K
No, no, that's the clapper,
which, obviously...

100
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:12,901
剽窃了我们的点子
...stole a bit of our thunder

101
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:16,476
我个人是看不出有什么差别
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

102
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:19,046
你知道，随便
不过
You know, whatever, but...

103
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:24,517
不过显然有占很多数比例的人口
这方面有点困难
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

104
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:27,679
-不大能够弹指头
-拍掌比较简单
-...snapping.
-clapping's easier

105
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,151
这有待商榷
Debatable

106
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:32,517
我帮不了你
I can't help you

107
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,757
黛比？
Debbie?

108
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:36,694
我能叫你黛比吗？
can I call you Debbie? Because...

109
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,164
我一进来就觉得你倍感亲切
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

110
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,303
我觉得你对我也有同感
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too

111
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,469
我对你没感觉
I didn't feel a connection

112
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:48,774
听着
Look

113
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:53,643
我明天就要有一份工作
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

114
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,681
要是找不到K
If I don't have one...

115
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,784
反正我就是需要
好吗？
well, I just need it, okay?

116
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,185
我不知道
well, I don't know

117
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,755
可能有个缺
I might have one thing

118
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,426
他们回绝了我派去的每一个人
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

119
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,065
太好了
Great

120
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,263
谁知道呢？
--who knows?

121
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,267
你可能会走运
You might get Iucky

122
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,599
-抱歉，你好
-你好
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi

123
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:56,438
我是赖瑞达理
我来找克西傅德瑞克面试
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with cecil Fredricks

124
00:10:56,946 --> 00:11:00,040
-他应该还在办公室里
-太好了
-Right. He should still be in his office.
-Great

125
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:03,674
我是导览员贝嘉贺门
-你好
-I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
-Hi

126
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:07,118
-我带你过去吧
-太好了
-Let me point you in the right direction.
-Great

127
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,687
泰迪罗斯福总统，对吧？
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

128
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,523
-对，好眼力
-当然
-Yes, a great visionary.
-Yes, definitely

129
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,756
他是第四任总统，对吧？
He was our 4th president, right?

130
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,163
-是第二十六任
-第二十六任

131
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:22,304
请勿触碰展品
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean...

132
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,768
下等人

00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,232
贺门小姐
我不能忍受这种混乱
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos

134
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,607
这是一间博物馆
不是K
I mean, this is a museum, not a...

135
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:33,913
你知道博物馆代表什么吗？
Do you know what “museum” means?

136
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,581
那不是代表
“哇，爸爸，好大的恐龙”
It doesn't mean,
Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing

137
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,382
“我能碰他的脚吗？”
不行！
can I touch its leg? No!

138
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,488
拜托你解决问题

139
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,752
-我会的
-谢谢

-Thank you

140
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,056
麦菲博士，博物馆总监
Dr. McPhee, the museum director

141
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,028
看来挺风趣的
Seems like a fun guy

142
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,532
拜托管一下你的小孩
control your young, please. can we?

143
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,973
（警卫室）

144
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:09,112
谁啊？
开玩笑的啦
Hello? Just kidding

145
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:12,914
你好，我是赖瑞达理
你是傅德瑞克先生？
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

146
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,250
傅德瑞克先生是我爸
Mr. Fredricks was my father

I am cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake

148

进来吧
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
come on in

149
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:29,202
我们就打开天窗说亮话吧
Let's tALk turkey here

150
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,236
博物馆近年亏损连连
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist

151
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:39,711
我猜现在的孩子
不再喜欢蜡像或填充动物了
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animALs

152
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:43,879
所以他们要缩编
就是裁撤K
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

153
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,021
我和夜班警卫
...myself and the other two night guards

154
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:48,482
他们要找新的警卫来取代我们
They want to replace us
with one new guard

155
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:52,185
-抱歉
-你又能怎样呢？
-oh, sorry.
-well, what are you gonna do?

156
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,922
见见我两位同事吧
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here

157
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,532
雷纳？葛斯？
ReginALd? Gus?

158
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,295
他人呢？我要亲手扁他
where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

159
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,768
葛斯，这位是赖瑞达理
他要来当新的夜班警卫
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard

160
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:09,433
夜班警卫？
Night guard?

161
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:12,775
介绍所的人说是博物馆的职位
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position

162
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:16,076
博物馆里最重要的职位
Most important position
in the museum, Larry

163
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,049
他看来像个怪胎
He looks like a weirdie

164
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,221
好警卫，做人却很糟
wonderful guard, terrible people skills

165
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,723
听着，呆瓜，别想耍花招
Now, listen, Iunch box.
Don't try anything funny

166
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:28,091
我跟拳王对战过九回合
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan

167
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,060
你才没跟拳王对战过
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life

168
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,827
两位，这里有个应征者
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here

169
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:36,528
他的履历很漂亮，态度又积极
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

170
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:39,072
我认为该给他一个机会
...and I say let's give him a shot.
what do you say?

171
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:43,302
等等，我要想一下
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over

172
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:46,277
你到底要不要工作，呆瓜？
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

173
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:53,020
-要，我要这份工作
-欢迎成为夜班警卫，赖瑞
-No, no, I want the job--
-welcome to the night guards, Larry

174
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:56,015
赖瑞，到二楼等我
Larry, meet me up on the second floor

175
00:13:56,192 --> 00:14:00,094
我穿上护膝带你走一圈
膝盖关节炎
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees

176
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:04,128
年纪大可不好玩，朋友，走吧
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on

177
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:12,472
你真认为他可以？
You really think he's the one?

178
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,638
当然
oh, yes

179
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,745
他可以的
He's the one

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,521
快跟上，我可是活动力很强的老人
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man

181
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,260
这是实景模型陈列区
This is the Diorama Room

182
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,425
是啊

-Yeah

187
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,031
你吓到我了
You got me

188
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:21,505
说真的，别在这里干蠢事
这玩意很古老了
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old

189
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:26,705
好了
你也看得出来，最近很冷清
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days

190
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:30,609
左边是匈奴王阿提拉和匈奴人

194
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,929
是啊
Ah, yes

195
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:52,029

我该怎么办？
what do I do?

-You give me gum-gum.
-I give you gum-gum?

274
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,777
新笨笨，给我糖糖
You new dum-dum.

275
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,483

I have no gum-gum. Sorry

276

你最好跑跑躲匈匈阿提拉
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun

280
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,435
待会见了，笨笨
See you later, dum-dum

281
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,536
怎么回事？

你听不到我？
You can't...? You can't hear me?

292

匈奴人

Huns. I gotta--

297
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:04,037
（二、关好狮子
不然他们会吃了你）

298
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,039
嘿，嗨
Hey. Hi

299
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,610
大铜人，嗨，你好啊

不然他们会吃了我
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me

你是伽利略？不是？
You're Galileo? No?

Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so...

305

如果可以的话
我就看我的书
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

306
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,856
不再烦你们，好吗？
...and be out of your hair, okay?

307
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:59,884
再检查一次你的腰带
猴子可能偷走钥匙了
“Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys.”

308
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,750
猴子
Monkey

309
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,495
喂，你叫什么名字？
Hey. Hey there. Hi.

不，回来
No, no, no. come back. come back

311
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,634
德伊？那是你的名字吗？
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

312
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:17,761
不对，德威？德克斯
No, no, no. what's--? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

313
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:20,134
德克斯，把钥匙给我吧？
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

314
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:22,538
我只是想锁门
I just want to lock up

315
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:24,838
对，很好，过来找爸爸
Yes. oh, good. come to Papa

316
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:29,677

好，谢谢你
That's okay. oh, thank you

318
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:35,787
不、不，没关系
非常、非常感谢你
oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much

319
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:59,677
坏猴子！快停！
Bad monkey. Stop that

320
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:02,942
那是不对的
你尿完了？
That's not right. Are you done?

321
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:06,779
你对我有意见吗？
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

322
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:10,015
因为我就算对人有意见
我也不会乱洒尿
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

323
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:13,490
还有，我告诉你
钥匙在此
And ALso-- Let me tell you something.

324
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,794
德克斯！这不好玩！快还来！
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back

325
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,796
德克斯！快还来！
Dexter. Give--

326
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:24,999
不要，我知道你在想什么
别那么做，那主意不好
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea

327
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,731
德克斯，我需要那些纸
Not-- Dexter, I need those

328
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:30,637
别鼓励他
你以为你朋友觉得你很有趣？
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

329
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:33,872
怎么，他是头头，你们是观众？
You three guys-- what, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

330
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:35,743
别那么做
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

331
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,544
你！
Lookit-- You!

332
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:52,565
这不是真的
oh, this is not happening

333
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:03,377
老天
oh, man

334
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:31,367
你们干嘛？
what are you guys doing?

335
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,935
我嘴唇麻了
I can't feel my lip

336
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,971
糟糕
oh, shit

337
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:42,373
老天
Man

00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:19,283
把他的腿绑起来
Hog-tie him, boys

341
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:24,515
-逮住他这个大猪头

-Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
-Hey, what are you doing?

342
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:27,024
把他绑好！这下大也没用了吧
cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

343
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:29,186
住手
Hey. Hey, stop that

344
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,527
每晚，年复一年
Every night, year after year...

345
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:39,195
你们其中一个警卫
把我们锁在这些箱子里
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes

346
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:42,605
我特此声明，先生K够了！
well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

347
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,509
发动火车头
Fire up the iron horse, boys

348
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:57,284
-金发男？

-Hey, blondie?
-Name's Jedediah

349
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,449
嘉地雅，停住火车
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please

350
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:03,222
-我无能为力，卧轨男
-这是怎么回事？
-That's a big no-can-do, cracker Jack.
-what's going on here, huh?

351
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:05,628
-有人得受到惩罚
-为什么？
-Somebody's gotta pay.
-Pay for what?

352
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,635
我不知道，就是惩罚！
别叫了，冷静接受惩罚吧
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man

353
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:16,836
说真的，快停住火车
Seriously, stop the train

354
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,844
-好吧，停住火车
-谢谢
-All right, stop the train.

现在全速前进压烂他
Now fulI speed ahead and ram him!

把他的头压个稀巴烂
Split his head like a watermelon!

357
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:27,915
拜托！
For crying out loud

358
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:29,579
真是够了
All right, that's enough

359
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:32,555
有状况！
we got a breach

360
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,355
（巨人逃走了）

361
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:45,629
我逮到他了
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.

-准备投石器
-oh, my....
-Prepare the catapults

363
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:57,576
屋大维，等等，这不是你的战场
这巨人在我们的土地上
octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land

364
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:00,243
小家伙，小嘉？
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah

365
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:03,356
我不是巨人，好吗？我身材中等
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

366
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:05,219
别一副高高在上的样子！
Don't tALk down to me

367
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:08,419
我不是巨人，是你们太小了
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little

368
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:12,894
我们也许小，心却很大
we may be small,
but our hearts are large...

369
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,058
这是比喻性的说法
...metaphorically speaking

370
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:17,568
我只是说你们是很迷你
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures

371
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,640
安静！罗马帝国无所不知
Silence! The Roman Empire

-Don't you do it, son.
-Do what?

373
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,977
-屋大维！
-别做什么？
-octavius.
-Don't do what?

374
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:28,604
-展开攻击！
-不要
-Unleash hell!
-Don't--

375
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,156

376
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,422
握紧我的手，孩子
Take the hand, son

377
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,997
上马

That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

379
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:57,133
那个八字胡男
他没办法永远保护你的
That mustachioed horseman ain't ALways
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

380
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:01,672
-谢谢你
-别客气
-Thank you.
-Not at all

00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:03,009
西奥多罗斯福
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

382
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:06,415
美国第26任总统，为您效劳
...of these United States of America
at your service

383
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:11,317
我是赖瑞达理，新进夜班警卫
okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard

384
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:17,325

不过请恕我失礼
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though

385

进行猎杀
Hunt's afoot

387
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:26,937
总统先生，我能问你一些事吗？
Excuse me, Mr. President.
could I ask you something?

388
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:29,166
可以，不过就一个问题
-Yes, but just one question.
-All right

389
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:32,540
为什么？这是阿拉丁神灯吗？
okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deAL, or--?

390
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:37,580
不是的
自己才是生存的关键
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life

391
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:41,950
人要向自己的内心寻求解答
我能帮得上什么忙？
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

392
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:45,650
我不知该怎么说，请别误会
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

393
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:49,385
不过博物馆里的东西
不是应该K
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

394
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,122
一片死寂？
-...dead?
-Dead?

395
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,131
-对
-跟我来
-Yeah.
-Follow me

396
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,597
随你叫吧，法老王
Yell all you want, pharaoh

397
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:03,733
你待54年了，今晚出不去的
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight

398
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:06,809
那是一切混乱的根源
There's the source of all this commotion

399
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:10,212
阿卡曼拉刻写板
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah

400
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:14,979
1952年尼罗河探险后被送到此
Arrived here in 1 952
from the Nile expedition

401
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:21,359
就在当晚
博物馆里的一切都活了过来
on that night,
everything in this museum came to life

402
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:24,020
之后每晚也都如此
And every night since

403
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,972
博物馆里的一切每晚都复活？
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

404
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,630
没错
Exactly

405
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:36,837
那我该做些什么？
And I'm supposed to do what?

406
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:42,108
你是守夜者，劳伦斯
这机构里最值得尊敬的职位
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution

407
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:47,181
-走吧
-好了，这是不可能的
-come on, lad.
-All right. okay. This is impossible

408
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:49,879
没有不可能的事，梦想也能成真
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done

409
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:53,322
所以巨大的胡狼神瞪着你，别看他
Hence the 20-foot jackAL staring at you.
Don't make eye contact

410
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:56,895
你的工作是确保大家待在博物馆
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

411
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:59,692
当太阳出来，要是有人在外面
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

412
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,926
我们就会化为尘埃
...we turn to dust

413
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:04,869
-尘埃？
-尘埃
-You turn to dust?
-Dust

414
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,802
-真的？
-真的
-Really?
-Really

415
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:10,409
天快亮了，我帮你恢复秩序吧
Now, it's ALmost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight

416
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:14,139
不过这是我最后一次这么做
明白吗？
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

417
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:18,748
明白，我想是吧
我想我不K
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't...

418
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,889
别唠叨，明白还是不明白？
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

419
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,723
-明白
-很好
-Yes.
-Good

420
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,381
我们动身吧
Let's ride

421
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:39,504
好，爬虫动物厅很安全
All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure

422
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:49,443
你在找什么？
what are you looking at?

423
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,485
我在K追踪
I'm tracking, dear boy

424
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:58,489
有个人必须要追踪
欢迎来到这个大家庭
Man's got to track.
welcome to the family, Lawrence

425
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,519
明晚见了
See you tomorrow night

426
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:04,460
说真的，我怀疑我会再来
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back

427
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,896
什么？你才刚开始呢
what? You've only just begun

428
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:09,502
这不是我想要的
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what I--

429
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,864
-劳伦斯？
-是
-Lawrence?
-Yeah?

430
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,165
你之前是做什么的？
what did you do
before you took this post?

431
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:17,437
很多，我发明过“啪哒弹指器”
well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper

432
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:19,204
你也放弃发明了？
Did you give up on that as well?

433
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,611
不，我只是碰上了一些障碍
你听说过“拍掌器”吗？
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The clapper?

434
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:23,977
-劳伦斯？
-是，先生
-Lawrence.
-Yes, sir?

435
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:29,589
有些英雄造时势
有些时势造英雄
Some men are born great.
others have greatness thrust upon them

436
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:33,791
对你来说，这正是你的时机
For you, this is that very moment

437
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:03,153
妙啊！唬到你了，孩子
Bully. Got you, boy

438
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:04,814
是啊，你是唬到我了
Yeah. You got me

439
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:10,928
跟你的小小朋友打招呼吧
Say hello to your little friend

440
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,429
-你干嘛？
-放我下来
-what are you doing?
-Put me down

441
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,763
我不喜欢被人抓着
I don't like to be manhandled

442
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:20,134
-冷静点
-这感觉很不好
-Just cALm down, Jed.
-It doesn't feel good

443
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:23,903
-让我觉得自己渺小又无力
-说完没？
-It makes me feel small and powerless.
-You done?

444
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:28,538
我要射你的眼睛
射瞎你的狗眼
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye

445
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,582
继续射啊，根本不会有事
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen

446
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:34,220
你现在知道我丢脸的地方了
Now you know my shame

447
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:39,883
嘉地雅无能，他的枪没用
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away

448
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:42,621
还没完呢，你等着瞧吧
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me

449
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:44,856
我不想听了，好吗？
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

450
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,590
蹲下！
Duck!

451
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:52,432
个子越大，摔的越重
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

452
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:54,096
这工作给的钟点费也太低了
This is not worth 1 1 .50 an hour

453
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:57,870
巨人好怕，有更大的东西在跑耶
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around

454
00:41:35,483 --> 00:41:37,246
喂！
Hello

455
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:38,976
赖瑞？
Larry?

456
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:42,388
赖瑞？
Larry?

457
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:51,028
别那样，我们年纪大不经吓
oh, don't do that.
we're too old for surprises

458
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:54,167
我以为你们喜欢惊喜
像你们给我的惊喜
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

459
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:56,769
像博物馆的东西晚上都会活过来
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night

460
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:58,868
真是太有趣了
That little sweetheart

461
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,599
你根本不会相信我们的
we wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us

462
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,937
-你们知道我昨晚怎么过的吗？
-什么？
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-what?

463
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:08,013
-你们知道我昨晚怎么过的吗？
-安静点，胆小鬼
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-Keep a lid on it, butterscotch

464
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:12,117
听着，我不知道那是真的假的
但我没同意要参一脚
I don't know if what happened last night
was reAL, but I didn't sign up for this

465
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:16,313
我只是需要一份正常工作
没生命危险，又能应付开销
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills

466
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,187
所以感谢你们
我把制服留在办公室里
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

467
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:22,727
-我把制服留在办公室，再见
-赖瑞！
-...and I will be seeing you.
-Larry!

468
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:31,104
-爸？
-嘿
-Dad?
-Hey

469
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:33,570
小子，你来这干嘛？
Hey, buddy.
what are you guys doing here?

470
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:37,575
雅莉要去法院
所以我带大人物先生去学校
oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school

471
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:40,043
他想来看你的新工作
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job

472
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:43,509
你在这里工作真棒
It's so awesome
that you're working here

473
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:46,776
小家伙，要不要进去看看？
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

474
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:48,922
也许你爸会给你贵宝级的导览
Maybe your dad will give you a vIP tour

475
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:51,523
其实，我们今天早上很忙
You know what?
we're pretty slammed this morning

476
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:56,152
不过尼克，我保证
我很快就带你来参观，好吗？
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? DeAL?

477
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:57,796
-好
-很好
-DeAL.
-All right

478
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,223
-拜，爸爸
-拜
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye

479
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:02,062
-我爱你
-我也爱你，小乖
-Love you.
-Love you too, buddy

480
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:04,033
-再见
-好
Bye, now. All right

481
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:35,561
赖瑞
Hey, Larry

482
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:38,204
我就再试一个晚上吧
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night

483
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:40,363
我很高兴，欢迎回来
I'm glad you came around.
welcome back

484
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,635
你！晚班警卫，马上过来
You. New night guard, here, now

485
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,010
-怎么了？
-“怎么了？”
-what's up?
-“what's up?”

486
00:43:54,188 --> 00:43:57,715
跟我走，我带你去看，  “怎么了先生”
oh, well, take a wALk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. “what's up?”

487
00:43:57,892 --> 00:43:59,325
来
come on

488
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:05,458
麻烦你解释这是怎么回事？
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

489
00:44:08,302 --> 00:44:10,600
好，这个嘛
okay. I'm guessing--

490
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:14,872
我猜，我也只是猜想啦
And I'm just spitbALling here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

491
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,605
不过我想
罗马人太狂妄，跑进大西部
...and climbed over into the wild west

492
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:21,907
牛仔知道罗马人想夺取他的地盘
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

493
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:24,573
所以就把他架上示众O
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade

494
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,018
笑吧，搞笑夜班警卫
“Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard.”

495
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:31,981
答案是不对
“No” is the answer

496
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,720
我这是挖苦你的烂幽默感
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box

497
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,624
我没笑
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

498
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:41,494
我是假笑，如果那是你想要的
你想比幽默
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor

499
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:43,091
是吗？
Do you?

500
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:46,505
不是的
No

501
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:49,835
我并不想比幽默
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor

502
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,945
当然，因为那样你会一败涂地
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath

503
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:55,538
大角山战役并不好笑
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn

504
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:02,518
我认为那跟追星族一样可笑
No. I find it about as funny
as a “fancist.”

505
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:08,253
这不好笑，好吗？
我不会容许这么过份的K
It's not funny. okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant...

506
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,222
要是我没说清楚，告诉我
If I'm not clear, tell me

507
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:15,966
我说清楚了吗？
Am I clear?

508
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,098
是啊
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

509
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:24,107
克西？
Hey, cecil?

510
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:28,143
那本指令手册你有备份吗？
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manuAL?

511
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:32,411
-恐怕没有
-我告诉你该怎么做吧
oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do

512
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:35,146
去看一些书，重温历史
Read some books.
Brush up on your history

513
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:37,586
我刚来时，那对我助益很大
Helped me a lot when I first started out

514
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:43,060
这间博物馆是献给那个骑马的人
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

515
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,754
西奥多罗斯福
...President Theodore Roosevelt

516
00:45:44,932 --> 00:45:48,993
他喜爱历史
也相信人越明t过去
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

517
00:45:49,169 --> 00:45:52,070
就更能准备好迎接未来
...the better prepared you are
for the future

518
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:57,169
好了，谁能告诉我这间是什么？
okay, kids. who can tell me
what this room's called?

519
00:45:57,344 --> 00:45:59,744
很好，非洲哺乳动物陈列室
very good. The Hall of African MammALs

520
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:02,746
这是丛林之王，狮子
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion

521
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,446
上面是我最喜欢的动物之一
僧帽猴
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey

522
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:12,581
一种具有高度智慧的灵长类
以其仁慈慷慨的天性闻名
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature

523
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,861
抱歉？
Excuse me?

524
00:46:18,032 --> 00:46:21,024
我只是觉得K
I just thought that was...

525
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:23,897
我只是有同感的笑出来
I just was laughing in agreement

526
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:27,869
快乐的猴子
Happy monkey

527
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:31,406
好了，孩子们，往这边来
All right, kids. This way

528
00:46:36,717 --> 00:46:38,844
我告诉你
我才不买帐
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it

529
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:42,511
你骗的了小孩，骗不了我
你骗不倒我的
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me

530
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,091
等着瞧吧，好戏即将登场
can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy

531
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,750
好戏即将登场
There's a storm coming

532
00:46:50,663 --> 00:46:53,894
历史上最有名的追踪者之一
莎卡佳哩
one of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

533
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:57,332
她引领路易斯和克拉克
找到太平洋
...who led Lewis and clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific ocean

534
00:46:57,504 --> 00:47:00,769
你们也许听过这句话
“坐而言不如起而行”
You guys have heard the saying,
“Actions speak louder than words.”

535
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,965
但他们写K
And yet they wrote--

536
00:47:03,143 --> 00:47:05,873
-是的，达理先生？
-她是聋子吗？
-Yes, Mr. Daley?
-Yes. was she deaf?

537
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:10,776
聋？不，她不是
was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

538
00:47:10,984 --> 00:47:16,445
因为她看来有点K
没反应
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive

539
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:18,352
那是因为她是一尊雕像
That's because she's a statue

540
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:24,193
等我一下
去看看她吧，她很酷的
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool

541
00:47:26,232 --> 00:47:28,666
-你这是干嘛？
-既然我每晚都要待在这
-what are you doing?
-I'm gonna be here every night

542
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,497
我想认识我所守卫的东西
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding

543
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:34,039
事实上，我有一堆问题
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions

544
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,903
等你休息，我能请你喝咖啡吗？
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

545
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:38,407
喝咖啡？
A cup of coffee?

546
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:42,139
对，纯粹是同事对同事
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

547
00:47:42,382 --> 00:47:45,476
资讯交流那类的咖啡
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee

548
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,577
过二十分钟再见
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside

549
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:50,245
-谢谢你
-不客气
-Thank you.
-You're welcome

550
00:47:50,423 --> 00:47:53,221
-希望你有个好的K
-好了，孩子们
-And have a good rest of your--
-All right. okay, kids

551
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,821
她很厉害
It was incredible what she did

552
00:47:55,995 --> 00:47:59,192
她引领这些人跋山涉水
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

553
00:47:59,365 --> 00:48:02,926
她身上还背着孩子
她是终极的职业母亲
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother

554
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:05,434
你真是莎卡假哩专家
wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert

555
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:07,835
-是莎卡佳哩
-莎卡佳哩？
-Sakagawean.
-Sakagawean?

556
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:12,101
这是自然的
我这篇论文准备了四年
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years

557
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:16,214
四年写一篇论文？
是我铁定会抓狂
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy

558
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:20,079
其实那比较像是一本九百页的书
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book

559
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:25,046
你呢？你从小就立志当警卫？
So, what's your story? Have you
ALways wanted to be a security guard?

560
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:29,089
-我不是故意K
-不、不
-oh, I didn't mean to--
-No, no, no

561
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:33,096
我离婚了，还有个十岁大的儿子
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 1 0-year-old son...

562
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:37,066
我需要更稳定一点的生活
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation

563
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:40,263
懂了，你想知道馆里什么事？
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

564
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,466
匈奴王阿提拉
他是怎么搞的？
okay, Attila the Hun.
what is that guy's problem?

565
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:46,703
他是唯一威胁过罗马帝国的人
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire

566
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:50,146
人称“恐怖魔王”
Known as the 'Scourge of God' ...

567
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:54,878
阿提拉和他的手下
常将无助的受害者五马分尸
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims

568
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:59,288
他以迷信著称
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs

569
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:03,520
身旁围绕着巫师和术士
He surrounded himself with a phALanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

570
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:06,927
他们以黑魔法迷惑指使他
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts

571
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:17,266
（复活岛）

572
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:23,038
（大西部驿马车）

573
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,913
（罗马战争策略）

574
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:01,109
赖瑞？
Larry?

575
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:03,082
我只想祝你好运
Just wanted to say good Iuck, son

576
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,848
还有再见，这是我们最后一晚
And goodbye.
we're clocking out for the last time

577
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:07,617
到了波卡，来找我们
If you're ever in Boca, look us up

578
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:10,991
你们要出城？
万一这一切不顺利呢？
wait, you guys are going out of town?
what if this doesn't work out?

579
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:13,689
你这么聪明，一定没问题的
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine

580
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:18,394
打个电话就能找到我们
送我们出去吧
Yeah. we'll just be a phone call away.
come on, wALk us out

581
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:21,438
你们先走
You fellas go ahead

582
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:24,303
我需要独处一下
I need a moment

583
00:50:24,477 --> 00:50:29,141
他很感伤
这房里有许多回忆
He's very emotionAL.
A lot of memories in this room

584
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,498
好好玩吧，大个子
Go crazy, big guy

585
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,340
你们好
Hey, guys

586
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:36,482
找火？
Quest for fire...

587
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:40,180
搞定
自己找乐子吧
...over. Knock yourselves out

588
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:43,352
早安，笨笨
Morning, dum-dum

589
00:51:43,523 --> 00:51:47,220
我不笨笨，你笨笨
你有糖糖吗？
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

590
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:51,454
有，大头呆，很多糖糖
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum

591
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:16,381
什么？
我听不见，玻璃挡住了
what's that?
I can't hear you through the glass

592
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,883
抱歉
Sorry

593
00:52:20,493 --> 00:52:22,188
用力拉！
Heave

594
00:52:22,662 --> 00:52:25,597
用力拉！
Heave. Heave

595
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:28,325
怎么回事？
Hey, what's going on over here?

596
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:30,833
不扩张，就得死
we expand or we die

597
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:33,298
用力拉！
Heave

598
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:34,997
数到三
-Heave.
-on the count of three...

599
00:52:35,174 --> 00:52:38,610
就炸翻这个蚁丘
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come

600
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:42,579
嘉地雅，住手
-And a one and a two--
-Hey, Jed. Stop that

601
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,583
别这样，你炸山
只是在炸墙
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall

602
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:51,087
别管闲事，巨怪
我们要建铁道，要炸山洞
Step aside, Gigantor. we got us a railroad
to build. we're blowing a hole in that thing

603
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:54,590
第一，别再叫我什么巨怪了
okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

604
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:58,060
-我只想停止这一切
-我们就是要炸
-I'm just trying to close up shop.
-we're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

605
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:03,594
是啊，碰，了不起
你干嘛？
Yeah. what are you doing?

606
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:07,031
这像干嘛？这是天命
what's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny

607
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:11,006
你无法与之抗衡，我也一样
再多用点火药
You can't fight it and neither can I.
Go! More dynamite

608
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,678
-对，全用了
-好啊，很好
-Yeah, use it all.
-All right. okay

609
00:53:13,846 --> 00:53:16,508
听着，屋大尾？你得停止那样
Listen, “octavus”? You gotta stop that

610
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:18,616
我叫屋大维，赖皮
It's octavius, mary

611
00:53:18,785 --> 00:53:22,448
好吧，来，事情就会变成这样
okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens

612
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:24,852
你不能这样，我是罗马将军
-You cannot do this. I am a Roman generAL.
-Sorry

613
00:53:25,024 --> 00:53:26,286
-我有权利
-还有你
-I have rights.
-And you

614
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:28,950
-嘿，不，放我下来
-继续攻
-Hey, no! Put me down!
-Keep heaving, men

615
00:53:29,128 --> 00:53:30,425
我会回来的，我发誓
You can't stop progress!

616
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:32,791
我们要谈一谈
we're gonna have a little tALk, okay?

617
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,967
我说过我不喜欢被人抓着
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled

618
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:39,730
不，我要抓着你
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys

619
00:53:39,906 --> 00:53:42,466
你们到底是怎样？
为什么老处不来？
what is your problem, huh?
why can't you just get ALong?

620
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,040
我们是男人，我们战斗，就这样
Look, we're men. we fight, okay?
That's what we do

621
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,803
我们都这样杀时间
It's kind of how we pass the time

622
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:51,346
你是巨人、怪胎
你没办法了解的
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
we can't expect you to understand that

623
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:54,645
空间很大，你们不用腻在一起
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other

624
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:59,485
-什么？你是说
-你要让我们出去？
-what, you mean...?
-You're gonna let us out?

625
00:54:00,026 --> 00:54:02,392
四处闲逛？
what, and just roam free?

626
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:05,689
有可能，只要你们保证不乱来
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave

627
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:08,993
那表示没火花、没爆炸
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

628
00:54:09,168 --> 00:54:10,396
我敢起誓，主人
You have my word, my liege

629
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,232
是啊，没问题，巨怪
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor

630
00:54:13,406 --> 00:54:17,308
首先，我的名字叫赖瑞
阿嘉
My name's Larry, first of all. okay, Jed?

631
00:54:17,476 --> 00:54:20,206
我叫你阿嘉，不叫你小人
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

632
00:54:20,379 --> 00:54:21,937
那是什么意思？
what's that supposed to mean?

633
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:27,711
-小鬼头，如何？
-我不喜欢，我很受伤
-“Hey, Teeny.” How does that sound?
-I don't like it. It hurts my feelings

634
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,617
“巨怪”也让我觉得像怪胎
“Gigantor” makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so...

635
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,258
我不会那样，我就叫你赖瑞
I don't. I just call you Larry

636
00:54:33,426 --> 00:54:35,417
少谄媚了
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

637
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:37,426
我现在信任你们
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

638
00:54:37,597 --> 00:54:41,033
你们要是不听我的话
就会跟小马雅人一样
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there

639
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:43,293
被关起来，你们看
Locked up. Take a look

640
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:46,666
-他们看来高兴吗？
-不
-Do they look happy?
-No

641
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:49,272
他们看来很难过
They look sad

642
00:54:49,442 --> 00:54:52,502
因为他们不能为所欲为
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

643
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:55,909
现在我给你们一点自由
别让我失望
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

644
00:54:56,082 --> 00:55:00,246
我得走了，好好相处，好吗？
好，谢了
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
okay. Good. Thanks

645
00:55:01,988 --> 00:55:04,218
笨笨，糖糖好吃吗？
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

646
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:05,721
好吃
Good

647
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:11,926
德克斯，我要锁了，要进来吗？
oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

648
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,191
很好
Yeah?

649
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,394
好吧
All right

650
00:55:24,377 --> 00:55:26,277
什么？你拿了我的钥匙？
what's that? You got my keys?

651
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,280
我可不这么想
I don't think so

652
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:36,712
看来老赖瑞骗过小德克斯了
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie

653
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,880
那是给小宝宝玩的玩具钥匙
Those are baby keys for a little baby

654
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:41,253
好好玩吧，小猴子
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey

655
00:55:41,427 --> 00:55:44,863
也许明天我会带纸尿布给你
你可以拿来便便
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it

656
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:47,363
我会搔搔你的痒
因为你是可爱的小猴子
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby

657
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:52,334
赖瑞叔叔骗你，你要哭整晚吗？
while you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

658
00:55:52,805 --> 00:55:54,830
我说过好戏即将登场
I told you there was a storm coming

659
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:04,478
-你好，泰迪
-劳伦斯
-Hey, Teddy.
-Lawrence

660
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,244
你这个没礼貌的小子
我就知道你会回来
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back

661
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:11,149
-你看来身负重任
-我准备再试一次
-You look like a man on a mission.
-Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot

662
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:21,659
-你
-什么K
-You...?
-what?

663
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:25,133
-你在打量她？
-真敢说
-You checking her out?
-The nerve

664
00:56:25,304 --> 00:56:28,296
打量，我没听过这种说法
checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing

665
00:56:28,474 --> 00:56:32,410
不，我是说，她很美
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful

666
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:34,307
-美？
-是啊
-Beautiful?
-Yeah

667
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:40,978
-我认为是个俊俏的女人
-是啊
-Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
-Yeah

668
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,980
也许你该去跟她说个话
I don't know,
maybe you should go tALk to her

669
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:46,750
是啊！
祝福你，小子
-Indeed. Bless you, lad.
-Yeah. All right

670
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,793
-继续加油吧
-好，再见
-carry on.
-Good. See you

671
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:08,675
我K
I...

672
00:57:56,395 --> 00:57:58,056
嘿，嗨
Hey, hi

673
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:02,359
不，没关系
没关系，你们会说英文吗？
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

674
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:03,894
不会？
No?

675
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,400
是啊，我不知道那是什么意思
Right. I don't know what that means...

676
00:58:08,574 --> 00:58:12,670
不过我知道我们一开始就没搞好
但是K
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

677
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,244
有只小鸟告诉我，有人喜欢
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

678
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:21,314
魔法
...magic

679
00:58:21,487 --> 00:58:24,422
-魔法？
-魔法
-Magic?
-Magic

680
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:26,952
巫术
Sorcery

681
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:28,658
巫术
Ah, sorcer--

682
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:31,262
对，幻术
Yes. llIusion

683
00:58:31,597 --> 00:58:33,087
大家都喜欢魔法
Everybody likes magic

684
00:58:33,265 --> 00:58:37,224
还有花，人们都喜欢花
And flowers. People like flowers

685
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:38,927
那些是给你的
There you go. Those are for you

686
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:41,665
人们还喜欢什么？钱
You know what else people like?
Money

687
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:46,210
无所不能的金钱
但金钱有时候会K
The ALmighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

688
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:48,444
不见
...disappear

689
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,274
至少我是这么K
At least that's what I...

690
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:55,214
听说的
...hear

691
00:58:56,822 --> 00:59:00,553
难怪你不懂我的话，你耳里有钱
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear

692
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:06,625
你们看，有人需要手帕吗？
check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

693
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:11,300
我不建议拿这条小手帕
因为这顽皮的家伙
well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

694
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,130
会凭空消失
...of vanishing...

695
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:18,210
不要，那会穿帮K
...into thin air!

696
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:21,477
别五马分尸，各位
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

697
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:43,665
拜托，别五马分尸
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs

698
01:00:00,186 --> 01:00:02,017
蔻蒂兹，对吧？
cortes, right?

699
01:00:18,037 --> 01:00:19,265
怎么会？
How?

700
01:00:21,707 --> 01:00:24,574
想都别想
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

701
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:26,911
德克斯
Dexter!

702
01:00:37,389 --> 01:00:38,879
拜托你们
come on, guys!

703
01:01:04,316 --> 01:01:05,874
喂，你们
Hey, guys!

704
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:12,853
嘿，两位K
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

705
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:16,627
抱歉，怎么回事？
Sorry. what's going on?
what happened here?

706
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:18,126
你们在干嘛？
我们不是讲好了？
I thought we had a deAL

707
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:20,527
我们永远无法忍受这些小丑
we will never coexist
with these buffoons

708
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:22,633
承诺已成过去，小赖
we're past words, Laredo

709
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:25,861
该让手上的家伙说话了
Now it's time to let Smith & wesson
do the tALking!

710
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:27,335
那玩意根本没用
Those guns don't even work

711
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:29,770
是吗？你看着
They don't? Take a look at this

712
01:01:32,878 --> 01:01:34,106
德克斯！
Dexter!

713
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:24,791
为什么？
why?

714
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,763
德克斯
Ho! Dexter

715
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,372
你无路可逃了，小毛猴
End of the line, cool breeze

716
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,383
无路可逃
End of the line

717
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,500
我可不是闹着玩的
I am not playing games here

718
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:12,370
快给我
Just hand them over

719
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:19,880
小心，很好，德克斯
Easy. That's it, Dexter

720
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:22,213
慢慢来，就是这样
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it

721
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,970
老天，你干嘛打猴子？
Good Lord, Lawrence!
why are you slapping a monkey?

722
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,878
这家伙一直惹我，我受够了
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

723
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:54,109
胡说，这小家伙是你的远亲
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother

724
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:56,083
没有他，就没有我们
without him, there's no us

725
01:03:56,622 --> 01:03:57,919
你得了狂犬病啦？
Are you rabid?

726
01:03:58,123 --> 01:03:59,750
把泡泡擦干净
wipe that off

727
01:04:00,492 --> 01:04:03,120
你得对这小家伙展现爱和尊重
You have to deAL with this creature
with love and respect

728
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:05,126
朋友，可以把钥匙给我吗？
May I have the keys, dear friend?

729
01:04:06,598 --> 01:04:08,998
-谢谢
-劳伦斯？
Thank you. Lawrence?

730
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:13,936
你似乎很清楚该怎么做
well, you know what?You seem to know what you're doing

731
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:15,572
所以我就让你接手
so I'm gonna let you take over

732
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:18,801
你不能现在就举白旗
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now

733
01:04:18,977 --> 01:04:20,968
博物馆正濒临无政府状态
The museum is on the verge
of totAL anarchy

734
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:22,875
我试过了，我今晚回来了
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't I?

735
01:04:23,048 --> 01:04:26,415
就一晚，我也建不好巴拿马运河
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama canAL in one day

736
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:29,781
很好，但这是史上最荒谬的工作
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history

737
01:04:29,955 --> 01:04:31,513
有些英雄造时势
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

738
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,124
是，我知道，泰迪
有些时势造英雄
Yeah, I know. others have
greatness thrust upon them

739
01:04:34,393 --> 01:04:36,224
你昨晚就说过那句话了
You hit me with that chestnut
last night

740
01:04:36,395 --> 01:04:38,920
不过不是每个人都是英雄
The thing is, not everyone is great

741
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:41,691
有些人只是普通人
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary

742
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,528
你不是，别再顾影自怜了
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity

743
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:46,898
每个伟大的旅程
都是由第一步开始
Every journey begins with a footstep

744
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:49,836
要是你能教导居民和平相处
他们就不用被关起来了
Teach the inhabitants to get ALong,
they wouldn't need to be locked up

745
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:53,068
-夜复一夜的
-这话出自花五十年偷看女人
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

746
01:04:53,245 --> 01:04:55,509
却不敢开口的人口中，还真有用
...spying on a girl he's never even
tALked to

747
01:04:56,315 --> 01:04:59,307
我本来要去跟她说话的，拜托
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please

748
01:05:00,152 --> 01:05:01,983
我受够了，好吗？
I'm done, all right?

749
01:05:06,325 --> 01:05:09,556
不，笨龙
No, Rexy! No!

750
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:43,286
不！
oh, no

751
01:06:46,592 --> 01:06:48,423
好吧
All right

752
01:06:57,502 --> 01:07:01,302
没人会再来这了
何况我二年级就来过了
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley

753
01:07:01,473 --> 01:07:03,873
我爸会给我们私人导览的
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up

754
01:07:04,176 --> 01:07:06,474
-达理先生？
-是
-Mr. Daley?
-Yeah?

755
01:07:07,946 --> 01:07:09,846
-泡沫
-是啊，我知道
-Foam.
-Yes, I know

756
01:07:10,048 --> 01:07:11,345
在尼安德塔人展示区里！
In the NeanderthAL display

757
01:07:11,516 --> 01:07:14,485
昨天晚上
灭火器出了点状况
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher

758
01:07:14,653 --> 01:07:16,280
我正要去清理
I was on my way to go clean it up

759
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:18,923
不用麻烦，你被炒了
okay, don't bother. You're fired

760
01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:22,921
今天没得参观了
I don't think we're getting a tour today

761
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:25,120
你爸刚被炒了
Your dad just got canned, dude

762
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:28,657
抱歉
Excuse me?

763
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:30,626
麦菲先生？
Mr. McPhee?

764
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:32,936
抱歉，麦菲先生？
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

765
01:07:33,105 --> 01:07:35,437
我能跟你谈一谈吗？
can I tALk to you about this, please?

766
01:07:35,607 --> 01:07:36,733
-先生？
-干嘛？
-Sir?
-what?

767
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:39,809
我错了，但我现在知道该怎么做了
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job

768
01:07:39,978 --> 01:07:43,106
-你显然是不知道
-我本来不知，但现在知道了
-You obviously don't.
-No, I didn't, but now I do

769
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:46,045
-真的，麦菲先生
-博士
-Really, Mr. McPhee--
-Doctor

770
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:48,649
麦菲博士
Dr. McPhee

771
01:07:49,588 --> 01:07:51,488
你能再给我一个晚上吗？
can you please give me one more night?

772
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:56,421
-就再一晚
-好，谢谢
-one more night.
-okay, thank you

773
01:07:56,595 --> 01:07:59,928
要是你当班之后
And if anything is the tiniest...

774
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,861
有任何事发生
...after your shift:

775
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,167
因为K
Because...

776
01:08:09,174 --> 01:08:10,869
-我t
-好吗？
-Got it.
-okay?

777
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:14,774
骗我一次，是我丢脸
骗我两次
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

778
01:08:19,951 --> 01:08:22,852
是我丢脸K我丢脸
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me

779
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:25,784
-你
-骗我两次，我t
-You.
-Fool me twice.... Got it

780
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:28,482
-接不接受随你
-好，谢谢
-Take it or leave it.
-okay. Thank you

781
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:34,525
-嘿
-嘿
-Hey.
-Hey

782
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,828
-怎么了？
-也许你该去问尼克
-what's wrong?
-Maybe you should ask Nicky

783
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:43,102
小子，怎么回事？
Hey, buddy. what's going on?

784
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:45,267
你被炒了
You got fired

785
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:47,872
什么？我并没有被炒啊
what are you tALking about?
I didn't get fired

786
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:53,115
我今早去了博物馆
你老板对你大吼
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you

787
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:56,987
你怎么没告诉我？
一切都没事
why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine

788
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:58,986
没事，我们只是有点误会
we just had a little misunderstanding

789
01:08:59,157 --> 01:09:00,556
为什么？
why?

790
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,919
很难解释，我是说
你不会相信K
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

791
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:09,190
这样吧，我就让你见识一下
You know what? Let me show you

792
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:11,865
-见识什么？
-跟我一起去上班
-Show me what?
-come to work with me tonight

793
01:09:12,037 --> 01:09:13,368
赖瑞？
Larry?

794
01:09:13,538 --> 01:09:16,234
我能跟你谈一谈吗？
can I tALk to you for a second?

795
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:20,674
我有麻烦吗？
Am I in trouble?

796
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:22,609
赖瑞，你在干嘛？
Larry, what are you doing?

797
01:09:22,814 --> 01:09:25,146
我想让他看看我的工作
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all

798
01:09:25,317 --> 01:09:28,343
我很高兴你想和他分享，可是
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

799
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,047
我不认为尼克能再次承受失望
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment

800
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:35,017
他不会失望的
He won't be disappointed

801
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,058
赖瑞
Larry

802
01:09:37,629 --> 01:09:39,597
他不会失望的
He won't be disappointed

803
01:09:45,737 --> 01:09:48,228
在警卫室等到大家离开
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone

804
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:50,306
-之后我就会来找你，好吗？
-好
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

805
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:13,726
小姐？我得请你离开本馆
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises

806
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,196
你好
-Hey there.
-Hey

807
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:19,996
-很棒的沉思之地
-是啊
-Good place to think, huh?
-Yeah. Definitely

808
01:10:21,139 --> 01:10:23,630
今晚没约会啊？
So no big plans tonight?

809
01:10:23,809 --> 01:10:26,642
我不大喜欢约会
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person

810
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:29,742
我喜欢跟已死之人相处
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years

811
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:31,542
活人令我困惑
It's the live ones that throw me

812
01:10:31,716 --> 01:10:35,550
但说真的，你得走了
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave

813
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:38,656
-认真的？
-抱歉，博物馆的规定
-Seriously?
-Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules

814
01:10:38,824 --> 01:10:40,621
我们要把一切都锁起来
we're sort of locking everything up

815
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:43,989
你很认真执行你的工作
You're really taking your job seriously

816
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:47,563
我一戴上领带，就很认真
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business

817
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:48,926
-我明白了
-好
-I get it.
-Yeah

818
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,931
论文进度如何？
How's that dissertation coming?

819
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:55,603
我遇上瓶颈了
研究只能让我到此为止
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far

820
01:10:55,774 --> 01:10:57,674
我永远不会认识真正的她
I'm never gonna know
who she really was

821
01:10:58,343 --> 01:11:02,507
我想我该研究别的主题了
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject

822
01:11:03,114 --> 01:11:04,809
我就让你继续工作吧
I'll let you get back to work

823
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:10,045
-晚安，赖瑞
-好K
-Good night, Larry.
-Yeah, okay

824
01:11:10,255 --> 01:11:12,086
晚安
Night

825
01:11:19,197 --> 01:11:20,596
嘿

826
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,827

827
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:28,601
-嘿，贝嘉
-嘿
-Hey, Rebecca.
-Hey

828
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:32,004
我不认为你该放弃你的论文
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper

829
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,007
好吧，为什么？
okay. why?

830
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,943
这听起来可能有点疯狂
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

831
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:39,709
听起来真的很疯狂
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy

832
01:11:39,885 --> 01:11:42,581
-好吧
-我是说超疯狂的疯狂
-okay.
-No, I mean insanely crazy

833
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:44,381
-我能接受
-好
-I can handle it.
-okay

834
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:49,121
你知道在某些博物馆里
历史会栩栩如生
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

835
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:52,161
-是啊
-在这间博物馆里
-Yeah.
-In this museum...

836
01:11:53,031 --> 01:11:54,555
一切真的活了过来
...it actually does

837
01:11:56,368 --> 01:11:57,995
你在胡说什么？
what are you tALking about?

838
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:06,911
这馆内的一切在晚上都会活过来
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night

839
01:12:10,415 --> 01:12:13,543
-真的？
-是真的，我没骗你
-Really?
-Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you

840
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:15,845
你知道阿卡曼拉刻写板吧？
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

841
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:18,990
它让一切活过来
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell

842
01:12:19,157 --> 01:12:21,887
自它来了以后，一切都活了过来
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life

843
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:27,157
泰迪罗斯福跟我说的
真的！那只猴子，德克斯？
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

844
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,300
-他是什么来着？僧帽猴
-僧帽猴
-what is he?
-capuchin

845
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:32,265
他咬了我的鼻子
还在我身上撒了尿
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose

846
01:12:33,204 --> 01:12:37,140
莎卡佳哩在柜子里，每晚都复活
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

847
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:39,504
聆听路易斯和克拉克吵嘴
...just listening to Lewis and clark
argue

848
01:12:39,678 --> 01:12:42,112
所以你要是想了解她
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

849
01:12:43,515 --> 01:12:45,380
我能帮你安排
...I can hook that up

850
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:48,180
真是太棒了
That's cool

851
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:51,481
是啊，是很棒，棒呆了
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome

852
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,793
嘲笑历史学者
Make fun of the history geek

853
01:12:57,762 --> 01:13:00,629
-不是的，贝嘉
-晚安，赖瑞
-No. Rebecca!
-Good night, Larry

854
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:05,465
我不是在嘲笑你，贝嘉？
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca

855
01:13:16,448 --> 01:13:18,916
-馆内的最佳座位
-怎么回事？
-Here you go. Best seat in the house.
-what's going on?

856
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:22,281
-用说的你不会信，我让你自己看
-什么？
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you

857
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:25,354
你再过20秒就会看到了
-what?
-You'll see in about 20 seconds

858
01:13:25,523 --> 01:13:27,514
-你喜欢暴龙吧？
-喜欢
-okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
-Yeah

859
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:29,990
我叫他小龙
Yeah? well, I call him Rexy

860
01:13:30,161 --> 01:13:34,655
他就快活过来了，儿子
再过
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

861
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:42,029
五、四、三、二
...five, four, three, two...

862
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,648
-爸？
-等一下
-Dad?
-Hang on a sec

863
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:55,217
跟小龙打声招呼吧
Say hello to Rexy!

864
01:13:56,388 --> 01:13:57,582
爸，你没事吧？
Dad, are you okay?

865
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:01,382
怪了
This is weird

866
01:14:01,559 --> 01:14:03,686
大家出来啊！
Guys! come on!

867
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:06,060
太阳下山了
Sundown!

868
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:11,635
总统，起床了，我要你醒来
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up

869
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:13,896
我儿子来了，醒醒啊

I need you to wake up

870
01:14:14,072 --> 01:14:17,200

快跑，德克萨斯
Get on, Texas! Get up

872
01:14:19,444 --> 01:14:21,571
别闹了，好吗？
Just stop, okay?

873
01:14:21,746 --> 01:14:25,204
尼克
我告诉你，那里有个板子
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

874
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:27,442
阿卡曼拉刻写板
called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

875
01:14:27,652 --> 01:14:30,314
-这下又有个板子了？
-是啊
-Now there's a tablet?
-Yeah, there is

876
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:32,046
拜托，爸

-什么不见了？
-It's gone.
-what's gone?

879
01:14:41,733 --> 01:14:45,191
板子，我想有人偷走了它
The tablet. I think somebody stole it

880
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,265
是啊
Yeah, right

881
01:14:47,572 --> 01:14:49,267
我不是开玩笑的，儿子
I'm not kidding, Nicky

882
01:14:52,911 --> 01:14:54,276
尼克？

883
01:14:56,214 --> 01:14:58,182
嘿，尼克
Hey, Nicky!

嘿，尼克，你要去哪？

886
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:11,428
走吧

887
01:15:20,438 --> 01:15:22,702
你们不该在这里的
You guys shouldn't be here

888
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,102
把板子给我们
Give us the tablet, son

889
01:15:24,275 --> 01:15:26,266
等等，尼克，你们在干嘛？
wait a minute, Nicky.

890
01:15:26,444 --> 01:15:28,674
我们不会伤害你，把板子给我们
we're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet

891
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:33,580
抱歉告诉你这一切，孩子
不过你爸不在这工作，他被炒了
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here He got fired this morning

892
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:35,048
无法胜任
couldn't hack it

893
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:38,155
爸？你说过你没被炒的
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired

894
01:15:38,323 --> 01:15:40,689
他们骗人，这样他们才能偷东西
I did. They're lying,
trying to steAL that thing

895
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:43,521
把中间那块翻过来，你就明白了
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was tALking about

896
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:45,560
那是博物馆的财产，孩子
拿给我
That is museum property, son.
Give it back

897
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,664
尼克，相信我，快翻
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it

898
01:15:47,866 --> 01:15:49,993
-把板子给我们
-尼克？
-Give us the tablet!
-Nicky?

899
01:15:50,702 --> 01:15:52,135
相信我
Trust me

900
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:16,026
尼克？快跑
Nick? Run. Now

901
01:16:17,195 --> 01:16:19,095
给我回来，小鬼
Get back here, kid!

902
01:16:21,799 --> 01:16:23,494
坏主意，赖瑞
Bad idea, Larry

903
01:16:23,902 --> 01:16:26,427
想打架吗？
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

904
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:28,731
葛斯，你是老人
我不想伤你
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you

905
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:34,806
赖瑞，担任这工作几年下来
我们就明白
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

906
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:39,109
我们就像博物馆里的一切
夜里会有新生命
...like everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night

907
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:42,515
日落到日出，我们都重获新生
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again

908
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:46,280
我没想到有那招
okay. Did not see that coming

909
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:48,118
让我们重获活力
Gave us an energy boost

910
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:50,557
我们喜欢夜生活，赖瑞
we love the nightlife, Larry

911
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:52,889
所以一等他们辞退我们
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

912
01:16:53,064 --> 01:16:54,531
我们就得偷走板子
...we had to steAL the tablet

913
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:56,724
大家都知道你需要钱
Everyone knows you need the money

914
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:58,766
栽赃在你家的赃物
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

915
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:01,064
刚好成了你的罪证
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime

916
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:03,139
好好照料伤口
Take care of that cut

917
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:05,276
我们去找那个小鬼吧
come on, guys, let's go find that kid

918
01:17:07,245 --> 01:17:09,270
-祝你好梦，呆头
-不！
-Sweet dreams, cupcake!
-No!

919
01:17:09,447 --> 01:17:10,880
岩石落下技！
Pile driver!

920
01:17:11,716 --> 01:17:13,616
我们去拿板子吧
Let's get our tablet

921
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,742
谢谢，我们就从这里接手
Thank you very much.
we'll take it from here

922
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:43,470
尼克
Nicky!

923
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:48,281
刚好，我们正要锁门呢
Just in time, Larry.
we were just locking up

924
01:17:49,787 --> 01:17:51,880
好好睡吧
Sleep tight, hotshot

925
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:55,591
快去拿值钱的东西吧
Let's grab everything we can fence

926
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,060
我打算要过一段好日子
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement

927
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:11,497
泰迪！你在的话，我需要你
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pAL!

928
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:15,376
有人叫我吗？
Someone call my name?

929
01:18:17,115 --> 01:18:19,481
西奥多罗斯福，为您效命
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service

930
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:21,516
泰迪
你能带我们出去吗？
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

931
01:18:21,686 --> 01:18:23,950
做不到，这是你人生的机会
can't do it, man. This is your moment

932
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:26,646
拜托你少开讲了，我不是你
will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. okay?

933
01:18:26,824 --> 01:18:30,282
我没建巴拿马运河，也不是总统
I didn't build the Panama canAL,
I wasn't president of the United States!

934
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:31,655
我需要帮忙
I need some help. come on

935
01:18:31,829 --> 01:18:33,592
事实上
Actually...

936
01:18:35,633 --> 01:18:39,592
那些事也不是我做的
是泰迪罗斯福做的
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did

937
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:42,638
我是模型工厂的产品
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie

938
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:44,672
我从未射杀过野兽
I never shot a wild beast

939
01:18:44,842 --> 01:18:48,073
我也没勇气告诉那位女士我爱她
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her

940
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:49,877
不过你
But you...

941
01:18:50,648 --> 01:18:54,175
你这次得完成这个工作
你不能放弃
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit

942
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:58,956
我是蜡做的，劳伦斯
I'm made of wax, Larry

943
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:01,420
你又是什么做的？
what are you made of?

944
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:08,663
-等等，那就是你的忠告？
-没错
-wait! That's all you got for me?
-That's it!

945
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:23,003
这就对了，来吧
That's it. come on

946
01:19:23,848 --> 01:19:25,179
低头！
Duck!

947
01:19:26,851 --> 01:19:28,341
过去
Go over there!

948
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:52,006
嗨，你好吗？
抱歉打扰你了
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

949
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,269
不过，你的卫兵
你的胡狼神K
...but your guys there? Your jackAL guys?

950
01:19:54,445 --> 01:19:56,743
你能不能请他们退下？
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

951
01:19:56,914 --> 01:20:00,213
我们不想伤你，但他们不这么想
拜托你快点！
we're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. could you do it like now?

952
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:08,551
谢谢你，尼克
Thank you. Nicky

953
01:20:09,293 --> 01:20:10,555
谢了
Thank you

954
01:20:18,503 --> 01:20:19,902
爸？
Dad?

955
01:20:31,349 --> 01:20:33,874
你不会相信这里面有多闷
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there

956
01:20:35,853 --> 01:20:38,879
-你怎么会说英文？
-我上过剑桥
-How come you speak English?
-I went to cambridge University

957
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:40,148
你上过剑桥？
You went to cambridge?

958
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:42,918
我在埃及古物学系作过展示
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department

959
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:46,621
我是阿卡曼拉
第四王朝的第四任国王
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

960
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:49,323
我父亲王国的统治者
...ruler of the land of my fathers

961
01:20:49,934 --> 01:20:52,095
我是赖瑞
I am Larry...

962
01:20:53,571 --> 01:20:55,402
密尔顿之子
...son of Milton...

963
01:20:55,573 --> 01:20:58,940
这是我儿，尼克
...and this is my son, Nick

964
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:01,601
我们来自布鲁克林
And we hail from Brooklyn

965
01:21:01,946 --> 01:21:05,211
就我啦
他每周三和K
well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on wednesdays...

966
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:06,645
隔周周末跟我住
...and every other weekend

967
01:21:07,285 --> 01:21:11,619
监护权的协议
That was the custody agreement
that we had

968
01:21:12,089 --> 01:21:15,786
赖瑞、尼克，布鲁克林守护者
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

969
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,825
我永远感谢你们
...I am forever in your debt

970
01:21:17,995 --> 01:21:20,589
现在请将刻写板给我
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

971
01:21:20,765 --> 01:21:23,290
好让我重掌我的王国
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom

972
01:21:24,135 --> 01:21:27,104
好，刻写板，我很乐意
oh, yes. okay, the tablet. I would...

973
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:30,638
将它返回给你，可是它不在
...love to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

974
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:32,506
我们手上
...have it

975
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:43,415
谢了，我会保护他的
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

976
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:44,953
谢谢
Thank you

977
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:01,666
那是什么？
what is that?

978
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,701
匈奴人
Huns

979
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:07,473
我得解决这个家伙
I gotta deAL with this guy

980
01:22:44,181 --> 01:22:46,411
抱歉，赖瑞，我会说匈奴话
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun

981
01:22:54,358 --> 01:22:56,258
他想把你五马分尸
He says that he wants to rip you apart

982
01:22:56,427 --> 01:22:58,952
又要分尸，我明白
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand

983
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,622
我懂了，你想撕扯什么
I get it. Ripping for you....
You want to rip things, okay?

984
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,759
也许是因为很久以前
有人撕扯了你
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago

985
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:08,728
在这里
In here

986
01:23:09,407 --> 01:23:11,602
很久以前
Somebody ripped little...

987
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:14,745
有人伤了小阿提拉，就在这里
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here

988
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:19,314
他们摧毁了某个东西，对吧？
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

989
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:22,746
他们摧毁了爱
They ripped the love

990
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:25,886
让你失去了爱
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

991
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:30,318
小宝宝孤单待在帐棚里
A little baby all ALone in a tent...

992
01:23:31,062 --> 01:23:33,394
爸爸出门去
...whose daddy went off...

993
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:37,200
去掠夺某个城镇，或者
...to pillage some town...

994
01:23:37,368 --> 01:23:40,098
去抢某个地方，做他该做的事
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job

995
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:42,398
可是谁被扔在家里？
But who was left ALone?

996
01:23:45,776 --> 01:23:47,641
你
You

997
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:56,514
别压抑，释放出来吧
Let it out. Let it go. Let it go

998
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:20,736
没事了
It's okay. It's okay

999
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,575
你是下一个
You're next

1000
01:24:28,452 --> 01:24:31,319
很好，深呼吸
Good. That's good. Just breathe

1001
01:24:35,326 --> 01:24:36,691
赖瑞达理
-Larry Daley.
-Yeah

1002
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:42,196

01:24:42,767 --> 01:24:44,632
是，很好，很好
Yeah. okay. Good, good

1004
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:49,405
好了
大家听着
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

1005
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,477
各位，听我说
Guys! come on!

1006
01:24:58,282 --> 01:25:04,585
安静！
Quiet!

1007
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:15,957
我的笨笨有话要说
My dum-dum want to speak

1008
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:17,930
谢谢
Thank you

1009
01:25:18,803 --> 01:25:21,135
这位是阿卡曼拉王
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah

1010
01:25:21,305 --> 01:25:24,138
他的板子让各位每晚重获新生
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night

1011
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:27,106
这些夜班老警卫偷走了它
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it

1012
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:30,173
在天亮之前
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1013
01:25:30,347 --> 01:25:32,247
我们得找到这些警卫，拿回板子
...and we need to do it before morning

1014
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:35,579
南北战争士兵！
快去天文馆

1015
01:25:37,755 --> 01:25:40,588
我不记得我探险家朋友的名字了
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me

1016
01:25:40,758 --> 01:25:44,125

-哥伦布！对，真抱歉
-It's columbus.
-Right, columbus! Right, I'm sorry

1017
01:25:44,295 --> 01:25:47,093
你又没挂名牌，哥伦布
带尼安德塔人去搜索
There's no nameplate, so....
columbus, take the NeanderthALs...

1018
01:25:47,264 --> 01:25:50,199
无脊椎和爬虫类动物陈列室
...and do a sweep from Invertebrates

他们的货车在后面，看住它
Jed and octavius, their van's parked

1020
01:25:53,537 --> 01:25:56,631

whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy

1021

罗马人单打独斗

-That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
-Yes, it did

1023
01:26:01,545 --> 01:26:02,773
少蠢了
come on

1024
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:05,008
那一下比较用力
That was much harder!

1025
01:26:05,182 --> 01:26:06,649
两位，拜托
Guys, come on!

1026
01:26:07,485 --> 01:26:09,578
阿嘉、屋大维
Jed, octavius

1027
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:12,052
你们的年代虽然差了两千年
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1028
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:13,747
但你们并没有那么大的差异
...you guys aren't that different

1029
01:26:14,325 --> 01:26:16,520
你们都是伟大的领袖
You're both great leaders

1030
01:26:16,694 --> 01:26:18,924
你们都为自己的人民谋福利
对吗？
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1031
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:20,495
-对
-对
-Yeah.
-Yeah

1032
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:22,188
南北战争的兵士们
civil war dudes

1033
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:28,735
拜托，你们是同胞
别再打斗了
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting

1034
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:33,474
北方赢了，奴隶不对，抱歉
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry

1035
01:26:33,644 --> 01:26:39,105
我并不想毁了你们的幻想
不过南方，你们有艾曼兄弟
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1036
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:42,909
还有房车赛，别激动了
...and NAScAR, so just chill!

1037
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:48,453
听着
没有了刻写板，这一切
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1038
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:52,357
夜生活就会划下休止符
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away

1039
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:55,624
我不想那样，但我需要你们帮忙
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help

1040
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,132
我们做得到，但我们得齐心合力
we can get this done,
but we gotta do it together

1041
01:26:59,303 --> 01:27:00,497
谁要帮我？
So who's with me?

1042
01:27:01,906 --> 01:27:03,567
好
Yeah

1043
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:05,675
-谁跟我同一阵线？
-好耶！
-who's with me?
-Yeah!

1044
01:27:05,843 --> 01:27:08,334
-好啊
-冲啊！
-Yeah!
-charge!

1045
01:27:09,747 --> 01:27:12,648
好耶，我们动手吧
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1046
01:27:14,752 --> 01:27:16,117
还有动物们
And animALs!

1047
01:27:17,922 --> 01:27:21,653
还有无脸男们，一起来吧
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1048
01:27:44,682 --> 01:27:46,616
跟我来，各位
come on! Follow me, boys!

1049
01:27:46,784 --> 01:27:48,479
吉拉尼莫！
Geronimo!

1050
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:02,062
天哪
oh, jeez

1051
01:28:16,113 --> 01:28:20,311
各位，要来软的还是硬的
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way

1052
01:28:25,723 --> 01:28:27,987
我想你们是想来硬的
I guess it's gonna be the hard way

1053
01:28:31,829 --> 01:28:35,629
我们就快到了
Right, men, we're ALmost there

1054
01:28:55,986 --> 01:28:58,181
救救你自己吧
Save yourself!

1055
01:28:58,355 --> 01:29:00,289
我不想戒掉你
I ain't quitting you!

1056
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:03,784
葛斯？
Gus?

1057
01:29:06,096 --> 01:29:07,290
雷纳？
ReginALd?

1058
01:29:07,731 --> 01:29:09,858
两位？你们在哪里？
Fellas, where are you?

1059
01:29:10,868 --> 01:29:12,199
兄弟们？
Guys?

1060
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:26,472
我就说嘛，干的好！
That's what I'm tALking about.
Good job, gentlemen

1061
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,117
团队合作太棒了
Loving the teamwork!

1062
01:29:48,205 --> 01:29:51,663
他们消失了，要怎么找他们？
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1063
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:54,702
我知道有人能帮忙
来吧
I know someone who can help. come on

1064
01:29:55,813 --> 01:29:57,644
小心！
watch out!

1065
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:08,189
莎卡佳尾，或佳哩
有人偷了他的板子
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet

1066
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:10,850
你能追踪拿走它的人吗？
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1067
01:30:11,528 --> 01:30:15,692
他往东走
不过失控撞车了
He went east
but he lost control and crashed

1068
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,326
真厉害，你怎么知道的？
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1069
01:30:23,474 --> 01:30:25,465
他放弃车子
He left the wagon...

1070
01:30:25,642 --> 01:30:27,473
跑回去了
...and went back

1071
01:30:27,644 --> 01:30:29,475
跑回去？
He went back?

1072
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:32,214
他为什么要回去？
why would he go back?

1073
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:36,385
让开！
Get out of the way!

1074
01:30:44,561 --> 01:30:46,085
你救了我
You saved me

1075
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:48,522
你值得我救，亲爱的
You're worth saving, my dear

1076
01:30:50,968 --> 01:30:53,596
-这下有问题了
-泰迪，老天
-That's problematic.
-Teddy. oh, man

1077
01:30:53,771 --> 01:30:55,966
劳伦斯，别紧张，我是蜡做的
Larry, relax. I'm wax

1078
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,005
不过快天亮了
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching

1079
01:30:58,175 --> 01:31:01,440
馆里大半的东西都在外面乱跑
他拿了我的板子
-HALf the museum's running amuck outside.
-He's got my tablet

1080
01:31:04,148 --> 01:31:06,241
走吧，小屋
come on, ockie!

1081
01:31:12,289 --> 01:31:14,189
为您效劳，巨怪
At your service, Gigantor!

1082
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:16,588
主人，我们该怎么帮忙？
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1083
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,955
让我想一下
Just give me a second, guys

1084
01:31:23,067 --> 01:31:24,762
小龙？
Rexy?

1085
01:31:26,136 --> 01:31:27,398
过来，小乖
Here, boy

1086
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,801
泰迪，我需要一匹马
Teddy, I need a horse

1087
01:31:29,973 --> 01:31:31,634
快去吧
Do it, man

1088
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:50,318
来啊，让我听你吼吧！
-come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
-Yeah!

1089
01:31:50,494 --> 01:31:52,359
这真是梦想成真
Just living the dream, baby!

1090
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:54,156
我爱死这一切了
I'm loving this!

1091
01:31:57,768 --> 01:31:59,929
快停住马车
现在！
PulI the stagecoach over now!

1092
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,432
这个弯能交给我吗？
can I make this turn up here?

1093
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,673
我就当是答应了，坐稳了
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1094
01:32:16,019 --> 01:32:17,850
我控制不了它
I can't hold it!

1095
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:33,029
走，我们了结这一切吧
come on, Tex, let's finish this

1096
01:32:34,438 --> 01:32:36,133
快啊
come on!

1097
01:32:40,911 --> 01:32:42,640
把板子给我
Give me the tablet, cecil!

1098
01:32:42,813 --> 01:32:44,303
做不到
can't do it, son

1099
01:32:47,784 --> 01:32:49,251
停下
PulI over!

1100
01:32:49,419 --> 01:32:52,547
那是不可能的，走吧
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on

1101
01:32:53,257 --> 01:32:55,919
快停住，不然我就动手了
Last chance, cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1102
01:32:56,193 --> 01:32:58,058
他们停不住的
They can't be stopped, Larry

1103
01:32:58,228 --> 01:32:59,889
你历史没学好吗？
Don't you know your history?

1104
01:33:00,063 --> 01:33:05,091
他们是载运钱财的
他们只听一个秘密指令
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word

1105
01:33:05,269 --> 01:33:07,169
真的吗？你是说像K
Really? You mean a word like...

1106
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:10,166
达科塔！
...“Dakota”?

1107
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:16,176
过去，德克萨斯
come on, Tex

1108
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:22,749
我温习过历史了，感谢指点
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip

1109
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:24,415
还有
oh, and by the way...

1110
01:33:24,588 --> 01:33:27,079
别在我儿子面前那样对我说话我
...don't ever tALk to me like that
in front of my son

1111
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:31,054
走吧
Moving on

1112
01:33:35,132 --> 01:33:37,066
-嘿，匈奴人
-叫阿提拉让他的手下
-Hey, Huns.
-Tell Attila to have his boys...

1113
01:33:37,234 --> 01:33:39,225
把他跟其他警卫绑在一起
...take him back.
Put him with the guards

1114
01:33:42,406 --> 01:33:45,170
还有，别五马分尸了
oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1115
01:33:58,956 --> 01:34:00,617
等等，别急
不要那么激动
Hey, boy. wait, wait, hold the phone

1116
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:04,249
“马基卡卡”啥意思？
翻译一下，拜托
what's maKeeKaKa mean?
wait. Translation, please

1117
01:34:06,663 --> 01:34:10,429
那是在1909年
我沿尚比西河而上
The year was 1 909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa

1118
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:13,794
我们的矮黑人向导用喀嗒声说话
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking

1119
01:34:21,878 --> 01:34:23,243
好了
There we are

1120
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,884
老天
怎么了？
-oh, boy.
-what is it?

1121
01:34:29,052 --> 01:34:31,179
我得把你们弄回博物馆
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum

1122
01:34:32,856 --> 01:34:34,118
怎么弄？
How?

1123
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:39,260
阿卡曼拉，我需要你帮忙
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help

1124
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:42,660
你懂板上的文字，你送大家回去
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back

1125
01:35:10,727 --> 01:35:13,662
有个人得看看这个
come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this

1126
01:35:16,099 --> 01:35:19,364
他们每季付A-Rod这么多钱
what I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1127
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:22,733
他每季都该打赢世界大赛
...he ought to be bringing home
a world Series trophy every season

1128
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,969
你懂我的意思吧？
You know what I mean?

1129
01:35:43,427 --> 01:35:45,987
谁来帮它们清大便啊？
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1130
01:35:46,163 --> 01:35:47,357

好吗？谢谢

1139
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:06,642
他回来了
我来处理这烦人的家伙
-He's back.
-All right, I'll deAL with this joker

1140
01:36:06,817 --> 01:36:09,945
大麋鹿，你过不来的
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1141
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:12,554
你头上的角会卡住
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers

1142
01:36:12,723 --> 01:36:15,749
带着你的驯鹿朋友去上货区
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock

1143
01:36:15,926 --> 01:36:18,622
-劳伦斯
-泰迪
-Lawrence!
-Hey, Teddy

真高兴看到完整的你
Great to see you in one piece

1145
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:23,531
莎卡佳哩弄点热腊就黏好了
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man

1146
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,395
赖瑞？
Larry?

1147
01:36:29,873 --> 01:36:32,137
我说过我不是跟你开玩笑
I told you I wasn't making fun of you

1148
01:36:32,309 --> 01:36:34,971
-我知道
-泰迪？
-I know.
-Teddy?

1149
01:36:36,546 --> 01:36:39,811
老天
oh, my God

1150
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:42,245
你想见见她吗？

罗斯福总统，这是我朋友贝嘉
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,

I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you

1158
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:03,901
你超赞的，我是你的超级粉丝
You rock. I am a big fan

1159
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:06,967
你想知道什么？
what would you like to know?

1160
01:37:07,811 --> 01:37:10,609
我不知道该从何问起
well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but...

1161
01:37:22,025 --> 01:37:24,721
-达摩祖师，合十答礼
-到
-one Buddha.

1162
01:37:26,096 --> 01:37:28,428
两匹斑马
Two zebras

1163
01:37:29,132 --> 01:37:32,568

-德克斯，欢迎回来
-Right. check.

1164
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:35,465
德克斯，我们和好吧？
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1165
01:37:36,973 --> 01:37:38,531
-劳伦斯
-你看到了
-Lawrence!
-You saw!

1166
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:40,972
-你看到他打我了
-谁比较高等？
-You saw what he did just then!
-who's evolved?

1167
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:42,941
-我
-谁比较高等？
-I am.
-who's evolved?

1168
01:37:43,113 --> 01:37:44,478
我！
I am!

1169
01:37:45,515 --> 01:37:46,880
很好
Good

1170
01:37:47,651 --> 01:37:49,141
全员到齐
well, they're all here

1171
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:50,786
干得好
大家都回来了
well done. Everyone's in

1172
01:37:50,954 --> 01:37:52,615
是啊，不过K
Yeah, well...

1173
01:37:52,856 --> 01:37:54,585
没有全部
...not everyone

1174
01:37:55,759 --> 01:37:58,853
我们今晚失去了几个好小子
we lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight

1175
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:03,130
伟大的胜利总是会有些许牺牲
with great victory comes great sacrifice

1176
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:05,658
是啊
Yeah

1177
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:10,469
爸？你看
Dad, look

1178

好耶！
Bully!

1179
01:38:39,135 --> 01:38:41,501
你没那么容易甩掉我们的
You ain't getting rid of us that easy

1180
01:39:01,825 --> 01:39:03,520
明晚见？劳伦斯
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1181
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,458
我不知道，泰迪
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy

1182
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,461
这次我可能搞不定了
It's gonna be tough
to tALk my way out of this one

1183
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:11,692
若真是那样
well, if that's indeed the case...

1184
01:39:11,868 --> 01:39:13,768
那么就此道别了，朋友
...then it's farewell, my friend

1185
01:39:15,739 --> 01:39:17,400
尼克？
Nick?

1186
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:20,442
你父亲是英雄
Your father's a great man

1187
01:39:20,944 --> 01:39:22,536
我知道
I know

1188
01:39:28,351 --> 01:39:29,978
我跟你说过了
Told you

1189
01:39:33,456 --> 01:39:35,424
晚安
All right. Good night

1190
01:39:35,592 --> 01:39:38,493
不，是早安
No, Lawrence. Good day

1191
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:45,467
泰迪？
Hey, Teddy?

1192
01:39:58,682 --> 01:40:00,274
谢了
Thanks

1193
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:17,161
这是纽约一台，新闻台
You're watching New YorK 1.
News all morning

1194
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:21,026
今天地上铺了一层新雪
ThanKs for joining us.
There is a fresh blanKet of snow

1195
01:40:21,204 --> 01:40:23,604
不过纽约人谈论的可不是这个
But it's not the snow
that's got New YorKers talKing

1196
01:40:23,773 --> 01:40:28,233
他们谈的是雪上的东西
西81街上有恐龙脚印
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracKs along West 81 st Street

1197
01:40:28,645 --> 01:40:31,978
那些脚印是暴龙脚印
Here's the remarKable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracKs...

1198
01:40:32,148 --> 01:40:35,208
足迹直接延伸至自然历史博物馆
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History

1199
01:40:35,685 --> 01:40:39,781
当局发现地铁里有史前洞穴划
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway

1200
01:40:39,956 --> 01:40:43,084
尼安德塔人在博物馆屋顶
这是骗局还是公关活动？
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1201
01:40:43,259 --> 01:40:44,487
（家庭影片
博物馆之迷）

1202
01:40:44,661 --> 01:40:46,526
由你来决定
但有件事很确定
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1203
01:40:46,696 --> 01:40:50,325
自然历史博物馆的人员
真是使出了浑身绝技
The folKs at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

1204
01:40:53,603 --> 01:40:54,865
你有何解释？
Any explanation at all?

1205
01:40:59,175 --> 01:41:00,836
没，没有解释
No. Got nothing

1206
01:41:01,011 --> 01:41:02,239
好
Good

1207
01:41:02,846 --> 01:41:05,508
我要拿回你的钥匙和手电筒
I'll take your keys and your flashlight

1208
01:41:23,533 --> 01:41:25,626
大家，跟我来
Folks, this way

1209
01:42:23,293 --> 01:42:27,286
我叫尼克达理
我的职场父母要介绍的是我爸
My name is Nick Daley.
My career Day parent is my dad

1210
01:42:27,464 --> 01:42:30,592
他是自然历史博物馆的夜班警卫
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of NaturAL History

1211
01:42:35,638 --> 01:42:37,538
尼克说过了
Hey, how's it going? well, Nicky said it:

1212
01:42:37,707 --> 01:42:40,175
我是自然历史博物馆的夜班警卫
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of NaturAL History

1213
01:42:40,343 --> 01:42:44,302
在那里，历史栩栩如生
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive

1214
01:42:45,582 --> 01:42:48,176
你们有多少人到过那里？
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1215
01:43:09,105 --> 01:43:12,472
得分！
GoAL!

1216
01:43:39,402 --> 01:43:41,836
嘿，时间晚了
你要回家了吗？
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1217
01:43:42,372 --> 01:43:43,361
还没
Nope

1218
01:43:49,879 --> 01:43:51,506
冲啊
Let's ride

1219
01:44:29,052 --> 01:44:32,453
赖瑞很好心没举发我们
不过这太扯了
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous

1220
01:44:32,622 --> 01:44:34,886
我们是夜班警卫，不是清洁工
we're night watchmen, not janitors!

1221
01:44:35,692 --> 01:44:37,626
你们好好干
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job

1222
01:44:37,794 --> 01:44:39,125
我去打个盹
I'll gonna catch a few Z's

1223
01:44:39,295 --> 01:44:40,762
你不能走
You ain't going nowhere

1224
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:43,592
快给我拖地
Start mopping, hot dog

1225
01:44:48,037 --> 01:44:49,698
这边
over here
