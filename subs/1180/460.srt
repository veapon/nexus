4
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,435
(clamouring)

5
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,143
A beer.

6
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,941
(man) Barman. One more, one more.

7
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,802
- Now?
- Now, upstairs.

8
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,533
Forestier!

9
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,334
- Charles Forestier!
- Yes.

10
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,329
Georges Duroy.

11
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,300
The 6th Hussars. Algeria, '85.

12
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,545
Yes, Georges Duroy.

13
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,380
Yes.

14
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,181
You look terrible.

15
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,473
Let me buy you a drink.

16
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,805
When did you last have a proper meal?

17
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,720
Excuse me.

18
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,514
(crowd cheering)

19
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,525
Champagne!

20
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,690
(dancer yipping)

21
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,702
So, what have you been doing
all these years?

22
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,372
I only just got out.

23
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,494
- (glass shatters)
- (chuckling)

24
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,545
I'm hoping for better luck in Paris.

25
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,084
You couldn't have come at a better time.

26
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,676
Paris is filthy with money.
Rotten with it.

27
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,425
If you can't succeed here

28
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,594
you might as well lie down and die.

29
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,092
Yes!

30
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,222
Even the whores are getting rich.

31
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,226
And me, ex-soldier,

32
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,607
living on the Boulevard Haussmann,

33
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,686
<i>Political Editor of La Vie Francaise.</i>

34
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,732
We're going to be the newspaper
that brings down the government.

35
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,573
I'm working as a clerk
at the railway office.

36
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,449
I don't have your connections, Charles.

37
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,785
I have to make money somehow.

38
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,296
And we can't go on
a looting spree any more.

39
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,755
We're not in the desert.

40
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,630
Why don't you come
to dinner tomorrow night?

41
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,429
Come and meet my wife.

42
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,216
<i>(Georges) Well, the thing is, uh,</i>

43
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,768
I don't have any evening clothes.

44
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,229
Well, here.

45
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,940
Buy some, hire some.
Come at 7:30, yes?

46
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,151
- Er, yes.
- Good.

47
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,654
Georges Duroy!

48
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,511
- (grunting)
- (panting)

49
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,157
(sighs)

50
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,544
What name shall I give?

51
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,675
Georges Duroy.

52
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,557
<i>(butler) Monsieur Georges Duroy.</i>

53
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,164
I am Madeleine Forestier.

54
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,714
(chuckling softly)

55
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,924
You're married to Charles?

56
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,926
Of course.

57
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,266
Charles has told me all about you.

58
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,726
- Madame Francois de Marelle.
- Madeleine!

59
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,223
<i>(Madeleine) Clotilde.</i>

60
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,065
You look lovely.

61
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,354
I'm Clotilde.

62
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,906
You can call me Clotilde.

63
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,447
<i>(butler) Madame Pierre Rousset.</i>

64
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,593
<i>(Rousset) He's frail.
The gout's gone to his kidneys.</i>

65
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,427
He'll become a member of
the Academy for the rest of his life.

66
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,574
And so everyone will be satisfied.

67
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,601
- (all chuckle)
- You're awful.

68
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,982
It's this knife, Duroy.

69
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,902
What?

70
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,110
He's not used to eating like this.

71
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,280
I believe you've only just returned
from your posting in North Africa.

72
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,782
You were in Algeria?

73
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,750
Yes.

74
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,792
Charles and I were first there
together, five... Five years ago?

75
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,129
(Charles) Five years.

76
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,669
He was a little thinner then.

77
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,167
(all chuckle)

78
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,172
Where were you garrisoned?

79
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,471
I was garrisoned at the frontier.

80
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,010
The very edge of the Sahara.

81
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,635
I once heard a very foolish story
about the desert.

82
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,309
It may well be a myth,
but I find it rather romantic.

83
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,817
I was told that the sands sing? Hmm?

84
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,818
Oh, it's true.
It's an effect of the wind on the dunes.

85
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,281
It makes a kind of music.

86
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,326
Oh. And what does it sound like?

87
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,159
It sounds very sad and mournful.

88
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,661
At least, it does to a lonely soldier.

89
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,498
You? But how could you be lonely?

90
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,217
And there, where the women are divine.

91
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,716
The women are ravishing,

92
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,723
and yet I was still homesick.

93
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,016
Hmm.

94
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,514
Sandstorms and mangy dogs,

95
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,057
- that's what I remember.
- (all laugh)

96
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,682
You could run something
extraordinary about this.

97
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,351
Mmm? I think it would be timely.

98
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,024
Timely? Why?

99
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,317
- Don't you read the newspapers?
- No.

100
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,157
The government
are trying to take Morocco.

101
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,366
Yes. For the good of
the Moroccan people, of course.

102
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,741
- But surely nobody wants a war.
- That won't stop them.

103
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:17,208
No. But we will.

104
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>(Madeleine) Think of it.
An eyewitness view.</i>

105
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,710
A handsome young soldier
on the frontier.

106
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,757
Homesick and alone.

107
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,752
His adventures,

108
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,754
his insights.

109
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,180
<i>The Diary of a Cavalry Officer.</i>

110
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,433
Hmm?

111
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,431
What do you think, dearest?

112
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,266
- What fish are we having?
- Oh!

113
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,268
Oh, yes. Let's change the subject.

114
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,938
I can't bear politics.

115
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,439
Men talking about men

116
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,441
fighting with men about men.

117
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,531
It bores me stupid.

118
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,704
What does interest you?

119
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,241
Well...

120
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,708
I like enjoying myself.

121
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,081
What do you enjoy?

122
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,957
Well, I don't know.

123
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,262
Everything.

I want the first article in the morning.

127
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,438
You realise he's never written a word?

128
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,937
I'll help him get started.

129
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,716
(whinnying)

130
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,883
We'll write it as a letter to a friend.

131
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,975
"Dear...

132

my enthusiasm for the people. "

(striking match)

139
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,923
"if only I could convey to you
the true wonder of the souk.

"I was hers. "

I hope you don't think I'm going to
write all your articles for you.

No.

152

I would never presume. I...

153
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,680
I meant something quite different.

154
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,387
I know what you meant.

155
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,980
Let's be clear.

156
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,235
I have no interest
in being your mistress.

157
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,319
There's nothing more boring to me
than an infatuated youth.

158
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,031
I know perfectly well that
love for you is an appetite.

159
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,492
It makes idiots of you all.

160
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,875
Look at me, please.

161
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,915
I will never be your mistress.

162

Do you understand?

163
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,339
- Yes.
- Good. (chuckles)

164
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,680
Then we can be friends.
Real friends.

165

And I can give you some advice.

00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,608
The most important people in Paris

168
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,605
are their wives.

169
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,238
Call on Madame Rousset.

170
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,245
She likes you.

171
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,763
<i>Madame Rousset likes me?</i>

172
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,415
(chuckles) Not like that.

173
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,540
Never like that.

174
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,252
No.

175
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,461
Her husband values her opinion
above all others.

176
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,460
One good word from her

177
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,929
is worth ten years of grovelling to him.

178
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,098
But you may very much enjoy
a visit to my friend, Clotilde.

179
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,138
She is such wonderful company

180
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,729
and her husband is very often away.

181
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,666
If there is ever any way
I can repay your kindness.

182
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,505
(door opening)

183
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,692
May I present Georges Duroy.
We're helping him get on his feet.

184
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,985
This is the Comte de Vaudrec.

185
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,773
The Comte is our
best and closest friend.

186
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,691
Get out of my way!

187
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,872
Duroy!

188
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,926
(Charles) Monsieur Rousset,
you remember Georges Duroy?

189
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>Diary of a Cavalry Officer.</i>

190
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,099
Your article was a success.
Write me another.

191
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,942
Put him on the payroll, Forestier.

192
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,065
If you think so.

193
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,780
(Charles) You'll get
five francs for this article.

194
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,199
Five for the next.

195
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,781
Then 200 a month.

196
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:13,124
Plus ten centimes a line
for any articles you manage to place.

197
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,291
Here.

198
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,874
Give this to the Chief Cashier.

199
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,463
What's the matter?
Can't believe your luck?

200
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,146
Hello, I'm Laurine, you're Georges.

201
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,274
Please sit down.
Maman will be down shortly.

202
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,290
What's your favourite game?

203
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,745
<i>Tag.</i>

204
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,831
<i>Tag.</i>

205
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,338
Oh, well.

206
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,003
You...

207
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,471
- are 'it'.
- (screams excitedly)

208
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,345
(Laurine laughing)

209
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,191
Who's 'it'?

210
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,856
You are. (screaming)

211
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,782
I'm going to get you.
Going to get you.

212
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,531
(whispering) Going to get you. Tag!

213
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,030
- (Laurine) Get Georges.
- Tag.

214
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
(Laurine squealing)

215
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,999
Off ground.

216
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,707
- Who's chasing who?
- You're chasing us.

217
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,879
It is time for Laurine
to take her lunch.

218
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,881
I want to stay with Georges.

219
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,215
Well, perhaps you'll permit me
to call on you again.

220
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,517
Come soon, Bel am!

221
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,973
<i>Kiss.</i>

222
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,066
"Bel ami. " She never hugs anyone.

223
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,207
I'm so glad you called.

224
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,747
When can I see you again?

225
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,424
I'll come to you.

226
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,591
Tomorrow.

227
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,882
Come today.

228
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,468
Well, I hope you haven't gone to
too much trouble.

229
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,638
(both laugh)

230
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,069
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

231
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,065
- I'm a bit nervous.
- So am I.

232
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,405
(train rumbling)

233
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,956
(laughs)

234
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,499
(bed creaks)

235
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,679
Do you think it will
take both of us? (laughs)

236
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,176
(bed creaks)

237
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,022
(coughs)

238
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,608
(neighbours arguing)

239
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,865
Oh.

240
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,287
I'd like to do this again.

241
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,989
I'd like to do this now.

242
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,832
I mustn't come to your room, though.

243
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,160
Anyone might see.

244
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,873
I can't risk a divorce.
I would lose Laurine.

245
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,717
And I don't want to
embarrass my husband.

246
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,878
He's a good man.

247
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,554
Mm.

248
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,852
A love nest is what we need.

249
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,729
A little place we could go
to be alone from time to time.

250
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,323
<i>I would pay for it.</i>

251
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,902
<i>My money,</i>

252
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,245
<i>to spend on me,</i>

253
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,366
<i>on something I want.</i>

254
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,109
(both laughing)

255
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,994
(Clotilde laughing)

256
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,662
(bell tolling)

257
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,962
What are you reading?

258
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,795
It's a letter from my father.

259
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,680
Every week he puts on his best suit
and goes to the priest

260
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,673
and the priest writes a letter for him.

261
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,681
And every week it's the same thing.

262
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,478
Your mother sends her blessings.

263
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,145
The pigs have diarrhoea.

264
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,526
- When are you getting married?
- Ooh!

265
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,020
(both laugh)

266
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,775
- My father's a peasant.
- Mmm.

267
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,326
He's never left his village.

268
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,704
And he's asking me for money.

269
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,333
I'd like to see where you grew up.

270
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,508
I'd like to see you there.

271
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,565
Promise me something.

272
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,233
- Don't bring your other women here.
- Ha!

273
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,649
I don't have other women.

274
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,863
All men have other women.

275
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,453
Not me.

276
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,664
Honestly?

277
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,290
Don't lie to me.

278
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,380
Honestly and truly.

279
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,430
(lively music playing)

280
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,116
(laughing)

281
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,549
Champagne!

282
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,896
Hello.

283
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,816
I was talking to your friend here.

284
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,154
Georges?

285
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,576
I think you've mistaken me
for somebody else.

286
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,497
So, I see.

287
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,167
Not so friendly after all, are we?

288
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,119
Now that you're not looking for
a cheap fuck.

289
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,674
(women exclaiming in surprise)

290
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,633
Clo!

291
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,339
Don't you dare touch me!

292
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,390
It was before I knew you.

293
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,936
Clotilde!

294
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,525

00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,197

296
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,621
Who are you to speak to me?

297
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,998
Who am I?

298
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,755

- Rival?
- Yes.

00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,183
No.

301
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,892
You still owe me 40.

302
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,183
I need to eat, too.

303
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,564
Why don't you try earning it?

<i>Diary Of A Cavalry Officer.
Whatever happened to that?</i>

305
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,792
Perhaps you can get my wife to write it.

306
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,161
Perhaps you think you can

307

draw your salary

308
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,837

Now, I...

I brought you into my home,
I fed you, I clothed you,

and how do you repay me?

312

Yes.

320
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,639

Pompous idiot.

He can talk.
Couldn't even write his own name

You don't know her.

334
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,942
Monsieur Rousset regrets to inform you

335
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,027
that your services are
no longer required.

336
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,321
Pack up and get out.

337
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,452
You're on your own, Duroy.

338
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,117
There's no women to help you here.

339

<i>(Georges) Madame Rousset.</i>

340
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
I hope you'll forgive me for intruding.

341
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,564
<i>Monsieur Duroy.</i>

342
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,113
I wanted to make a gift to you
of these pears

343
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,152
I received from my parents' orchard
in Normandy today.

344
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,741
Oh. How very kind.

345
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,293
Would you care to join us?

346
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,340
(ladies chuckling)

347
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,631
I would. Thank you.

348
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,653
Will you eat a pear, Madame Rousset?

349
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,161
(ladies chuckling)

350
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,534
Well, Um.

351
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,366
Yes, I think I might.

(Charles coughing)

356
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,851
(Rousset) Ah, Duroy.

357
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,440
You remember my wife.

360
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,527
<i>(Georges) Of course.</i>

<i>Well, Bel ami.</i>

00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,752
Don't you have a smile
for your old friend?

363
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,798
Let's go into dinner, ladies.

364
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,879
We have pages and pages
of gossip for you.

365
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,266
Madame Forestier.

366

<i>Bel ami. Ha!</i>

367
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,391
I thought you'd forgotten me.

368
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,601
Impossible.

369
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,776
- (piano playing softly)
- (singing Ave Maria)

370
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,833

(continues coughing)

373
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,551
I missed you so much.

374
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,723
Why didn't you come to me?

375
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,052
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

376
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,054
I always want you.

377
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,240
I must go.

378
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,577
My husband
will be wondering where I am.

379
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,502
My other husband.

380
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,750
Your rich husband.

381
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,418
The father of my daughter.

382
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,516
Will you lace me up?

383
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,219
Don't forget to tie a double bow.

384
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,430
- Like your husband does it?
- Mmm.

385
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:29,439
(sighs) Poor Charles.
He won't live to see another spring.

386
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,779
Madeleine has taken him to the sea,
but it won't help.

387
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,576
Poor thing.

388
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,739
She won't be a widow for long.

389

391
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,310
Thank you for coming.
You're the only one.

392
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,730
How is he?

393
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,316
I brought him to Cannes
to make him better.

394
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,151
But I'll bury him here.

395
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,829
They're my favourite. Thank you.

396
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,767
(Charles chuckles)

397
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,652
You've come to see me die.

398
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,988
No. I've just come to escape the city.

399
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,995
Because I'm going to live.

400
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,618
Yes.

401
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,867
I am.

402
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,870
I'm going to live.

403
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,791
Help me.

404
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,123
I want to go for a drive!

405
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,548
You're not strong enough.

406
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,049
Help

407
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,009
(coughs)

408
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,520
(coughing)

409

410
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,321
(Charles groaning faintly)

411
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,969
I want you to listen
to what I have to say

412
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,060
and try to understand.

413
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,640
Don't be angry.

414
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,145
I only want you to know that
with one word you can make me happy.

415
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,730
You can make me your friend,

416
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,031
your brother,

417
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,198
or you can make me your husband.

418
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,742
My heart and my body are yours.

419
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,211
You have to understand,

420
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,248
I am not like other women.

421
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,090
Marriage to me is partnership,

422
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,887
a contract between equals.

423
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,684
I will not accept authority, jealousy,

424
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,602
or questioning my conduct.

425
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,097
I insist on being free.

426
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,600
(softly) Of course.

427
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,944
You must give it more thought.

428
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,782
It is an important decision for us both.

429
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,643
Clo.

430
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,656
Just tell me.

431
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,329
Tell me quickly.

432
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,957
I'm getting married.

433
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,464
Oh.

434
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,253
Of course you must.

435
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,345
Who is she?

436
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,357
Madeleine Forestier.

437
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,690
Oh.

438
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,452

the woman you need.

440

Yes.

441
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,008
And you love her?

442
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,129
Clo.

443
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,965

Wasn't there a deputy?

Sarrazin.

461
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,278
We should give Sarrazin's moustache
a column of its own.

462
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,445
Georges,

463
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,276
it's brilliant.

464
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,947
That is brilliant.

The Political Editor of
a leading newspaper

468

should have a more memorable name.

469

Something...

470
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,059
a bit grand.

My parents are from Canteleu.

We didn't have our honeymoon there.

I wish her better health.

503
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,426
<i>(Paul) You are too kind,
Monsieur le comte.</i>

504
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,426
That'll be all.

505
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,822
What did he want?

506
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,790
<i>(Madeleine) It's Tuesday.</i>

507
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,789
He always comes on Tuesday.

508
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,308
And when are your politicians arriving?

509
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,512
Ah!

510
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,138
In half an hour.

511
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,190
Half an hour!

512
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,443
Yes.

513
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,111
In half an hour.

514
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,359
- Now, I've invited Laroche.
- Uh-huh.

515
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,198
You must pay special attention to him.

516
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,153
He's going to be foreign minister
one day, I promise.

517
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,863
(Georges grunts)

518
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,678
Georges.

519
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,351
(people chattering)

520
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,454
<i>(Rousset) We are going to bring
this government down with one word.</i>

521
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,581
I want the word on the front page
of every newspaper.

522
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,710
I want it on every wall
and every shop window.

523
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,132
I want every man,
woman, and child, to know

524
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,096
that this government is lying.

525
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,886
Forestier can dig something up.

526
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,638
What's that?

527
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,760
What?

528
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,762
You just called me Forestier.

529
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,268
Oh, force of habit.

530
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,476
Don't be offended.
It's an easy mistake to make.

531
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,894
How do you mean?

532
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,734
And we should look into
troop movements.

533
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,074
Logistics.

534
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,743
<i>(Rousset) Yes.
Laroche, you can help us here.</i>

535
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,410
I know a couple of officers
who are sympathetic to our cause.

536
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,249
You can talk to, uh...

537
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,290
Laroche will tell you what to write.

538
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,147
Look at these exports to Algiers.

539
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:07,027
Why have we gone from shipping
hundreds of tons of grain here to...

540
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,991
Look, look.

541
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,994
Thousands of tons here.

542
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,830
Why?

543
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,832
(clears throat)

544
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:22,835
I don't know, to feed an army. Hmm?

545
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,207
To feed an army.

546
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,809
This is it.

547
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,387
This is it.

548
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,599
Who is supplying the grain?

549
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:43,476
Georges, that's the question.

550
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,026
Georges, I need to work.

551
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,361
Mmm. My brilliant wife.

552
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,536
All right.

553
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,396
(Madeleine grunting)

554
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,194
(chuckling) Mado.

555
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,606
(Madeleine grunting rhythmically)

556
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,900
Mado, slow down. Slow down.

557
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,951
(Madeleine panting)

558
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,411
Mado!

559
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,408
(Georges straining)

560
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,548
Mado!

561
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,095
(Georges grunts)

562
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,795
Look.

563
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,465
They're going to invade.

564
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,513
(both sighing)

565
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,197
<i>La Vie Francaise has found proof.</i>

566
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,279
Oh, of course, it's Tuesday.

567
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,865
The Comte de Vaudrec
must be arriving soon.

568
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,666
Incontrovertible proof
of the government's true intentions

569
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:09,004
toward Morocco.

570
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,212
We've never talked about that, have we?

571
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,676
The Comte de Vaudrec.

572
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,468
The man

573
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,804
who arrives unannounced,

574
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,682
who knows all the servants
better than I do...

575
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,552
Buried deep amongst

576
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,189
the dreary columns
of our trade figures.

577
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,894
What is he to you, huh?

578
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,689
Where no one would think to look.

579
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,361
What is he to you?

580
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:43,573
Do you want to be the man
who brought down the government?

581
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,246
Or do you want to be a fool?

582
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,212
- (lively music plating)
- Ah!

583
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,960
(people clapping)

584
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,885
We're just waiting for Laroche.

585
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,722
- You know my daughter, Suzanne?
- Oh!

586
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,595
So pretty.

587
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,138
And another for Bel ami.

588
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,603
- (laughs)
- It's what Maman calls you.

589
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,820
I have from time to time.
I hope you don't mind.

590
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,151
Call him whatever you like.

591
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:04,991
Ah!

592
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,910
Our foreign minister.

593
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,657
Go on.

594
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,162
Thank you, thank you, my good friends.

595
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,287
My excellent,

596
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,173
hard-working friends.

597
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,842
But I'm afraid I have bad news for you.

598
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,633
Our work has only just begun!

599
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:24,302
(guests laughing)

600
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,133
We have a great task ahead of us.

601
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,973
- Our achievements in government...
- Would you excuse me'?

602
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,287
...must dwarf our achievements
in opposition.

603
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,480
There will be battles.
There will be conflicts.

604
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:37,022
But they will be fought

605
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,987
not on the sands of Morocco,

606
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,983
but on the floor of the chamber.

607
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:43,029
(man) Hear, hear.

608
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,652
<i>(Laroche) My first act
as foreign minister</i>

609
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,327
is to recall General Boutin
from Algiers.

610
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,208
There will be no minister of war
in this government.

611
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,498
- (guests cheering)
- Hear this, my friends.

612
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,041
People of France...

613
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,880
I don't have to ask how you are.

614
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,504
I've been very pleased for you.

615
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,680
How's Laurine?

616
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,674
She still hasn't forgiven you.

617
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,143
She calls you Monsieur Forestier now.

618
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,146
She's too young to understand.

619
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,108
And you'?

620
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,321
You made a good marriage.
We all have to do it.

621
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,035
And I miss you.

622
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,200
Our love nest feels cold without you.

623
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,041
You kept it on.

624
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,706
I'm an optimist.

625
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:39,047
(Laroche) Once and for all!
Morocco is safe.

626
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,837
(guests cheering)

627
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,713
(lively music playing)

628
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:50,176
- What a formidable partnership.
- Very kind. Thank you.

629
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,560
(man) Well done.

630
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,484
(guests chattering)

631
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,730
Thank you.

632
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,094
Come. Play a hand.

633
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,598
<i>Sit.</i>

634
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,398
Let my boy deal.

635
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,777
I warn you, I'm on a winning streak.

636
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,959
(sighs)

637
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,091
I'm more powerful than a king.

638
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,142
Not as rich.

639
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,639
(chuckling)

640
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,433
Not yet, anyway

641
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,150
In a mere morning,
I emptied the Chamber of Deputies,

642
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,652
and filled it again
with men of my choosing,

643
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,994
with nothing more than words on a page.

644
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,744
They're not your words, though.

645
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,331
Are they?

646
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,527
How's married life?

647
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,533
How do you get along with Vaudrec?

648
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,163
He visits quite often.

649
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,545
I dare say it's only fair.
After all, he does own the apartment.

650
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:27,999
Duroy?

651
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:37,972
Yes, he set them up in the apartment
after he married Madeleine to Forestier.

652
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:42,060
He married Madeleine to Forestier?

653
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,477
Well, he introduced them
and then he paid the dowry,

654
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,655
so I suppose
that is how you would put it.

655
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,028
Vaudrec is a father to her.

656
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,411
Hmm.

657
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:57,575
Perhaps.

658
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,327
Why don't you go and enjoy the party?

659
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,038
I'm sure the ladies will want a dance.

660
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,670
<i>Bel ami.</i>

661
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,311

662
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,832

(Georges exhales)

664
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,812
What brings you here?

665
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,646
You were caught in the rain?

666
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,500
No, I didn't come here by chance.

667
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,052
I don't mean to frighten you.

668
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,392
I expect nothing. I ask for nothing.

669
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,232
I don't even know what I'm doing.

670
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,071
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

671
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,405
No.

672
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,405
No, you’re not offended me.

673
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,534
But we must talk of it no longer.

674
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,669
Shall I leave'?

675
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,087
Shall I stay? I...

676
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,681
(gasps)

677
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,294
Is there any hope for me?

678
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,476
You are trying to seduce me in a church.

679
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:01,424
I've never had a lover before.

680
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,409
Look at me.

681
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,787
Does your husband
tell you you're beautiful?

682
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,009
(gasps)

683
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,322
Virginie. Virginie.

684
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,077
Georges.

685
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,372
Whose arms are these?

686
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,998
They're mine.

687
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,378
- And whose lips?
- Virginie.

688
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,176
Whose lips?

689
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,675
They're my lips.

690
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,138
- Now, come on.
- Hmm.

691
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,264
Get dressed.

692
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,355
When will I see you again?

693
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,852
Please leave.

694
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,393
My beautiful Georges.

695
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,070
My darling boy, please tell me when.

696
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,190
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow!

697
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,696
Yes, tomorrow.

698
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,699
Well... (giggles)

699
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,512
- (door opens)
- (Clotilde) Georges?

700
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,260
Georges?

701
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,593
<i>(Georges) Hmm.</i>

702
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,185
Georges?

703
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,398
Georges?

704
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,355
Madeleine will be wondering
where you are.

705
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,085
Madeleine?

706
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,050
Madeleine?

707
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,643
Where's my wife?

708
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,067
<i>She's with the Comte de Vaudrec.</i>

709
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,986
What?

710
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,780
He died this morning.

711
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,660
I have asked you here today,
Madame Duroy de Cantel,

712
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,492
to hear the will
of the Comte de Vaudrec.

713
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,919
The Comte has named you, madame,

714
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,292
as the sole inheritor of his estate,

715
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,383
the value of which stands at

716
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,883
one million, eighty thousand
and fifteen francs.

717
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,553
And 29 centimes.

718
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:43,013
There is one complication.

719
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,315
Uh, the nature of the legacy.

720
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,148
The nature of the legacy?

721
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,818
Uh...

722
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,988
If you'll forgive me, sir,

723
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:02,746
it is unusual for an estate to be left
solely to a married woman.

724
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,827
It would normally be left
to the husband.

725
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,299
And why is that?

726
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:17,806
To avoid any suggestion of, forgive me,

727
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:22,056
impropriety in the relationship.

728
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,153
(sighs) What was he to you, hmm?

729
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,451
What was he thinking,
the stupid old bastard?

730
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,739
He should have left it all to me.

731
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,961
It would have been much better for you.

732
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,555
He must have known
what people would make of it.

733
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,305
He must have realised
how it would compromise you.

734
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,019
Unless it was done in innocence.

735
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,813
A fatherly gesture.

736
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,563
He was like a father to you, wasn't he?

737
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,110
A guardian.

738
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,237
(sighs)

739
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,907
I can't accept it.

740
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,415
I must protect my reputation.

741
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,454
I don't want a million francs.

742
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,084
(sighs)

743
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,375
<i>(Georges) Come on, let's not be hasty.</i>

744
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,799
I'm sure we can reach some kind of...

745
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,219
(chuckles)

746
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,688
But the will is there for all to see.

747
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,192
I can only redeem it by rejecting it.

748
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,276
(Georges sighs)

749
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,784
But if I, your husband,
chose to accept it,

750
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,787
then who is to question me, hmm?

751
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,910
Mmm?

752
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,917
Indeed,

753
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,293
to refuse is to admit the shame.

754
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,424
Whereas,

755
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,470
to accept is to deny it.

756
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,191
(Georges sighs)

757
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,446
Good.

758
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,046
Perhaps your old man
wasn't so stupid after all.

759
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,589
(tearfully) Don't speak of him.

760
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,840
What was he to you?

761
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,098
Tell me.

762
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,015
Tell me. I deserve an answer.

763
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,520
(sobbing)

764
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,202
He is the man I have lost.

765
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,367
The man I am grieving.

766
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:42,093
You want it to be something small,

767
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:46,598
something squalid and contemptible.

768
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,181
He was my friend.

769
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,484
My father.

770
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,529
And my lover.

771
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,793
(Madeleine sobbing)

772
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,370
You loved him.

773
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,340
Ah!

774
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:28,172
(wailing)

775
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:32,393
(Madeleine sobbing)

776
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,727
(sobbing) How will I live?

777
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,648
How will I live?

778
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,533
You haven't been to see me for a while.

779
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,708
For a whole week
I've waited for a word from you.

780
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,537
Georges, my beautiful boy.

781
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,338
Don't call me that.

782
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,301
- (horse neighing)
- (man) Make way there! Make way!

783
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,845
Make way!

784
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,590
They're not for you.

785
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,267
You're meeting someone else.

786
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,145
Take me with you. I need to talk to you.

787
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,019
- Just for an hour.
- Remember where you are!

788
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,645
Remember where you are.

789
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,736
You shouldn't have seduced me.

790
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:28,695
You should have left me where I was,
a happy and faithful wife.

791
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,494
Please, let me come with you.
Please, just for an hour.

792
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,323
I've got something
so important to tell you.

793
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,534
Something to your advantage.

794
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,210
It's about my husband.

795
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,006
Please.

796
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:53,007
If you're going to cry you should leave.

797
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,100
Please, Georges.

798
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,305
Oh, my darling Georges.

799
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,724
My beautiful boy.

800
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,398
I have been so clever.

801
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,646
So discreet.

802
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,320
I've asked all the right questions.

803
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,534
I've listened carefully.

804
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,328
- (gasps)
- Oh, come on!

805
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,871
What?

806
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,123
Our new government
is going to take Morocco.

807
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,630
(laughs)

808
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:41,514
Virginie, the new government
came to power,

809
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,975
I brought them to power,

810
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,935
on the promise that they would not.

811
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,941
That's the whole point.

812
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,697
Don't you see?

813
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,025
No one's expecting it.

814
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,989
My husband and Laroche have been
hatching this plan for a long time.

815
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:59,324
The first troops sail tonight.

816
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,458
Tonight.

817
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,253
But they would have included me.

818
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,335
They don't trust you.

819
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,876
They think you're too impulsive.

820
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,136
Too greedy, they say.
Not used to having money.

821
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,095
They think that you'll give them away.

822
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,426
(scoffs) They think I'm too greedy.

823
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:20,432
They don't know you as I do.

824
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,853
Over the past few weeks
they've bought the entire Moroccan loan.

825
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:28,562
They've bought every copper mine
in Morocco. Every last one.

826
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,648
They stand to make 70 million apiece.

827
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,994
Seventy million.

828
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,071
He's spending it already.

829
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,533
He's going to buy
the Palais Saint-Honor.

830
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,708
Seventy million
and I've shamed myself for a pittance.

831
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,754
Aren't you proud of me?

832
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,757
Don't you love me?

833
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,002
Haven't I done well
finding this out, my darling?

834
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,347
I've bought shares for you, too.

835
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,509
And they'll make you at least 70,000.

836
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,892
- (whimpers)
- I don't want your pennies!

837
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,853
They're not worth the price
I paid for them!

838
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,854
(gasps and whimpers)

839
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,654
You disgust me!

840
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,486
But I love you.

841
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,197
I don't want your love.
I've never loved you.

842
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,583
Your smell, it turns my stomach.

843
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,412
Because you smell of him.

844
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,417
Your filthy husband!

845
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,794
I used to laugh, every time I'd had you,

846
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,922
to think I'd sent you back to him
with my sweat on your skin.

847
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:37,221
When all the while, it was me!

848
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,344
I was the one getting fucked!

849
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:40,890
Me!

850
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,330
- Get out of my house.
- Just listen to them, Georges.

851
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,367
Get out! Get out of my house!

852
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,208
<i>(Madeleine) Listen to them, Georges.
Just listen to what they have to say.</i>

853
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,415
lam going to ruin you.

854
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,876
Don't be a child.
Consider your best interests.

855
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,802
There's still money to be made.

856
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,639
You think I've robbed you.

857
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,808
You're not my responsibility.

858
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,477
The opportunity was there for anyone
who had eyes to see it.

859
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,686
You!

860
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,985
You were an embarrassment to Charles.

861
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:40,447
A failed soldier, barely literate.

862
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,696
He said you'd never amount to much.

863
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,452
Seems he was right.

864
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,288
Pity you didn't marry more wisely.

865
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:54,415
You'll be missed.

866
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,434
You knew.

867
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,435
Don't be absurd, Georges.

868
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,562
How could I know?

869
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:22,994
I'm a woman.
I'm not invited to the card game. Hmm?

870
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,916
Who was it today, hmm?

871
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,335
Clotilde?

872
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,209
Or Virginie?

873
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,710
Or both?

874
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,084
And yesterday?

875
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,511
You stupid, stupid man.

876
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,425
You complete and perfect man.

877
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,140
(Madeleine laughs scornfully)

878
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,770
I poured my talent into you.

879
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,270
My intelligence.

880
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,444
My vision into you.

881
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:01,862
I had no conception of the depths
of your emptiness.

882
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,739
Nothing.

883
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,787
There is nothing there.

884
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,331
Nothing but rage.

885
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,874
Like a dumb animal.

886
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,921
That's what you are. An animal.

887
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,917
I thought I could teach you.

888
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,047
But what I should have done
was train you.

889
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,311
(door slams)

890
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,398
(grunting)

891
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,322
(crowd cheering)

892
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,910
Aah! Ah!

893
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,912
(laughs)

894
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:51,619
(grunting)

895
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,200
Get out of it!

896
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,401
(conversing indistinctly)

897
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,994
(instrumental music playing)

898
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,306
Excuse me.

899
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,671
I always liked your audacity.

900
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,216
I don't need to hide my face.
I'm not the criminal.

901
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,043
- You're not gonna throw me out.
- No.

902
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,135
Stay. Drink my champagne.
Dance with my wife.

903
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,309
Yours, I see, is already spoken for.

904
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,379
(Clotilde) Georges. Georges?

905
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,319
(sighs)

906
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:37,789
I've been such a fool.

907
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,352
Why do you come back to me?

908
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,356
I don't know.

909
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,983
Perhaps because you never expect me to.

910
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,370
I am sorry I hurt you.

911
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,115
It is worth saying.

912
01:25:58,195 --> 01:26:01,540
(Clotilde) I've never seen
such a host of buck-toothed cretins.

913
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,501
Everyone a noble bankrupt.

914
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:07,921
All here for Suzanne
and her thirty million francs.

915
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,215
(gasps)

916
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,961
Open this door or we will force it!

917
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,959
<i>- (Madeleine) Who is it?
- Police.</i>

918
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,760
Madame Madeleine Duroy de Cantel?

919
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,264
Wife of
Monsieur Georges Duroy de Cantel?

920
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:00,966
Yes.

921
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,974
(gasps)

922
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,111
Madame Duroy de Cantel,

923
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:17,241
I have found you here in a place
that is not your home

924
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,152
with Monsieur Francois Laroche.

925
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,996
Do you admit
that this man is your lover?

926
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,994
I admit it.

927
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:29,495
Madame, I have no choice
but to charge you with adultery.

928
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,417
Is there anything that you wish to say?

929
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,170
- No.
- (Georges) Let's leave her in peace.

930
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,961
We have no further business here.

931
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,931
What should I do'? Should I go?

932
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,097
No, stay.

933
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,598
Finish, if you like.

934
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,694
Well, you'll hear from my lawyer
in a few days.

935
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,486
Goodbye, Georges.

936
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,698
Goodbye.

937
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,717
(laughs) I couldn't get away.

938
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:28,891
They were shouting and screaming,
on and on. (laughs)

939
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,935
Maman wouldn't stop crying and wailing,

940
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,024
she was like a madwoman.

941
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,779
I wish I could see their faces
when they find me gone.

942
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:39,899
<i>Papa will turn blue!</i>

943
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,570
Oh! (laughs)

944
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,407
(driver) Whoa!

945
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,253
We'll need two rooms.

946
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,602
Good night, Suzanne.

947
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,100
But...

948
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,646
I need a good-night kiss.

949
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,121
You should get some sleep.

950
01:29:28,156 --> 01:29:29,579
But...

951
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:31,161
Get some sleep.

952
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,639
<i>Papa.</i>

953
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:56,975
<i>Maman.</i>

954
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,995
- He will not marry her.
- I should have seen it coming.

955
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,998
He will not marry her!

956
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:22,877
I will not suffer it!

957
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,844
<i>(Rousset) He will marry her.</i>

958
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,343
He must marry her.

959
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:30,513
And you will accept it, Virginie.

960
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,511
This is as much your doing
as it is mine.

961
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:34,058
My doing!

962
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:38,476
Your infatuation for him
infected my daughter!

963
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:42,646
He will marry her
and I will be glad of it.

964
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,863
What more can a father wish for

965
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,528
than to see his daughter
with a man he can respect?

966
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,340
She's only a child.

967
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:10,090
- Do you love her?
- No.

968
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,347
She's of no interest to me.

969
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,687
Poor little Suzanne.

970
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:24,067
Suzanne's her father.
Just in perfect miniature.

971
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:28,734
- You've ruined her.
- I haven't. I'm going to marry her.

972
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,912
Did you sleep with her?

973
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,874
No.

974
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,208
You didn't sleep with her?

975
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,621
I didn't touch her. I didn't need to.

976
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,090
It was enough for people to think I had.

977
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,919
I don't know you at all.

978
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,219
You do.

979
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,598
Oh, do I? (scoffs)

980
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,809
You planned it.

981
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,429
You planned it.

982
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,141
You ruined Laroche.

983
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,772
You humiliated Madeleine.

984
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,400
You humiliated her.

985
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,658
All so you could take Suzanne.

986
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,780
Suzanne chose me
because I was the only one

987
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:14,450
- she wasn't allowed to have.
- And me?

988
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,745
Did you ever think
how this would hurt me?

989
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:21,002
It has nothing to do with you.

990
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,500
(tearfully) Then why am I in pain?

991
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,131
I don't know.

992
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,339
You didn't even tell me yourself.

993
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,804
I had to hear it from my husband.

994
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,885
You think I'll forgive you anything.

995
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,975
I will not be stopped, Clotilde.

996
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:38,512
I will marry her.

997
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,767
You're just one of them, after all.

998
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:51,450
Just another selfish, brutal man.

999
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,652
Just another thief.

1000
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:57,117
It's not enough to be loved, is it?

1001
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,991
No, you must be a king.

1002
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,036
No.

1003
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,499
It's not enough to be loved.

1004
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,501
Even by you.

1005
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:14,222
I loved you when you had nothing.

1006
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:19,265
I don't understand
why you must be so proud.

1007
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,101
I don't understand.

1008
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:26,060
That's because you've never been poor.

1009
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:29,779
Trying to scrape out some
miserable scrap of an existence.

1010
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,067
I can't live like that.

1011
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,907
Like my father.

1012
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,539
Working to the bone,

1013
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:44,748
and then down on his knees every week,

1014
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,585
praying to God that
the next life will be better.

1015
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,460
Well, there is no next life.

1016
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,765
The flesh, it rots in the earth.

1017
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,226
It rots.

1018
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:04,772
I have seen a man die.

1019
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,065
And I am going to live.

1020
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,775
It's so clear to me.

1021
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,907
I thought you would understand.

1022
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,939
(dialogue silent)

1023
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:33,144
- (echoing chatter)
- (bells pealing)

1024
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,819
(people applauding)
