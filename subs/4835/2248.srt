00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
片名《换子疑云》
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
一个真实的故事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

3
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
洛杉矶 1928年3月9日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

4
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,075
沃特,宝贝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter, honey.{\r}

5
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:11,942
该起床了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Time to wake up.{\r}

6
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:13,304
再让我睡10分钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just 10 more minutes.{\r}

7
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,609
那可不行，小运动家 你可以明天再睡个够
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I'm sorry, sport. You can sleep in tomorrow.{\r}

8
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,273
星期六才是用来睡懒觉的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what Saturdays are for.{\r}

9
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,322
靠墙站好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Up against the wall.{\r}

10
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:28,952
来，来，来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come, come, come.{\r}

11
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,459
好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

12
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,656
好了，你看看！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Got it. Got it. Look, look!{\r}

13
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,131
好了，坐下吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, sit down.{\r}

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,690
你的早餐要冷掉了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your breakfast is getting cold.{\r}

15
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,099
明明就是麦片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's cereal.{\r}

16
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,602
麦片本来就是冷的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's supposed to be cold.{\r}

17
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,086
甜心，我们到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sweetheart, we're here.{\r}

18
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:03,854
走吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay.{\r}

19
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,036
这是你的书
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here's your books.{\r}

20
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,372
去吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go ahead.{\r}

21
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,190
好的，女士，请您稍微等一下 我去给你找下主管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment, I'll get a supervisor for you.{\r}

22
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,085
好的，她马上就过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, she's coming right now.{\r}

23
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,720
稍等一下，她马上就到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just a second, she'll be with you.{\r}

24
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:15,699
请您稍等 你来处理这事，我管不了了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just one second, please. You deal with this one. I'm not going near it.{\r}

25
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:19,671
你好，我是主管 我能帮你做什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello, this is the supervisor. How can I help you?{\r}

26
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,938
我发现你那里有多个用户在通话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can see you're on a party line...{\r}

27
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,110
很遗憾，的确会有人通过多人电话偷听，我们…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Unfortunately, some people do listen in on party lines. We...{\r}

28
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,806
他在干什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, what is he doing?{\r}

29
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,107
哦，我的…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my...{\r}

30
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,516
一切都还好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything all right?{\r}

31
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:39,149
是的，长官，一切正常 有位女士暂时无法接通
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was having trouble with the connection.{\r}

32
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,949
嘿，小运动家 嘿，妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, sport. Hey, Mom.{\r}

33
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,425
你在学校怎么样？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How was school?{\r}

34
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,723
还行 是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay. Yeah?{\r}

35
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,764
我们教了恐龙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We learned about dinosaurs.{\r}

36
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,129
然后我和比利・曼克维斯基打了架
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.{\r}

37
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,258
怎么回事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What happened?{\r}

38
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,461
他打我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He hit me.{\r}

39
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,060
你打回去了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you hit him back?{\r}

40
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,435
干的好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.{\r}

41
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,768
第一条，还记得吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Rule number one, remember?{\r}

42
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,536
永远不要主动打架，但要做个赢家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never start a fight, always finish it.{\r}

43
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,768
他为什么要打你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why'd he hit you?{\r}

44
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,142
因为我打了他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because I hit him.{\r}

45
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,505
你先打他的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You hit him first?{\r}

46
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,040
为什么打他？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why?{\r}

47
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,686
他说爸爸是因为不喜欢我才走的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.{\r}

48
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:12,121
宝贝，你爸爸根本没有见过你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Honey, your father never met you,{\r}

49
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,125
那他又怎么会不喜欢你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so how could he not like you?{\r}

50
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,990
可他为什么要走呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then why did he leave?{\r}

51
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:21,021
因为在你出生的那天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, because the day you were born,{\r}

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,500
他收到了一个包裹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}something else arrived in the mail.{\r}

53
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,495
是个比你稍微大一点的盒子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And it was in a box a little bit bigger than you.{\r}

54
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,198
你知道里面装的是什么吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what was in it?{\r}

55
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,036
是一种叫做责任的东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something called responsibility.{\r}

56
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,099
对有些人来说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And to some people,{\r}

57
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,941
责任是世界上最最吓人的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}responsibility is the scariest thing in the world.{\r}

58
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:39,378
所以，他离开是因为盒子里有个最最吓人的东西？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, he ran away because he was scared of what was in that box?{\r}

59
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:40,476
嗯-哼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uh-huh.{\r}

60
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:41,884
听起来好傻
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's just dumb.{\r}

61
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,717
我也是这么想的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is exactly what I thought.{\r}

62
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,867
我是不是错过《阿莫斯和安迪》了？ [备注：20年代在美国很流行的情景喜剧]
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?{\r}

63
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,837
恐怕是的，小运动家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid so, sport.{\r}

64
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,771
来吧，该睡觉了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come now, time for bed.{\r}

65
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,510
我们明天还去看电影吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are we still going to the movies tomorrow?{\r}

66
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,847
嗯哼，我听说有一部查理・卓别林的新电影
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin picture{\r}

67
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:15,716
还有一部新的连续剧，叫做神秘的飞行员
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.{\r}

68
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,182
那是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's that?{\r}

69
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,224
不知道，没有人知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know. Nobody does.{\r}

70
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,452
所以他才会那么神秘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what makes him so mysterious.{\r}

71
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,516
哦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh.{\r}

72
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,022
是不是我太重，你抱不动了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Am I too heavy for you to carry?{\r}

73
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,759
哦，不是，至少这几年还不会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no, not for years.{\r}

74
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,323
这几年
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not for years.{\r}

75
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,368
- 你好？ - 我是玛格瑞特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello? This is Margaret.{\r}

76
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,605
嗨，玛格瑞特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Margaret.{\r}

77
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,668
你过的还好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, how are you?{\r}

78
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,975
挺好的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine.{\r}

79
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,312
我想跟你说，简今天没法来了，我们这里缺个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, Jean can't come in today and now we're a little shorthanded.{\r}

80
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:46,612
她什么时候打电话来说生病的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When did she call in sick?{\r}

81
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:47,743
大概半个小时前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}About half hour ago.{\r}

82
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,481
这时候我实在找不到其他人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm having a hard time trying to find someone.{\r}

83
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:51,284
摩尔娜呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, what about Myrna?{\r}

84
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:52,722
我知道她肯定愿意花个把钟头，而且…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know she could use the extra hours and...{\r}

85
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,884
她很忙的，你不能来帮忙吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's busy. Can't you come?{\r}

86
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,722
不行 不，我不是这个意思，只是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No, no, no. I just...{\r}

87
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:03,431
我答应沃特说要带他去看电影的，所以…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I promised Walter that I'd take him to the movies, is all, and...{\r}

88
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,901
没事的，就到4点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, it's just until 4:00.{\r}

89
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,164
那好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

90
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,035
但是… 就到4点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just... Just until 4:00.{\r}

91
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,105
我们等下见
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see you then.{\r}

92
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,273
冰箱里有三明治和牛奶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's a sandwich and milk in the fridge,{\r}

93
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,874
我已经请莱利太太和她女儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I've asked Mrs. Riley and her daughter{\r}

94
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,715
过来照顾你几个小时了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to stop in in a couple of hours.{\r}

95
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,948
我能照顾好自己
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can take care of myself.{\r}

96
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,651
我知道你可以的，他们是来照看房子，不是照顾你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know you can. They're checking on the house, not you.{\r}

97
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,630
明天我们就去看电影
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tomorrow we will go to the movies.{\r}

98
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:42,674
然后我们会坐大红号去圣莫尼卡 在那边的码头散步
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa Monica and take a walk on the pier.{\r}

99
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,971
你觉得怎么样？听起来会很好玩吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How does that sound? Does that sound good?{\r}

100
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,344
天黑之前我会回家的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll be home before it gets dark.{\r}

101
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,310
我不怕黑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not afraid of the dark.{\r}

102
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,181
我什么都不怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not afraid of anything.{\r}

103
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,818
我知道，我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know. I know.{\r}

104
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,950
乖乖的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Be good.{\r}

105
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:03,685
我爱你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I love you.{\r}

106
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,499
我们这里到俄亥俄州的线路堵住了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio.{\r}

107
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,001
他说他要跟负责人讲话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He says he needs to speak to somebody in charge.{\r}

108
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:47,731
我要申请些日用必需品，帮我签个名
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need your signature here for a supply requisition.{\r}

109
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,831
请问您要接什么号码？ 您要接什么号码？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Number, please. Number, please.{\r}

110
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,176
请继续
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go ahead, please.{\r}

111
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,243
好了，给我接奥马哈中继站
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, get me the Omaha routing station.{\r}

112
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,715
看看我们能不能通过那里中转电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See if we can put our calls through their switchers.{\r}

113
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,376
让我们试试看吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's get this console running, now.{\r}

114
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,023
克莉斯汀，做得不错 我一直想要找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christine. Good, I was hoping to catch you.{\r}

115
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,486
听着，我一直在关注你的工作情况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I've been following your work reports,{\r}

116
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,757
我想告诉你的是我非常满意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I just want to let you know that I am very impressed.{\r}

117
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,265
最初我建议使用女性接线员当主管的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I first suggested hiring female supervisors,{\r}

118
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,892
上头表现地不是很感冒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}my superiors weren't big on the idea.{\r}

119
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,836
结果你的表现和你的那些男同事一样出色
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you have held your own as well as any of your male counterparts.{\r}

120
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:20,929
谢谢夸奖，哈里斯先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you, Mr. Harris.{\r}

121
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,530
哦，本，请你不要 听着，我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Ben, please. Listen, I...{\r}

122
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,700
听着，重点是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, the point is,{\r}

123
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,574
我们准备给我们新的贝佛利山办公室找个经理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we're looking to take on a manager for our new Beverly Hills office.{\r}

124
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,671
如果你有兴趣的话，我可以给你打个报告，或者…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if you're interested in the job, I could write a report, or...{\r}

125
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,545
那再好不过了，太谢谢你了，先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That would be wonderful. Thank you so much, sir.{\r}

126
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,881
没错，很好 那么，也许我们可以…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, good, so maybe we could...{\r}

127
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,419
我们可以好好谈一下 星期一，当然可以，没问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Could we speak about it Monday? Yeah, absolutely.{\r}

128
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,978
星期一真的可以吗？非常感谢，谢谢您，先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would that be all right? Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.{\r}

129
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:47,360
等一下！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please!{\r}

130
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,264
别走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

131
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,366
沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter.{\r}

132
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,465
宝贝？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Honey?{\r}

133
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,807
沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter.{\r}

134
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,371
沃特!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter!{\r}

135
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,742
宝贝？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Honey?{\r}

136
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,323
沃特?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter?{\r}

137
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,964
宝贝！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Honey!{\r}

138
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,405
沃特!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter!{\r}

139
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:07,037
沃特，回家的时间到了，宝贝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter, it's time to come in, honey.{\r}

140
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:12,807
苏希，你看见沃特没有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Suzie? Have you seen Walter?{\r}

141
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:15,778
没有，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

142
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,048
抱歉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry.{\r}

143
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:27,857
沃特?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter?{\r}

144
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,601
沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter.{\r}

145
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:57,990
请告诉我您要拨打的号码
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Number, please.{\r}

146
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,088
请给我接警察局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May I please have the police station?{\r}

147
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,689
我正在帮您接通
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll connect you.{\r}

148
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,756
这里是林肯高地分局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lincoln Heights Division.{\r}

149
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,632
你好，我叫克莉斯汀・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello, my name is Christine Collins.{\r}

150
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,228
我住在北大街210号23楼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I live at 210 North Avenue, 23.{\r}

151
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,207
我要报失踪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I'm calling to report a missing child.{\r}

152
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,742
失踪儿童
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Missing child.{\r}

153
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,870
女士，你和孩子的关系是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your relation to the child, ma'am?{\r}

154
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,346
是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's my son.{\r}

155
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,642
他不见多长时间了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How long has he been gone?{\r}

156
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,110
我也不知道，我刚下班回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not sure. I just got home from work.{\r}

157
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,616
可能是今天早上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It could be since this morning{\r}

158
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,419
也有可能就在刚才
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or it could be just the last hour.{\r}

159
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,549
你在附近找过了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you checked around the neighborhood?{\r}

160
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,355
是的，我当然找过了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, of course I did.{\r}

161
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,487
那，也有可能他玩的忘了时间了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, maybe he's lost track of time.{\r}

162
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,825
不，不，不会的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No, no.{\r}

163
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:36,334
天黑了以后他肯定会呆在房子里的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He always stays around the house when it gets dark.{\r}

164
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,460
你能不能派人来这里？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you please send someone down here?{\r}

165
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,935
很抱歉，根据我们的制度
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry, but our policy is that{\r}

166
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:43,964
只有在孩子失踪超过24小时后我们才会派人进行搜救
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for 24 hours.{\r}

167
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,302
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

168
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,836
你知道吗，这种案子十有八九小孩子会在第二天早上回来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, 99 times out of 100, the kid shows up by morning.{\r}

169
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:53,816
我们可没有那么多人手来找每个 和朋友跑出去玩的小家伙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We don't have the resources to go chasing every kid who runs off with his pals.{\r}

170
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,978
不，不，不是那样的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no.{\r}

171
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,681
沃特不是那样的，他从来不会那么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, that's not Walter. He doesn't do that.{\r}

172
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:02,090
请原谅我实话实说，太太 每个家长都是这么跟我说的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With all due respect, ma'am, every parent who calls says the same thing.{\r}

173
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:05,187
求你了，求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, please.{\r}

174
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,925
你看，我没有办法帮你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, there's nothing I can do.{\r}

175
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,466
我会记下你的名字和其他信息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll take your name and your information,{\r}

176
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,161
不过最快要到明天早上我们才能派人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but that's all until the morning, at the earliest.{\r}

177
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,262
我确定他会在那之前回来的，孩子们都这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure he'll show up by then. They always do.{\r}

178
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,429
你是柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you Mrs. Collins?{\r}

179
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:03,712
我们今天将为来自林肯高地的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Our thoughts go out again today to Mrs. Christine Collins{\r}

180
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,222
克莉斯汀・柯林斯太太祈祷
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of Lincoln Heights,{\r}

181
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,451
她的孩子沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}whose young son, Walter Collins,{\r}

182
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:10,051
在大概两周前失踪了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}disappeared nearly two weeks ago.{\r}

183
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,587
尽管她并非我们的成员
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Though she is not a member of our congregation,{\r}

184
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,394
我们会和往常一样为她祈祷
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we pray for her today as we have every day,{\r}

185
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,704
因为我们知道她的困境
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}since we learned of her plight.{\r}

186
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,639
从报纸和广播里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On the radio and in the newspapers{\r}

187
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,645
我们知道洛杉矶警局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we are told that the Los Angeles Police Department{\r}

188
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:32,309
正在尽力帮助这位母亲和她的儿子团聚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is doing its very best to reunite mother and child,{\r}

189
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,784
我相信他们没有撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I'm sure that that is true.{\r}

190
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:40,951
但是作为洛基山脉西边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But given its status as the most violent, corrupt{\r}

191
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,994
最暴力、腐败和最不称职
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and incompetent police department{\r}

192
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,291
的警察分局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}this side of the Rocky Mountains{\r}

193
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,822
我不清楚他们是否对此有足够的重视
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am not sure it's saying a great deal.{\r}

194
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:59,807
每一天，穆赫兰道或是城市的路沟边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every day, new bodies appear along Mulholland{\r}

195
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:01,903
都有新的尸体出现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and in the ditches of our cities,{\r}

196
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,385
对于警察局长詹姆斯・戴维斯 和他手下的炮团来说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the work of Police Chief James Davis and his aptly named Gun Squad.{\r}

197
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:11,820
众多市民的真正需求被弃置一旁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every day, the needs of honest citizens{\r}

198
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,122
取而代之的是贪婪和中饱私囊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}are put second to greed and personal gain.{\r}

199
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:22,689
这个城市正在一天天的沉沦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every day, this city sinks deeper into a cesspool{\r}

200
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:27,569
变成充斥惊惧、恐吓和腐败的污水池
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of fear, intimidation and corruption.{\r}

201
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,039
在洛杉矶，曾经的天使之城里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Once the City of Angels,{\r}

202
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:35,171
我们的保护者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Los Angeles has become a place where our protectors{\r}

203
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,738
转而成为了施暴者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}have become our brutalizers.{\r}

204
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:42,780
法律的守护者却悍然践踏法律之上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where to be the law is to be above the law.{\r}

205
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,780
1928年4月3日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

206
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,160
我知道了，谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I understand. Thank you.{\r}

207
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,034
我过几个星期会再给你电话的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I will call back in a few weeks.{\r}

208
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,370
非常谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much.{\r}

209
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,943
拉斯维加斯失踪人口科？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Las Vegas Missing Persons Department?{\r}

210
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:44,244
你好，我是克莉斯汀・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello, this is Christine Collins.{\r}

211
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:47,183
我想问下你那里有没有找到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm calling to see if you've found any missing or lost children{\r}

212
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:51,120
符合沃特・柯林斯外貌特征的失踪儿童
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}who meet the description that matches Walter Collins.{\r}

213
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,026
哦，我知道了，好的，如果有消息的话，请你务必给我电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, all right. Well, please do. Please do call.{\r}

214
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:57,652
如果可以，我会再打电话给…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I'll call back in a matter...{\r}

215
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,493
再过一周打过来，非常感谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In a week, if that's all right. Thank you very much.{\r}

216
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,554
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

217
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,477
2美金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}$2.{\r}

218
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,458
该死的，我大概是把钱包落在家里了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hell, I think I left my wallet at home.{\r}

219
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,429
我能先欠着么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I owe it to you?{\r}

220
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:34,926
不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No credit.{\r}

221
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,661
付钱，不然我就叫警察了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pay up or I call the cops.{\r}

222
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,566
你这种无赖让我恶心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sick of bums like you coming around here.{\r}

223
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,070
我也不想让你难做，厨子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.{\r}

224
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,629
我只是把钱包落在家里了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just left my wallet at home, that's all.{\r}

225
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:45,676
我现在就回去拿，5分钟，不，最多就10分钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll go back and get it. Five, 10 minutes, tops.{\r}

226
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,641
你有东西抵押么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Got collateral?{\r}

227
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,481
那么没什么比把我的亲生骨肉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't ask for better collateral{\r}

228
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,849
抵押在这里更让你放心的了吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}than a man's own flesh and blood, right?{\r}

229
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,445
孩子，现在你等在这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, you stay here, son.{\r}

230
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,054
我很快就回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll be right back.{\r}

231
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,649
不过…你别给我惹麻烦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But... Now, don't give me any trouble.{\r}

232
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,717
这位先生肯信我们，他是个好人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a good man to trust us like this.{\r}

233
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:08,363
你现在给我乖乖等在这里，我回去拿我的钱包
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, you just stay here and I'll go back and get my wallet.{\r}

234
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:14,070
给你10分钟，不然我就打电话给警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ten minutes, then I call the cops.{\r}

235
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,739
啊，该死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ah, hell.{\r}

236
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,313
请您告诉我要接通的号码 哈，莫尔托?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Number, please. Hello, Myrtle?{\r}

237
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,255
哈，你好，我是哈尔夫，饭店的那个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello? Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.{\r}

238
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:35,384
哦，嗨，哈尔夫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, hi, Harve.{\r}

239
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,620
能帮我找下治安官拉尔森吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you get me Sheriff Larsen?{\r}

240
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:37,593
没问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure thing.{\r}

241
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,126
你今天过得很不错吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have a nice day, too.{\r}

242
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,630
克莉斯汀，我这里接不通
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christine, I'm having trouble with the connection here.{\r}

243
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,570
我怎么也没法接通
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't seem to get through.{\r}

244
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,040
我想是这样，嗯，我想这样会好些
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.{\r}

245
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,415
你有个私人电话 费尔法克斯2331
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have a person to person call, Fairfax 2231.{\r}

246
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:59,973
是个长途电话，对不起，请您再说一遍？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Long distance. Sorry, can you repeat?{\r}

247
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,814
马上给您接过去，女士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll connect you right away, ma'am.{\r}

248
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,249
谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks.{\r}

249
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,166
柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins?{\r}

250
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,560
我是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

251
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:23,339
我是J.J.琼斯上尉 林肯公园少年案件组的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm Captain J.J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.{\r}

252
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,938
我这里负责处理所有离家出走和失踪儿童的案件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases,{\r}

253
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,878
包括你儿子的案子 然后…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}including your son's, and...{\r}

254
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,547
他还活着，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's alive, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

255
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:39,355
两天前他被伊利诺斯州德卡博当地的警察发现了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was picked up two days ago by local police in DeKalb, Illinois.{\r}

256
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,857
他很安全，没有受伤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's safe and unhurt.{\r}

257
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,356
他跟一群流浪汉混迹在一起， 我们在查全境通告时发现了他 [APB：all-points bulletin 全美法务机构联网发布通告的系统]
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was in the company of some drifter. We have an APB out for him,{\r}

258
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,455
不过他现在很安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but he's safe.{\r}

259
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,467
非常感谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you so much.{\r}

260
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,731
哦，克莉斯汀...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Christine...{\r}

261
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,037
这实在是太好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is so great.{\r}

262
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,075
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

263
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,726
外面有好多记者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's so much press.{\r}

264
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,803
因为你的故事有个好的结局 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

265
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,067
大家都喜欢看到圆满结局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People love happy endings.{\r}

266
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,505
我们最好走快点，火车已经进站了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We better get a move on, the train's pulling in.{\r}

267
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,014
后退，伙计们，后退
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Back, boys. Back.{\r}

268
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,146
谢谢，谢谢，小伙子们，谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks. Thanks, boys, thanks!{\r}

269
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,707
等会儿我会演说的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll have a statement for you in a few minutes,{\r}

270
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:41,843
不过现在最重要的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but the important thing right now{\r}

271
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,683
是让这位夫人和她的儿子团聚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is to reunite this little lady with her son,{\r}

272
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,120
所以请你们给我们留些时间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so if you'll excuse us.{\r}

273
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,388
慢点，不要跑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay right there. Come on, don't rush.{\r}

274
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,558
慢点，慢点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Easy, easy.{\r}

275
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,024
柯林斯太太，请允许我向你介绍詹姆斯・戴维斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to James E. Davis,{\r}

276
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,296
警察局长
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Chief of Police.{\r}

277
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,359
很高兴见到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Very nice to meet you.{\r}

278
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:00,802
最近这段时间里，我们可从来没
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We don't get a lot of positive attention{\r}

279
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,362
从媒体那些家伙那儿获得过正面评价
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}from the boys in the press these days,{\r}

280
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,931
所以能有个圆满的结局对我们彼此来说 都是再好不过了，你说是吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so it's good to be here with a positive story, don't you think?{\r}

281
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,067
是的，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.{\r}

282
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:10,513
我手底下的人对你的态度还好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department?{\r}

283
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:12,675
他们说我必须等人失踪24小时之后才报案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,{\r}

284
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,013
我觉得也许是不是可以…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I thought that maybe that was a...{\r}

285
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:15,518
不算制度上的问题呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Technicalities aside.{\r}

286
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,715
很好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was wonderful.{\r}

287
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,916
好的，很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, good.{\r}

288
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,860
那么你应该可以毫不犹豫地告诉那些记者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then you won't have any trouble telling that to the press,{\r}

289
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,862
实际上洛杉矶警局…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and the fact that the LAPD...{\r}

290
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,226
女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Women.{\r}

291
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:31,461
等一下，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold on a second.{\r}

292
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,135
伙计们，后退，后退
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Back, boys, back.{\r}

293
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,376
让他们往后退
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Keep them back.{\r}

294
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,860
好了，你是不是可以…请你…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, aren't you... Aren't you gonna...{\r}

295
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,200
这不是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's not my son.{\r}

296
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,636
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

297
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,209
你刚刚说什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you saying?{\r}

298
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,277
这不是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not my son.{\r}

299
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,714
是吗，我觉得你肯定是搞错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I'm sure you're mistaken.{\r}

300
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:20,876
我没有弄错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not mistaken.{\r}

301
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,580
你看，他这5个月来吃不好睡不好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, he's been through five terrible long months.{\r}

302
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,782
所以他瘦了，样子也变了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's lost weight, he's changed.{\r}

303
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,552
我难道不认识我自己的儿子吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I would know my own son.{\r}

304
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,423
我只能说你是太激动看错了 而且他样子也变了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All I'm saying is you're in shock and he's changed.{\r}

305
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:33,958
你叫什么名字？能告诉我你的名字吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's your name? Can you tell me your name?{\r}

306
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:35,659
沃特・柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter Collins.{\r}

307
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,392
这名字很多人用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a common name.{\r}

308
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,632
你住在哪里？沃特? 你知道家里的地址吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where do you live, Walter? You know your home address?{\r}

309
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:44,937
我住在加利福尼亚，洛杉矶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I live at 210 Avenue 23,{\r}

310
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,267
西大街210号，23楼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Los Angeles, California.{\r}

311
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,245
她就是我妈妈！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that's my mommy!{\r}

312
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:57,385
柯林斯太太, 听我说，我明白你的心情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, listen to me. I understand.{\r}

313
00:22:57,455 --> 00:23:00,447
你现在是不是觉得很忐忑，不敢确定？ 这是很常见的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're feeling a little uncertain right now, and that's to be expected.{\r}

314
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,891
这样年纪的孩子变得非常快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A boy this age, he changes so fast.{\r}

315
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,896
我们在检查的时候就确认过了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've compensated for that in our investigation.{\r}

316
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,933
毫无疑问，他就是你的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And there's no question that this is your son.{\r}

317
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,025
他不是沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is not Walter.{\r}

318
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:15,206
他不是你记忆里的沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not Walter as you remember him.{\r}

319
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:19,905
所以说你带他回去以后 进行一段时间的试生活是很有必要的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that's why it's important for you to take him home on a trial basis.{\r}

320
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,870
试生活？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A trial basis?{\r}

321
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,005
是的，是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, yes.{\r}

322
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:27,609
等他回到自己熟悉的环境后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Once he's around his familiar surroundings,{\r}

323
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,621
你要给他点时间 好从惊吓里恢复过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and you've given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition,{\r}

324
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:34,453
你就知道，他肯定是你的沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you will see that this is your Walter.{\r}

325
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,086
现在，我可以给你保证，我的话肯定没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I promise you, I swear to you, I give you my word.{\r}

326
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,788
他是你的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is your son.{\r}

327
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:42,424
现在，如果你还有任何问题，任何的问题都可以 请你告诉我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, if you have any problems, any problems at all, you come and you talk to me.{\r}

328
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,831
我来帮你处理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll take care of it.{\r}

329
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,835
我向你保证，相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I give you my word. Trust me.{\r}

330
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:51,898
柯林斯太太, 他没有别的地方可以去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, he has nowhere else to go.{\r}

331
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:56,875
求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

332
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:04,011
也许是我糊涂了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe I'm not thinking clearly.{\r}

333
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,919
而且…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And...{\r}

334
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:08,518
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

335
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,118
没错，是你刚才糊涂了，这样才对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, you're not thinking clearly, that's right.{\r}

336
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,628
我们走吧！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here we go!{\r}

337
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,462
谢谢，谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you. Thank you.{\r}

338
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:16,591
这里，在这里转弯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, just turn around here.{\r}

339
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,730
终于把你的孩子找回家了，说说你的感想吧 柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How does it feel to have your son home, Mrs. Collins?{\r}

340
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,794
当你再一次见到你儿子的时候，想到了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What'd you think when you saw him for the first time?{\r}

341
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,170
很难用语言描述
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's hard to explain.{\r}

342
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,072
一开始她有些惊讶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She was shocked at first.{\r}

343
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:28,112
她没有认出自己的孩子，不过这也很正常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She didn't recognize the boy, which is perfectly natural.{\r}

344
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,544
小家伙也遭受了不少磨难
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's been through quite an ordeal.{\r}

345
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,081
孩子，你现在在想什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How're you feeling, son?{\r}

346
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:32,207
能回到家心里一定很高兴吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bet it feels great to be home.{\r}

347
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:33,580
是的，非常高兴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. It's great.{\r}

348
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,812
洛杉矶警察局非常感谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful{\r}

349
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,084
德卡博郡治安官的不懈努力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for all the hard work done by the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department{\r}

350
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,785
让我们见到了这一场温馨的重逢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in making this joyful reunion possible.{\r}

351
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:44,555
洛杉矶警局时刻服务大众
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The LAPD is dedicated to serving the public at all times.{\r}

352
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:47,257
长官，我们能给孩子和他母亲照张合影吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can we get a photo with mother and son, Captain?{\r}

353
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,527
当然可以！就这里拍吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Absolutely! Here we are.{\r}

354
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,361
这样，就这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like that. Like that.{\r}

355
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:53,996
靠紧点，拍吧，朋友们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Squeeze together. There you go, boys.{\r}

356
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,635
沃特，朝这里看，笑得开心点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This way, Walter. Big smile.{\r}

357
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:58,769
再来一张吧，嗯，这个表情不错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One more, please. That's a good one.{\r}

358
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:01,105
再来一张
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One more.{\r}

359
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,099
三明治还好吃吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The sandwich all right?{\r}

360
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,103
你要喝点牛奶吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you like some more milk?{\r}

361
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,298
不用了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

362
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,937
说不用了，谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, thank you.{\r}

363
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:33,671
不用了，谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, thank you.{\r}

364
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:44,111
火车弄得你满脸都是灰，你应该去洗个澡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're covered in soot from the train. You should take a bath.{\r}

365
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:57,994
睡衣我给你放在床边了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pajamas are on the edge of the bed.{\r}

366
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,700
你还好吧？没事吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You okay? You all right?{\r}

367
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,742
我觉得像个傻瓜！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I fell. Stupid tub!{\r}

368
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,239
没事的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's all right.{\r}

369
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,711
你切过包皮了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're circumcised.{\r}

370
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:18,486
出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get out.{\r}

371
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,018
快点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move.{\r}

372
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,028
上次我给沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Last time I measured Walter,{\r}

373
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:36,369
上一次我给我儿子量身高的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}last time I measured my son,{\r}

374
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,500
他比你现在要高多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}he was inches taller than you are now.{\r}

375
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:40,877
你到底是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are you?{\r}

376
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,105
你到底在这里做什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing here?{\r}

377
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,739
你是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are you?{\r}

378
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,213
你是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are you?{\r}

379
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,864
他不是我儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not my son.{\r}

380
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:04,993
柯林斯太太...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins...{\r}

381
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,196
我不知道，我不知道为什么他要说自己是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I don't know why he's saying that he is,{\r}

382
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,000
但他不是沃特，我不会搞错的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but he's not Walter and there's been a mistake.{\r}

383
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,098
我记得我们上次说好，给他适应的时间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought we agreed to give him time to adjust.{\r}

384
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,836
他比我儿子矮了3英寸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's three inches shorter.{\r}

385
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,542
我和以前的记号比过了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I measured him on the chart.{\r}

386
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,011
可能是你量歪了呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, maybe your measurements are off.{\r}

387
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,015
你看，关于这事情我们肯定能找到个合适的解释
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all of this.{\r}

388
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,414
他割过包皮了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's circumcised.{\r}

389
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,383
沃特没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And Walter isn't.{\r}

390
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:24,950
柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins.{\r}

391
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,591
你的儿子失踪了5个月
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your son was missing for five months.{\r}

392
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:35,223
这5个月里，他有很长时间 是和一群没有身份的流浪汉呆在一起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For at least part of that time in the company of an as yet unidentified drifter.{\r}

393
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,132
谁知道这些经常扰乱治安的家伙们会做些什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done?{\r}

394
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,997
他可能给孩子割了包皮，也可能…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He could have had him circumcised. He could have...{\r}

395
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:43,540
让他变矮么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Made him shorter?{\r}

396
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,844
你为什么不肯听我呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why aren't you listening to me?{\r}

397
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:52,906
我在听啊，该死的，我听你说了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am listening, damn it, I am listening.{\r}

398
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,508
我明白你现在的感受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I understand your feelings.{\r}

399
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,712
他样子有些变了，但不会错，还有…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's changed, no mistake, and that's...{\r}

400
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,415
你们都度过了一段糟糕的日子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've both been through a terrible experience,{\r}

401
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:01,390
他需要你的爱和支持，然后慢慢恢复过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and that's why he needs your love and support to bounce back.{\r}

402
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:02,982
他不是我儿子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not my son!{\r}

403
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,255
你为什么还要坚持这么说，柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?{\r}

404
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,422
你干吗这样呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are you doing this?{\r}

405
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:10,558
你完全有能力照顾这个孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy.{\r}

406
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,035
你的工资足够负担他的一切生活需求
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your job pays you enough to attend to his personal needs,{\r}

407
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,833
所以我不明白你为什么要逃避
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so I don't understand why you're running away{\r}

408
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,703
你作为母亲的责任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}from your responsibilities as a mother.{\r}

409
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,038
我没有要逃避任何东西！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am not running away from anything!{\r}

410
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,577
不要谈什么责任了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Least of all my responsibilities!{\r}

411
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:23,239
我现在还在照顾这个孩子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am even taking care of that boy right now,{\r}

412
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,145
因为他无处可去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}because I am all he has!{\r}

413
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,514
我担心的是你们因此就不去找我的儿子了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What worries me is that you have stopped looking for my son!{\r}

414
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:32,079
我们干吗要去找一个已经被找回来的人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why should we be looking for someone we've already found?{\r}

415
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,584
因为你们还没找到他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because you have not found him.{\r}

416
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,094
我们已经确认他的身份了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His identity has been confirmed{\r}

417
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:41,654
我们这里有儿童鉴定的权威
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}by the best minds in the field of child identification,{\r}

418
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,930
他们知道自己在做什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}people who know what they're doing.{\r}

419
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,400
你是说我不知道？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I don't?{\r}

420
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,853
对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry.{\r}

421
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,849
我十分感谢警察局所作的一切
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I appreciate everything that this department has done{\r}

422
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:11,053
我也知道你们花了很多力气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I know how hard you're working.{\r}

423
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:14,222
我真的很感谢你们，而且我也不想给你们添麻烦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I really do, and I don't want to cause any trouble.{\r}

424
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:17,062
但是…这是个很大的误会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just... There has been a terrible mistake,{\r}

425
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:19,295
我希望你们能帮助我解决这个误会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I need you to help me correct it,{\r}

426
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,205
好让我能在儿子出什么意外前找到他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so I can find my son before it's too late.{\r}

427
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,603
求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

428
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:40,317
我不想再浪费你的时间了 我很失望
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't take up any more of your time. I'm sorry I got upset.{\r}

429
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:42,325
对不起，很对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry, very sorry.{\r}

430
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:55,995
长官，什么事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, Captain?{\r}

431
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:58,064
萨拉，你去找下塔尔医生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.{\r}

432
00:29:58,142 --> 00:29:59,268
好的，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.{\r}

433
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:05,606
柯林斯太太？ 是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins? Yes?{\r}

434
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:07,310
我是伊尔・塔尔医生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dr. Earl W. Tarr.{\r}

435
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,409
是琼斯上尉派我来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Jones sent me.{\r}

436
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:10,920
我一直帮助他做青少年案件的咨询
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases.{\r}

437
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,353
我能进来吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May I come in?{\r}

438
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,591
请进，谢谢你能过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, thank you for coming.{\r}

439
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:16,456
我还以为他根本不相信我说的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was beginning to think he didn't believe me.{\r}

440
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:19,894
你看，我不是来了吗 我们会解决一切问题的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights.{\r}

441
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:22,723
那个孩子在哪里？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where's the boy?{\r}

442
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:27,494
啊！在这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ah! There he is.{\r}

443
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,500
英俊的小家伙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A handsome young man.{\r}

444
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,039
他的眼睛很像你，不是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He has your eyes, doesn't he?{\r}

445
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,340
鼻子也挺像的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And a little bit of the nose.{\r}

446
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:38,741
很健壮，生他的时候很辛苦吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Very fit, in spite of all his travails.{\r}

447
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,115
你有个很健康的孩子啊，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

448
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,748
我以为你是过来帮我找孩子的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought you were here to help me.{\r}

449
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:46,312
当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I am.{\r}

450
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,826
琼斯上尉说这个孩子的体格变了不少
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Jones said that the boy had been through some severe physical changes{\r}

451
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,418
所以要我来看看他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and asked me to drop in on him{\r}

452
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:54,089
确保你尽到了做母亲的责任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to reassure you in your time of motherly concern.{\r}

453
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:59,559
他不是我的儿子，我没有照顾他的义务
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My motherly concern is not for him because he's not my son.{\r}

454
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:04,799
你现在的话很容易伤害到孩子的自尊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, statements like that will hardly help the boy's self-esteem,{\r}

455
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,274
对吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}now will they?{\r}

456
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:10,275
琼斯上尉提到了身高的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Jones said something about a change in height?{\r}

457
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,206
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

458
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,648
过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come.{\r}

459
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,118
靠墙站好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Against the wall.{\r}

460
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,517
他足足比我儿子矮了3英寸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's three inches shorter.{\r}

461
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:26,058
啊，好吧…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ah, well...{\r}

462
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,660
这的确是个谜题，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

463
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:35,035
我们都知道，有时候精神创伤会影响孩子的成长
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children.{\r}

464
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,267
过去5个月里他经受的紧张压力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Given the stress of the past five months,{\r}

465
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,801
可能让他的脊椎出现了收缩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}his spine may have actually shrunk.{\r}

466
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:42,846
非常罕见，但并非毫无可能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's uncommon, but it's within the realm of possibility.{\r}

467
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,881
那割包皮的事呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And circumcision?{\r}

468
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:54,150
很有可能是诱拐他的人做的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate.{\r}

469
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,989
从生理卫生的角度来看，割掉包皮值得提倡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After all, circumcision is hygienically sound.{\r}

470
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,365
当时给他造成的刺激一定很大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Must have been quite traumatic at the time.{\r}

471
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,395
所以他选择忘掉那段记忆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No wonder he's submerged the memory.{\r}

472
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:08,862
我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I...{\r}

473
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:13,273
你看，你所提出的疑点都有完美的医学解释
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this.{\r}

474
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:16,709
当然了，你有权力提出质疑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But it's right for you to raise the questions.{\r}

475
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,807
你必须理解，在他失踪的那段时间里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You need to be apprised of all changes the lad went through{\r}

476
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,943
这个孩子可能出现各种变化
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}during his absence.{\r}

477
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,284
我难道还会不知道他是不是我儿子吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wouldn't I know whether or not he's my son?{\r}

478
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,747
我是母亲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm the mother.{\r}

479
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,783
也意味着你没法客观冷静地来看待这个问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Which means you're in no position to be objective.{\r}

480
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:35,758
你太钻牛角尖了，只关注孩子的过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy{\r}

481
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:38,431
而这个孩子跟你记忆中的形象出入很大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}who has changed from what you remember.{\r}

482
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:40,527
他和离开这里时的孩子不一样了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He isn't the same boy that left here.{\r}

483
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:42,731
就好像参军回来的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just as a boy that goes off to war and then returns{\r}

484
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,638
和以前大不相同
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is not the same anymore.{\r}

485
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:49,372
而母亲的判断往往依靠的是直觉和情绪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And a mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion,{\r}

486
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,881
在发现这些改变后起了抵触心理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}sees these changes and rebels,{\r}

487
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,915
所以才坚持说这不是你的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}insists that this isn't your son.{\r}

488
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:58,316
但事实是无法改变的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Doesn't change the facts.{\r}

489
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:06,392
请让我用更客观的方法来证明我的理论 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

490
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,596
你来吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you?{\r}

491
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:18,000
这实在是太过分了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It is absolutely outrageous!{\r}

492
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,976
你先冷静下来，冷静，好好听我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Calm yourself, calm yourself and just listen to me.{\r}

493
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:25,106
不，不是，请你听我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no. No, you listen to me, please.{\r}

494
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:29,651
这个所谓的医生把我带到我的邻居面前转悠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This so called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood,{\r}

495
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,053
说得好像我是个失职到连自己的儿子都认不出来的妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}like some kind of a derelict mother who didn't even know her own son.{\r}

496
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,115
他的结论是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what was his findings?{\r}

497
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:37,456
他只得到了他想要的结论
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He found what he expected to find,{\r}

498
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:41,130
很明显也就是你希望他得出的结论
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}what you obviously told him he would find.{\r}

499
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:42,665
柯林斯太太，这不是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins. But that's not...{\r}

500
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:44,394
没有什么好懊恼伤心的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's nothing to be embarrassed about.{\r}

501
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:48,962
我伤不伤心不是重点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That I was embarrassed is not the issue.{\r}

502
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,077
重点是你在浪费时间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The point is that you are wasting time{\r}

503
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:57,308
你真正应该做的是去找我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when you should be looking for my son.{\r}

504
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,441
很遗憾，交完报告就都结束了 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But the report is final, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

505
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:04,615
是吗，那我希望能收到报告 在这份报告交给任何人之前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, then I want to receive the report, so I can refute it,{\r}

506
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,622
我要拒绝接受这份报告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}before it goes to anyone else.{\r}

507
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,918
随便你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine.{\r}

508
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,090
谢谢，再见
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Good day.{\r}

509
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,869
没有我的事了，我能不能回自己房间？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm finished. Could I go to my room now?{\r}

510
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:24,967
去吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

511
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,179
晚安，妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good night, Mommy.{\r}

512
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,919
不准你再这样叫！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop saying that!{\r}

513
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,451
不准你叫！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop saying that!{\r}

514
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:45,627
我不是你的妈妈！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not your mother!{\r}

515
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,260
我只要把我的儿子找回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my son back.{\r}

516
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:54,964
你不是他，你不是我的儿子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not him. You're not my son!{\r}

517
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,035
我要我的儿子回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my son back.{\r}

518
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,470
我要我的儿子回来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my son back!{\r}

519
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,379
你真该死！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Damn you!{\r}

520
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,918
我要我的儿子回来!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my son back!{\r}

521
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,349
我不应该对你大吼大叫的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was wrong to yell at you.{\r}

522
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,083
你只是个孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're just a child{\r}

523
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:53,358
我想你也不知道自己正在做什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I don't think you know what you're doing,{\r}

524
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,421
还有你的到来给我带来的伤害
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and the hurt you're causing.{\r}

525
00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:00,937
但是你必须知道一件事，我的儿子就是我的生命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I need you to understand that my son is my life.{\r}

526
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,201
他就是我的一切
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's all I have.{\r}

527
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:11,542
不管警察是怎么想的，我也不管世界上所有人怎么想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And no matter what the police think, and no matter what the world thinks,{\r}

528
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,947
你和我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you and I,{\r}

529
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:19,045
我们都知道这是错的，对吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we both know the truth, don't we?{\r}

530
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:23,622
我们都清楚你不是沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We both know that you're not Walter.{\r}

531
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:27,687
你只要告诉他们说你不是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You just have to tell them that you're not my son,{\r}

532
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,733
然后他们就会找到我儿子了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so they can find my son.{\r}

533
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,566
求求你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

534
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:44,046
我们明天再说吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can talk tomorrow.{\r}

535
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,028
哈？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello?{\r}

536
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:09,129
是克莉斯汀・柯林斯太太吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?{\r}

537
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,764
我是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

538
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:12,433
我的名字叫做古斯塔夫・布里格勒博
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is Gustav Briegleb.{\r}

539
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:15,876
我是圣保罗教会的牧师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm the pastor over at St. Paul's Presbyterian.{\r}

540
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:19,182
哦，我知道你，我听过你的广播
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes, I've heard your broadcasts.{\r}

541
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:20,773
我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm...{\r}

542
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,751
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

543
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,380
你读过今天的泰晤士报了没？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you read the Times this morning?{\r}

544
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:26,582
没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

545
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:31,289
也许你应该先去读一下 然后过来教堂这里吃早餐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, maybe you should give it a gander and then come over here to the parish{\r}

546
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:34,422
大约一个小时之后，我们会再见的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for breakfast, in, say, an hour. I think we should meet.{\r}

547
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,261
哈？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello?{\r}

548
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:48,268
神秘案件…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Mysterious case of...{\r}

549
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:50,711
应洛杉矶警局的要求
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department,{\r}

550
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:54,945
儿童专家伊尔・塔尔医生为沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist, examined Walter Collins{\r}

551
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:56,815
作了检查，以了解造成他变矮的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"to determine the cause of his loss of weight,{\r}

552
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:59,549
自从星期一这个孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"paleness, confusion, and rundown condition{\r}

553
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:00,817
回到他母亲的身边之后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"noticed since the return of the boy{\r}

554
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:03,382
显得苍白、疑惑、摇摇欲坠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"To his mother last Monday. "{\r}

555
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:07,192
用词很优美，不是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it?{\r}

556
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:10,290
他提到自从孩子回到他母亲身边后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Noticed since the return of the boy to his mother.{\r}

557
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,131
现在不只是证明了你就是这男孩的妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, not only does that clearly state you're the boy's mother,{\r}

558
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:17,572
还指出说你应该为这些改变负责
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but one could infer from it that you're somehow responsible for these changes.{\r}

559
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,939
而且警察局开始关注
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that the police department is concerned{\r}

560
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,774
在你的监护下孩子的生活状况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for the boy's welfare while he's in your charge.{\r}

561
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,337
尝尝煎蛋，做的非常好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should try the eggs. They're very nice.{\r}

562
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:29,611
我给那男孩做了全面检查，塔尔医生说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"'I examined the boy quite thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,{\r}

563
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,154
很明显这孩子有些话要跟我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"'And it's clear that he has something to tell.{\r}

564
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:33,621
我很确定不久之后…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"'I'm sure that in time... "'{\r}

565
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,820
他会把整件事情的来龙去脉告诉我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair,{\r}

566
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:40,693
不过那要等到他有信心讲给他的听众
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but not until he has faith in his listener.{\r}

567
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:44,757
而那正是他缺少的， 一位听众和让这个可怜孩子讲出经历的信心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that is what is lacking here, faith in the poor lad's story.{\r}

568
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:48,994
经过检查，我的结论和洛杉矶警局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Course of my examination, I found nothing to dispute the findings{\r}

569
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,869
得出的结论是一致的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of the LAPD.{\r}

570
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,303
他们为什么这么做？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why would they do this?{\r}

571
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:57,370
这样才能避免承认他们犯了错误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To avoid admitting they made a mistake{\r}

572
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,109
承认说他们找错了孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when they brought back the wrong boy.{\r}

573
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,845
只要是稍微有点脑子的人在读了报纸以后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course, anyone reading the newspaper with half a brain{\r}

574
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,978
肯定会对此表示怀疑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}would see through it instantly.{\r}

575
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:08,047
很遗憾的是 同时也意味着直接将泰晤士报的一半读者给抹掉了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sadly, that would exclude about half the readership of the Times.{\r}

576
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:13,157
柯林斯太太，我一直致力于找出隐藏在各类事情后的真相
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission in life to bring to light all the things{\r}

577
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,791
洛杉矶警局不希望让人发现他们的错误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the LAPD wish none of us ever knew about.{\r}

578
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:22,897
这是一个充斥着暴力、滥用职权 谋杀、腐败和恐吓的警察局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A department ruled by violence, abuse, murder, corruption and intimidation.{\r}

579
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:27,440
两年前戴维斯局长接手的时候他说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When Chief Davis took over the force two years ago, he said...{\r}

580
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,878
我们会好好料理洛杉矶街上的那些拿枪的混混们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We will hold court against gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles.{\r}

581
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,883
我要把他们赶尽杀绝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want them brought in dead, not alive,{\r}

582
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:37,785
对于任何姑息养奸和对罪犯表示同情的下属 我将做出严厉的斥责
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal.{\r}

583
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:41,324
他挑选了警队里最暴力的50个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He picked 50 of the most violent cops on the force,{\r}

584
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,952
给他们发了中型枪械 以及朝任何反抗人员射击的许可
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}gave them machine guns and permission to shoot anyone who got in their way.{\r}

585
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,519
他把他们叫做炮团
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He called them the Gun Squad.{\r}

586
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:52,902
不需要律师，没有诉讼，没有问讯，不处分，不调查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No lawyers, no trials, no questions, no suspensions, no investigations.{\r}

587
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,835
只剩下一摞摞尸体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just piles of bodies.{\r}

588
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:59,802
停尸房、医院甚至路边，到处都是尸体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.{\r}

589
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:04,280
洛杉矶警局不是想要消灭犯罪，根本不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And not because the LAPD wanted to wipe out crime. No.{\r}

590
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:07,909
洛杉矶警局是想要消灭竞争
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The LAPD wanted to wipe out the competition.{\r}

591
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,010
克瑞尔市长和炮团里一半的人都有入股
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mayor Cryer and half the force are on the take.{\r}

592
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:13,215
赌博、卖淫、走私酒，只要你报的出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, you name it.{\r}

593
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,555
如上帝在伊甸园里所做的那样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because once you give people the freedom to do whatever they want,{\r}

594
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:21,428
只要给予人们做任何事的自由 他们会毫不犹豫地去做我说的那些事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}as the Lord found in the Garden of Eden, they will do exactly that.{\r}

595
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:25,332
警察局决不容忍有反抗和异议的存在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This police department does not tolerate dissent, or contradiction,{\r}

596
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,802
甚至是让他们难堪的情况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or even embarrassment.{\r}

597
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:32,638
而你，你让他们脸上很不好看 这让他们很不高兴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you are in a position to embarrass them and they do not like it.{\r}

598
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,576
他们会利用一切的手段来诋毁你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They will do anything in their power to discredit you.{\r}

599
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:39,241
我不知道见过多少次了，现在已经开始麻木了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've seen that happen too many times to start going blind now.{\r}

600
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,375
所以我才想要见见你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's why I wanted to meet you,{\r}

601
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,284
我要告诉你，你让自己陷入了怎样的境地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to let you know what you're getting yourself into{\r}

602
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:47,812
而且我希望能帮助你抗争到底 如果你是这样决定的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and to help you fight it, if you choose to.{\r}

603
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,291
牧师先生，很感谢你为我做的一切
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Reverend, I appreciate everything that you're doing{\r}

604
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,761
还有你所告诉我的信息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and everything that you said,{\r}

605
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,724
但是我没有这样的想法
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but I'm not on a mission.{\r}

606
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,825
我只想找我的儿子回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just want my son home.{\r}

607
00:41:00,804 --> 00:41:03,102
柯林斯太太，有不知多少母亲的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, a lot of mothers' sons{\r}

608
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:06,336
已经因为这一点便宜私利而成为了牺牲品
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}have been sacrificed to expediency around here.{\r}

609
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,708
你的孩子，很遗憾，肯定不是第一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your son, unfortunately, would not be the first.{\r}

610
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:12,146
但如果你能做出正确的选择，也许他将是最后一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But if you do it right, he may very well be the last.{\r}

611
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,455
他只有两条路来选
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He had two cavities that needed filling.{\r}

612
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:25,188
由他来引出这次战斗，而我负责处理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He put up a fight, but I took care of it.{\r}

613
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,524
还有呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And?{\r}

614
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:30,260
你儿子的门牙之间有条缝，也就是齿隙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small tissue, a diastema.{\r}

615
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,825
两颗牙齿之间大约有1/8英寸的距离
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart.{\r}

616
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,337
房间里那孩子的嘴里却没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The boy in that room has no such gap.{\r}

617
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,669
牙齿也会随年龄改变么？他们是这么宣称的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can that change with age? Because that's what they're gonna say.{\r}

618
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,174
在某些情况下，的确是有可能的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In some cases, yes, it's possible.{\r}

619
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:42,541
但是沃特牙齿之间的那条缝是不可能长拢的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But the tissue between Walter's teeth prevents that from happening.{\r}

620
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:45,980
不通过手术是无法办到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See, they can never come together without an operation to sever the tissue,{\r}

621
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:49,746
而且我现在就可以明确地告诉你说 他从来没有接受过这样的手术
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation.{\r}

622
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,189
你能不能将这些话写到证词里？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you be willing to put that officially in writing?{\r}

623
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:56,020
请原谅我的粗鲁，我绝对帮你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pardon my language, but hell yes.{\r}

624
00:41:57,661 --> 00:42:00,926
看来麻药的效果过去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sounds like the anesthetic's wearing off.{\r}

625
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:04,365
或者，我应该先去写证词
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On the other hand, maybe I'll write that letter first.{\r}

626
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,494
给这个小家伙一点时间好好想想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give the little fella something to think about.{\r}

627
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,378
如果真是那样的话，他的变化也太大了点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, if it is, he's changed enormously.{\r}

628
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,349
你知道我是谁吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know who I am?{\r}

629
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:22,715
你是个老师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a teacher.{\r}

630
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:25,949
没错，但是老师也有名字啊？ 我的名字叫什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, but even teachers have names. What's mine?{\r}

631
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,654
我不记得了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't remember.{\r}

632
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,558
我认识你，但是我不记得你的名字了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know you, but I don't remember your name.{\r}

633
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,195
是福克斯太太 好了，去你位置坐下吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Fox. Now, take your seat.{\r}

634
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,273
我说的不是让你坐下，是让你回自己位子坐下 安排给你的那个位子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat, the one assigned you.{\r}

635
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:59,015
你应该知道自己的位子在哪里 你可是坐了快一年了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You must know where it is, you've been sitting in it for over a year now.{\r}

636
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:10,792
柯林斯太太, 如果他是你的儿子 我就把教尺吃下去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, if that's your son, I'll eat my yardstick.{\r}

637
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:14,268
我不仅会帮你提供证明，我还愿意到法庭上给你作证
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not only will I put it in writing, I will testify to it in a court of law{\r}

638
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:18,068
如果需要的话，我可以给卡尔文・柯立兹总统写信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or to the President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have to.{\r}

639
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:20,368
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

640
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,273
今天晚上的广播见
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see you tonight for the broadcast.{\r}

641
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:26,679
祝你好运
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good luck.{\r}

642
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,154
就几个问题，女士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Quick question, ma'am.{\r}

643
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:38,421
就几个问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Quick question!{\r}

644
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:40,224
柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins.{\r}

645
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,558
你好，我的名字是克莉斯汀・柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello. My name is Christine Collins.{\r}

646
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,828
早上好 早上好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good morning. Good morning.{\r}

647
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:50,464
在3月10号，我9岁大的儿子沃特・柯林斯失踪了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On March 10th, my nine-year-old son, Walter Collins, disappeared.{\r}

648
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,269
经过5个月的调查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And a five-month investigation{\r}

649
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:56,301
他们从伊利诺斯州的德卡博带回来一个男孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}led to a boy being brought to Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.{\r}

650
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,747
他们告诉我，也告诉大家说这个孩子就是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They told me and all of you that this boy was my son.{\r}

651
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,682
他其实不是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was not my son.{\r}

652
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,687
洛杉矶警局弄错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The LAPD made a mistake,{\r}

653
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,452
因为这个孩子的变化太大了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and that is the reason for the supposed transformation.{\r}

654
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,993
我这里有他的医生和老师提供的证明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have letters from his teachers and his doctors{\r}

655
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:13,461
都能够证明他不是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}all confirming that he is not my son.{\r}

656
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,660
我已经拿去复印了，明天我就拿给你看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm having them reprinted now, and I'll have them for you tomorrow.{\r}

657
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:21,192
我给了洛杉矶警局好多次机会来纠正他们的错误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have given the LAPD every opportunity to admit their mistake{\r}

658
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:23,535
还有重新开始搜索我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and renew the search for my son.{\r}

659
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,507
但他们一直拒绝那样做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Since they have refused to do so,{\r}

660
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:28,476
所以我不得不把事情公之于众
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}it has forced me to bring my case public.{\r}

661
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:32,242
我希望这样做能说服他们 把这个问题给圆满处理好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I hope that this now will persuade them to finish what they started{\r}

662
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:34,977
然后把我真正的儿子送回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and bring my son home to me.{\r}

663
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:36,541
谢谢大家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much.{\r}

664
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:50,927
莫雷利！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Morelli!{\r}

665
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,901
我要你去找那个叫柯林斯的女人，带到这里来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to find the Collins woman and get her here.{\r}

666
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,200
还有，比尔，带她从后门进来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And, Bill, bring her in the back way.{\r}

667
00:44:56,273 --> 00:44:57,331
是，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.{\r}

668
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:09,842
这边，女士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This way, miss.{\r}

669
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:11,945
为什么我们要从后面绕？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are we going in the back?{\r}

670
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,786
这是上尉的命令，前面都是记者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain's orders. Front's jammed with reporters.{\r}

671
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:22,425
太太，请坐，琼斯上尉马上就过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, sit down, miss. Captain Jones'll be right with you.{\r}

672
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:26,799
嘿，有人要接手加拿大的案子么， 伊巴拉你空着么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! Anyone want to take a call from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?{\r}

673
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:28,165
他们怎么了？丢了头麋鹿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What'd they do, lose a moose?{\r}

674
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:31,469
他们要抓一个从加拿大偷渡过来的小鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to Canada.{\r}

675
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,942
他和他的表哥一起住在怀恩威尔河边的一座农场里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's living with his cousin on some ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.{\r}

676
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:36,069
你来接？ 我来接
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You want it? I'll take it.{\r}

677
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:37,204
我空的实在没事做了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Got nothing better to do.{\r}

678
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,713
你简直就是个王子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a prince.{\r}

679
00:45:41,184 --> 00:45:42,617
柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins.{\r}

680
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:45,883
你可以让这男孩待在这儿，她会照顾好他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can leave the boy. She'll take care of him.{\r}

681
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,289
请坐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sit.{\r}

682
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:55,763
你给我们造了不小的麻烦啊，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, you've caused us quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

683
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:58,858
整个警察局都对这样的情况感到很失望
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This situation has become an embarrassment for the entire police department.{\r}

684
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:00,459
我没有想要让任何人尴尬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.{\r}

685
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,004
哦，当然不是，你当然不想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no, of course not.{\r}

686
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:05,769
作为对我们的回报，你告诉报纸说我们连几个孩子都分不清？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You just told the papers we couldn't tell one boy from another as a compliment{\r}

687
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:08,037
为了你这个案子我们忙了好几个月
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for the months we spent working on your case.{\r}

688
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:10,477
你是把我们都当白痴吗？是不是？你很开心吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? You enjoy this?{\r}

689
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,674
我没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course not.{\r}

690
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:13,977
我希望你们能找到我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to find my son.{\r}

691
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,813
你知道你的问题在哪里吗？柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what your problem is, Mrs. Collins?{\r}

692
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:17,820
你只是想逃避一个母亲应尽的责任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're trying to shirk your responsibilities as a mother.{\r}

693
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:19,048
你说什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

694
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,181
你不想要个拖油瓶，对不对？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you?{\r}

695
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:23,317
你只是不想要有孩子拖累吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You enjoyed not having to worry about a young son.{\r}

696
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:25,918
那样你就可以去自己想去的地方 做自己想做的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You could go where you wanted, do whatever you wanted,{\r}

697
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:27,793
还有见任何你想见的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}see anyone you wanted.{\r}

698
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:30,355
结果我们找到了你的儿子，而且我们把他带了回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But then we found your son, and we brought him back.{\r}

699
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:32,663
现在他又变成了你的负累
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now he's an inconvenience to you.{\r}

700
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,534
所以你才炮制了这个谎言
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that's why you cooked up this scheme,{\r}

701
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:38,438
好把这个孩子丢给州政府，让政府来帮你抚养他长大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to throw him to the state and get the state to raise him for you.{\r}

702
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:40,271
是不是这样？ 才不是这样！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Isn't that true? That is not true!{\r}

703
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:42,675
不是？就连那个孩子自己都说是你的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No? Well, even the boy says he's your son.{\r}

704
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,043
他为什么会那么说？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why would he say that?{\r}

705
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:45,775
他怎么会无缘无故那么说？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How would he know to do that?{\r}

706
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:47,817
我不知道，我只知道他在撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know. I just know he's lying.{\r}

707
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:50,250
哦，大概是吧，也许他在撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, maybe so. Maybe he is a liar.{\r}

708
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,584
他从小就是这么被教的吧，对不对？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But that's how he's been trained, isn't it?{\r}

709
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,521
你们两个都是天生的骗子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lying was born in both of you.{\r}

710
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,616
要我说，你就是个骗子，只会给我们制造麻烦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a liar and a troublemaker and, if you ask me,{\r}

711
00:46:56,693 --> 00:46:58,684
在洛杉矶街上巡逻的可不是你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you got no business walking the streets of Los Angeles.{\r}

712
00:46:58,762 --> 00:46:59,820
现在给我听好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now wait a minute.{\r}

713
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:01,761
要不就是你明知自己在撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because either you know you're lying,{\r}

714
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:05,562
或者就是你神智不清，不知道自己是撒谎还是在说真话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth.{\r}

715
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:07,159
你到底是哪一种呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, which is it?{\r}

716
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:11,131
你是个失职的母亲？还是脑子有毛病？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You a derelict mother? Or just plain nuts?{\r}

717
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:13,402
因为在我这里，你只有这两个选择
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}'Cause from where I sit, those are the only options.{\r}

718
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:14,807
我没那么多时间来听你的废话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not gonna sit here and take this.{\r}

719
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:17,142
你要专家？还是要医生？我这里都有不少
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You want experts? You want doctors? I have a few of my own.{\r}

720
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:18,407
玛顿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Matron.{\r}

721
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:26,287
柯林斯太太，你还要坚持说那边的男孩不是你儿子吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, you still insist that the boy out there is not your son?{\r}

722
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,687
是的，他不是我儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I do.{\r}

723
00:47:31,194 --> 00:47:32,491
不要再嘴硬了 什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, don't struggle. What?{\r}

724
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:33,722
不要！ 你这样做只会伤害到自己
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! You'll only hurt yourself.{\r}

725
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:35,059
你要做什么？ 站好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing? Hold still.{\r}

726
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:36,689
你不能这么做，不行，你不能这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't just do this. No, you can't.{\r}

727
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:37,892
你将会被移送到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You are to convey the prisoner{\r}

728
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:40,061
洛杉矶综合医院的精神病院去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.{\r}

729
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,296
你说什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

730
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:43,566
下面是你入院的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You are to make the following entry.{\r}

731
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,234
被告声称他被警察和其他人蒙骗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Defendant states she's been deceived by police and others,{\r}

732
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,799
坚持说我们给了她一个并非她儿子的男孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and that we have given her a boy and tried{\r}

733
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:50,675
并且强迫她承认这是她自己的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to make her think it is her son when she says it is not.{\r}

734
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:53,841
- 把她带走 - 不，不，不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take her away. No. No, no.{\r}

735
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:56,179
求你，求求你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please. Please.{\r}

736
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:57,412
走吧，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

737
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,387
不，不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No.{\r}

738
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:00,616
这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This way.{\r}

739
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:08,864
我们于1928年3月10日见到柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about March 10th, 1928{\r}

740
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:11,730
她向我们报告说她9岁大的儿子沃特失踪了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when she reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.{\r}

741
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,463
男孩在1928年8月被发现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The boy was gone until August 1928. Okay.{\r}

742
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:18,433
在孩子回家之后，她继续声称自己的儿子仍然失踪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Since his return, she has complained that he is still missing{\r}

743
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:21,170
一再要求继续寻找他的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and has made repeated requests that he be found.{\r}

744
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:26,341
鉴于她存在妄想，受迫性幻觉和现实认知错位等症状
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution and dislocation from reality.{\r}

745
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,910
可能对自己和其他人造成一定的威胁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She may be a threat to herself or others.{\r}

746
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:33,682
我们建议将她移送至精神病院
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward{\r}

747
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:35,452
直到她恢复神智为止
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until her senses can be restored.{\r}

748
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:36,787
又是12号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Got another code 12.{\r}

749
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,952
姓名？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Name?{\r}

750
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:39,086
柯林斯，克莉斯汀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Collins. Christine.{\r}

751
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:40,629
不，不，听我说，这是个错误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no, listen, this is a mistake.{\r}

752
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:41,959
签发人是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Certifying officer?{\r}

753
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,523
林肯高地分局，J.J.琼斯上尉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain J.J. Jones, Lincoln Heights Division.{\r}

754
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:46,592
不，不要，求求你！求求你！ 那些警察是想惩罚我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, please! Please! The police are trying to punish me...{\r}

755
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:48,762
如果你再吵吵闹闹，我就给你穿紧身衣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you keep it up, I'm gonna have to put you in a straitjacket.{\r}

756
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:50,100
要穿吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you want that?{\r}

757
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:51,231
不，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, ma'am.{\r}

758
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:53,707
那就给我老实点，12号
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then behave yourself. Code 12.{\r}

759
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,405
我没有发疯！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not mad!{\r}

760
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,844
求求你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

761
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:00,977
哦，上帝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God.{\r}

762
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:02,382
没事的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

763
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:08,919
不！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

764
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:19,028
住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop!{\r}

765
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:26,902
分开你的双腿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Spread your legs.{\r}

766
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:28,569
干什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

767
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:33,582
分开点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wider.{\r}

768
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,277

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not sick!{\r}

770
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:56,665

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Touch me! Touch me!{\r}

771
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,200
进去，这里就是你的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Inside. This is your room.{\r}

772
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:03,370
医生今天出去了，他明天早上会来看你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The doctor has left for the day. He will see you in the morning.{\r}

773
00:50:03,446 --> 00:50:05,812
我可不…可不可以跟负责的人谈一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I... I need to speak to somebody in authority.{\r}

774
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:07,008
抱歉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry.{\r}

775
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:11,747
我的房间！，不，不 这是我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room! No. No, no, no, this is my room.{\r}

776
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,180
我能打个电话吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I make a phone call?{\r}

777
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:15,224
只有表现好才能打电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Phone privileges are earned by good behavior.{\r}

778
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:19,022
根据规定，你不准看书、看报纸、杂志和听广播 也不允许拥有尖利物品
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not allowed newspapers, magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.{\r}

779
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,528
这是为了你的安全着想 请帮帮我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is for your own good. Help me!{\r}

780
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:22,189
听我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen to me.{\r}

781
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:24,096
我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room.{\r}

782
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,863
不，这是我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, this is my room.{\r}

783
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,201
哦，上帝啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God!{\r}

784
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:30,569
我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room.{\r}

785
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:35,236
不，不，这是我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, this is my room.{\r}

786
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:39,445
我的房间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room.{\r}

787
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:45,080
我的房间！我的房间！我的房间！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room! My room! My room!{\r}

788
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:47,583
我的房间！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My room!{\r}

789
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:50,558
他们说这是我的房间！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They said it was my room!{\r}

790
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,573
有什么要帮忙的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have a problem?{\r}

791
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,042
引擎过热了，没什么大事 很快就会好的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Overheated, that's all. She'll be fine in a bit.{\r}

792
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:10,869
嘿，听我说，能不能帮我个忙？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, listen, could you give me a hand?{\r}

793
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:14,747
我要找一个叫做诺斯考特农庄的地方 就在怀恩威尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.{\r}

794
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:18,016
诺斯考特农庄吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Northcott Ranch, huh?{\r}

795
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,590
哦，对，没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yeah, yeah.{\r}

796
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,758
你就要到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're almost there.{\r}

797
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:31,357
你只要…你只要沿着这条路往西走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You just... You just follow this road west,{\r}

798
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:34,062
大概还有两，不，还有三英里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}about two, no, three miles.{\r}

799
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:36,662
之后你往右开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And then you take that next right.{\r}

800
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,197
沿着路一直往前开就到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you stay on that and it will bring you right to it.{\r}

801
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,077
那边出什么事情了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is something going on out there?{\r}

802
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:46,274
没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

803
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:48,510
就是有个少年犯的案子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just looking into a juvenile matter.{\r}

804
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:50,913
谢谢你的帮助
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks for your help.{\r}

805
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,181
不用谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure.{\r}

806
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,262
有人吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello?{\r}

807
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:28,008
嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey!{\r}

808
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,518
嘿！嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! Hey!{\r}

809
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:33,646
过来！过来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come here! Come here!{\r}

810
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:40,891
我们是警察！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is the police!{\r}

811
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:44,126
我要逮捕一个叫桑佛德・克拉克的小子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark.{\r}

812
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,795
把门打开，靠墙站好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Open the door or stand aside.{\r}

813
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:02,543
嘿！站住！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! Stop!{\r}

814
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:06,911
站住！给我站住！站住！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop! Stop it! Stop it!{\r}

815
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:10,043
别动！再动我就把你的脸摁到地板里去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through this floor!{\r}

816
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:11,177
别动！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop it!{\r}

817
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:12,312
好吧！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine!{\r}

818
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,789
把手伸出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give me your hands.{\r}

819
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,028
过来，坐下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Sit down.{\r}

820
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,832
上帝啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus!{\r}

821
00:55:30,473 --> 00:55:31,906
孩子，你到底怎么了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the hell is wrong with you, kid?{\r}

822
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:33,407
啊？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Huh?{\r}

823
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,341
你难道不知道袭击警察是违法的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law?{\r}

824
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,606
有什么区别吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What difference does it make?{\r}

825
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:41,843
我们会把你送回加拿大去，小子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're just sending you back to Canada, son.{\r}

826
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:44,079
又不是什么世界末日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It isn't the end of the world.{\r}

827
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,948
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

828
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:51,554
小子，美国可不是你想待多久就多久的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, you can't stay in the U.S. As long as you want, pal.{\r}

829
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,857
联系上柯林斯太太了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No word from Mrs. Collins?{\r}

830
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,299
我们没有她的消息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We haven't heard from her.{\r}

831
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:01,563
去她的家看看她是不是出事了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get on down to her house, make sure she's all right.{\r}

832
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:03,127
如果她不在屋子里的话，找她的邻居打听下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if she's not there, check with her neighbors.{\r}

833
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,264
看看他们知道些什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Find out what they know.{\r}

834
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,398
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Absolutely.{\r}

835
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,535
现在有请圣保罗教会的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now KGF welcomes the Reverend Gustav Briegleb{\r}

836
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,772
古斯塔夫・布里格勒博牧师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of St. Paul's Presbyterian.{\r}

837
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,249
我是圣保罗教会的古斯塔夫・布里格勒博牧师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,{\r}

838
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:18,185
在KGF电台为您主持主的世界
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}bringing you the Lord's word on Radio KGF.{\r}

839
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:19,915
晚上好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good evening.{\r}

840
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:21,923
我今天晚上一直在等一位嘉宾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight,{\r}

841
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:24,289
不过显然她是迟到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but apparently she has been delayed.{\r}

842
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,319
既然她不在场，没法复述下午她告诉媒体的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And since she cannot be here to tell you what she told the press this afternoon,{\r}

843
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:31,025
就由我来讲述这个故事吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll have to fill in as best I can.{\r}

844
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,863
由我来告诉大家发生了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going to tell you what happened{\r}

845
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:37,201
每天晚上我都会在这里向大家播报新的情况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I'm going to keep on telling you every night, right here,{\r}

846
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:40,333
直到有人出面做他们应该做的事为止
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until somebody does something about it.{\r}

847
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:47,207
前往沙漠本地，45号列车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Desert Local, train number 45,{\r}

848
00:56:47,283 --> 00:56:50,582
5分钟后会在2号道口进站
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}will be arriving on track two in five minutes.{\r}

849
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,279
你好，我要买张去加拿大的票
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello. I'd like a ticket to Canada.{\r}

850
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:55,586
阿尔伯塔或者温哥华 只要是今晚的票就行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving tonight.{\r}

851
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,626
今天晚上没有那么远的车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't have anything going that far tonight.{\r}

852
00:56:57,693 --> 00:56:59,923
最远的话我可以给你一张去西雅图的火车票
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The best I can do is put you on a train to Seattle.{\r}

853
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,760
你可以在那里换乘，或者开车穿过国境
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From there you can transfer to a local or drive across the border.{\r}

854
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:04,231
那也可以
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That would be fine.{\r}

855
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,494
要回程票吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Roundtrip?{\r}

856
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:06,728
单程的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One way.{\r}

857
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,235
那就是15块
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That'll be $15.{\r}

858
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:09,362
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Right.{\r}

859
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,602
给你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There you go.{\r}

860
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:16,201
谢谢，这是你的票，旅途愉快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you. There you go. Enjoy your trip.{\r}

861
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:17,473
当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I will.{\r}

862
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:37,122
半个小时后吃早餐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Breakfast is half an hour.{\r}

863
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:44,069
求求你了，女士，我要见负责的医生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, miss, I need to see a doctor in charge.{\r}

864
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,607
餐厅就在楼下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The dining room is down the hall.{\r}

865
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:48,576
等医生准备好了自然会喊你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The doctor will call for you when he's ready.{\r}

866
00:58:00,556 --> 00:58:02,751
你要鸡蛋，还是麦片？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you want eggs or oatmeal?{\r}

867
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:06,255
好了，所有人都到齐了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, that's everyone that's here.{\r}

868
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,694
那么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

869
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,628
吃麦片吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can pull the oatmeal.{\r}

870
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,064
你明天也吃麦片吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you want it for tomorrow?{\r}

871
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:12,498
都丢掉，对，就这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, just dump it. All right.{\r}

872
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,092
你应该吃东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should eat.{\r}

873
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,868
吃饭才显得你正常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Eating is normal.{\r}

874
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:19,737
你要处处显示出自己很正常才行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You gotta do everything you can to look normal.{\r}

875
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,276
这是你出去的唯一机会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's the only chance you got.{\r}

876
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,504
我不饿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not hungry.{\r}

877
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:24,842
芭芭拉，你得吃东西 我不饿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Barbara, you have to eat now. I'm not hungry.{\r}

878
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:27,439
我叫我叫卡罗尔・德克斯特 你叫什么名字？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My name's Carol Dexter. What's yours?{\r}

879
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,050
克莉斯汀 克莉斯汀・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christine. Christine Collins.{\r}

880
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,283
把东西都吃光吧，我知道会很辛苦 但你得吃饭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, finish it all. I know it's hard, but you gotta try.{\r}

881
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:35,654
哦，天啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, boy.{\r}

882
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,262
我听见他们的谈话了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I heard them talking.{\r}

883
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,392
你也是因为12条进来的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're here on code 12?{\r}

884
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,130
警察干预
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Police action.{\r}

885
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,728
我是说，这里的医生和工作人员都认为
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, the doctors, the staff, they figure{\r}

886
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,136
如果是警察带你进来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that if the police brought you here,{\r}

887
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:53,232
那就是有道理的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}there must be a good reason for it.{\r}

888
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:55,709
根本没有什么理由
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There isn't a good reason for it.{\r}

889
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:59,477
我很正常，我会找时间向他们解释
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm perfectly sane and I will explain that to them.{\r}

890
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:01,240
怎么解释？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How?{\r}

891
00:59:02,385 --> 00:59:06,116
你表现得越正常，就越显得你有病
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look.{\r}

892
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:10,022
如果你笑得太多，就是有幻觉，要不就是精神错乱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you smile too much, you're delusional or you're stifling hysteria.{\r}

893
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:12,856
但如果你不笑呢，就是你抑郁了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if you don't smile, you're depressed.{\r}

894
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:17,490
如果你一点表情都没有，那就是情感丧失 有可能发展成紧张性精神分裂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you remain neutral, you're emotionally withdrawn, potentially catatonic.{\r}

895
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,001
你想的很多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've given this a lot of thought.{\r}

896
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:25,734
没错，你还不明白吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I have. Don't you get it?{\r}

897
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:28,975
你是12条，我也是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a code 12, so am I.{\r}

898
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:31,240
我们进来的原因是一样的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're here for the exact same reasons.{\r}

899
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:33,440
我们都把条子给惹毛了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We both pissed off the cops.{\r}

900
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:37,452
你看看，你看到那边那个女人了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, you see, you see that lady there?{\r}

901
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,954
她找个了老是揍她的警察老公
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She was married to a cop who kept beating her up.{\r}

902
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:43,048
当她想把真相告诉别人的时候，他把她丢进了这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When she tried to tell somebody about it, he brought her here.{\r}

903
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,387
我还要些果汁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want more juice.{\r}

904
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,654
还有她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that one?{\r}

905
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:47,059
把你的托盘放回原位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put your tray back where it belongs.{\r}

906
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:51,361
然后当她想把事情透露给报纸的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms.{\r}

907
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,868
警察把他弟弟狠揍了一顿，打断了他的双手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When she tried to tell the papers...{\r}

908
00:59:56,439 --> 00:59:57,667
你是怎么回事呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And you?{\r}

909
00:59:58,874 --> 01:00:01,866
我做的夜班
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I work nights.{\r}

910
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:03,901
嗯？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure.{\r}

911
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:08,113
我是说，我晚上出来找活
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, I work nights.{\r}

912
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:10,977
哦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh.{\r}

913
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,213
对，在城里的俱乐部里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. In the clubs. Downtown.{\r}

914
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,346
对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry.{\r}

915
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:17,222
然后，有个客户一直打我，他一直打，不停手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, well, this one client just kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,{\r}

916
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:19,352
然后我去投诉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so I filed a complaint.{\r}

917
01:00:19,428 --> 01:00:21,896
结果却发现他是个条子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And it turns out he was a cop.{\r}

918
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:24,091
接下来我知道的就是我被送进了这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Next thing I know, I'm here.{\r}

919
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:26,859
可是他们没有权力这么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But they can't do that.{\r}

920
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:27,994
你开玩笑吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you kidding?{\r}

921
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,594
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, one more and then that's it.{\r}


922
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:32,140
大家都知道女人很脆弱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody knows women are fragile.{\r}

923
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,476
我是说，女人都很情绪化，没有逻辑 上不来台面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, they're all emotions, no logic, there's nothing going on upstairs.{\r}

924
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,136
来人哪，救救我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Somebody! Help me!{\r}

925
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,875
每过一段时间她们都会有一些不方便
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every once in a while they say something that's a little inconvenient,{\r}

926
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:41,507
那时候她们就会脑子不清楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}they just go fucking nuts.{\r}

927
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:42,710
我的法国口音重，不好意思
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pardon my French.{\r}

928
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:44,514
你可以吃完的，你就要吃完了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You gotta get those dishes. You got it.{\r}

929
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:48,318
如果我们都是疯子，那么就不用管我们说什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us.{\r}

930
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:51,152
我是说，如果是你，你会相信谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, who are you gonna believe,{\r}

931
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:54,560
是想要破坏警队团结的几个疯女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force,{\r}

932
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,393
还是相信警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or a police officer?{\r}

933
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,160
他们把我们丢进这里的好处就是，既让我们闭上了嘴 又顺便教了我们怎么做人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then once they get us in here, we either shut up and we learn to behave,{\r}

934
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:02,898
要不然我们就别想回家了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or we don't go home.{\r}

935
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:04,599
你都吃完了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you all done?{\r}

936
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,843
或者，我们会像那样子回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or we go home like that.{\r}

937
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:48,005
住手，住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop. Stop it.{\r}

938
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:51,148
别拍！别拍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop it! Stop it.{\r}

939
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:52,447
求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

940
01:01:55,157 --> 01:01:56,317
克拉克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Clark.{\r}

941
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,849
桑佛德・克拉克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sanford Clark?{\r}

942
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:00,821
这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here.{\r}

943
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:03,856
文件下来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Paperwork's come through.{\r}

944
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:06,367
你会在后天被遣返回加拿大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll be deported back to Canada day after tomorrow.{\r}

945
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,699
加拿大警察会决定该怎么处置你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Police there will decide what to do with you next.{\r}

946
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:12,070
我希望你在这段时间里好好反省过了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope your stay here has convinced you not to try crossing the border{\r}

947
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:13,904
以后不会再偷偷越境了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}illegally in the future.{\r}

948
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:15,135
等等！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait!{\r}

949
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:20,510
我想跟带我进来的那位长官谈谈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'd like to talk to the officer who brought me in.{\r}

950
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,380
我想他这会儿有更重要的事情要做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure he has far more important things...{\r}

951
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,749
求你了，是很重要的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please. It's important.{\r}

952
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,255
克莉斯汀・柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christine Collins.{\r}

953
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:35,991
谢谢 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you. Mrs. Collins.{\r}

954
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:40,496
我是乔纳森・斯蒂尔医生 请坐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.{\r}

955
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,577
我希望你在这里过得还算不错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope your stay with us has been comfortable so far.{\r}

956
01:02:52,514 --> 01:02:53,640
嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

957
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,616
真的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Really?{\r}

958
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:59,176
我以为第一次进来都会比较难受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'd think it'd be quite difficult at first.{\r}

959
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,018
的确如此
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, it was.{\r}

960
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:06,892
当然不好受，不过我觉得还多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course it was very difficult, but comfortable enough.{\r}

961
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:20,573
我看到他们做了… 他们抽了血做测试
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see that they have... They've taken a blood test.{\r}

962
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,607
瓦色尔曼氏测试
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Wassermman Test.{\r}

963
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,809
他们说是为了检查有没有梅毒 梅毒会影响大脑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They said it was to check for syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.{\r}

964
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,717
听到别人觉得你应该去检查梅毒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The idea that someone thinks you need to be checked for syphilis,{\r}

965
01:03:31,787 --> 01:03:33,652
你会不会觉得很沮丧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}does that upset you?{\r}

966
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,054
不会，他们说只是依照惯例，我不觉得有问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, they said it was standard procedure, so it did not.{\r}

967
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,525
对，当然，标准流程
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, exactly. Standard procedure.{\r}

968
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,459
我们必须做到面面俱到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have to cover all our bases.{\r}

969
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:41,962
我可以理解
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can imagine{\r}

970
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:46,928
也许对有些人来说会不好受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that for some people that would be uncomfortable,{\r}

971
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:49,163
我可以理解
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but I understood.{\r}

972
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:13,026
根据你的记录，你怀疑警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}According to your file you believe that the police substituted{\r}

973
01:04:13,128 --> 01:04:15,221
用假的男孩来冒充你的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}a fake boy for your son.{\r}

974
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:17,492
我不是说的真假
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I didn't say he was a fake boy.{\r}

975
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,659
他不是我的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not my boy.{\r}

976
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,168
他们找错孩子了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They brought home the wrong boy.{\r}

977
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:23,204
我的儿子依然不见踪影
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My son is still missing.{\r}

978
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:28,274
是吗？那就奇怪了，因为我在这张报纸上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, that's strange, because I have here a newspaper article{\r}

979
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:34,239
看到了一张你在火车站迎接儿子回家的照片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming home your son.{\r}

980
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,314
这照片上的人是你没错吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is you in the photo, isn't it?{\r}

981
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:40,912
是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

982
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,082
确定？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

983
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:43,815
是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

984
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:46,827
也就是说，一开始他是你的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, at first he was your son,{\r}

985
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,127
然后现在他又不是你儿子了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and now he's not your son.{\r}

986
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:54,001
这样的情况存在多长时间了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Has this been going on for a long time?{\r}

987
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:57,698
人会长大，变成其他的样子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People changing, becoming something other than what they are?{\r}

988
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,638
人不会变
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People don't change.{\r}

989
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,266
你觉得人不会改变？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't think people change?{\r}

990
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:02,435
不是，我不是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, that's not...{\r}

991
01:05:06,081 --> 01:05:08,345
他们逼迫过你吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police, they're not out to persecute you?{\r}

992
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:10,777
没有，他们没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, they're not.{\r}

993
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:13,947
警察是来保护你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police are here to protect you.{\r}

994
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,985
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

995
01:05:16,225 --> 01:05:17,658
你确定？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Really?{\r}

996
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:18,784
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

997
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:24,231
这就更奇怪了，因为你一开始被送进来的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, that's odd because when you were admitted,{\r}

998
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,435
告诉我们的护士长说 警察想要给你一个惩罚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you told the head nurse that the police were conspiring deliberately to punish you.{\r}

999
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:35,976
是护士长和实习生都有份惩罚你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, either the head nurse and the interns are also conspiring to punish you{\r}

1000
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,275
还是你的故事内容又变了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or you're changing your story.{\r}

1001
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:50,616
你是不是经常会分不清现实和幻想，柯林斯太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?{\r}

1002
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,119
没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1003
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,033
抱歉这种天气里还把你叫出来，警探先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, Detective,{\r}

1004
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,101
但是这孩子一直很抗拒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but the boy has been quite insistent.{\r}

1005
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:11,544
那也很正常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all right.{\r}

1006
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:14,548
我先来听听他想要说什么 然后回家把自己弄干
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry.{\r}

1007
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:17,244
这种下雨天 外面到处都是阿猫阿狗和民主党人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's raining cats, dogs, and Democrats out there,{\r}

1008
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,617
所以最好别让我白跑一趟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so this had better be worth it.{\r}

1009
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:21,713
又是你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You again, huh?{\r}

1010
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,557
让我们看看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll see.{\r}

1011
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:34,394
好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well?{\r}

1012
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:38,467
很不容易，对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This isn't easy, okay?{\r}

1013
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,529
什么意思？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1014
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:42,941
大老远地冒着暴雨开车过来也不是件容易事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Driving my ass here in the pouring rain wasn't easy either.{\r}

1015
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:47,377
高顿・诺斯考特是我的表弟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My cousin is Gordon Northcott.{\r}

1016
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:50,043
你找到我的那个农庄是他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He owns the ranch where you found me.{\r}

1017
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:55,046
他说我可以在他离开的时候替他照顾这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said I could live there in exchange I watch the place when he's gone,{\r}

1018
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:58,085
打打杂，干干家务之类的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}doing chores and stuff like that.{\r}

1019
01:06:59,628 --> 01:07:02,426
还说我可以想待多久就待多久
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Said I could stay as long as I wanted to.{\r}

1020
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:06,128
于是我就以为我也可以随时离开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought that meant I could leave whenever I wanted.{\r}

1021
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:07,259
~
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mmm.{\r}

1022
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:09,634
你的意思是说他把你当囚犯一样关了起来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You saying that he held you prisoner?{\r}

1023
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:10,865
胡扯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bull.{\r}

1024
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,806
我去的时候可是看到你自由的像只松鸦一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I got there, you were running around free as a jaybird.{\r}

1025
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,810
只要你愿意，随时都可以离开嘛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Could've left any time you wanted.{\r}

1026
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:16,902
不是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1027
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:18,741
那又是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, what's this, huh?{\r}

1028
01:07:18,847 --> 01:07:20,872
随便编造一个故事 好解释你为什么会非法入境？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some kind of story to cover why you're in the country illegally?{\r}

1029
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,075
不，不是那样的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, it's nothing like that.{\r}

1030
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,209
我也没兴趣听你讲故事，你懂么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}'Cause I don't have time for this, okay?{\r}

1031
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:24,445
听我说！他说…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen to me! He said...{\r}

1032
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,782
说什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1033
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:27,583
他说了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What did he say?{\r}

1034
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:30,955
他说如果我敢走人的话，他就把我干掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me.{\r}

1035
01:07:31,026 --> 01:07:34,052
听着，你不明白他是怎样一个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, you don't understand what he's like,{\r}

1036
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:37,462
还有…他做了什么，他逼我做了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}what he... What we did, what he made me do.{\r}

1037
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,435
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

1038
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:43,937
那我们从头说起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's start at the beginning then.{\r}

1039
01:07:47,576 --> 01:07:49,669
他逼你做了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What'd he make you do?{\r}

1040
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:56,449
我们杀了一些小孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We killed some kids.{\r}

1041
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:57,780
你说什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1042
01:07:57,853 --> 01:08:01,448
你听我说，我不想干的，我发誓 是他逼我帮他杀人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I didn't mean to, I swear. He made me help him.{\r}

1043
01:08:01,523 --> 01:08:04,117
他说如果我不动手的话，他会连我也一起杀掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said if I didn't, he'd kill me, too.{\r}

1044
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,889
你得帮帮我，求求你了，我很害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, you gotta help me, please. I'm so scared.{\r}

1045
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,954
我不想因为杀小孩下地狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't want to go to hell for killing kids.{\r}

1046
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,397
你看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look.{\r}

1047
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:14,299
什么孩子，你到底…你到底在讲什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What kids? What... What are you talking about?{\r}

1048
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:16,894
我不知道，我根本不知道他们的名字
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know. I never knew their names.{\r}

1049
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,462
名字？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Names?{\r}

1050
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,564
多少个？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How many?{\r}

1051
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,131
多少孩子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How many kids?{\r}

1052
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,575
一共加起来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All together?{\r}

1053
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,847
大概有20个吧，我想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}About 20, I guess.{\r}

1054
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,618
不，你在撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, you're lying.{\r}

1055
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:34,053
我没有，我发誓都是真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! It's true, I swear!{\r}

1056
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:35,783
你难道要告诉我说你杀了20个小孩？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're gonna tell me you killed 20 kids?{\r}

1057
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:39,315
嗯！大概那么多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah! Thereabouts.{\r}

1058
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:44,063
我后来就没有数了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I stopped counting after a while.{\r}

1059
01:08:47,903 --> 01:08:51,669
高顿说大概有1、2个逃跑了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gordon said maybe one or two may have escaped.{\r}

1060
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:56,401
但是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But...{\r}

1061
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:57,502
不可能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1062
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:00,412
不可能有人杀了20个孩子好吗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nobody can just up and kill 20 kids, okay?{\r}

1063
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:01,676
我们真的做了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We did.{\r}

1064
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:05,280
是我们杀的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We did.{\r}

1065
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,248
怎么杀的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How?{\r}

1066
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,726
大多数时候我们就杀一两个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Most times we'd just have one or two.{\r}

1067
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:17,298
有时候会是三个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sometimes as many as three.{\r}

1068
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:23,099
我们准备离开农场的时候我就得
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I always knew when we were getting ready to leave.{\r}

1069
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,269
把车擦干净
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Clean up the car.{\r}

1070
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,540
确认轮胎都有气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Make sure the tires were good.{\r}

1071
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,277
检查引擎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Check the engine.{\r}

1072
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,442
因为他担心车子会抛锚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}'Cause he was afraid that the car would break down{\r}

1073
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:41,987
然后我们会被逮住
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and we'd get caught.{\r}

1074
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,889
我可怜的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My loving baby{\r}

1075
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:49,055
每一次我们都会挑不一样的方向走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'd always go a different direction every time.{\r}

1076
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,299
从来不在镇子的同一个地方停留两次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never hit the same part of town twice.{\r}

1077
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,803
很多次我们就这么一直开啊开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sometimes we'd just drive around for hours,{\r}

1078
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:58,906
直到我们发现了孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}till we found somebody.{\r}

1079
01:09:58,974 --> 01:10:00,498
你在这里！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, there you are!{\r}

1080
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:02,372
我们找你都快找疯了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've been looking for you like mad.{\r}

1081
01:10:02,444 --> 01:10:03,706
你是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have?{\r}

1082
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:05,144
当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure thing.{\r}

1083
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:08,148
听着，你的小伙伴出事了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, your folks, they've been in an accident.{\r}

1084
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,248
他们伤的很严重，派我们来找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And they sent us to come find you. Now, they're hurt real bad.{\r}

1085
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,084
警察已经把他们送去医院了，所以没有空来找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police took them to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you,{\r}

1086
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:16,147
我跟他们说我可以去找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so we said that we would do it.{\r}

1087
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:17,824
快点，马上走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, come on.{\r}

1088
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:20,453
好了，快点进来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right. Get in here. Hurry.{\r}

1089
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:23,862
听着，我们会带你去医院，带你去看你的伙伴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, we gotta get you to that hospital so you can see your folks.{\r}

1090
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:27,163
你瞧，一般小孩子不会和一个陌生人上车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See, a lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger,{\r}

1091
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:28,566
但如果还有一个小孩在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but when he's got a kid there...{\r}

1092
01:10:28,637 --> 01:10:30,264
还有一个小孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's a good boy.{\r}

1093
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:31,738
让开点，让开点，桑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Scoot over. Scoot over, San.{\r}

1094
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:33,365
事情就好办多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that made it easier.{\r}

1095
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:34,909
你抓紧了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to hold on tight.{\r}

1096
01:10:34,976 --> 01:10:36,273
他们会看着我，然后想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They'd look at me and say...{\r}

1097
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:37,607
我们要走很长的路
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've got a long way to go.{\r}

1098
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:38,839
“如果他没有事的话”
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Hey, if he's safe... "{\r}

1099
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:40,074
我们会开得很快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And we are gonna fly.{\r}

1100
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,412
“我也不会有事的”
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"... I guess I will be, too. "{\r}

1101
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,877
每次看着他们爬进卡车里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every time they got in the truck,{\r}

1102
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,682
我只想死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just wanted to die.{\r}

1103
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:54,490
等我们回到农场以后，就把他们关进仓库里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As soon as we got back to the ranch, they went in the coop.{\r}

1104
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:57,362
你们饿不饿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You boys hungry?{\r}

1105
01:10:57,432 --> 01:10:58,524
啊？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Huh?{\r}

1106
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,431
看好门，桑佛德！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Watch the door, Sanford!{\r}

1107
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:02,503
嘿！看着门！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! Watch the door!{\r}

1108
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:04,838
怎么了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the matter?{\r}

1109
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:06,168
我不会伤害你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not gonna hurt you.{\r}

1110
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:07,731
你是不是担心我会伤害你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you worried that I'm gonna hurt you?{\r}

1111
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:08,901
我不会弄伤你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not gonna hurt you.{\r}

1112
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,444
来，过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Huh? Come here.{\r}

1113
01:11:10,512 --> 01:11:12,503
不要，不要 过来，我不会伤害你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! No! No! No! Please! I would never hurt you.{\r}

1114
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:15,243
有些时候他会立即杀人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some days he'd do them right off.{\r}

1115
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:20,085
有时候他会等几天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Other days he'd wait,{\r}

1116
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,788
再去多抓几个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}pick up a few more,{\r}

1117
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:26,885
等到有4、5个的时候才动手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until he had about four or five of them.{\r}

1118
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:28,588
对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1119
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:29,994
不要，不要，不要！ 不要什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! No! No! No what?{\r}

1120
01:11:30,065 --> 01:11:31,157
不要什么？啊？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No what, huh?{\r}

1121
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:33,729
过来！过来！过来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Come on. Come on!{\r}

1122
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:35,736
桑佛德，给我盯好门外！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sanford, keep your eye on that door!{\r}

1123
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:38,568
不要，求求你，不要！不要！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! Please, no! No! No!{\r}

1124
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,007
不，不要！不要过来！ 求求你，不要！不要！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! No! No! No! Please! No! No!{\r}

1125
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:46,973
有时候，他…他会留下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He'd... He'd sometimes leave{\r}

1126
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:51,382
一两个人，勉强还有口气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}just one or two of them alive, barely, anyway.{\r}

1127
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,681
然后他会跟我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He'd say,{\r}

1128
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:55,552
把他们干掉…桑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Finish them, San.{\r}

1129
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:58,923
“你去把他们干掉，或者…或者让我把你干掉”
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Finish them or... Finish them or I'll finish you. "{\r}

1130
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,061
于是我照做了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I did.{\r}

1131
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:06,594
我杀了他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I killed them.{\r}

1132
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:07,896
是我干的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I did.{\r}

1133
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:09,527
我杀死了他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I killed them.{\r}

1134
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:11,504
上帝啊，我杀死了他们！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God, I killed them!{\r}

1135
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,009
哦，上帝啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God! Oh!{\r}

1136
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,369
嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey.{\r}

1137
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:19,539
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1138
01:12:19,614 --> 01:12:20,979
看着我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at me.{\r}

1139
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:23,916
这些孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These kids.{\r}

1140
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:29,323
如果再让你看到他们的样子，你能不能认出来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You think if you saw them again, you think you might be able to recognize them?{\r}

1141
01:12:29,658 --> 01:12:31,785
我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know.{\r}

1142
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,020
可能吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe.{\r}

1143
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:36,719
嘿，我有好些时间没有更新过这个了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, I haven't updated these in a while, but still.{\r}

1144
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:39,625
我只要…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just...{\r}

1145
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:43,432
大概，只要看下这些就行了，可以么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It should be. Just go through these, okay?{\r}

1146
01:12:48,309 --> 01:12:52,643
如果发现你认得出的，直接把照片拿出来 摆到这边的桌上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you see any you recognize, just put them down on the table here.{\r}

1147
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,083
对不起！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry!{\r}

1148
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,386
哦，我的上帝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my God.{\r}

1149
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:42,986
我不想的…是他逼我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't mean to... He made me.{\r}

1150
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,400
哦，他妈的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, shit.{\r}

1151
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:56,843
这一个，看着我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This one. Look at me.{\r}

1152
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:00,942
你确定么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're sure?{\r}

1153
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:06,515
确定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure.{\r}

1154
01:14:10,425 --> 01:14:11,483
上帝啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus Christ.{\r}

1155
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:15,791
哦，我的天哪！我的天哪！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God! Oh, God!{\r}

1156
01:14:16,063 --> 01:14:17,530
上帝！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus Christ.{\r}

1157
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:20,332
王八蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Son of a bitch.{\r}

1158
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:24,766
哦，我的老天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, God.{\r}

1159
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:27,772
好吧，他是在撒谎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, he's lying.{\r}

1160
01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:29,867
你脑子抽风了么？莱斯？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you gone soft in the head, Les?{\r}

1161
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:31,002
整整二十个孩子，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Twenty kids, sir.{\r}

1162
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:32,067
他在耍你呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's playing you.{\r}

1163
01:14:32,146 --> 01:14:34,876
他知道自己肯定麻烦了 所以搞出这种狗屁故事来糊弄人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story{\r}

1164
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,917
说什么自己是被迫留在这里的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}about how he was forced to stay in the country.{\r}

1165
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:39,953
那是你的看法，长官 我不这么认为，你没有看见他的表情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him.{\r}

1166
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:42,012
这小子已经被吓得半死，浑浑噩噩了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This kid, he's scared half out of his mind.{\r}

1167
01:14:42,089 --> 01:14:45,217
他还挑了那个叫柯林斯的小鬼 我们已经找到那孩子了，你还记得不？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He picked the Collins kid. We found him, remember?{\r}

1168
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:46,590
你没读报纸吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Haven't you been reading the papers?{\r}

1169
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:49,524
可能你已经读过了 我说的对吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or maybe you have, is that it?{\r}

1170
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:50,689
长官，请你听我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir, if you'd just listen to me...{\r}

1171
01:14:50,765 --> 01:14:52,198
上尉，对不起，他又来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry, Captain, but he's here again.{\r}

1172
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:54,063
- 谁？ - 那个布里格勒博牧师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who? That Reverend Briegleb.{\r}

1173
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:55,966
他在打听克莉斯汀・柯林斯的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's asking about Christine Collins.{\r}

1174
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,061
好吧，那你去告诉那个煞笔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, you tell that son of a bitch{\r}

1175
01:14:57,138 --> 01:14:58,696
让他快点从警察局里他妈的滚出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to get the hell off of police property,{\r}

1176
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:00,741
不然我就以扰乱治安罪逮捕他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or I'll have him arrested for disturbing the peace.{\r}

1177
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:03,868
我说了，但是他说他不会离开 他还带了人来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I tried. He said he won't leave, him or his friends.{\r}

1178
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:05,071
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1179
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:09,008
哦，真他妈的该死！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, what the hell!{\r}

1180
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:12,309
上帝！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus!{\r}

1181
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:18,083
哦，上帝都去死吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Jesus jumped down.{\r}

1182
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,257
上尉？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain?{\r}

1183
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:21,784
- 伊巴拉 - 我在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ybarra? Yeah.{\r}

1184
01:15:21,863 --> 01:15:24,457
听我说，你给我回来，什么都不要做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen to me. You're to do nothing except get back here.{\r}

1185
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:26,466
长官，根据警局的规定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir, departmental policy requires that{\r}

1186
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:29,128
所有谋杀案都要进行调查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}all allegations of homicide have to be investigated.{\r}

1187
01:15:29,203 --> 01:15:30,295
看在上帝的份上，这些可是孩子啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These are kids, for Christ sake.{\r}

1188
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:31,963
我刚才的话就是局里的规定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Departmental policy is what I say it is.{\r}

1189
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:35,304
现在我命令你带着那个孩子滚回来，听到没有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid, you got that?{\r}

1190
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:38,277
你谁都不要讲，然后给我把那个孩子带过来，听明白没？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't talk to anybody and you bring me that kid. You got it?{\r}

1191
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:39,506
不准告诉任何人！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nobody!{\r}

1192
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:55,018
- 琼斯上尉 - 伙计们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Jones. Boys.{\r}

1193
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:57,530
你把克莉斯汀・柯林斯怎么了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the hell have you done with Christine Collins?{\r}

1194
01:15:57,598 --> 01:15:59,793
不要给我装腔作势说些虚的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And don't try and lie your way out of it,{\r}

1195
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:04,361
有好几个邻居都看见她坐上一辆警车走的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}because several of her neighbors saw her being driven away in a police car.{\r}

1196
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:07,038
柯林斯太太因为精神崩溃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins has been placed in protective custody{\r}

1197
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:09,076
现在正在我们的保护性监管中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}following a mental breakdown.{\r}

1198
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:11,806
精神崩溃？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A what?{\r}

1199
01:16:12,246 --> 01:16:14,680
她正在接受最好的治疗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's getting the best treatment available.{\r}

1200
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:16,546
事情就是这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that will be all.{\r}

1201
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,454
下一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Next.{\r}

1202
01:16:21,522 --> 01:16:22,853
过来 接受什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on. Move up. For what?{\r}

1203
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:23,913
药物治疗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Medication.{\r}

1204
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:26,050
为什么要做药物治疗？ 对你有益
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Medication for what? The kind that's good for you.{\r}

1205
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:27,253
能够帮助你休息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Help you relax.{\r}

1206
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:28,386
但是我不想要休息 别这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I don't want to relax. Come on.{\r}

1207
01:16:28,462 --> 01:16:29,827
我什么药都不需要… 那我们将强制你服用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not gonna take something... We can force-feed you{\r}

1208
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:31,296
如果你希望我们用这样的方式的话 我不知道这是什么药！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}if that's what you want. I don't know what it is!{\r}

1209
01:16:31,365 --> 01:16:32,832
我不知道，斯蒂尔医生 抓住她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what it is. Dr. Steele? Take it. Orderly.{\r}

1210
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:33,889
斯蒂尔医生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dr. Steele?{\r}

1211
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:34,935
我明白，过来吃药
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I understand. Come on.{\r}

1212
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:36,936
女士，继续走，过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ladies, keep moving. Come on.{\r}

1213
01:16:37,004 --> 01:16:38,631
我不知道这是什么东西，我不要吃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't wanna take anything that I don't know what it is.{\r}

1214
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:40,936
我什么病都没有，我不用接受药物治疗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's nothing wrong with me that I need medication.{\r}

1215
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:43,408
你的确没有什么问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's nothing wrong with you.{\r}

1216
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:47,578
你没有问题 没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, there's nothing wrong. No.{\r}

1217
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:49,806
你很健康？ 是的，我很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're fine. Yes, I am.{\r}

1218
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:55,321
那么你应该能够在这个上面签字
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, then you shouldn't have any trouble signing this.{\r}

1219
01:16:56,924 --> 01:16:59,415
签了这份东西，你要承认
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By signing it, you certify that you were wrong{\r}

1220
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:02,360
警察还给你的孩子不是你儿子这话是错的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when you stated the boy returned to you by the police was not your son.{\r}

1221
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,864
这上面还声明警察把你送到这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It further stipulates that the police were right{\r}

1222
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:06,866
接受看护是有必要的 他们不必对此承担任何责任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in sending you here for observation and it absolves them{\r}

1223
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:09,300
签字吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of all responsibility. Sign it.{\r}

1224
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,099
我不会签字的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't sign that.{\r}

1225
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,333
我不会在上面签字的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't sign that.{\r}

1226
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:16,274
好吧，那说明你的情况没有好转
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, then your condition is not improved.{\r}

1227
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:20,246
签完字，明天一早你就可以出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sign it, and you can be out of here first thing tomorrow morning.{\r}

1228
01:17:21,882 --> 01:17:23,577
可我根本没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I wasn't wrong.{\r}

1229
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:25,585
他不是我儿子，我的儿子还失踪着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not my son. My son is still missing.{\r}

1230
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:28,349
柯林斯太太，你开始激动了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, you're becoming agitated.{\r}

1231
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:32,483
是的，我是很激动…我不签 因为他不是我儿子！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing that, because he's not my son!{\r}

1232
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,584
看护员！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Orderly!{\r}

1233
01:17:33,661 --> 01:17:35,060
他不是我儿子！ 看护员！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not my son! Orderly!{\r}

1234
01:17:35,129 --> 01:17:36,528
我的儿子还没有找到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My son is missing!{\r}

1235
01:17:36,597 --> 01:17:39,088
这个病人精神错乱了 我没有！我的儿子失踪了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The patient is becoming hysterical! No! My son is missing!{\r}

1236
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,428
去看看镇静剂是不是有效
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See to it she is sedated properly.{\r}

1237
01:17:40,501 --> 01:17:42,492
- 把她带出去 - 不！不！不！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get her out of here. No! No! No!{\r}

1238
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,969
下一个！ 不！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Next! No!{\r}

1239
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,499
不！不！ 看护员，抓住她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no! Orderly, hold on.{\r}

1240
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:51,203
住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop it!{\r}

1241
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:53,872
该死！张嘴！ 张开，张嘴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! Open your mouth. Open, open your mouth.{\r}

1242
01:17:53,981 --> 01:17:55,539
冷静！ 你抓好她了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Easy! You got her?{\r}

1243
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:57,174
上帝啊！ 吞下去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}God! Swallow it.{\r}

1244
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:58,718
住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop it!{\r}

1245
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:01,446
退回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move back.{\r}

1246
01:18:01,522 --> 01:18:02,955
你！ 把她带走！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You! Get her out of here!{\r}

1247
01:18:03,024 --> 01:18:04,286
过来，你找到她了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, you got her?{\r}

1248
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:06,758
不准插手，这跟你们没关系 这是警察在办事！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay out of this! This is none of your business! This is police business!{\r}

1249
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:09,387
你们所有人都别动！都不准过来 如果你们还有点脑子的话！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All of you! You'll stay out of it if you know what's good for you!{\r}

1250
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:11,727
你不知道你已经惹上很多麻烦了么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'd think you were in enough trouble with the law already,{\r}

1251
01:18:11,799 --> 01:18:13,198
臭婊子，你不明白么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}being a whore, wouldn't you?{\r}

1252
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,671
攻击管理人员 把她关进18号房间去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Attacking a staff member. Room 18.{\r}

1253
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:22,266
不，不要！住手！不要！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no! Stop it! No!{\r}

1254
01:18:22,576 --> 01:18:24,510
不！不！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! No!{\r}

1255
01:18:25,846 --> 01:18:27,438
不！住手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! Stop it!{\r}

1256
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:41,713
过来，孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, kid.{\r}

1257
01:20:01,442 --> 01:20:05,276
我不知道，我也不能确定 我想应该是的，他长得很像
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know. I'm not sure. I think so. He was pretty close.{\r}

1258
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:06,643
等下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me.{\r}

1259
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:09,314
- 没事的，接下来我来吧 - 但是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all right, I can take it from here. But I got...{\r}

1260
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:10,407
我们有话要问他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We need him for questioning.{\r}

1261
01:20:10,484 --> 01:20:11,542
我来就好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like I said, it was dark.{\r}

1262
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:12,881
谢谢 过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks. Come on.{\r}

1263
01:20:13,654 --> 01:20:15,053
布拉迪，罗斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Brady, Ross.{\r}

1264
01:20:15,122 --> 01:20:17,215
你们两个被正式征用了，跟我走 路上我再给你们解释
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've just been requisitioned for backup. I'll explain on the way.{\r}

1265
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,815
是，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.{\r}

1266
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,036
我也不确定，她说她小时候得过哮吼 也可能是肺炎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not sure. She said she'd had the croup before. This could be pneumonia.{\r}

1267
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:35,140
我一直在劝她，但是她不答应
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I keep telling her that, and she doesn't want to.{\r}

1268
01:20:35,276 --> 01:20:36,641
你必须坚持
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to insist.{\r}

1269
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,177
你不应该那么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You shouldn't have done that.{\r}

1270
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:39,610
求求你，让我出院！ 进去！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, let me out! Get in there!{\r}

1271
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,011
我自找的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wanted to.{\r}

1272
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:42,946
感觉很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Felt good.{\r}

1273
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:44,709
让我出去！不要！求求你！不要！ 你找到她了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me out! No! Please! No! You got her?{\r}

1274
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:50,622
我在赤脚医生那里堕了两次胎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I lost two babies to back alley doctors.{\r}

1275
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,023
我没有选择
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No choice.{\r}

1276
01:20:56,397 --> 01:20:59,195
我根本连为自己的孩子斗争的机会都没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never had the chance to fight for them.{\r}

1277
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:01,798
而你有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You do.{\r}

1278
01:21:02,336 --> 01:21:03,701
不要放弃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't stop.{\r}

1279
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:06,534
我不会的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't.{\r}

1280
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:14,878
都他妈的去死，让他们马上风死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.{\r}

1281
01:21:17,852 --> 01:21:20,116
这可不是一个有教养的女人说的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's not exactly language for a lady.{\r}

1282
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:22,247
去死吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hell.{\r}

1283
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:27,024
有些时候就该说这样的狠话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There are times that's exactly the right language to use.{\r}

1284
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:29,521
什么时候？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1285
01:21:31,098 --> 01:21:33,623
当你已经一无所有的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When you've got nothing left to lose.{\r}

1286
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:36,531
你不应该待在这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not supposed to be here!{\r}

1287
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:38,298
嗯嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mmm. Mmm.{\r}

1288
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:04,222
待着这里，检查房子，还有仓库
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stay there. Check the house. Check the barn.{\r}

1289
01:22:13,908 --> 01:22:15,671
没有人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all clear.{\r}

1290
01:22:15,776 --> 01:22:17,607
这里也安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Clear here.{\r}

1291
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:19,612
拿铲子给我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bring me that shovel.{\r}

1292
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,682
好了，我们走吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right. Let's go.{\r}

1293
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:32,219
过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on.{\r}

1294
01:22:35,396 --> 01:22:37,591
你指给我看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're gonna show me.{\r}

1295
01:22:43,404 --> 01:22:45,099
指给我看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Show me.{\r}

1296
01:23:06,226 --> 01:23:07,454
这里？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This it?{\r}

1297
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:10,293
你确定？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You sure?{\r}

1298
01:23:10,364 --> 01:23:11,456
嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1299
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:15,459
挖开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Dig.{\r}

1300
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:22,241
既然你说你把他们埋起来了，那么这里就应该有尸体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You put them in the ground, you can take them out of the ground.{\r}

1301
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:24,974
挖吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on. Dig.{\r}

1302
01:23:25,879 --> 01:23:28,040
听到我说的没有，挖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You heard me. Dig.{\r}

1303
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:14,624
我的天哪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My God.{\r}

1304
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,297
哦，天啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my God.{\r}

1305
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:33,210
叫他进来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Call it in.{\r}

1306
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:34,839
去叫验尸官来 把方圆20英里内所有的警察叫来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the coroner and every officer{\r}

1307
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:37,110
让他们1个小时内到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in a 20-mile radius here inside the hour.{\r}

1308
01:24:37,184 --> 01:24:40,483
给我发信息通缉高顿・斯图尔特・诺斯考特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then put out an APB on Gordon Stewart Northcott.{\r}

1309
01:24:41,622 --> 01:24:44,147
所有的资料都在我车里，继续挖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The information's in my car. Go on.{\r}

1310
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:51,391
不用再挖了，小子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can stop, son.{\r}

1311
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,235
停下吧，够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can stop now. It's over.{\r}

1312
01:24:58,305 --> 01:24:59,567
嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey.{\r}

1313

没事的，没事的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's okay. It's okay.{\r}

1317
01:25:24,965 --> 01:25:26,262
都结束了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all over.{\r}

1318
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,792
没事了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay?{\r}

1320
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:37,967
大家回避
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Privacy, please.{\r}

1321
01:25:43,717 --> 01:25:47,175
我知道你一直拒绝药物治疗，所以我们将强制服用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see that you've been refusing medication, requiring force feeding.{\r}

1322
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:49,489
好了，麦克 吃午饭了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, Michael. Lunchtime?{\r}

1323
01:25:49,556 --> 01:25:52,650
柯林斯太太，已经6天了 一点效果都没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no progress.{\r}

1324
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,987
我们可能有必要采用一些更激进的疗法了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We may have to move on to more strenuous therapies.{\r}

1325
01:25:58,098 --> 01:26:01,727
除非你愿意向我们证明说你的病情开始好转了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Unless you're willing to prove that you're doing better{\r}

1326
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,899
只要你签掉这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}by signing this.{\r}

1327
01:26:07,975 --> 01:26:10,808
去死吧，让你马上风死吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.{\r}

1328
01:26:15,215 --> 01:26:16,739

1329
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:28,220

1330

1331
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,655
这里谁负责的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who is in charge here?{\r}

1332
01:26:33,867 --> 01:26:35,027
打开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Open.{\r}

1333
01:26:35,602 --> 01:26:36,899
我是这里当值的主治医师
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm the head doctor on duty.{\r}

1334
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:39,234
你就是把克莉斯汀・柯林斯关起来的那个医生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're the doctor who locked up Christine Collins?{\r}

1335
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:40,432
哦，对不起，先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I'm sorry, sir.{\r}

1336
01:26:40,507 --> 01:26:42,031
对于家属之外的人员，我们不便透露病情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We don't discuss cases with anyone other than family.{\r}

1337
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:44,703

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, you'll damn well discuss this one. Read it.{\r}

1338

1341
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:03,894
柯林斯太太，我最后问你一次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, one last time.{\r}

1342
01:27:03,964 --> 01:27:07,491
你到底愿不愿意签这份声明？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you or are you not prepared to sign that letter?{\r}

1343
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:08,796
我不签
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1344
01:27:13,006 --> 01:27:14,564

1345
01:27:17,978 --> 01:27:19,070
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1346
01:27:19,446 --> 01:27:22,938
你的衣服在旁边的房间里，你可以在那里换衣服
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your clothes are in the next room. You can change there.{\r}

1347
01:27:23,684 --> 01:27:24,708

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In the next room?{\r}

1348
01:27:24,785 --> 01:27:26,412
对，没错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. That's right.{\r}

1349
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:28,751
你自己去拿吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See to it.{\r}

1350
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:34,954
上帝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christ.{\r}

1351
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:36,486
漫长地不敢想象
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Long as it's not the original.{\r}

1352
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:37,621
不是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, it's not.{\r}

1353
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,097
给你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here it is.{\r}

1354
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,997
那是谁的东西？贝克的文件？还是拉尔森的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And who is that? Is that Baker's file or Larson?{\r}

1355
01:27:41,068 --> 01:27:42,296
贝克的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's Baker.{\r}

1356
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:44,234
他说他会…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said he wanted...{\r}

1357
01:27:44,304 --> 01:27:45,703
护士，给我所有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nurse, I wanna see{\r}

1358
01:27:45,772 --> 01:27:48,900
关于克莉斯汀・柯林斯太太的文件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}every piece of paper you have on the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,{\r}

1359
01:27:48,976 --> 01:27:50,967
我现在就要，你听明白没有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I want to see it right now, do you understand me?{\r}

1360
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:53,672
所有的文件，她什么时候能出来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every piece. When will she be coming out?{\r}

1361
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:55,739
马上就能出来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, it's just up ahead.{\r}

1362
01:27:55,816 --> 01:27:57,113
哦，很好，我们…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, all right. Let's...{\r}

1363
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,414
暴风袭击了西棕榈沙滩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hurricane hits West Palm Beach!{\r}

1364
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:01,954
贝比鲁斯击出第53记本垒打
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Babe Ruth hits 53rd home run!{\r}

1365
01:28:02,923 --> 01:28:04,914
河岸幼童谋杀案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kids found murdered in Riverside! There it is.{\r}

1366
01:28:04,992 --> 01:28:07,859
洛杉矶史上最残酷的犯罪!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Biggest crime in Los Angeles history!{\r}

1367
01:28:07,928 --> 01:28:09,987
柯林斯的孩子可能已经死了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Collins boy assumed dead!{\r}

1368
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:13,689
请看这里！请看这里！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Read it here! Read it here!{\r}

1369
01:28:19,006 --> 01:28:21,099
柯林斯太太 我很遗憾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, I'm so sorry.{\r}

1370
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:27,809
上尉，你处理克莉斯汀・柯林斯一案的方式
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain, your handling of the Christine Collins case{\r}

1371
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,941
让警局在公众面前闹了大笑话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}has exposed this department to public ridicule.{\r}

1372
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:35,351
这里不仅是民事责任了，还有刑法责任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There is even the possibility of civil and criminal liability.{\r}

1373
01:28:35,822 --> 01:28:38,689
长官，没有人会预先知道那个农场里发生了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir, nobody could've known what was happening up at that ranch.{\r}

1374
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:41,819
我们不知道，治安官部门不知道 执法办公室也不会知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not us, the sheriff's department, or the marshal's office.{\r}

1375
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:43,988
至于这个叫做柯林斯的女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And as for the Collins woman,{\r}

1376
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:46,828
我还是不太相信她的儿子也是怀恩威尔案的受害者之一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm still not convinced that her boy is among the victims up in Wineville.{\r}

1377
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:48,059
你不相信？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No?{\r}

1378
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:49,102
不相信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1379
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:52,661
这里还有4张失踪孩子的照片，长得都很像他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There were four other photos of missing boys that looked a lot like him.{\r}

1380
01:28:52,739 --> 01:28:54,673
那个克拉克可能认错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Clark kid could've been mistaken.{\r}

1381
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:56,072
可能吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe he was.{\r}

1382
01:28:56,143 --> 01:28:59,374
但更重要的是，没人在乎他是不是认错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Which begs the obvious question. Who cares?{\r}

1383
01:29:00,781 --> 01:29:01,873
长官？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir?{\r}

1384
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:04,310
市长希望让这件事尽快被大家遗忘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The mayor wants this to go away.{\r}

1385
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:06,477
我也这样希望
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want this to go away.{\r}

1386
01:29:06,553 --> 01:29:10,045
你所要做的就是默认沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins{\r}

1387
01:29:10,123 --> 01:29:12,648
也是在那间该死的庄园被杀的孩子之一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is not among those boys killed up at that goddamn ranch.{\r}

1388
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:15,286
因为如果你带回来的那个孩子不是沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because if the boy you brought back is not Walter Collins,{\r}

1389
01:29:15,362 --> 01:29:18,354
而他又没有死在农庄里，那他妈的这孩子到底会在哪里？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he?{\r}

1390
01:29:18,432 --> 01:29:20,127
人们会开始想，为什么我们没有找到那小子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People are gonna want to know why we haven't found him.{\r}

1391
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,464
为什么我们连尽职尽责都做不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why we're not doing our job.{\r}

1392
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,263
相对的，如果
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But if, on the other hand,{\r}

1393
01:29:25,339 --> 01:29:29,605
他是，或者可能是死在怀恩威尔的可怜孩子之一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}he is, or could be, among those poor boys killed up in Wineville,{\r}

1394
01:29:30,077 --> 01:29:32,409
那么质疑的声音就不会出现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}then the inquiries stop.{\r}

1395
01:29:34,147 --> 01:29:35,705
只是短暂的不愉快罢了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a momentary embarrassment{\r}

1396
01:29:35,782 --> 01:29:37,909
你得自己担起来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you're just gonna have to live with.{\r}

1397
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:39,451
忍过这段糟糕的时间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Better a short inconvenience{\r}

1398
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:42,682
总比一直拖着问题好 你说呢，上尉？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?{\r}

1399
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:43,916
是，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.{\r}

1400
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:45,855
那个孩子已经失踪快1年了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The boy's been gone nearly a year.{\r}

1401
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:49,089
就算能找到他，现在也不是时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now.{\r}

1402
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:50,527
不管他是不是在那个农庄里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whether he was up at that ranch or not,{\r}

1403
01:29:50,597 --> 01:29:52,792
真相就是他可能死在别的地方了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the truth is he probably is dead somewhere.{\r}

1404
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:56,927
最好他的母亲能马上知道这个消息，你说呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Better his mother accept that now than later, don't you think?{\r}

1405
01:29:57,003 --> 01:29:58,994
- 是，长官 - 很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir. Good.{\r}

1406
01:29:59,072 --> 01:30:00,699
就这样，上尉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That'll be all, Captain.{\r}

1407
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:06,072
我们就照您所要求的去做 这事情就这样处理了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's how you want it, then I guess we're done here.{\r}

1408
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:07,940
跟地区监狱说，把他关押候审
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell county jail we're remanding him for trial.{\r}

1409
01:30:08,014 --> 01:30:11,882
等等，我什么都没有做 事情发生的时候我根本不在场
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait. I didn't do anything. I wasn't even here when it happened.{\r}

1410
01:30:13,086 --> 01:30:14,417
假装自己是沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By pretending to be Walter Collins,{\r}

1411
01:30:14,488 --> 01:30:17,980
你的所作所为干扰了警察对一宗 绑架谋杀案的调查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder.{\r}

1412
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:21,050
如果找到证据，我们可以认定你是杀人犯的同伙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can try you as accomplice to that murder after the fact.{\r}

1413
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:22,561
太可惜了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's too bad.{\r}

1414
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:26,360
地方监狱可比少管所和孤儿之家要惨多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}County jail is a lot worse than a juvenile hall or a foster home.{\r}

1415
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:27,832
糟糕得多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a lot worse.{\r}

1416
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:32,327
你不能那么做 我还没有成年
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't do that. I'm just a kid.{\r}

1417
01:30:34,841 --> 01:30:36,866
桑佛德・克拉克也是个孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sanford Clark's a kid, too.{\r}

1418
01:30:36,943 --> 01:30:39,411
15岁，他会进监狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fifteen. He's going to jail.{\r}

1419
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,677
谋杀犯和他的同伙都要进监狱，这个道理大家都懂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All murderers and their accomplices go to jail. Everybody knows that.{\r}

1420
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:48,582
把他带出去，事情解决了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get him out of here. It's out of my hands now.{\r}

1421
01:30:48,655 --> 01:30:51,180
等等，我不想进监狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait. I don't want to go to jail.{\r}

1422
01:31:01,435 --> 01:31:02,697
那就证明你无罪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Prove it.{\r}

1423
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:05,668
我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I...{\r}

1424
01:31:05,806 --> 01:31:09,333
我知道汤姆・米克斯是在洛杉矶拍的电影
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies.{\r}

1425
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:11,910
我就想，如果我能碰到汤姆・米克斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I figured if I could meet Tom Mix{\r}

1426
01:31:11,978 --> 01:31:14,674
也许他会答应让我骑他的马
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}maybe he would let me ride on his horse.{\r}

1427
01:31:16,216 --> 01:31:18,776
他的马叫做托尼，你知道不？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His horse is named Tony. Did you know that?{\r}

1428
01:31:23,089 --> 01:31:24,488
你觉得怎么样了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How are you feeling?{\r}

1429
01:31:24,558 --> 01:31:25,923
还好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

1430
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,389
还有一辆警察的车停在外面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police still have a car outside.{\r}

1431
01:31:28,462 --> 01:31:32,330
我猜他们是想知道你接下去要做什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I guess they're waiting to see what your next move is going to be.{\r}

1432
01:31:33,467 --> 01:31:35,492
- 我要回家 - 然后呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going home. And then?{\r}

1433
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:37,903
然后，我能想到很多事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then, I've been giving it a lot of thought.{\r}

1434
01:31:37,971 --> 01:31:42,465
他们是怎么对待这些女人的 还有他们是怎么对待沃特的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what they did to those women, and what they did about Walter.{\r}

1435
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:47,006
我一直教他，永远不要主动动手，但要保证自己赢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I used to always tell him, "You never start a fight, but you always finish it. "{\r}

1436
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,481
这次的事情不是我挑起来的，但是要由我来结束
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I didn't start this fight, but I'm gonna finish it.{\r}

1437
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:55,282
柯林斯太太，你现在是个公众关注人物了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, right now you're a sufficiently high profile that I think{\r}

1438
01:31:55,355 --> 01:31:59,189
我想，现在警察就算想派人跟着你，也要考虑一下了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}even the police would hesitate to go after you out in the open,{\r}

1439
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:02,059
但是我必须警告你，事情的变化很快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but I have to warn you that could change very quickly{\r}

1440
01:32:02,128 --> 01:32:04,824
如果他们觉得自己的位置受到了威胁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}if they feel their position threatened.{\r}

1441
01:32:04,898 --> 01:32:06,695
整个风向都会变，真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Very quickly indeed.{\r}

1442
01:32:08,068 --> 01:32:10,400
他们现在想怎么对付我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are they gonna do to me now?{\r}

1443
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:13,932
他们没有证据
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They got nothing.{\r}

1444
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:18,467
我要回家了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going home.{\r}

1445
01:32:30,202 --> 01:32:33,601
加拿大，温哥华 1928年9月20日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1446
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:43,601
嗨，姐姐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, sis.{\r}

1447
01:32:44,337 --> 01:32:45,668
高顿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gordon.{\r}

1448
01:32:45,739 --> 01:32:48,230
我都不知道你回来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't know you were back in town.{\r}

1449
01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:51,070
嗯，我几天前就回来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I got in a couple of days ago,{\r}

1450
01:32:51,144 --> 01:32:54,011
我想给你个惊喜，没有…没有什么问题吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}figured I'd surprise you. Is that... Is that okay?{\r}

1451
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,106
当然，当然没有 进来吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Yes, of course. Of course, come on in.{\r}

1452
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,318
我那个小侄女呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where's that little niece of mine?{\r}

1453
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:04,516
她进城里去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She went into town.{\r}

1454
01:33:04,591 --> 01:33:06,081
晚上应该能回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Should be back this evening.{\r}

1455
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,353
呃，鲍勃在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uh, Bob's here.{\r}

1456
01:33:07,427 --> 01:33:08,485
哦，那好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, good.{\r}

1457
01:33:08,562 --> 01:33:10,894
呃，我是想问你，我能不能在你这里待段时间
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uh, I was gonna ask if I could stay on a couple days.{\r}

1458
01:33:10,964 --> 01:33:12,329
你要住下？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Staying?{\r}

1459
01:33:12,732 --> 01:33:13,858
对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1460
01:33:13,934 --> 01:33:16,198
我可不可以用下你的浴室
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, can I use your bathroom?{\r}

1461
01:33:16,269 --> 01:33:18,260
我开了很久的车，想要好好洗个澡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's been a long ride and I could really use a shower.{\r}

1462
01:33:18,338 --> 01:33:20,272
- 当然可以 - 好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course. Okay.{\r}

1463
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,406
谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

1464
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,018
他不是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is that...{\r}

1465
01:33:38,224 --> 01:33:41,591
没事的，去隔壁 我会给警察打电话的，快去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, go next door. I'll call the police. Hurry.{\r}

1466
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:48,061
你好，需要我接什么号码吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Operator. How may I connect you?{\r}

1467
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:49,693
长官，他就在楼上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's upstairs, sir.{\r}

1468
01:33:49,769 --> 01:33:52,533
从另一边绕过去！截住他！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go around the other side! Cut him off!{\r}

1469
01:33:52,606 --> 01:33:53,664
跟我来！ 是，长官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come with me! Yes, sir.{\r}

1470
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,037
我们行动！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's go!{\r}

1471
01:33:59,212 --> 01:34:03,080
柯林斯太太，我想请你见下我的朋友，哈恩先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, I'd like you to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.{\r}

1472
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:06,778
柯林斯太太，对于你的遭遇我表示深深的遗憾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, my deepest condolences on your loss.{\r}

1473
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,012
我们能进来吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May we come in?{\r}

1474
01:34:13,126 --> 01:34:15,026
谢谢你的关心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I appreciate the sentiment,{\r}

1475
01:34:15,095 --> 01:34:17,325
但是他们说…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but they've yet to find...{\r}

1476
01:34:17,397 --> 01:34:19,922
已经确认了我儿子的尸体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To identify the remains as my son.{\r}

1477
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:24,593
恐怕没有那么容易放下吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid it never gets any easier.{\r}

1478
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:27,332
5年前我的女儿因为小儿麻痹症去世了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I lost a daughter to polio five years ago.{\r}

1479
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:29,602
我每一天，无时无刻不在思念她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's not a day goes by when I don't think,{\r}

1480
01:34:29,676 --> 01:34:32,201
总是想，我应该把这个告诉克劳蒂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"I should mention this to Claudine. "{\r}

1481
01:34:32,278 --> 01:34:34,644
然后我才记起来，她已经不在了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then I remember she's not here.{\r}

1482
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:38,814
请坐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, sit.{\r}

1483
01:34:43,757 --> 01:34:45,691
我今天早上都在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been on the phone all morning{\r}

1484
01:34:45,759 --> 01:34:48,956
和警察总署的秘书交涉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}with the appointment secretary of the police commission.{\r}

1485
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:50,997
他们不同意让我出庭作证
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They said that they won't let me testify{\r}

1486
01:34:51,064 --> 01:34:54,329
或者传召证人 说没有这个必要
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}at the hearing or call witnesses. That it won't be necessary.{\r}

1487
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:56,995
我知道，我听到消息说检查总署
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know. My sources say the police commission{\r}

1488
01:34:57,070 --> 01:35:01,166
决定宣布说琼斯和洛杉矶警局没有错误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is going to say that Jones and the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,{\r}

1489
01:35:01,274 --> 01:35:04,334
他们要把责任都推到那个孩子身上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and that the real blame lies with the kid and with you{\r}

1490
01:35:04,411 --> 01:35:09,348
还有你给他们的工作带来了困扰 为了你的个人安全，他们不得不把你隔离
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.{\r}

1491
01:35:12,686 --> 01:35:16,850
那样的话我想我需要雇个律师 提起民事诉讼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then I guess I would have to hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.{\r}

1492
01:35:17,657 --> 01:35:19,591
我找了城里最好的检察官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I went to the best attorney in town,{\r}

1493
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:22,492
他和市里面打了4场官司，都赢了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}a man who's sued this city four times and won.{\r}

1494
01:35:22,562 --> 01:35:25,531
可惜的是我们请不起他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Unfortunately, we can't afford to really hire him.{\r}

1495
01:35:25,598 --> 01:35:26,826
我明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see.{\r}

1496
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,391
所以我会接受这个案子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Which is why I'm doing this pro bono.{\r}

1497
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:33,269
很荣幸能够为你辩护，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

1498
01:35:33,473 --> 01:35:34,838
在我做律师的15年里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In my 15 years as a lawyer,{\r}

1499
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:38,708
从没有见过任何人像你这样坚持又倔强地争斗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have,{\r}

1500
01:35:38,945 --> 01:35:42,108
毫无疑问，正义站在你这一边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.{\r}

1501
01:35:42,882 --> 01:35:44,247
谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

1502
01:35:44,818 --> 01:35:46,183
让我看看，书架上有什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me see what's on the shelf.{\r}

1503
01:35:46,252 --> 01:35:47,583
我来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll look.{\r}

1504
01:35:49,656 --> 01:35:50,748
你好？我可不可以…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes? May I...{\r}

1505
01:35:50,824 --> 01:35:52,155
我叫S.S.哈恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is S.S. Hahn,{\r}

1506
01:35:52,225 --> 01:35:55,058
我手上有法庭的执行令 要求你们释放所有因为第12条行政令
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I have a court order for the immediate release of all women being detained{\r}

1507
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:58,063
而被关押进这家机构的所有女性
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in this institution under the designation code 12{\r}

1508
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:01,362
并就将他们关押的理由的正当性提出质疑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}pending a formal inquiry into the reasons for their detainment.{\r}

1509
01:36:01,434 --> 01:36:03,595
对不起，主管医生现在不在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry, the doctor in charge is not here{\r}

1510
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,194
大概要等到早上 女士，我清楚地和你说吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until the morning. Madam, let me be clearer.{\r}

1511
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:08,035
要不你就乖乖地照执行令说的给我名单
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Either you will produce the people named in that court order,{\r}

1512
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:11,669
要不然你会发现自己出现在铁栏杆后 而且是没有钥匙孔的那边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or you will find yourself behind bars, and I mean without a key.{\r}

1513
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:14,873
我没有权限给你… 女士，请让一让
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't authorize you... Madam, stand aside.{\r}

1514
01:36:24,858 --> 01:36:25,916
我能见她了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I see her now?{\r}

1515
01:36:25,992 --> 01:36:28,017
当然，没问题 她怎么样了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure. Absolutely. How does she look?{\r}

1516
01:36:53,653 --> 01:36:55,621
好了，朋友们，都退后 给他让条路
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, fellas, step back. Let's give him room.{\r}

1517
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:56,712
他在这里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here he is.{\r}

1518
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,781
诺斯考特先生 关于被捕，请你说几句
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, any comment on your arrest?{\r}

1519
01:36:58,858 --> 01:37:00,018
诺斯考特先生 你现在是怎么想的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, how are you feeling?{\r}

1520
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:01,754
哦，我觉得挺不错的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I'm feeling fine.{\r}

1521
01:37:01,828 --> 01:37:04,353
正如你们所知道的，我度了个小假
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been on a little vacation, as some of you know.{\r}

1522
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:07,126
是个非常愉快的假期
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was a really pleasant vacation.{\r}

1523
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:10,431
最近警察和我找了不少乐子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police have certainly provided me with a lot of amusement.{\r}

1524
01:37:10,503 --> 01:37:11,936
你躲了多久？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How long you been in hiding?{\r}

1525
01:37:12,005 --> 01:37:13,267
你是怎么逃过警察追捕的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How did you avoid capture?{\r}

1526
01:37:13,339 --> 01:37:14,601
别吵，别吵，都问够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Easy, easy. That's far enough.{\r}

1527
01:37:14,674 --> 01:37:16,369
是吗，我可没有，对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I didn't, did I?{\r}

1528
01:37:16,442 --> 01:37:17,534
再来一张！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One more shot!{\r}

1529
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,578
你见到报纸上自己的照片了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you seen your picture in the paper?{\r}

1530
01:37:19,646 --> 01:37:22,877
我直到最近才知道有人要抓我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Didn't know anybody wanted me until just recently.{\r}

1531
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:24,541
我没有逃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Didn't even try.{\r}

1532
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:28,211
伙计，我的行李上还有我的名字缩写呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My luggage still has my initials on it, fellas.{\r}

1533
01:37:28,288 --> 01:37:30,415
你知道警察为什么要抓你吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you know why the police were after you?{\r}

1534
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:33,391
不知道，不过如果能不沾染上官司 我觉得会更好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, but I figured it'd be a good idea if I were to just stay out of it.{\r}

1535
01:37:33,459 --> 01:37:34,483
你感到羞愧吗？先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Any remorse, sir?{\r}

1536
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:39,260
你有什么话要对被你谋杀的孩子的父母说吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you have anything to say to the parents of the children you murdered?{\r}

1537
01:37:39,332 --> 01:37:41,027
无可奉告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No comment.{\r}

1538
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,192
再拍一张 看这里！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One more shot, this way!{\r}

1539
01:37:43,803 --> 01:37:46,465
克雷尔市长，事情太出人意料了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mayor Cryer. This is unexpected.{\r}

1540
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,864
的确
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So was this.{\r}

1541
01:37:48,942 --> 01:37:52,378
传票，要求宣誓证词, 接受问讯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Subpoenas, requests for depositions, interrogatories.{\r}

1542
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:56,040
来自哈恩先生和他的新客户克莉斯汀・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his new client, Christine Collins.{\r}

1543
01:37:56,983 --> 01:37:58,541
局长，你不用凑那么近去看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't have to look them over too closely, Chief.{\r}

1544
01:37:58,618 --> 01:38:01,382
你那份传票很快就会送到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your own copies should be coming any time now.{\r}

1545
01:38:01,454 --> 01:38:03,888
本市议会也同意调查本案了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The city council has also agreed to look into this,{\r}

1546
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:05,015
马上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}starting immediately.{\r}

1547
01:38:05,091 --> 01:38:06,149
该死的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}God damn it!{\r}

1548
01:38:06,226 --> 01:38:08,956
我还以为事情总算过去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought this was supposed to go away.{\r}

1549
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:10,824
今年是选举年
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is an election year.{\r}

1550
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:12,387
我可不想闹出这么大的负面新闻来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't afford this kind of press.{\r}

1551
01:38:12,465 --> 01:38:15,696
很快就会解决的，我已经告诉琼斯上尉怎么做了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It is going away, sir. I've instructed Captain Jones to deal with it.{\r}

1552
01:38:15,768 --> 01:38:17,326
我担心的是，就算他低声下气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid, falling on his sword{\r}

1553
01:38:17,403 --> 01:38:21,305
道歉说他犯了错，也没法弥补了，局长
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and saying he made a mistake isn't going to be good enough, Chief.{\r}

1554
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:24,832
我们让他躲一阵子风头
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we take him out of the picture for a while,{\r}

1555
01:38:24,911 --> 01:38:28,711
直到庭审结束，等事情冷下来会比较好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}just might help calm things down until the hearing's finished.{\r}

1556
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:48,664
发生了什么事？ 你没有听说吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What is happening? Didn't you hear?{\r}

1557
01:38:48,735 --> 01:38:50,498
这是我见过的最庞大的抗议队伍了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's the biggest protest I've ever seen.{\r}

1558
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:51,832
抗议 对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Protest? Yeah.{\r}

1559
01:38:51,905 --> 01:38:55,102
都是支持柯林斯的 让人难以置信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Over the Collins broad, if you can believe that.{\r}

1560
01:39:04,684 --> 01:39:07,847
我们要公正！ 我们要公正！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We want justice! We want justice!{\r}

1561
01:39:10,256 --> 01:39:11,848
哦，天啊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my!{\r}

1562
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:20,299
哈里斯先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Harris.{\r}

1563
01:39:20,366 --> 01:39:23,665
上帝的行事必然有他的道理，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

1564
01:39:24,904 --> 01:39:26,769
真的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Boy, does he ever.{\r}

1565
01:39:44,057 --> 01:39:46,651
女士们，先生们，请听我说
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?{\r}

1566
01:39:46,726 --> 01:39:51,288
这是有史以来参庭人数最多的一次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There are more people gathered in this chamber than have ever been in this room before.{\r}

1567
01:39:51,364 --> 01:39:55,061
所以我想请你们稍微克制一下你们的举动
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Therefore, I ask you to refrain from demonstrations of any kind.{\r}

1568
01:39:55,134 --> 01:39:56,624
告诉我们真相！告诉我们真相！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell the truth! Tell the truth!{\r}

1569
01:39:56,703 --> 01:40:00,605
我们聚集在这里是因为我们都想知道事实的真相
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We are all here because we want to know the real facts in this case.{\r}

1570
01:40:00,673 --> 01:40:04,803
我想一周之后，我们就能够知道事情的真相了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And everybody is going to be heard if we have to sit here for a week.{\r}

1571
01:40:04,877 --> 01:40:07,778
索普先生，我怎么没有看到警察总署的人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any members of the police commission.{\r}

1572
01:40:11,284 --> 01:40:14,447
房间里有谁是警局的代表吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are there any members of the police department in the room?{\r}

1573
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,385
戴维斯局长在吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is Chief Davis here?{\r}

1574
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:19,382
琼斯上尉来了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is Captain Jones here?{\r}

1575
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,559
这里有谁是代表警察的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is there anybody here representing the police?{\r}

1576
01:40:22,628 --> 01:40:26,826
柯林斯太太，请你和我一起到外面去下可以吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, could you come across the street with me for just a moment?{\r}

1577
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:29,094
我想你应该看看这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's something I think you should see.{\r}

1578
01:40:29,168 --> 01:40:31,193
好吧，虽然我不希望在开庭前就要求中止
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I hate to call a recess before we've even started,{\r}

1579
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:32,794
不过我想我得先打几个电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but I think a few phone calls are in order.{\r}

1580
01:40:37,043 --> 01:40:39,944
警察方面希望审判能够在非公开的场合进行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The police decided it'd be best to keep this off the main docket{\r}

1581
01:40:40,046 --> 01:40:44,278
以免出现街对面那样的混乱局面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos we have across the street.{\r}

1582
01:40:56,929 --> 01:40:59,898
柯林斯太太 我是莉安・克雷
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins. I'm Leanne Clay.{\r}

1583
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,964
这是我的丈夫，约翰 你好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is my husband, John. Hi.{\r}

1584
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:06,896
我只是想表达我的同情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just wanted to pass along my sympathies.{\r}

1585
01:41:07,173 --> 01:41:09,300
我们以为自己儿子戴维的消息已经够糟糕了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What we went through waiting to hear anything{\r}

1586
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:13,505
结果现在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}about our son David was bad enough, now this.{\r}

1587
01:41:14,447 --> 01:41:18,406
警察们对你的所作所为，实在是令人发指
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But what the police did to you, there was no call for that.{\r}

1588
01:41:18,484 --> 01:41:20,042
太过分了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No call at all.{\r}

1589
01:41:23,056 --> 01:41:24,614
请起立
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All rise.{\r}

1590
01:41:33,366 --> 01:41:35,391
请大家都坐下 法警
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, be seated. Bailiff.{\r}

1591
01:41:48,648 --> 01:41:49,842
哦，嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, hey.{\r}

1592
01:41:52,051 --> 01:41:54,178
我在报纸上看到你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw you in the papers.{\r}

1593
01:41:54,253 --> 01:41:58,121
你真的很有胆量，敢跟这样的警察作对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got a lot of moxie, standing up to the police like that.{\r}

1594
01:42:03,329 --> 01:42:05,263
请被告起立
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The defendant will please rise.{\r}

1595
01:42:10,903 --> 01:42:12,996
高顿・斯图尔特・诺斯考特,
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gordon Stewart Northcott,{\r}

1596
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:17,236
你被指控犯有3宗一级谋杀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you've been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree,{\r}

1597
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:22,009
另有17项未确认指控正在接受地区检察官的调查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}with an additional 17 counts under review by the district attorney's office.{\r}

1598
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:23,708
你可认罪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How do you plea?{\r}

1599
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:27,245
我没有罪，法官大人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.{\r}

1600
01:42:31,023 --> 01:42:33,184
诺斯考特先生，请坐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You may sit, Mr. Northcott.{\r}

1601
01:42:37,763 --> 01:42:42,700
考虑到被告喜欢进行跨国旅行，所以不允许保释
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set.{\r}

1602
01:42:42,768 --> 01:42:45,362
法庭会在明天造成听取初步动议
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This court will hear preliminary motions by tomorrow morning.{\r}

1603
01:42:45,438 --> 01:42:47,906
一名叫作沃特・柯林斯的男孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The boy, Walter Collins,{\r}

1604
01:42:47,974 --> 01:42:50,738
在1928年3月10日失踪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}was reported as missing, March 10, 1928.{\r}

1605
01:42:51,544 --> 01:42:54,172
之后我们进行了全国性的搜索
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We then instituted a nationwide search.{\r}

1606
01:42:54,247 --> 01:42:58,183
在8月18日，我们接到一个电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On August 18th, we received a cable indicating that a boy{\r}

1607
01:42:58,251 --> 01:43:01,687
告知在伊利诺斯州，德卡博发现了一名 符合他外貌特征的男孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}matching his description was found in DeKalb, Illinois.{\r}

1608
01:43:01,754 --> 01:43:05,781
经过问讯，他承认自己是沃特・柯林斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins.{\r}

1609
01:43:05,858 --> 01:43:10,818
我们安排这个孩子坐火车回到了加利福尼亚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We then made arrangements for him to be transported back to California.{\r}

1610
01:43:11,063 --> 01:43:13,531
之后柯林斯太太告诉你说那个男孩不是她的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not her son.{\r}

1611
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:15,362
是的，她拒绝承认
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. She denied his identity{\r}

1612
01:43:15,434 --> 01:43:18,426
而各项证据都证明这孩子是她的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in spite of all of the evidence pointing to the contrary.{\r}

1613
01:43:18,504 --> 01:43:21,598
但是后来的种种迹象表明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But, as subsequent events have demonstrated,{\r}

1614
01:43:21,707 --> 01:43:23,368
她说的是对的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}she was correct.{\r}

1615
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:26,475
那么，出于什么原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, what prompted you to send her{\r}

1616
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:28,173
你要将她送去接受心理检查呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for psychological evaluation?{\r}

1617
01:43:28,247 --> 01:43:29,976
这个孩子是不是她的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy{\r}

1618
01:43:30,049 --> 01:43:32,574
和我的决定没有关系
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}was not relevant to my decision.{\r}

1619
01:43:32,652 --> 01:43:34,813
在那段时间里，她的行为十分怪异
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Throughout this period, she acted strangely.{\r}

1620
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:38,414
她表现的很冷酷，淡漠，面无表情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She was often cool and aloof and unemotional,{\r}

1621
01:43:38,491 --> 01:43:42,154
特别是面对我们在德卡博找到的男孩时
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}especially when confronted with the boy we found in DeKalb{\r}

1622
01:43:42,228 --> 01:43:44,287
以及在我们后续的交谈中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and in our subsequent conversation.{\r}

1623
01:43:44,363 --> 01:43:46,228
她的种种奇怪表现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was because of her{\r}

1624
01:43:47,033 --> 01:43:51,732
所以我同意将她送去洛杉矶综合医院
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation{\r}

1625
01:43:51,804 --> 01:43:54,602
在精神病院接受看护
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital.{\r}

1626
01:43:54,674 --> 01:43:55,971
就这么一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just like that.{\r}

1627
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:58,237
你只不过打了个响指
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You snap your fingers and an innocent woman{\r}

1628
01:43:58,311 --> 01:44:00,006
就把一个无辜的女人丢进了精神病院！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}is thrown into the psycho ward!{\r}

1629
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,412
- 不是被强制的 - 如果任何一个警察上尉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wasn't thrown. Every family in this state is in grave danger{\r}

1630
01:44:03,482 --> 01:44:06,610
都可以用职权 在5分钟内将一个刚进入他办公室的女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when a police captain can take a woman into his office{\r}

1631
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,016
强制送进精神病院的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and five minutes later{\r}

1632
01:44:08,087 --> 01:44:10,817
恐怕这个州的每一个家庭正受到这潜在的威胁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority!{\r}

1633
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:12,289
她不算是被强迫的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wasn't thrown.{\r}

1634
01:44:12,358 --> 01:44:15,691
我们没有强迫她！ 她不算是被强迫进去的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wasn't thrown! She wasn't thrown!{\r}

1635
01:44:16,362 --> 01:44:18,262
那是怎么样的呢？队长？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What was that, Captain?{\r}

1636
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:21,059
我们没有强制遣送她 她是被护送入院的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wasn't thrown. She was escorted.{\r}

1637
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:28,331
护送，强制，用什么样的动词都没有区别，上尉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, Captain.{\r}

1638
01:44:28,407 --> 01:44:32,639
问题在于她是在没有逮捕令的情况下被关押的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant.{\r}

1639
01:44:32,712 --> 01:44:34,646
我这里有一份洛杉矶州就克莉斯汀・柯林斯一案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am holding a carbon copy{\r}

1640
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:37,842
下发的精神错乱鉴定证词
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case{\r}

1641
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:41,353
的文件副本
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of the State of California v. Christine Collins.{\r}

1642
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,887
这份证词是谁签的字？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who signed the affidavit?{\r}

1643
01:44:42,955 --> 01:44:44,047
是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I did.{\r}

1644
01:44:44,123 --> 01:44:46,751
好吧，那么让我看下这个说法对不对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, now, let me see if I have this correct,{\r}

1645
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:50,421
你们在没有逮捕令的情况下将一个女人关进精神病院里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}a woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant,{\r}

1646
01:44:50,496 --> 01:44:52,657
因为根本没有所谓的逮捕令存在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}because no warrant existed.{\r}

1647
01:44:52,732 --> 01:44:55,292
等到逮捕令写好已经是几天之后了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And when it was finally written several days later,{\r}

1648
01:44:55,368 --> 01:44:57,734
那时候她人已经被关进病院里去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}there was no need to sign it or to go to a judge{\r}

1649
01:44:57,803 --> 01:45:00,567
也就不需要再签发或者向法官提交了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}because she was already in the asylum!{\r}

1650
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:03,333
是这样吧，上尉先生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is this correct, Captain?{\r}

1651
01:45:03,409 --> 01:45:04,671
理论上来说，是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Technically, yes.{\r}

1652
01:45:04,744 --> 01:45:07,770
有时候非常规手段是必须的，因为我们是在处理…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing...{\r}

1653
01:45:07,847 --> 01:45:09,678
我们是在处理非常的事件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We were dealing with an extraordinary situation.{\r}

1654
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:12,445
我们被一个自称是沃特・柯林斯的小鬼给骗了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, is it our fault that we were being deceived{\r}

1655
01:45:12,518 --> 01:45:15,316
这是我们的错吗？不是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}by a boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No.{\r}

1656
01:45:16,088 --> 01:45:19,080
光听孩子的话，再看她的奇怪表现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In light of his claims and her disturbing behavior,{\r}

1657
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:21,752
谁会想到她说的是真的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}who wouldn't begin to think that there was something the matter with her?{\r}

1658
01:45:21,827 --> 01:45:22,851
因为她质疑了你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because she questioned you?{\r}

1659
01:45:22,928 --> 01:45:25,123
不是，是因为她不肯听我们说的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, because she wouldn't listen!{\r}

1660
01:45:25,197 --> 01:45:26,994
是因为她表现地很顽固！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because she insisted on being obstinate!{\r}

1661
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:30,263
因为她不愿意相信我们这样的职业警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because she tried to take matters into her own hand,{\r}

1662
01:45:30,369 --> 01:45:32,132
而是固执地想把所有事情掌控起来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}best left to qualified officers!{\r}

1663
01:45:32,204 --> 01:45:33,899
而且，一旦涉及到公民不服从权…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because once civil disobedience starts...{\r}

1664
01:45:33,973 --> 01:45:36,032
因为她在争夺自己儿子的生命！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because she was fighting for the life of her son!{\r}

1665
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:38,099
一个可能还活着的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A boy who may have still been alive{\r}

1666
01:45:38,177 --> 01:45:42,841
而你却在浪费宝贵的时间，拒绝承认自己做错了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong!{\r}

1667
01:45:45,584 --> 01:45:47,142
再之后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And in the end{\r}

1668
01:45:48,654 --> 01:45:51,384
你的处理方法就是把她送进精神病院，对不对？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that's what happened, isn't it?{\r}

1669
01:45:51,490 --> 01:45:54,948
而同时，在这一切发生的同时
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}At some point, while all this was going on,{\r}

1670
01:45:57,129 --> 01:45:59,791
沃特・柯林斯和其他的19个孩子一样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter Collins was brutally murdered,{\r}

1671
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:03,166
在怀恩威尔的诺斯考特农庄里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}along with as many as 19 other boys{\r}

1672
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:07,632
被残忍的杀害了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}at the Northcott Ranch in Wineville.{\r}

1673
01:46:09,442 --> 01:46:11,603
是不是这样，上尉？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is that correct, Captain?{\r}

1674
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:14,735
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, it is.{\r}

1675
01:46:15,481 --> 01:46:17,108
这就是所谓的公正么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a travesty.{\r}

1676
01:46:22,788 --> 01:46:24,619
我没有问题了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No further questions.{\r}

1677
01:46:42,007 --> 01:46:43,998
14号列车已经进站，请旅客们上车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Train number 14, now boarding on track...{\r}

1678
01:46:44,076 --> 01:46:47,944
那么，通过一番努力，我们终于能够确认
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, after much effort, we were able to identify this boy,{\r}

1679
01:46:48,013 --> 01:46:50,573
这个之前给我们惹来不少麻烦的孩子的身份了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}who's been responsible for so much trouble lately,{\r}

1680
01:46:50,649 --> 01:46:53,516
他是爱荷华州锡达拉皮兹的亚瑟・赫金斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.{\r}

1681
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,585
此外，我们已经将涉嫌谋杀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Between this, and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering{\r}

1682
01:46:57,656 --> 01:46:59,385
真正的沃特・柯林斯的嫌犯逮捕了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the real Walter Collins,{\r}

1683
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:02,723
我们解开了洛杉矶史上最大的两个谜团
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we've cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.{\r}

1684
01:47:02,795 --> 01:47:04,990
我希望媒体的各位先生们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you gentlemen of the press will give{\r}

1685
01:47:05,064 --> 01:47:07,123
能够不吝版面帮我们的功绩做些宣传
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}as much space to the good things we do{\r}

1686
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,759
不要过分关注某些罕见情况造成的小失误
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions.{\r}

1687
01:47:09,835 --> 01:47:11,666
先生们，请允许我们向各位介绍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you{\r}

1688
01:47:11,737 --> 01:47:14,797
孩子真正的母亲简奈特・赫金斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to the boy's real mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.{\r}

1689
01:47:16,242 --> 01:47:17,709
亚瑟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Arthur.{\r}

1690
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:19,300
但愿他没有给你们添太多麻烦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope he wasn't too much trouble for you.{\r}

1691
01:47:19,378 --> 01:47:21,175
哦，没有，一点也没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no, not at all.{\r}

1692
01:47:21,247 --> 01:47:23,442
伙计，来张合照？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How about a photograph, fellas?{\r}

1693
01:47:26,519 --> 01:47:27,918
再来张
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One more.{\r}

1694
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:29,920
赫金斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Hutchins,{\r}

1695
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:33,322
这是柯林斯太太，亚瑟一直和她呆在一起 她希望你能收下这些东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins, the woman he was staying with, wanted him to have these.{\r}

1696
01:47:33,392 --> 01:47:34,882
这是她给他穿的衣服
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're the clothes she let him wear.{\r}

1697
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,757
谢谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, thank you.{\r}

1698
01:47:36,829 --> 01:47:38,592
亚瑟，她真是个好人对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Isn't that nice, Arthur?{\r}

1699
01:47:38,664 --> 01:47:41,030
向好心的长官说声谢谢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell the nice officer, "Thank you. "{\r}

1700
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:44,092
我不要这些东西，给别人吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't want them. Give them to somebody else.{\r}

1701
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,797
这孩子真老成，不是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Precocious little fellow, isn't he?{\r}

1702
01:47:45,871 --> 01:47:48,169
这不是我的错，都是警察的错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not my fault. It's the police.{\r}

1703
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,869
他们说我是沃特・柯林斯的，不是我要说的 不是我的主意！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They said I was Walter Collins, not me! It wasn't my idea!{\r}

1704
01:47:51,944 --> 01:47:53,411
不是我的主意！ 上…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not my idea! Get...{\r}

1705
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:55,913
是啊，去怪警察吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. Go blame the police for your own mistakes.{\r}

1706
01:47:55,981 --> 01:47:58,142
我们已经见多不怪了，不是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've seen a lot of that lately, haven't we?{\r}

1707
01:47:58,217 --> 01:48:01,152
照顾好自己，亚瑟！ 路上小心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take care now, Arthur! Safe travels.{\r}

1708
01:48:02,321 --> 01:48:04,551
好了，伙计们 今天就到此结束了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, fellas, that's it for today.{\r}

1709
01:48:04,623 --> 01:48:06,352
先生，先生！那个孩子是什么意思？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir, sir! What did the boy mean by that?{\r}

1710
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:10,152
3月10号那天，我下班回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was March 10th, and I came home from work,{\r}

1711
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:13,096
发现我九岁的孩子沃特不见了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and my nine-year-old son, Walter, was gone.{\r}

1712
01:48:13,165 --> 01:48:16,896
琼斯上尉一直认定他知道的信息才是对的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Captain Jones was acting on information he believed to be correct.{\r}

1713
01:48:16,969 --> 01:48:20,598
沃特・柯林斯的牙齿间有裂缝 又叫做齿隙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter Collins had a diastema, also known as a diastema.{\r}

1714
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:22,197
那个孩子从来没有进过我的教室
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That child was never in my classroom.{\r}

1715
01:48:22,308 --> 01:48:23,832
我可以百分之百确定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can certainly attest to that.{\r}

1716
01:48:23,909 --> 01:48:27,276
我们希望警察局的好心人们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We rely on our good friends in the police department{\r}

1717
01:48:27,346 --> 01:48:30,406
能告诉我们，是谁做出了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to point to us those people who exhibit behavior{\r}

1718
01:48:30,483 --> 01:48:33,213
这种社会不容的决定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}which is socially unacceptable.{\r}

1719
01:48:33,285 --> 01:48:38,120
他比沃特上次量的身高矮了差不多4英寸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}About four inches shorter than the last mark of Walter.{\r}

1720
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:41,516
这些照片能够证明
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, some of these pictures show{\r}

1721
01:48:41,594 --> 01:48:44,256
桑佛德・克拉克之前告诉我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}what Sanford Clark told me,{\r}

1722
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,925
他的确参与杀害了这些孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that he did in fact help in the murder of these children.{\r}

1723
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,695
谢谢你，警探先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you, Detective.{\r}

1724
01:48:49,768 --> 01:48:50,996
陪审团的众位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen of the jury,{\r}

1725
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:53,834
我想请你们好好看下这些照片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I ask you to take a good look at these images.{\r}

1726
01:48:53,906 --> 01:48:56,466
它们能够说明这些十恶不赦的罪行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They establish beyond any reasonable doubt{\r}

1727
01:48:56,542 --> 01:49:00,308
的的确确发生在我们眼前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the circumstances and the nature of these heinous crimes.{\r}

1728
01:49:11,557 --> 01:49:13,422
我在这儿，牧师先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm in here, Reverend.{\r}

1729
01:49:21,534 --> 01:49:23,661
沃特还没失踪的时候 我经常在他睡觉的时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When Walter was here, I used to walk by his room{\r}

1730
01:49:23,736 --> 01:49:25,897
到他的房间来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}when he was sleeping.{\r}

1731
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:29,964
就算现在我再也看不到他，也听不到他的声音
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And even though I couldn't see him or hear him,{\r}

1732
01:49:30,042 --> 01:49:31,771
我还是能感觉到他的存在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I could feel him.{\r}

1733
01:49:34,013 --> 01:49:36,743
所以我觉得沃特还没有死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's why I don't think Walter's dead.{\r}

1734
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,880
我还能感觉到他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can still feel him.{\r}

1735
01:49:42,521 --> 01:49:44,489
柯林斯太太... 别说了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins... No.{\r}

1736
01:49:44,557 --> 01:49:46,752
我知道警察说了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know what the police said.{\r}

1737
01:49:47,259 --> 01:49:49,819
但是那个地方，还有那些尸体
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But that place and the remains,{\r}

1738
01:49:51,697 --> 01:49:54,222
他们没法进行鉴定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}they couldn't be properly identified.{\r}

1739
01:49:55,234 --> 01:49:59,568
也许那个孩子弄错了，他不小心选了沃特的照片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And maybe that kid made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture.{\r}

1740
01:50:00,439 --> 01:50:03,840
我知道你不愿意接受事实
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I understand you don't want to accept this.{\r}

1741
01:50:03,909 --> 01:50:05,570
没有哪个母亲能够承受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What mother would?{\r}

1742
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:12,373
但是我觉得你是时候放开心怀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I think it's time for you to move on{\r}

1743
01:50:12,484 --> 01:50:14,850
为了你自己活下去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and start over for yourself.{\r}

1744
01:50:16,088 --> 01:50:18,522
你的孩子也会希望你能好好活下去的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your son would want you to move on.{\r}

1745
01:50:20,693 --> 01:50:22,923
也许
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe.{\r}

1746
01:50:22,995 --> 01:50:26,294
也许他希望我能够继续去找他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe he'd want me to keep looking for him.{\r}

1747
01:50:26,365 --> 01:50:28,890
也许他还在什么地方等着我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe he's somewhere waiting for me.{\r}

1748
01:50:30,769 --> 01:50:32,999
女士，我相信他一直在等我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I believe he is waiting, ma'am.{\r}

1749
01:50:34,506 --> 01:50:36,303
他一定还在那个地方等着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's waiting in that place where{\r}

1750
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:40,402
总有一天我们会和心爱的人团聚在一起的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we'll all go someday to be reunited with our loved ones.{\r}

1751
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:45,576
到那一天，他会知道从头至尾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And on that day, he'll know from front to back, end to end,{\r}

1752
01:50:45,651 --> 01:50:49,178
你为他全心全意做过的所有事的 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}heart to soul, that you did everything you could, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

1753
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:51,921
所有的一切
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything.{\r}

1754
01:50:55,828 --> 01:50:57,523
我们得走了，女士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We should go, ma'am.{\r}

1755
01:50:57,596 --> 01:50:58,961
我等下就来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One minute.{\r}

1756
01:51:25,858 --> 01:51:28,349
现在宣布判决
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This meeting will now come to order.{\r}

1757
01:51:29,361 --> 01:51:32,387
委员会已经听过了双方的证词
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This committee has now heard all of the testimony,{\r}

1758
01:51:32,464 --> 01:51:35,433
综合双方所述的事实
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and, in light of the facts presented,{\r}

1759
01:51:35,534 --> 01:51:38,367
我们建议对琼斯上尉作出
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones{\r}

1760
01:51:38,437 --> 01:51:39,904
永久停职的处理
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}be made permanent.{\r}

1761
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:47,803
肃清！肃清！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Order! Please. Please.{\r}

1762
01:51:48,947 --> 01:51:50,938
佛曼先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Foreman,{\r}

1763
01:51:51,016 --> 01:51:53,507
陪审团是否做出了裁决？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}has the jury reached a verdict?{\r}

1764
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:55,348
是的，法官大人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have, Your Honor.{\r}

1765
01:51:56,622 --> 01:51:58,852
请被告起立
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Will the defendant please rise?{\r}

1766
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:05,260
此外，法庭将考虑对现有法律和执法程序
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Second, that steps be taken to investigate a change{\r}

1767
01:52:05,364 --> 01:52:08,458
做出相应修改
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in the prevailing laws and procedures by which a citizen{\r}

1768
01:52:08,534 --> 01:52:11,992
以避免出现城市公民因主观认定的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}of this city can be subjected to incarceration{\r}

1769
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:14,130
被关押进当地的精神病医疗机构
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}in the county's mental facilities.{\r}

1770
01:52:21,313 --> 01:52:23,304
请陪审团阅读判决
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You may read the verdict.{\r}

1771
01:52:24,016 --> 01:52:26,883
陪审团认为被告高顿・斯图尔特・诺斯考特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"We the jury find the defendant, Gordon Stewart Northcott,{\r}

1772
01:52:26,952 --> 01:52:29,512
有罪，一级谋杀罪名成立
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"guilty on all counts of murder in the first degree. "{\r}

1773
01:52:34,293 --> 01:52:38,559
最后，考虑到警察局在公众诚信方面的丧失
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Finally, restoration of public confidence in the police department{\r}

1774
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:40,757
经过委员会的同意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}can only be achieved{\r}

1775
01:52:40,866 --> 01:52:44,097
我们认为应免除
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}by the removal of its chief of police,{\r}

1776
01:52:44,203 --> 01:52:46,228
警察局长的所有职务
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and this committee so recommends.{\r}

1777
01:52:46,305 --> 01:52:47,533
本次庭审结束
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This hearing is concluded.{\r}

1778
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:12,660
在判决执行前，被告是否有什么要说的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed?{\r}

1779
01:53:13,799 --> 01:53:16,563
我必须说清楚一件事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to make it real clear{\r}

1780
01:53:16,635 --> 01:53:20,071
在这里，我从来没有获得过公平的待遇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that I never once got a fair shake from you,{\r}

1781
01:53:20,139 --> 01:53:21,902
包括法官大人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your Honor,{\r}

1782
01:53:22,841 --> 01:53:25,309
还有这法庭上的每一个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or from this court.{\r}

1783
01:53:29,715 --> 01:53:32,878
也只有她有这个该死的荣幸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The only one in here worth a good goddamn is her.{\r}

1784
01:53:35,287 --> 01:53:38,347
因为只有她没有在面对媒体的时候对我恶言相向
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}'Cause she's the only one who never badmouthed me to the press.{\r}

1785
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:39,856
她是唯一一个知道内情的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's the only one who understands{\r}

1786
01:53:39,925 --> 01:53:41,449
她知道警察在背地里的勾当
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}what it is to be framed by the police{\r}

1787
01:53:41,527 --> 01:53:43,825
捏造些你从没有做过的罪名 够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}for something you didn't do. All right, that's enough.{\r}

1788
01:53:43,896 --> 01:53:46,490
接下来我就等着被扔进洞里
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And then to just be thrown in the hole,{\r}

1789
01:53:46,565 --> 01:53:49,557
或者在某个角落里烂死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}to just rot and to fester and to be forgotten{\r}

1790
01:53:49,635 --> 01:53:51,364
从公众面前消失，然后被遗忘，我说的对吧？ 高顿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and fade away, isn't that right? Gordon!{\r}

1791
01:53:51,436 --> 01:53:52,562
律师！ 是不是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Counsel! Isn't it?{\r}

1792
01:53:52,638 --> 01:53:55,038
我没有杀你的孩子 柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I never killed your boy, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

1793
01:53:55,107 --> 01:53:56,870
律师，说够了！ 我决不会杀他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Counsel, that's enough! I would never do that.{\r}

1794
01:53:56,942 --> 01:53:58,000
我绝对没有伤害沃特的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I would never hurt Walter.{\r}

1795
01:53:58,076 --> 01:53:59,100
律师，请你管好你的客户
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Counsel, get control of your client{\r}

1796
01:53:59,178 --> 01:54:00,236
我一定会把他绑起来，塞好他的嘴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or I'll have him bound and gagged!{\r}

1797
01:54:00,312 --> 01:54:01,802
他是个天使
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's an angel.{\r}

1798
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,610
闭嘴，高顿 放开我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, Gordon. Get off of me!{\r}

1799
01:54:04,683 --> 01:54:06,173
现在坐下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now get down.{\r}

1800
01:54:08,921 --> 01:54:11,014
高顿・斯图尔特・诺斯考特,
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gordon Stewart Northcott,{\r}

1801
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:14,956
本庭作出宣判
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}it is the judgment of this court{\r}

1802
01:54:15,027 --> 01:54:17,325
你将被送入圣昆丁监狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that you be conveyed to San Quentin Prison,{\r}

1803
01:54:17,396 --> 01:54:20,695
在那里接受两年的单独监禁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}where you'll be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years,{\r}

1804
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:24,361
直至1930年10月2日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until October 2, 1930.{\r}

1805
01:54:25,437 --> 01:54:29,771
你将在那天接受绞刑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}On that date, you will be hanged by the neck until dead.{\r}

1806
01:54:32,644 --> 01:54:34,703
愿主宽恕你的灵魂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May God have mercy on your soul.{\r}

1807
01:55:41,787 --> 01:55:44,277
1930年9月30日
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1808
01:55:48,787 --> 01:55:50,277
我可以休息10分钟吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it all right if I have a 10-minute break?{\r}

1809
01:55:50,355 --> 01:55:51,652
当然可以
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course.{\r}

1810
01:55:54,226 --> 01:55:55,591
你知道吗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know,{\r}

1811
01:55:56,695 --> 01:55:58,629
你应该考虑要不要
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}one of these days you might actually consider taking{\r}

1812
01:55:58,697 --> 01:56:00,221
真的去休息上10分钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}one of these 10-minute breaks.{\r}

1813
01:56:00,299 --> 01:56:02,062
对你有好处的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It might be good for you.{\r}

1814
01:56:02,134 --> 01:56:03,465
到时候看吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll see.{\r}

1815
01:56:06,305 --> 01:56:08,330
我是克莉斯汀・柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is Christine Collins.{\r}

1816
01:56:08,407 --> 01:56:10,341
我昨天通过电话的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I called yesterday.{\r}

1817
01:56:10,409 --> 01:56:13,003
请问你可不可以再查一下文件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was wondering if you had a chance to look through the files{\r}

1818
01:56:13,078 --> 01:56:16,741
是不是有符合我儿子沃特・柯林斯特征的报告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and see if there was a match to my son, Walter Collins.{\r}

1819
01:56:17,749 --> 01:56:19,341
我知道了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see.{\r}

1820
01:56:19,418 --> 01:56:20,680
如果你方便的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, if it's all right with you,{\r}

1821
01:56:20,752 --> 01:56:23,516
我下个月会再打过来，非常感谢你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll call back in a month. Thank you very much.{\r}

1822
01:56:23,588 --> 01:56:25,783
柯林斯太太 我只想…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Collins. I was just...{\r}

1823
01:56:25,857 --> 01:56:27,256
是的，我明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I know.{\r}

1824
01:56:28,393 --> 01:56:31,260
事实上，这也是我想见你的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In fact, that's why I wanted to see you.{\r}

1825
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:33,161
是关于沃特 我们…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's about Walter. We had a...{\r}

1826
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:36,963
我们接到了一份非常奇怪的电报
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, we received a very strange telegram.{\r}

1827
01:56:37,869 --> 01:56:39,131
是谁发的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From who?{\r}

1828
01:56:39,204 --> 01:56:41,172
高顿・诺斯考特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gordon Northcott.{\r}

1829
01:56:41,239 --> 01:56:43,139
他想要见你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's asked to see you.{\r}

1830
01:56:43,675 --> 01:56:44,733
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why?{\r}

1831
01:56:45,811 --> 01:56:47,745
他说他知道你还在继续找你的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He said he knows you're still looking for your son,{\r}

1832
01:56:47,813 --> 01:56:49,713
在他死之前…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and before he dies...{\r}

1833
01:56:53,185 --> 01:56:56,586
他说作证的时候他撒谎了 说他没有杀沃特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He says he lied when he testified that he didn't kill Walter.{\r}

1834
01:56:56,655 --> 01:57:00,250
克莉斯汀，他终于还是承认他杀了你的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christine, he's willing to finally admit that he did it.{\r}

1835
01:57:01,093 --> 01:57:03,561
他说，如果你可以去监狱探望他一下的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He says if you come up to see him in person,{\r}

1836
01:57:03,628 --> 01:57:06,153
他会当面把真相告诉你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}then he'll tell you the truth, to your face{\r}

1837
01:57:06,231 --> 01:57:08,756
然后希望你能够安心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so that you can get on with your life{\r}

1838
01:57:09,868 --> 01:57:11,335
继续过自己的日子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and have some peace.{\r}

1839
01:57:12,104 --> 01:57:13,628
你知道的，他后天就要在圣昆丁监狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As you know, he's set to be executed{\r}

1840
01:57:13,705 --> 01:57:15,969
被绞死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the day after tomorrow at San Quentin,{\r}

1841
01:57:16,041 --> 01:57:19,204
所以你的时间不多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}so you don't have a lot of time.{\r}

1842
01:57:20,212 --> 01:57:23,978
我花了一整个早上来帮你准备所有的会面手续
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It took me most of the morning to make all the arrangements.{\r}

1843
01:57:24,282 --> 01:57:26,113
我发现你是这30年来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Turns out, you're the first woman in 30 years{\r}

1844
01:57:26,184 --> 01:57:29,119
被州里允许和连环杀手见面的唯一一个女性
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}the state has allowed to visit a serial killer{\r}

1845
01:57:29,187 --> 01:57:31,280
而且是在处刑前晚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}on the eve of his execution.{\r}

1846
01:57:51,977 --> 01:57:53,205
你一个人可以吗？太太？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll be all right, ma'am?{\r}

1847
01:57:53,278 --> 01:57:55,712
- 嗯 - 我们就在门口了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. We're right at the door.{\r}

1848
01:57:58,817 --> 01:58:00,216
会面时间是20分钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Twenty minutes.{\r}

1849
01:58:05,557 --> 01:58:07,923
你大概没有烟吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't suppose you got a cigarette?{\r}

1850
01:58:10,462 --> 01:58:13,363
诺斯考特先生，你让我过来探望你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.{\r}

1851
01:58:13,565 --> 01:58:15,260
你说，如果我过来看你的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You said that if I did,{\r}

1852
01:58:15,333 --> 01:58:18,029
你会把关于我儿子的事情都告诉我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}you would tell me the truth about my son.{\r}

1853
01:58:19,337 --> 01:58:20,736
对
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1854
01:58:22,274 --> 01:58:24,902
没错，我是那么说的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're right. I did say that.{\r}

1855
01:58:24,976 --> 01:58:28,503
但问题是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But see, the thing is,{\r}

1856
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:32,016
我没有想到你真的会来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't really think that you would come.{\r}

1857
01:58:32,084 --> 01:58:33,449
现在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now.{\r}

1858
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:36,746
现在… 现在怎么了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And now... And now what?{\r}

1859
01:58:36,955 --> 01:58:39,253
我实在没有想到你会…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just didn't expect that you'd...{\r}

1860
01:58:41,259 --> 01:58:43,227
我不想见到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't wanna see you.{\r}

1861
01:58:43,695 --> 01:58:45,754
你不想见我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't wanna see me?{\r}

1862
01:58:45,831 --> 01:58:48,299
不是，是，我说不了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. See, I can't do this.{\r}

1863
01:58:48,366 --> 01:58:50,357
我不想和你说话，我现在实在没法和你说话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't wanna talk to you. I can't talk to you right now,{\r}

1864
01:58:50,435 --> 01:58:52,426
不是因为明天他们会把我绞死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}not with what they're gonna be doing to me tomorrow.{\r}

1865
01:58:52,504 --> 01:58:55,837
那是另外一回事 柯林斯太太，给你发电报
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's one thing, Mrs. Collins, to send a telegram,{\r}

1866
01:58:55,907 --> 01:58:57,374
那很容易
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}that is really easy.{\r}

1867
01:58:57,442 --> 01:59:01,936
但等到你来了，现在看到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But when it's here, right now, in person, you know,{\r}

1868
01:59:02,013 --> 01:59:03,412
我就是，我不行…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just, I can't...{\r}

1869
01:59:03,482 --> 01:59:05,507
我现在说不出你想听的话，柯林斯太太
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't tell you what you want to hear, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

1870
01:59:05,584 --> 01:59:06,642
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And why not?{\r}

1871
01:59:06,718 --> 01:59:10,347
因为我不想带着满嘴谎言死去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because I don't want to go to hell with a lie on my lips.{\r}

1872
01:59:10,422 --> 01:59:12,515
你看，为了忏悔，我惩罚了自己
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See, I did my penance,{\r}

1873
01:59:12,591 --> 01:59:15,890
我请求上帝宽恕我，而且我知道他原谅我了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I asked God to forgive me and he did, so far as I know.{\r}

1874
01:59:15,961 --> 01:59:18,589
我之后一直表现的很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I have been really good ever since.{\r}

1875
01:59:18,663 --> 01:59:23,430
如果我现在说谎的话，如果现在我又犯戒的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But if I lie now, if I commit any sins right now,{\r}

1876
01:59:23,502 --> 01:59:25,402
我就没有多少时间剩下了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm out of time here,{\r}

1877
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,869
我绝对得不到第二次宽恕的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and I won't be forgiven again.{\r}

1878
01:59:26,938 --> 01:59:29,304
我要跟你说，我不要下地狱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I'll tell you one thing, I am not going to hell.{\r}

1879
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:33,610
我不想…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not...{\r}

1880
01:59:40,519 --> 01:59:43,283
诺斯考特先生，是你叫我过来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.{\r}

1881
01:59:53,598 --> 01:59:54,929
诺斯考特先生，请你看着我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, please look at me.{\r}

1882
01:59:56,835 --> 01:59:59,167
诺斯考特先生，请你看着我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Northcott, please look at me.{\r}

1883
02:00:06,077 --> 02:00:07,840
你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son?{\r}

1884
02:00:12,684 --> 02:00:14,447
你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son?{\r}

1885
02:00:15,287 --> 02:00:16,754
我不知道你在说什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what you're talking about.{\r}

1886
02:00:16,821 --> 02:00:18,482
是的，你明白，你明白的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Hmm.{\r}

1887
02:00:18,557 --> 02:00:19,717
你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son?{\r}

1888
02:00:21,626 --> 02:00:24,527
我说了，我现在不想跟你说话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I told you, I don't wanna talk to you right now.{\r}

1889
02:00:25,096 --> 02:00:29,190
你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son?{\r}

1890
02:00:29,267 --> 02:00:30,325
你有没有杀我的儿子？ 嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son? Hmm.{\r}

1891
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,767
你有没有杀我的儿子？ 我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son? I don't know.{\r}

1892
02:00:31,836 --> 02:00:33,030
你不知道？你不记得了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't know? You don't remember?{\r}

1893
02:00:33,104 --> 02:00:34,469
你有没有杀我的儿子？ 哦，不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son? Oh, no.{\r}

1894
02:00:34,539 --> 02:00:37,269
回答我！你回答我！你回答我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Answer me! You answer me! You answer me!{\r}

1895
02:00:37,342 --> 02:00:39,367
我都不知道他们的名字 你有没有杀我的儿子？有没有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know their names. Did you kill my son? Yes...{\r}

1896
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:40,672
你最好不要理我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You better get off of me.{\r}

1897
02:00:40,745 --> 02:00:42,110
不然呢？ 哼嗯嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or what? Hmm.{\r}

1898
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,579
你有没有杀我的儿子？ 我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son? I don't know.{\r}

1899
02:00:43,648 --> 02:00:44,842
你有没有…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill...{\r}

1900
02:00:44,916 --> 02:00:46,213
你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son?{\r}

1901
02:00:46,284 --> 02:00:47,546
你知道他的名字！ 我不知道，不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know his name! Oh, I don't. No.{\r}

1902
02:00:47,619 --> 02:00:49,348
你知道他的名字！ 你说他是个天使！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know his name! You called him an angel!{\r}

1903
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:51,446
没有 你知道他的名字！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. You know his name!{\r}

1904
02:00:51,523 --> 02:00:52,956
不，我不知道他的名字 你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I don't know his name. Did you kill my son?{\r}

1905
02:00:53,024 --> 02:00:54,992
他们喊着自己爸爸妈妈的名字，希望他们来救自己 然后我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They cried for their parents to come and get them and then I...{\r}

1906
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:57,187
你有没有杀我的儿子？ 你有没有杀我的儿子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you kill my son? Did you kill my son?{\r}

1907
02:00:57,262 --> 02:00:58,422
回答我！ 不然呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Answer me! Or what?{\r}

1908
02:00:58,496 --> 02:00:59,827
回答我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Answer me!{\r}

1909
02:00:59,898 --> 02:01:01,763

1930
02:03:08,259 --> 02:03:09,726

1966
02:06:34,098 --> 02:06:37,829
他们会排队准备入场参加电影典礼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're gonna pipe in the movie ceremonies into the restaurant.{\r}

1967
02:06:37,902 --> 02:06:40,029

1973
02:06:56,955 --> 02:06:58,820
我压了2美金在一夜风流上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I put $2 down on It Happened One Night{\r}

1974
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:00,357

1975
02:07:00,425 --> 02:07:02,052

1977
02:07:04,062 --> 02:07:06,121
不过，如果我们赢的话，你愿意在明天的晚餐上庆祝吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But, if it wins, do you wanna celebrate tomorrow night at dinner?{\r}

1978
02:07:07,665 --> 02:07:10,259

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a deal, Christine. See you.{\r}

1979
02:07:10,335 --> 02:07:12,963

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If your movie wins, I'll call you.{\r}

1980
02:07:13,037 --> 02:07:14,504

1989
02:07:42,166 --> 02:07:44,361

1994
02:07:55,546 --> 02:07:57,844

1995
02:07:57,915 --> 02:07:59,974

1996
02:08:00,051 --> 02:08:02,315
是什么事？ 警察刚刚给我打了电话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What is it? The police just called.{\r}

1997
02:08:02,387 --> 02:08:04,582

1998
02:08:06,391 --> 02:08:08,518

1999
02:08:08,593 --> 02:08:10,060
我们现在正要过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're leaving right now.{\r}

2000
02:08:10,128 --> 02:08:11,618
我马上就过去

2003
02:08:37,722 --> 02:08:40,850
但是他们说现在有很重要的事情要和他单独谈谈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}but they said it was important to talk to him alone first.{\r}

2004
02:08:40,925 --> 02:08:43,052
他们确认了？ 他们很确定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are they sure? They're sure.{\r}

2005
02:08:43,127 --> 02:08:46,290
不过更重要的是我很确定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But, more important, I'm sure.{\r}

2006
02:08:46,364 --> 02:08:47,456
是我的儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's my boy, all right.{\r}

2007
02:08:47,532 --> 02:08:49,363
是戴维
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's David.{\r}

2008
02:08:49,434 --> 02:08:51,561
克莉斯汀，他还活着
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's alive, Christine.{\r}

2009
02:08:51,636 --> 02:08:53,035
他们在希思佩里亚找到他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They found him up in Hesperia.{\r}

2010
02:08:53,104 --> 02:08:56,096
你从学校回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You were walking home from school,{\r}

2011
02:08:56,174 --> 02:08:58,369
然后他们说让你帮忙找一只狗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and they told you they needed help finding a dog.{\r}

2012
02:08:58,443 --> 02:08:59,705
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

2013
02:08:59,777 --> 02:09:02,837
那么，你上了卡车之后，发生了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, after you got in the truck, what happened next?{\r}

2014
02:09:02,914 --> 02:09:05,212
他们开车带我逛了好多时候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They drove me around for a long time,{\r}

2015
02:09:05,283 --> 02:09:06,841
最后我们在这个农场停了下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}then we ended up at this ranch.{\r}

2016
02:09:06,984 --> 02:09:10,385
过来 戴夫，过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Come on, Davy.{\r}

2017
02:09:10,455 --> 02:09:11,820
- 戴夫！过来 - 放开我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Davy! Come on. Get off me.{\r}

2018
02:09:11,889 --> 02:09:13,083
别打架！ 别吵
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't fight this much. Hey!{\r}

2019
02:09:13,157 --> 02:09:15,250
那里还有别的男孩吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Were there other boys there?{\r}

2020
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,428
是的，我记得还有5个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. Five, I think.{\r}

2021
02:09:19,997 --> 02:09:21,931
不过，那是很久之前了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was a long time ago, though.{\r}

2022
02:09:21,999 --> 02:09:24,297
嗨，孩子们 这是戴夫！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello, boys. This is Davy.{\r}

2023
02:09:24,368 --> 02:09:25,733
我知道你们会… 嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know you'll make him feel... Hey!{\r}

2024
02:09:26,904 --> 02:09:30,237
不，不，嘿！ 闭嘴！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No! Hey! Shut up!{\r}

2025
02:09:30,308 --> 02:09:32,208
你和他们说过话吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you speak to them?{\r}

2026
02:09:32,977 --> 02:09:35,571
说了？那你还记得他们的名字吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah? You remember any of their names?{\r}

2027
02:09:36,447 --> 02:09:38,415
嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

2028
02:09:38,483 --> 02:09:39,916
他们中有两个是兄弟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Two of them were brothers.{\r}

2029
02:09:39,984 --> 02:09:42,817
我想他们应该是姓文斯洛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think their last name was Winslow.{\r}

2030
02:09:44,122 --> 02:09:46,215
大的那个应该叫杰佛瑞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The oldest one was Jeffrey.{\r}

2031
02:09:50,194 --> 02:09:51,684
还有个叫沃特.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And Walter.{\r}

2032
02:09:54,098 --> 02:09:55,622
沃特？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter?{\r}

2033
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:59,301
你还记得沃特的姓吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. Do you remember Walter's last name?{\r}

2034
02:10:04,742 --> 02:10:06,004
柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Collins.{\r}

2035
02:10:07,678 --> 02:10:09,236
沃特・柯林斯.
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter Collins.{\r}

2036
02:10:10,281 --> 02:10:13,512
你只记得这些男孩的名字？还记得别的事吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me something if you only remember some of the boys' names,{\r}

2037
02:10:13,584 --> 02:10:16,246
你怎么会记得他的全名的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}how come you remember his full name?{\r}

2038
02:10:16,988 --> 02:10:19,115
因为发生的事情？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because of what happened.{\r}

2039
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:21,215
沃特和杰佛瑞在说话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Walter and Jeffrey were talking.{\r}

2040
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:23,226
- 拉起来 - 因为他们检查了周围
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pull it. They kept checking around{\r}

2041
02:10:23,294 --> 02:10:25,888
他们发现棚子旁边有块栅栏松了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}and they found a part of the coop where the wire was all messed up.{\r}

2042
02:10:25,963 --> 02:10:27,555
当心！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Be careful!{\r}

2043
02:10:27,632 --> 02:10:29,327
快点！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hurry!{\r}

2044
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,766
也许我们能够挖个足够大的洞，然后逃出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe make enough room to get out of there and run.{\r}

2045
02:10:31,836 --> 02:10:33,531
我们跑出来以后就分开走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When we get out, we split up,{\r}

2046
02:10:33,604 --> 02:10:35,367
朝不同的方向跑，明白了吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}go in different directions. Okay?{\r}

2047
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:37,532
他们没法抓住我们所有人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They can't catch all of us.{\r}

2048
02:10:37,608 --> 02:10:39,576
肯定弄出了很多声响
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It'd make an awful lot of noise.{\r}

2049
02:10:39,644 --> 02:10:42,374
轻点，明白吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Be quiet. You got it?{\r}

2050
02:10:42,446 --> 02:10:45,347
结果那个洞不够大，所以我们卡住了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if it wasn't wide enough, then we'd be stuck.{\r}

2051
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,916
等等，救命！帮帮我！ 快点，快点走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait. Help! Help! Come on, hurry!{\r}

2052
02:10:52,824 --> 02:10:56,123
我的脚卡住了，快点 救命，帮帮我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My foot's stuck! Hurry, help! Help me, please!{\r}

2053
02:10:58,696 --> 02:11:01,563
他过来了！ 他…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's coming! He's...{\r}

2054
02:11:01,632 --> 02:11:03,293
我的脚！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My foot!{\r}

2055
02:11:04,235 --> 02:11:05,759
他过来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's coming.{\r}

2056
02:11:05,837 --> 02:11:07,600
快点，快跑，跑！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hurry, run, run, run!{\r}

2057
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:15,201
嘿，你们这群小混蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! What the hell are you boys...{\r}

2058
02:11:17,081 --> 02:11:21,711
哦！圣母玛丽亚！嘿！嘿！嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh! Mary, Mother of God! Hey! Hey! Hey!{\r}

2059
02:11:22,453 --> 02:11:25,513
你们滚回来！ 嘿！站住！嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You get back here! Hey! Hold it! Hey!{\r}

2060
02:11:27,992 --> 02:11:29,084
嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey!{\r}

2061
02:11:30,261 --> 02:11:31,319
嘿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey!{\r}

2062
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:34,157
别跑！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop!{\r}

2063
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,865
去抓其他的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Check on the others!{\r}

2064
02:11:37,935 --> 02:11:39,334
站住！该死的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop! Damn it!{\r}

2065
02:11:39,403 --> 02:11:41,667
臭小子们，我跟着你们了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Boys, I'm coming after you!{\r}

2066
02:11:41,739 --> 02:11:44,833
该死！该死!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Damn it! Damn it!{\r}

2067
02:11:45,142 --> 02:11:48,077
小家伙们，不管你们跑到哪里，我都会找到你们的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Boys, I'll find you no matter where you are!{\r}

2068
02:11:48,145 --> 02:11:50,511
他们不在这里了 过来，上车！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're not in there! Come on! Get in the car!{\r}

2069
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:54,711
我会找到你们的！该死的！ 快点上车，他妈的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna find you! Damn it! Damn it! Come on.{\r}

2070
02:11:54,785 --> 02:11:57,185
妈的！上车！ 桑佛德！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shit! Get in the car, Sanford!{\r}

2071
02:12:04,662 --> 02:12:07,290
那是我最后一次看到他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That was the last I saw of any of them.{\r}

2072
02:12:07,865 --> 02:12:10,891
也就是说你也不知道另外两个人后来有没被抓住？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, you don't know if either of the other two were captured?{\r}

2073
02:12:10,968 --> 02:12:12,060
不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

2074
02:12:13,337 --> 02:12:15,237
我知道的是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All I know is,{\r}

2075
02:12:15,306 --> 02:12:18,173
如果没有沃特回来找我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}if Walter hadn't come back for me{\r}

2076
02:12:19,043 --> 02:12:21,773
我大概永远没有机会逃出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't think I ever would've gotten out of there.{\r}

2077
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:24,045
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay.{\r}

2078
02:12:25,316 --> 02:12:27,477
之后发生了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, what happened after that?{\r}

2079
02:12:27,551 --> 02:12:29,246
我朝着大路一直跑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I kept off the main roads,{\r}

2080
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:34,280
然后看到火车在岔道口听了下来 就跳了上去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}until I saw a train stopped at a crossing and I jumped in.{\r}

2081
02:12:34,692 --> 02:12:37,752
你为什么不告诉别人发生了什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why didn't you tell anyone what had happened?{\r}

2082
02:12:37,828 --> 02:12:39,295
我害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid.{\r}

2083
02:12:39,797 --> 02:12:42,766
我以为他们回来抓我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought they'd come after me, or my folks.{\r}

2084
02:12:44,568 --> 02:12:47,002
所以我谁都没有告诉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, I just didn't tell anybody.{\r}

2085
02:12:48,873 --> 02:12:53,071
我一直是一个人待着 后来有位蓝欣小姐给我免费的饭吃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was on my own until I got a free meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.{\r}

2086
02:12:53,144 --> 02:12:55,635
我告诉她说我是个孤儿，就一个人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Told her I was an orphan, on my own.{\r}

2087
02:12:57,615 --> 02:12:59,606
她说我可以留下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She said I could stay on.{\r}

2088
02:13:01,052 --> 02:13:02,383
于是我就待了下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I did.{\r}

2089
02:13:03,621 --> 02:13:04,986
每个晚上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Every night,{\r}

2090
02:13:05,056 --> 02:13:08,492
我都会惊醒，以为他们就在窗外等我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'd wake up thinking they were right outside my window.{\r}

2091
02:13:09,026 --> 02:13:11,494
然后我在广播里听警察说了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And then I heard the police talking on the radio{\r}

2092
02:13:11,562 --> 02:13:14,326
在农场里发生的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}about what happened at the ranch.{\r}

2093
02:13:14,432 --> 02:13:16,798
于是我想，现在我大概可以回家了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I thought, "For sure I can't go back now. "{\r}

2094
02:13:16,867 --> 02:13:18,334
为什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why?{\r}

2095
02:13:18,869 --> 02:13:19,927
为什么不回家？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why not?{\r}

2096
02:13:20,004 --> 02:13:22,802
因为我没有告诉任何人发生过什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Since I didn't tell anybody what happened.{\r}

2097
02:13:24,175 --> 02:13:26,939
我害怕他们会骂我 会为了那些孩子的死怪我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead.{\r}

2098
02:13:28,846 --> 02:13:30,711
所以我一直躲在外面不敢回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So I just stayed away.{\r}

2099
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:35,442
那这么多年之后，你为什么现在回来了呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What made you come forward now, after all this time?{\r}

2100
02:13:35,519 --> 02:13:38,079
嗯？为什么现在找警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hmm? Why come forward now?{\r}

2101
02:13:41,659 --> 02:13:43,422
我真的很想我妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I really miss my mom.{\r}

2102
02:13:45,830 --> 02:13:47,730
我真的很想我爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I really miss my dad.{\r}

2103
02:13:50,768 --> 02:13:52,736
我想回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just wanna go home.{\r}

2104
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:57,937
我只想回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just wanna go home.{\r}

2105
02:14:03,948 --> 02:14:05,711
你还好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you all right?{\r}

2106
02:14:06,384 --> 02:14:08,579
我爱你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I love you.{\r}

2107
02:14:41,085 --> 02:14:42,848
我还是不敢相信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I still can't believe it.{\r}

2108
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:46,822
案子已经结束5年了，大家都以为他死了 然后他又出现了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Five years, case closed, everyone thinks he's dead, and there he is.{\r}

2109
02:14:48,325 --> 02:14:51,089
如果没有沃特的话，他肯定回不来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wouldn't be, if it wasn't for Walter.{\r}

2110
02:14:52,763 --> 02:14:55,323
柯林斯太太，你的儿子很勇敢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your son did a brave thing, Mrs. Collins.{\r}

2111
02:14:55,399 --> 02:14:57,594
你应该为他骄傲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should be very proud of him.{\r}

2112
02:14:57,668 --> 02:14:58,999
我为他骄傲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am.{\r}

2113
02:15:01,338 --> 02:15:02,896
你觉得他还活着？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You still think he's out there?{\r}

2114
02:15:02,973 --> 02:15:04,201
为什么不？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why not?{\r}

2115
02:15:05,443 --> 02:15:07,411
警探先生，那天晚上有三个孩子逃了出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective.{\r}

2116
02:15:07,478 --> 02:15:09,002
如果一个人逃脱了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if one got out,{\r}

2117
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:12,174
那么其他两个人中至少会有一个能逃出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}then maybe either or both of the others did, too.{\r}

2118
02:15:12,249 --> 02:15:15,810
沃特可能也逃了出来，而且和这个孩子一样 他心里害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe Walter's out there, having the same fears that he did.{\r}

2119
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,785
不敢公开自己的身份，也不敢回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Afraid to come home and identify himself,{\r}

2120
02:15:17,855 --> 02:15:20,255
或者是害怕自己会再惹上麻烦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}or afraid he'll get into trouble.{\r}

2121
02:15:21,692 --> 02:15:23,785
不管是哪种情况
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But either way,{\r}

2122
02:15:23,861 --> 02:15:26,989
今天晚上的事给了我一些以前没有的东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}it gives me something I didn't have before tonight.{\r}

2123
02:15:27,098 --> 02:15:28,497
是什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's that?{\r}

2124
02:15:29,467 --> 02:15:30,661
希望
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hope.{\r}

2125
02:16:02,467 --> 02:16:07,661
