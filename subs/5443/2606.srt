1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,230
你以为我在玩性虐待吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,370
知道吗，小乖…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,900
我相信…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,410
即使现在你还是很清醒…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,640
知道我不是在和你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}... to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,870
玩性虐待的游戏
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...in my actions.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,410
此时…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}At this moment...

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,110
是我…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...this is me...

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,820
最痛苦的时刻
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,420
比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill.

11
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,790
这是你的骨肉…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's your ba...

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,770
我像是死了，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,500
不过我没死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,130
起码我可以说，我是千辛万苦
才捡回这条命的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,400
事实上比尔最后一枪
使我陷入昏迷状态－
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,810
一场长达四年的昏迷
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,990
我苏醒之后，就开始了
像电影广告词似的…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,540
"怒吼疯狂之复仇"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,650
我怒吼，我疯狂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,290
我也得到了血腥的满足
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,200
到目前为止，我已经宰了不少人了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,530
但是还剩一个没杀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but I've only one more.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,660
最后的一个
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The last one.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,270
就是现在我开车去找的这个人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,180
唯一剩下的人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The only one left.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,910
等我到了那里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,180
我将会…"杀死比尔"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,240
片名：(杀死比尔)第二卷

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,820
第六章

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
第六章：双松镇大屠杀

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,950
双松镇结婚教堂发生的案子…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The incident that happened at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,180
也就是这个故事的起因…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}that put this whole gory story into motion

33
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,880
已经成为一个传奇故事
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}has since become legend.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,650
"双松镇大屠杀"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Massacre at Two Pines. "

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,710
报纸上是这么称呼它的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's what the newspapers called it.

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,620
而当地电视台称之为…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The local TV news called it,

37
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,690
"德州艾帕索市婚礼教堂之惨案"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"The El Paso, Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre. "

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,460
怎么发生的，有谁在场…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How it happened, who was there,

39
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,470
死了多少人，是谁杀的…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}how many got killed and who killed them -

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,100
众说纷纭，莫衷一是
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}changes depending on who's telling the story.

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,610
事实上，惨案根本不是发生在婚礼上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}In actual fact, the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
而是婚礼之前的彩排上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It was a wedding rehearsal.

43
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,710
彩排到牧师对新郎说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, when we come to the part where I say,

44
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,020
"你现在可以吻新娘"
你现在可以吻新娘
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"You may kiss the bride," you may kiss the bride.

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,420
不过别把舌头伸进她嘴巴里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,720
你朋友们或许会觉得很有趣
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}This might be funny to your friends,

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,960
可是会让你父母难堪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but it would be embarrassing to your parents.

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,730
我们会控制自己的，牧师
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,900
你们想好要用哪支曲子了吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,740
"温柔地爱我"如何？
这首歌我会
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How 'bout "Love Me Tender"? I can play that.

51
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,800
- 好啊
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Sure. - Yeah.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,210
"温柔地爱我"，这曲子很好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,380
如弗斯…就是他
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,510
如弗斯…你当初是替谁伴奏来着？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rufus, who was that that you used to play for?

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,580
如弗斯・汤玛斯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,560
如弗斯・汤玛斯
如弗斯・汤玛斯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rufus Thomas. Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,960
我曾加入"哲欧"，"流浪着"
和"游走"乐团
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was a Drell. I was a Drifter. I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,630
也曾是"街头小子"
和"巴可"的一份子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was part of the Gang. I was a Barkay.

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,900
只要他们来德州
我就和他们一起演奏
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If they come through Texas, I done played with 'em.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,430
如弗斯…就是你啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,710
- 我还忘了什么吗？
- 我想想…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Have I forgotten anything? - Um...

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,280
嗯…哦…对了…
你忘了安排坐位了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh yes, you forgot, uh, the seating arrangements.

63
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,020
- 谢谢你，老妈
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Thank you, Mother. - Yes.

64
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,320
按照我们的惯例…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,490
我们有新娘这一边
还有新郎这一边
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}we have the bride's side, and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,790
不过新娘这边没人出席
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But since the bride ain't got nobody comin',

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,800
而新郎这边又有太多人要来…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and the groom's got far too many people comin'...

68
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,140
对呀，还有人大老远
从奥克拉荷马州来呢！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, yeah, they're comin' all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,080
对呀…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Right...

70
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,140
那么…我觉得可以…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, I don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,480
让新郎这边的人
也去坐到新娘那边
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...the groom's side sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,610
- 你说呢，老妈？
- 我不反对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Do you, Mother? - I don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,420
但是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But, uh...

74
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,720
亲爱的，如果你那边
也有人来就更好了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Honey, you know, it would be good if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,950
这表示…他们也祝福你？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,960
可是，我真的没有亲朋好友…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, I don't have anybody...

77
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,970
除了汤米和这些朋友
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,470
- 连家人都没有吗？
- 嗯…很快就会有了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You have no family? - Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

79
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,810
哈蒙尼太太，我们就是
这位天使需要的所有的人了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,570
我有点不舒服
肚里的小ㄚ头让我很难受
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm not feeling very well, and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,050
你们继续聊，我出去透口气儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So while y'all blather on, I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,250
好了…牧师…对不起…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,990
- 她要出去透透气儿
- 是的，以她现在的身体状况，…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- She's gonna go out and get some air. - Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,690
几分钟就好，她没事儿的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She just needs a few minutes to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
哦…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Right...

86
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,640
哈，小乖
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hello, Kiddo.

87
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,510
- 你是怎么找到我的？
- 这还用说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- How did you find me? - I'm the man.

88
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,330
你在这儿干嘛？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What are you doin' here?

89
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,920
我在干嘛？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What am I doin'?

90
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,360
哦…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well...

91
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,770
我刚才在吹箫
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

92
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,800
现在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}At this moment...

93
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,370
我这双老眼正看着
我所见过最迷人的新娘
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen.

94
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,810
- 你为什么会在这儿？
- 看你最后一眼
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Why are you here? - Last look.

95
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,220
- 你会好好的吗？
- 我这辈子从来没做过好人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Are you gonna be nice? - I've never been nice in my whole life.

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,530
不过我会尽量表现出…和善
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I'll do my best to be sweet.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
哦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hmm.

98
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,300
我总是告诉你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I always told you...

99
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,710
你和善的一面是你最好的一面
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...your sweet side is you best side.

100
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,270
我想这大概就是为什么
你是唯一见过我和善面的人吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it.

101
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,020
- 瞧…你已经大腹便便了
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- So you got a bun in the oven. - Hmm.

102
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,550
- 我怀孕了
- 哇
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- I'm knocked up. - Jeez, Louise.

103
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,230
你的那个小伙子还真不浪费时间啊
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That young man of yours sure doesn't believe in wasting time, does he?

104
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,860
你见过汤米没有？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Have you seen Tommy?

105
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,200
- 那个穿燕尾礼服的吗？
- 对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Big guy in the tux? - Yes.

106
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,400
那我见过了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then I saw him.

107
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,670
我挺喜欢他的发型
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I like his hair.

108
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,380
你答应过要好好的喔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You promised you'd be nice.

109
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,280
我说过会尽力而为
算不上是承诺吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, I said I'd do my best. That's hardly a promise.

110
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,350
不过你是对的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But you're right.

111
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,520
你未来的夫婿是干哪行的？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What does your young man do for a living?

112
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,260
他在艾帕索这儿
开了家二手唱片行
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He owns a used record store here in El Paso.

113
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,030
- 喔…是音乐爱好者，对吧？
- 他热爱音乐
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Ah. Music lover, eh? - He's fond of music.

114
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,370
我们也是啊？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Aren't we all?

115
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,810
那你最近干什么活儿维生呢？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And what are you doing for a J-O-B these days?

116
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,440
我在唱片行里打工
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I work in the record store.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,980
啊…原来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Aso.

118
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,120
突然间一切都清楚了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It all suddenly seems so clear.

119
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,970
- 你喜欢那份工作吗？
- 嗯，我非常喜欢，你这聪明鬼
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Do you like it? - Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

120
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,760
我可以成天听音乐…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I get to listen to music all day...

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,830
聊音乐. 真的酷得很
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...talk about music all day. It's really cool.

122
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,340
对我的小女儿来说
这是个合适的成长环境
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in.

123
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:37,750
你是拿那种刀头舐血
杀人掳掠的活儿来比吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}As opposed to jetting around the world, killing human beings, and being paid vast sums of money?

124
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,160
正是
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Precisely.

125
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,220
那么，老朋友…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, my old friend...

126
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,660
咱们各走各的路
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...to each his own.

127
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,290
不过，先把琐事放一边…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}However, all cockblockery aside...

128
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,830
我非常期待见见那小伙子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am looking forward to meeting your young man.

129
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,170
我其实很在意我的女人
到底嫁给了谁
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I happen to be, more or less, particular whom my gal marries.

130
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,480
- 你也要来参加婚礼吗？
- 除非能安排我坐在新娘这边
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You want to come to the wedding? - Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

131
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,650
你会发现我这边有点冷清的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

132
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,180
你身边一向很冷清
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your side always was a bit lonely.

133
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,290
但我不会坐其它地方
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

134
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,690
你知道…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know...

135
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,230
我昨晚有个美梦，梦到了你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I had the loveliest dream about you...

136
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,740
哦，汤米过来了！
记得叫我爱琳
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, here's Tommy! Call me Arlene.

137
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,100
- 你一定是汤米！
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You must be Tommy! - Uh-huh.

138
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,610
爱琳跟我说了很多关于你的事
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Arlene's told me so much about you.

139
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,470
- 宝贝，你没事吧？
- 哦，我很好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Honey, you OK? - Oh, I'm fine.

140
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,640
汤米，让我来介绍我父亲
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

141
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,450
哇，老天！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, my God!

142
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
哇，老天！ 真是太好了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, my God, this is great!

143
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,150
我真高兴认识你，先生
哦…不对…爸爸
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

144
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,520
我叫比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The name's Bill.

145
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,920
哦，真高兴能认识你，比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

146
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,190
- 爱琳跟我说你不能来.
- 给你个惊喜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Arlene told me you couldn't make it. - Surprise.

147
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,530
我老爸就是这样
总是出人意料
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's my pop for ya. Always full of surprises.

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,000
没错啦，说到"出人意料"…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, in the surprise department...

149
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,510
真是有其父必有其女
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

150
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,740
- 你什么时候到的？
- 刚到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- When did you get in? - Just now.

151
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,940
- 直接从澳大利亚来？
- 当然
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Did you come straight from Australia? - Of course.

152
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,810
爸，我告诉汤米，你在澳洲挖银矿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Daddy, I told Tommy that you were in Perth mining for silver, and...

153
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,940
没人找得到你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...no one could reach you.

154
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,280
很幸运的是，这次不一样啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

155
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,450
我说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So...

156
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,290
你们这是干嘛呢？
我只听过平装彩排
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's this all about? I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

157
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,590
但不曾听说盛装彩排
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but I don't believe I've ever heard of a wedding dress rehearsal before.

158
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,000
我们想说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}We thought,

159
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,270
婚纱礼服这么贵
只穿一次太可惜了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Why pay so much money for a dress you're only gonna wear once?"

160
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,330
特别是爱琳穿上它
是如此的美丽
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Especially when Arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it.

161
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,140
所以我们打算物尽其用
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So, I think we're gonna try to get all the mileage we can out of it.

162
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,940
不是说…新郎在婚礼前
看到新娘穿礼服是不好的预兆
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Isn't it supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her wedding dress before the ceremony?

163
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,320
我是想，活着就该经历些风浪吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, I guess I just believe in living dangerously.

164
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,290
我恰巧懂你的意思
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I know just what you mean.

165
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,560
孩子
有些人还有事呢
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Son. Some of us have places to be.

166
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,290
就是说嘛
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Sure do.

167
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,800
我们还得再排练一次
还是请你去坐…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Look, we got to go through this one more time. So, why don't you have a s...

168
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,860
哦，天哪，我是怎么啦？
你应该牵着新娘进场才对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, my God. What am I thinking? You should give her away!

169
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,670
汤米，爹地不太喜欢这样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Tommy, that's not exactly Daddy's cup of tea.

170
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,210
我想他还是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I think Father would be much more comfortable

171
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,270
- 和其他来宾坐一起会比较自在
- 哦. 真的吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- sitting with the rest of the guests. - Hmm. Really?

172
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,320
要求是过分了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's asking a lot.

173
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,620
哦，好吧，那就算了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh. OK. Well, forget it.

174
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,450
那今晚吃个饭庆祝一下如何？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate?

175
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,260
我请客才行
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Only on the condition that I pay for everything.

176
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,920
说定了. 我们得彩排了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Deal. We got to do this now.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,990
- 我能观礼吗？
- 当然，请坐吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Can I watch? - Absolutely. Have a seat.

178
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,040
- 新娘席在哪边？
- 就在这儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Which is the bride's side? - Right over here.

179
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,730
新郎的妈，开始吧！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mother, here we go!

180
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,470
现在，孩子，关于誓言的部分…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now son, about them vows...

181
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,220
比尔…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill...

182
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,850
- 我只想…
- 你不欠我什么
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- I just want... - You don't owe me a damn thing.

183
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,490
如果他就是你要的男人…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If he's the man you want...

184
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,630
那就去他身边吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...then go stand by him.

185
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,960
- 我漂亮吗？
- 哦，当然
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Do I look pretty? - Oh, yes.

186
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,100
谢谢
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Thank you.

187
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,170
搞什么鬼呀？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What the hell?

188
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,610
不要！ 比尔！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No! Bill!

189
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,780
你是说她杀了88个保镳
才杀到尾连面前？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You tellin' me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

190
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,090
不是刚好88人啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

191
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,930
他们只是自称"疯狂88人帮"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}They just called themselves "The Crazy 88"

192
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,160
- 为什么？
- 我怎知
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- How come? - I don't know.

193
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,400
也许他们觉得这名号很酷吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I guess they thought it sounded cool.

194
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,100
那他们是怎么死在她的半藏刀下？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Anyhow, they all fell under her Hanzo sword.

195
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,170
- 她有把半藏刀？
- 他铸了一把给她
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- She got a Hanzo sword? - He made one for her.

196
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,700
他不是发过毒誓不再铸刀了吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?

197
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,350
似乎他破了誓
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It would appear he has broken it.

198
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,250
日本鬼子不是很记仇的吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Them Japs sure know how to hold a grudge, don't they?

199
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,390
还是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Or maybe...

200
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,860
你会让人想起旧仇
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you just tend to bring that out in people.

201
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,630
恕我冒昧的问个蠢问题…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it,

202
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,370
你刀上的功夫还没落下吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but you haven't, by any chance, kept up with your... swordplay?

203
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,900
我，呃…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I, um...

204
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,510
几年前我就把刀当掉了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I pawned that years ago.

205
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,920
你把服部半藏的刀当了！？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

206
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,050
嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yep.

207
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,110
是无价之宝啊！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It was priceless.

208
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,130
在艾帕索算不上什么宝啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

209
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,190
我在艾帕索当了250块钱
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

210
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,530
我在上空舞厅当保镳，比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

211
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,640
如果她想动手，只要去那儿
随便找个茬，咱们就能打起来了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If she wants to fight with me, all she's got to do is come down to the club and start some shit, and we'll be in a fight.

212
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,190
我知道我们很久没聊聊了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I know we haven't spoken in some time,

213
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,060
最后一次聊天也闹的不愉快
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant,

214
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,560
但是你不能再生我的气了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but you've got to get over being mad at me,

215
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,830
得开始担心她了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and start becoming afraid of (bleep),

216
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,630
因为她要来找你，她来是要你的命
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you.

217
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,000
没有我的帮助，她一定成功
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.

218
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,920
我不会逃避我的罪过
也不会逃避我应得的报应
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew out of paying my comeuppance.

219
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,530
我们难道不能忘掉往事？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Can't we just... forget the past?

220
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,420
那个女人…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That woman...

221
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,700
是应该报仇
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...deserves her revenge.

222
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,630
同时…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And...

223
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,510
我们也的确该死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...we deserve to die.

224
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,410
但是，换句话说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But then again...

225
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,550
她也该死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...so does she.

226
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,650
所以我说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So I guess...

227
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,130
咱们走着瞧吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...we'll just see.

228
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,300
行吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Won't we?

又迟到了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Late again.

232
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,800
巴德，你没时间观念吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Budd, can't you tell time?

233
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,670
老兄，还没人上门呢
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}There ain't nobody in here, man.

234
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,080
- 是巴德？
- 对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Is that Budd? - Yeah.

235
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,140
叫他给我滚过来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Tell him to get his fucking ass back here!

236
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,080
好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}OK.

237
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,490
巴德，赖瑞有话跟你说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

238
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,880
吸一口，你就浑然忘我了，宝贝
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

239
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,630
你找我？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You looking for me?

240
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,180
我不知道你以前
在哪家洗车厂打工
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here

241
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,550
迟到20分钟还让你大摇大摆的进来
不过肯定不是我的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}that let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me

242
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,280
- 不过我真他妈的有间家洗车厂
- 要我回避吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- and I own a fuckin' car wash. - Do you want me to leave?

243
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,520
不，别走，我要你坐着等
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, I don't want you to leave. I want you to sit and wait.

244
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,790
瑞赖…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Larry...

245
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,800
外面没有客人，所以…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...there ain't nobody out there, so...

246
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,330
"外面没有客人，赖瑞."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"There's nobody out there, Larry."

247
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,670
你想说啥？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's your point?

248
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,330
- 这儿用不着你了？
- 我是说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- That you're not needed here? - My point is...

249
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,040
我是说…我是个保镳
而现在外面又没人闹事啊
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'm the bouncer, and there ain't nobody out there to bounce.

250
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,350
你是说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You saying that the reason...

251
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:13,820
你没干我付钱给你干的活儿
是因为没活可干？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...that you're not doing the job that I'm... paying you to do is that you don't have a job to do?

252
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,430
- 不是…
- 你是这个意思吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- No... - Is that what you're saying?

253
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,430
你到底想要我相信什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?

254
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,460
相信你像这里的屁眼一样
是个没用的废物吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That you're as useless as an asshole right here?

255
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,870
猜猜我怎么想，老兄？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, guess what, buddy?

256
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,140
他妈的，我还真的被你说服了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I think... you just fucking convinced me.

257
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,370
咱们看看日历吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Let's go to the calendar.

258
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,710

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's calendar time.

259

260
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,750

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- OK. You working tomorrow? - Yeah.

261
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,920

264
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,420

- 有
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Workin' Thursday? - Yeah.

265
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,800
我说没有
星期五
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I don't think so. Friday.

266
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,930
我说…这有你的名字
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I d... There's your name.

267
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,980
- 你说了算
- 这里以前有你的名字，懂吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- If you say so. - There used to be your name. OK?

268
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,880
- 星期六. 以前有你的名字
- 哦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Saturday. There used to be your name. - Oh.

269
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,970
呃，星期一…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Uh, Monday...

270
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,540
瞧. 这样如何？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Here. How about that?

271
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,380
现在的年轻人只认得钱
其他什么都不懂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing you kids seem to understand. OK?

272
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,080
你现在回家等我打电话给你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

273
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,520
等我打给你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Till I call you.

274
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,500
走之前去找洛姬
她有事情给你做
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Before you leave, talk to Rocket. She's got a job for you to do.

275
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,970
还有…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And...

276
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,770
那个帽子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...the hat.

277
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,740
那个蠢帽子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That fuckin' hat.

278
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,640
那蠢…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That fucking...

279
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,650
我跟你说过多少次
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How many times have I told you,

280
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,710
不准你在这里戴那个蠢帽子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}don't wear that fucking hat here? How many?

281
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,720
客人也有戴帽子呀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Customers wear hats.

282
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,450
我不是客人的老板
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

283
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,490
我是你的老板
所以我告诉你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm the boss of you. And I'm telling you...

284
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,500
我要你把那顶
又蠢又驴的帽子留在家里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...that I want you to keep that shit-kicker hat at home.

285
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,130
嗨，巴德，亲爱的
马桶又坏了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yeah. Budd, honey, uh, the toilet is at it again.

286
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,230
粪水流满地.
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}There's shitty water all over the floor.

287
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,110
知道了，洛姬
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}OK... Rocket.

288
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,780
- 我会打扫干净的
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- I'll clean it up. - Mm-hmm.

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...with a million dollars in folding cash...

335
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:18,190
我就给你这把
人所能造出最好的刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man.

336
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,100
你觉得如何呀？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, how do you like the sound of that?

337
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,000
听起来咱们像是成交了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Sounds like we got a deal.

338
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,940
- 一个条件
- 什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- One condition. - What?

339
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,600
让她受尽苦头
直到咽下最后一口气
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She must suffer to her last breath.

340
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,310
这么嘛…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well...

341
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,350
亲爱的艾儿…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That, Elle darlin'...

342
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,250
我几乎敢打包票
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I can pretty much damn well guarantee.

343
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,090
那么明早见啦…百万富翁
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then I'll see you in the mornin', millionaire.

344
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,460
好的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}All right.

345
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,390
醒醒咯，醒醒咯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Wakey, wakey.

346
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,820
早餐的蛋与腌肉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Eggs and bakey.

347
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,630
完工了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm done!

348
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,960
拉我出坑！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Get me outta this hole!

349
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,430
好的很
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Good.

350
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,430
哇，看看那双眼
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Whoa, look at those eyes.

351
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,940
这婊子一定气疯了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}This bitch is furious.

352
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,600
我说的没错吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What did I tell ya?

353
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,840
她是不是你
见过最性感的金发尤物？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

354
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,110
还是…她就是你
见过最性感的金发尤物？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Or... is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

355
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,850
我见过更棒的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I seen better.

356
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,960
你有遗言吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You got anything to say?

357
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,230
白人女子称之为"无言的抗议"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}White women call this "the silent treatment."

358
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,200
咱们得让她们相信
咱们可不喜欢这样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And we let 'em think we don't like it.

359
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,310
你抬脚，我抬头
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

360
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,350
小蠕虫，看到这个吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Wiggle worm, you see this?

361
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,460
看到了，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You see it, don't ya?

362
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,500
那是一罐催泪瓦斯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's a can of Mace.

363
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,940
今晚你马上就要入土了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're goin' underneath the ground tonight.

364
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,600
就这么简单
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And... that's all there is to it.

365
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,350
我想把你埋了…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I wanna bury ya.

366
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,780
我想把你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was gonna bury ya...

367
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,780
和这个一起埋了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...with this.

368
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,870
但是如果你不安份点儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But if you're gonna act like a horse's ass...

369
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:56,670
我就把他妈的一整罐
直喷到你眼珠子上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can right in your eyeballs!

370
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,180
会把你眼珠子都给烧出来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

371
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,740
然后你就瞎了…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then you're gonna be blind...

372
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,810
烧了你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and burnin'...

373
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,050
再活埋
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and buried alive.

374
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,730
你自己选，妹子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

375
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,680
算你聪明
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's a wise decision.

376
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,110
这一定会伤透了我老哥哥的心
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

377
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,690
第八章

378
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,040
第八章：白眉严教

379
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,850
从前…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Once upon a time...

380
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,760
在中国…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...in China...

381
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,690
据说大约在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...some believe around the year...

382
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,260
公元1003年
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...one double aught-three,

383
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:55,500
白莲教掌门白眉道长走在街上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

384
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:05,110
思索着只有白眉这种绝世高手
才会思索的问题
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...contemplating whatever it is that a man of Pai Mei's infinite powers would contemplate

385
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,150
换句话说就是
天晓得他在想什么
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}which is another way of saying, "Who knows?"

386
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,610
有个少林和尚迎面走来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}when a Shaolin monk appeared on the road,

387
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,460
向他迎面走来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}traveling in the opposite direction.

388
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,930
就在他们擦肩而过时…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}As the monk and the priest crossed paths...

389
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,130
白眉…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...Pai Mei...

390
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:32,770
白眉几乎是高深莫测的
向他友善的点了点头
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods.

391
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,870
这点头礼…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The nod...

392
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,440
却没得到回应
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...was not returned.

393
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,790
到底是和尚是有意羞辱白眉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

394
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,820
还是他没注意到对方的社交礼仪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?

395
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,830
和尚真正的意思无从得知
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The motives of the monk remain unknown.

396
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,990
唯一知道的是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What is known...

397
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,830
后果
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...were the consequences.

398
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,980
第二天早上白眉来到了少林寺
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The next morning, Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin temple...

399
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,320
要求掌门方丈…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and demanded of the temple's head abbot

400
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,700
自刎谢罪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}that he offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult.

401
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,540
起先方丈想和安抚他
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei.

402
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,510
却发现白眉…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Only to find Pai Mei was...

403
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,240
难消怒气
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...inconsolable.

404
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,990
接下来…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So began...

405
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:03,460
白莲教就血洗少林
全寺60僧众无一幸免
{\fnTahoma\fs11\b0}...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus.

406
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,340
然后…传说从此开始…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And... so began the legend...

407
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,810
白眉的五指穿心掌
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.

408
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,180
- 五指穿心掌到底是啥？
- 非常简单…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And what, pray tell, is the Five-Point-Palm

409
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,810
- Exploding-Heart Technique? - Quite simply,

410
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,950
武学中最致命的一招
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

411
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,950
他以五指击你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He hits you with his fingertips...

412
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,960
五指不等的内力击在你身上…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...at five different pressure points on your body...

413
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,060
然后让你自己逃走
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and then lets you walk away.

414
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,100
但是你在五步之内…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But once you've taken five steps...

415
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,200
穿心…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...your heart explodes inside your body...

416
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,370
倒地而死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and you fall to the floor, dead.

417
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,540
- 他把这招传给你了吗
- 没有
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Did he teach you that? - No.

418
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,850
他的五指穿心掌从不传人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.

419
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,990
说到这儿…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now...

420
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,390
我最喜欢你的一点就是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...one of the things I've always liked about you...

421
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,450
小乖…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...Kiddo...

422
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,890
你看起来比实际的年龄更聪明
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...is you appear wise beyond your years.

423
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:16,200
让我给你这聪明人一点忠告:
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So, allow me to impart a word to the wise:

424
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,900
无论如何…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Whatever...

425
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,940
不管白眉说什么，你都得服从
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

426
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:28,480
即使你短暂地露出些许不敬的眼神
他立刻把你眼珠子挖出来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you flash him, even for an instant, a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

427
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,780
如果你的美式骄傲触怒了他…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And if you throw any American sass his way...

428
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,060
他会把你脊椎
和脖子像小树枝一般地劈断
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...he'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs.

429
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,300
那你就成为一个故事了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And that will be the story of you.

430
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,150
他答应收你为徒了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He'll accept you as his student.

431
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,320
- 你怎么啦？
- 没事儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- What happened to you? - Nothin'.

432
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,560
- 和他动手了？
- 朋友间过个招罢了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Get in a fight? - Friendly contest.

433
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,060
他怎么会答应收我的？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Why did he accept me?

434
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,400
因为他已经很老很老了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because he's a very, very, very old man.

435
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,700
和其他老不死的王八蛋一样…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And like all rotten bastards...

436
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,940
他愈老就愈寂寞.
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...when they become old, they get lonely.

437
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,980
年纪改不了他的脾气
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Which has no effect on their dispositions,

438
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,780
但也让他学到了，有个伴儿的重要
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but it does teach them the value of company.

439
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,340
哇赛
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Whew. Oh.

440
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,320
光是瞧这些台阶，我腿就软了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Just seein' those steps again makes me ache.

441
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,230
以后你挑着水桶上上下下的
可有你乐的啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.

442
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,800
我何时能再见到你？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When will I see you again?

443
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,360
就像我最喜欢的70年代
一首黑人灵歌的歌名
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies.

444
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,240
- 啥？
- 没什么
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- What? - Nothin'.

445
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,780
等他说你可以出师时
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When he tells me you're done.

446
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,540
你想会是何时？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When do you think that might be?

447
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,550
亲爱的，那全看你自己了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That, my dearest, depends entirely on you.

448
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,250
记住，切勿讥讽，切勿顶撞
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now remember, no sarcasm, no backtalk.

449
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,620
起码头一两年里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}At least not for the first year or so.

450
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,890
你得给他时间来
慢慢让你进入状况
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're gonna have to let him warm up to you.

451
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,800
他讨厌白人，藐视美国人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He hates Caucasians, despises Americans,

452
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,660
更不喜欢女人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and has nothing but contempt for women.

453
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,440
所以像你这种情行
得多花点儿时间了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So in your case... it might take a little while.

454
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,140
再见啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Adios.

455
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,570
师父…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Master...

456
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,110
你的汉语好差
我一个字也听不懂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your Mandarin is lousy.

457
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,110
我一个字也听不懂
而且好刺耳！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It causes my ears discomfort. You bray like an ass!

458
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,050
我没要你说话，你就别说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You are not to speak unless spoken to.

459
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,550
你的汉语好呢
还是你的广东话好？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Is it too much to hope -- you understand Cantonese?

460
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,700
我的日语很好…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I speak Japanese very well--

461
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,060
我没问你日本话
也没问你蒙古话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I didn't ask if you speak Japanese --

462
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,300
我问你会不会说广东话？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I asked if you understand Cantonese?

463
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,830
一点点
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}A little.

464
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,100
你是来学武的，不是学讲话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

465
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,610
如果你不懂汉语
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you can't understand me --

466
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,170
就像狗一样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I will communicate with you like I would a dog.

467
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,970
我会斥喝你，命令你，用棍打你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When I yell, when I point, when I beat you with my stick!

468
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,920
你的师父是不是比尔？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill is your master, is he not?

469
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,320
是的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes, he is.

470
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,470
你师傅说过你曾经学过武术
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your master tells me -- you're not entirely unschooled.

471
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,770
你学过些什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What training do you possess?

472
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,270
我精通虎鹤拳
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

473
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,340
更精通日本武士道剑术
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and I am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

474
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,210
哼～日本剑道
开什么玩笑！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The exquisite art of the Samurai sword. Don't make me laugh!

475
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,350
你所谓的剑道不值个屁
你就更加笨
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your so-called exquisite art, is only fit for --

476
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,280
你居然敢正视我
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Japanese fat heads!

477
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,560
看你的脾气都可以学武
你觉得本道的功夫跟你比如何？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your anger amuses me. Do you believe you are my match?

478
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,690
不知
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No.

479
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,500
你知道本道会杀人吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Are you aware I kill at will?

480
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,230
知道
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

481
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,140
那么你是想死？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Is it your wish to die?

482
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,910
不
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No.

483
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,850
傻瓜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then you must be stupid...

484
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,450
真是傻瓜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then you must be stupid...so stupid.

485
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,250
本道好想看看你有多傻
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face.

486
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,910
起身
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Rise.

487
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,860
亏你还学过虎鹤拳
刚才走了一百来台阶就在喘了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So my pathetic friend... Is there anything that you can do well?

488
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,870
我看你不单是傻
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's the matter?

489
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,230
身体也很虚啊
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Cat got your tongue?

490
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,670
喔，对了，你会说日本话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

491
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,740
我最恨日本人！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I despise the Goddamn Japs!

492
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,510
去兵器架那边
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Go to that rack.

493
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,790
拔那把剑
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Remove the sword.

494
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,910
我要看下你的武功有多深
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Let's see how good you really are.

495
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,410
出招.
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If...

496
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,780
如果我输给你的话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you land a single blow,

497
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,250
我干脆拜你为师
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll bow down and call you master.

498
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,910
你看到我的功夫了吧
试我的脚法
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}From here you can get an excellent view of my foot.

499
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,480
你的剑术…只是一般入门的水平
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your swordsmanship -- is amateur at best.

500
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,770
残废也比你强
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your so-called kung-fu -- is really -- quite pathetic.

501
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,970
再来啊！

502
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,970
废物

503
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,610
我已经给你机会显示一下你的武功
我看到了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I asked you to demonstrate -- what you know -- and you did...

504
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,510
你一点都不会
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not a goddamn thing!

505
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,210
现在我要你以虎鹤拳
和我的鹰爪拳比试一下
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Let's see your Tiger Crane -- match my Eagle's Claw.

506
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,340
你和其他美国女人一样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Like all Yankee women...

507
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,900
只知道在餐馆点菜，花男人的钱
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money.

508
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,680
痛吗？ 我问你呢？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Excruciating -- isn't it?

509
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,010
痛！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes!

510
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,920
你相不相信我…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If it was my wish...

511
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,750
随时能砍下你的手臂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I could chop your arm off.

512
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,080
不要！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, please don't!

513
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,860
你相不相信我想怎样就怎样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

514
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,720
如果你不想我砍你的手…动手！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you can stop me -- I suggest you try.

515
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,950
我不行
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I can't.

516
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,360
打不过吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because you're helpless?

517
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,130
对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

518
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:44,870
你以前试过这种滋味吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Have you ever felt this before?

519
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,070
没有
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No.

520
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,740
你的功夫和我比，简直是班门弄斧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Compared to me -- you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle?

521
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,940
是的！！！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}YES!!!

522
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,880
现在开始
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG!

523
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,290
你想不想学
我刚才和你打的这套拳？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Is it your wish to possess this kind of power?

524
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,590
想！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes!

525
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,990
从明天开始你要练武
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your training will begin -- tomorrow.

526
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,930
记住

527
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,080
你的手臂属于我…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Since your arm now belongs to me...

528
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,980
我会将它练得结实
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I want it strong.

529
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,250
你能不能做到像我这样？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Can you do that?

530
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,610
可以，不过还差你一节
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I can, but not that close.

531
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,090
那就是不行了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then you can't do it.

532
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,090
如果敌人离你的身体只有三寸…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What if your enemy -- is three inches in front of you...

533
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,420
你怎么对付他？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...What do you do then...

534
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,660
抱头鼠窜…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...Curl into a ball...

535
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,600
还是用拳打穿他？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...or do you put your FlST through him?

536
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:46,930
现在开始
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now begin.

537
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,690
练拳头不应该是你怕木头
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's the wood that should fear your hand --

538
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,240
应该是木头怕你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-- not the other way around.

539
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,310
你之所以打不穿木头
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No wonder you can't do it -- you acquiesce to defeat --

540
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,810
是因为你用手之前已经认输了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-- before you even begin.

541
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,520
如果你像狗一样吃东西
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you want to eat like a dog...

542
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,780
我就让你像狗一样住外面
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You can live and sleep outside like a dog.

543
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,200
如果你想像人一样的话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you want to live and sleep like a human...

544
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,290
把筷子拿起来
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...pick up those sticks.

545
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,840
快，你混蛋
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Come on, you bitch.

546
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,450
好，白眉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}OK, Pai Mei.

547
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,990
我来了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Here I come.

548
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:06,760
请给我一杯水？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}May I have a glass of water, please?

549
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:10,110
第九章

550
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,760
第九章：艾儿和我

551
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:47,390
- 原来那就是德州式葬礼？
- 对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-Sothat's a Texas funeral? - Yep.

552
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,290
我不得不承认你还真行，巴德
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I have to give it to ya, Budd.

553
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,450
这种死法还真凄惨
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

554
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,960
她墓碑上是什么名字？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's the name on the grave she's buried under?

555
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,630
宝…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Paula...

556
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,230
休兹
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...Schultz.

557
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,970
能看看那把刀吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Can I look at the sword?

558
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,600
我的钱就在那红箱子里，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's my money right there in that red bag, isn't it?

559
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,380
没错
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It sure is.

560
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,850
那好，刀是你的啦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well then, it's your sword now.

561
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:38,070
那么，这就是那把半藏的刀咯！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}(blender whirring)

562
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,070
你刚说啥？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's that you said?

563
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,540
这就是服部半藏铸的刀？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword?

564
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,940
没错，就是半藏的刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

565
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,780
比尔告诉我
你曾经也有一把他的刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill tells me you once had one of these of your own.

566
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,340
对，曾经
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yeah, once.

567
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,180
真的？ 这把和那把比如何？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yeah? How does this one compare to that?

568
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,820
如果你要拿半藏的刀去比…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword...

569
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:12,230
那么其他所有的刀…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you compare it to every other sword ever made -

570
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:17,210
都不是服部半藏铸的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

571
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,990
给…大口喝吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Here you go. Wrap your lips around that.

572
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,120
我说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So...

573
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,690
你是什么感受？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...which "R" are you filled with?

574
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,460
什么意思？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What?

575
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,070
有人说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}They say...

576
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:57,850
老人的头号杀手就是退休
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...the number one killer... of old people... is retirement.

577
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,910
如果他们还有未竟的事
就得活得久一点去完成
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}People got a job to do, they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it.

578
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,860
我一直认为…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I've always figured that...

579
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,990
战士和敌人…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...warriors and their enemies...

580
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,800
有着同样的关系
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...share the same relationship.

581
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,360
现在战场上你没有敌人可杀了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So now that you're not gonna have to face your enemy no more on the battlefield...

582
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,470
所以你是什么感受？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...which "R" ya filled with?

583
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,270
轻松…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Relief...

584
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,650
还是婉惜？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...or regret?

585
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,720
- 都有点
- 放屁
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- A little bit of both. - Horseshit.

586
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,830
我相信你两种感受都有
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

587
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,360
但我肯定其中一种比另以种多
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I know damn well that you feel one more than you feel the other.

588
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:52,560
问题是…哪个多点？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And the question was: Which one is it?

589
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:55,940
婉惜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Regret.

590
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,140
你知道她早晚她会取代你的地位
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

591
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:05,080
我从没看过有谁
能像她那样使比尔着迷
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I never saw anybody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.

592
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,240
比尔认为她很聪明
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill thought she was so damn smart.

593
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,690
我试图告诉他…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And I tried to tell him...

594
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,950
她只能算金发美女中比较聪明的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...she was just smart for a blond.

595
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,940
多谢
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Thanks a bunch.

596
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,490
哦…对不起.巴德
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm sorry, Budd.

597
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,190
我太失礼了，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That was rude of me, wasn't it?

598
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,790
巴德，我给你介绍
这是我的朋友…黑曼巴蛇
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend, the black mamba.

599
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,860
这是黑曼巴；这是巴德
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Black mamba, this is Budd.

600
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,410
我选中这小东西之前
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, before I picked that little fella up,

601
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,740
在网上查过它的资料
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I looked him up on the lnternet.

602
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:39,010
黑曼巴真是个神奇的动物
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

603
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,440
听好咯:
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Listen to this:

604
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,050
"在非洲，是这么说的…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"ln Africa, the saying goes,

605
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,320

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"'ln the bush, an elephant can kill you, a leopard can kill you,

606

"黑曼巴蛇也能要你的命
但是只有黑曼巴…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"'and a black mamba can kill you. But only with the mamba,

607
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,930
"自开天辟地以来
能确定让人致命
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

608
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,730
因此它被认为是死神的化身."
很酷吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hence its handle, 'Death lncarnate."' Pretty cool, huh?

609
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,010
"它的神经性毒液是自然界中
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"lts neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons,

610
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,410

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}. "acting on the nervous system, causing paralysis.

611
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,010
"它毒液能使人在4小时内死亡
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"The venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours

612
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,820
"不过那是咬到脚踝或是拇指
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

613

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"However, a bite to the face or torso

614
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,020
20分钟内就会从全身麻痹到死亡."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes."

615
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,330
现在听好咯，因为和你有关
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, you should listen to this, 'cause this concerns you.

616
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:38,000
"它咬一口所能释放出的毒液
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite

617
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,270

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}can be gargantuan."

618
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,900
我一直都挺喜欢这个词，"巨量"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, I've always liked that word, "gargantuan."

619
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,570
平时说话很少有机会用得到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.

620
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,250
"如果不即时用血清治疗
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"lf not treated quickly with antivenom,

621
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,150

624
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,830
现在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now...

625
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,430
在你生命最后
几分钟的挣扎里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left,

626
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,440
让我好好回答
你刚才提出的问题
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Iet me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly.

627
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,870
此时此刻…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Right at this moment...

628
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:24,580
我感受最深的是婉惜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

629
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:32,150
婉惜我所遇到
(或许是)最伟大的战士
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met

630
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:42,300
怎么会死在像你
这样卑鄙无耻小人的手上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin', scrub, alkie, piece of shit like you.

631
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,530
那女人应该死的更壮烈才对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That woman deserved better.

632
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,740
比尔…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill...

633
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,410
我有个不幸的消息
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I have some tragic news.

634
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,490
你弟弟死了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Your brother's dead.

635
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,360
真遗憾，宝贝
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am so sorry, baby.

636
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,930
她在他住的活动屋里放了条黑曼巴
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She put a black mamba in his camper.

637
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,870
我把事情解决了，她也死了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

638
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,870
这么说吧:
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Let me put it this way:

639
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:57,270
如果你觉得很伤心，就去加州巴斯多
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You ever start feeling sentimental, go to Barstow, California.

640
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:01,250
到了以后，去花店买一大束花
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers.

641
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:04,210
然后带着花去杭廷顿公墓
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Then you take those flowers to Huntington Cemetery

642
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,650
再富乐和瓜达路培街交口
找一块叫做宝・休兹的墓碑
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

643
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,710
再把花放在墓上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and lay them on the grave.

644
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:16,730
那儿就是你的小乖
(碧翠丝・基多)安息的地方
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}'Cause you will be standing at the final resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

645
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,290
- 玛缇・克超瑟？
- 在
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Marty Kitrosser? - Here.

646
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,200

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Beatrix Kiddo? - Here.

648
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,170
我可以四小时之内到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Look... I can be there in about four hours.

649
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,730
你要我过去吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Do you want me to come over?

650
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:33,110
不…不…
如果你要，宝贝，我立马过去
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, no, no, no. You need me, baby, I'm there.

651
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,750
好，我现在就出发
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}OK. I'm leaving now.

652
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,980
你先抽口大麻烟或什么的
我马上就到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You go smoke some pot or somethin', I'll be there soon.

653
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,820
恶心
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Gross.

654
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:14,770
"献给我的弟弟，巴德
我唯一爱的人，比尔."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"T o my brother, Budd. The only man I ever loved. Bill."

655
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,680
那是什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What's that?

656
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,660
巴德的半藏刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Budd's Hanzo sword.

657
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,220
他说他拿去当了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He said he pawned it.

658
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,920
那么他就是个骗子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Guess that makes him a liar now, don't it?

659
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,260
- 艾儿？
- 碧(翠丝)
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Elle? - Bea.

660
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,300
有件事情我一直很好奇
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Somethin' I've always been curious about.

661
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,040
算是咱们女孩间的秘密吧…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Just between us girls...

662
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:57,520
你对白眉说了什么
他居然戳瞎了你一只眼睛？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...what did you say to Pai Mei to make him snatch out your eye?

663
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,520
我骂他可怜的老不死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I called him a miserable old fool.

664
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:08,690
噢～馊主意
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Ooh. Bad idea.

665
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,520
猜猜我干了啥？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Know what I did?

666
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,790
我宰了那可怜的老不死
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I killed that miserable old fool.

667
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,670
鱼头味道如何呀，可怜的老不死？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How do you like the fish head, you miserable old fool?

668
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,140
我在鱼头里下了毒
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I poisoned his fish heads.

669
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,670
艾儿，你这条没人性的狗
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Elle, you treacherous dog.

670
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,580
我一定会…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I - give - you - my - word --

671

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}is worth less than nothing."

674
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,170
没错
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's right.

675
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,200
我宰了你师父
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I killed your master.

676
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,900
我现在还要杀你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

677
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,640
就用你自己的刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}With your own sword, no less.

678
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:04,010
再过一会儿，就成了我的刀了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Which, in the very immediate future, will become my sword.

679
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,210
婊子…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bitch...

680
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,880
你马上就玩完了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you don't have a future.

681
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,470
操你这婊子！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fucking bitch!

682
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,870
臭婊子！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fucking bitch!

683
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,750
我宰了你！
你他妈的死定了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll kill you! You're fuckin' dead!

684
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,290
你这婊子！ 你这婊子！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You bitch! You bitch!

685
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,090
我要宰了你，婊子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

686
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,010
我逮得到你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, I'll get you!

687
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,010
我要…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm gonna...

688
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,100
你在哪儿？
让我操你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Where are you? Lemme fuckin' at you!

689
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:49,020
你在哪儿？
我来了，你这臭婊子！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Where are you? I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

690
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:51,950
你死定了！ 死定了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're fucking dead! You're dead!

691
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,420
终章

692
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:20,420
终章：对决

693
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,950
就像很多从没见过
自己父亲的人一样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Like most men who never knew their father,

694
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:29,780
比尔喜欢有长者风范的人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill collected father figures.

695
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,850
第一个是 艾斯特邦・维黑欧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The first was Esteban Vihaio.

696
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,990
艾斯特邦是个淫媒
也是他母亲的朋友
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Esteban was a pimp and a friend of Bill's mother.

697
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:41,160
他在墨西哥的阿库那
经营一家妓院超过50年了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico for over 50 years.

698
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,570
他的保镳团叫"阿库那小子"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}His army, the Acuna Boys,

699
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,000
是那些妓女生的没爹的孩子
他们负责娼寮的生意
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores, ran Acuna.

700
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,070
而他是他们的头儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He ran the Acuna Boys.

701
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:57,250
他现在80岁了，就是这个
正在享受安逸的退休生活的人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, at the age of 80, it would be this retired gentleman of leisure

702
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,340
可以告诉我比尔在哪里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}who could point me in Bill's direction.

703
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:04,720
是艾斯特邦・维黑欧先生吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Senor Esteban Vihaio?

704
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,620
正是
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

705
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,660
我能叨扰一下吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}May I join you?

706
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,930
如果你不连名带姓叫我
只叫我艾斯特邦，那就可以
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Only on the condition that you call me Esteban.

707
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,160
- 艾斯特邦，我能叨扰一下吗？
- 请
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- May I join you, Esteban? - Please.

708
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,400
美国人？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Americana?

709
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,170
是的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

710
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,910
如果你喜欢
我也会说一点西班牙语
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

711
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:33,540
不…不…，我喜欢说英语
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, no, no, no. I prefer English.

712
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,140
我很久没说英语了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I haven't spoken it in a while,

713
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:42,530
尤其不能错过，能和像你这么漂亮
的小姐说话的机会
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but I would relish the opportunity to converse with such a pretty companion as yourself.

714
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:47,000
能和像你这样的绅士做伴
才是我的荣幸
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It's my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

715
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:50,000
我得提醒你，美丽的小姐…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I must warn you, young lady...

716
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:53,040
我是很容易被赞美冲昏头的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I am susceptible to flattery.

717
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,130
我能帮你什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How may I be of service to you?

718
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,250
比尔在哪儿？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Where's Bill?

719
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,250
啊…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Ahh.

720
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,350
那你一定是碧翠丝了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You must be Beatrix.

721
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,590
难怪他喜欢你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I can see the attraction.

722
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:27,600
我认识比尔时他才五岁
我带他去看电影
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I remember when Bill was only five years old, I took him to the movies.

723
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:31,370
是拉娜・图纳和约翰・嘉菲尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

724
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:36,510
主演的"邮差总按两次铃"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The Postman Always Ring Twice, with John Garfields.

725
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:39,850
每当她出现在银幕上时
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And whenever she would appear on the screen,

726
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,550
比尔就会情不自禁的吸允拇指
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

727
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:51,190
从那一刻起我就知道
这孩子会傻呼呼的迷恋金发美女
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And I knew from this very moment, this boy was a fool for blonds.

728
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,530
你知道…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know...

729
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:04,470
能像傻子一样
迷恋你这种金发美女…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...being a fool for a woman such as yourself...

730
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,940
也不是件坏事儿
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...is always the right thing to do.

731
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:14,940
如果我在退休前结识你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If we had met when I was back in business...

732
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:19,580
你一定会成为我的头牌
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you would have been my number one lady.

733
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:25,660
- 过奖了
- 你一定会
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Well, I'm flattered. - You goddamn well better be.

734
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:32,560
这是？… 我听说你开的是小卡车
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}This... I heard you were driving a truck.

735
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,570
我的滦』醭祷盗
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}My Pussy Wagon died on me.

736
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,600
那滤懒耍
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The Pussy died. Hmm.

737
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:44,210
比尔朝你头上开了一枪？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill shot you in the head, no?

738
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,880
是
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Yes. - Hmm.

739
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:51,250
如果是我，可不会那么狠
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I would have been much nicer.

740
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,620
了不起让你破个相
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I would have just cut your face.

741
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,320
对不起
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You must forgive me.

742
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,890
请…和我喝一杯吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Please... you have a drink with me.

743
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,500
克！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Clara! (smooches)

744
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,770
来了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Coming.

745
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:16,340
(西语)
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Dos anejo.

746
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,350
谢谢
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Gracias.

747
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,690
刚说到哪儿了？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What were we talking about?

748
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,030
比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill.

749
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:52,770
- 比尔在哪里？
- 比尔在哪里
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Where's Bill? - Where's Bill.

750
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,340
哦，嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yeah. Hmm.

751
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:00,950
比尔在四季别墅
去萨尼那的路上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill is at the Villa Quatro, on the road to Salina.

752
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,320
我画个地图给你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I will draw you a map.

753
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,200
比尔就像我的儿子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bill is like a son to me.

754
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:12,830
- 你知道我为什么帮助你吗？
- 不知道
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Do you know why I help you? - No.

755
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,840
因为这是他的意思
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because he would want me to.

756
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,740
这我可不相信
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, that I don't believe.

757
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:25,840
不然他如何能再见到你？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How else is he ever going to see you again?

758
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,450
不许动，妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Freeze, Mommy.

759
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,510
砰～砰～哦！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bang, bang! Oh!

760
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:39,820
她打中我们了，宝贝！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh! She got us, B.B.

761
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,830
妈咪打中我们了！
哦，我要死了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mommy got us. Oh, I'm dying!

762
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:46,160
我要死了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm dying.

763
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:51,090
快趴下，甜心
妈咪击中我们了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fall down, sweetheart. Mommy shot us.

764
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:59,170
但是，快枪手基多不知道的是
小宝贝只不过是装死而已，
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know that little B.B. was only playing possum,

765
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:04,340
因为她实际上刀枪不入
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets.

766
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,480
我刀枪不入，妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

767
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:10,180
嘿！躺下！
你在装死呢！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hey, get back down there. You're playing possum.

768
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:18,950
当冷笑的杀手的走向
她认为已经饮弹身亡的尸体时
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So, as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought was a bullet-ridden corpse,

769
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:21,470
这时候，小宝贝开枪了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}that's when little B.B. fired.

770
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,720
砰～砰～！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bang, bang!

771
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:36,840
你死了，妈咪！
快死呀！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're dead, Mommy. So die.

772
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,440
哦！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh!

773
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,540
宝贝
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}B.B.

774
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,360
哦，宝贝…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh! B.B....

775
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:56,890
我早该料到…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I should've known.

776
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:00,270
你是…最棒的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You are... the best.

777
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,840
哦，妈咪，不要死！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

778
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,480
我只是玩游戏而已！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was just playing.

779
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,250
我知道
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I know.

780
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:36,370
我告诉她，你在睡觉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I told her that you were asleep...

781
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:41,310
但有一天你会醒来去找她
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her.

782
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:45,610
她问我："如果我出生时
妈咪就在睡觉…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And she asked me, "lf Mommy's been asleep since I was born,

783
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,380
她如何知道我长什么样呢？"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}then how will she know what I look like?"

784
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:55,120
我回答说："因为妈咪一直梦见你啊！"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you."

785
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,000
我就是这么说的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's what I said.

786
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:02,400
你有没有梦到我？
我有梦到你哦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Did you dream of me? I dreamed of you.

787
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:07,170
每天晚上，宝贝！
每天晚上！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Every single night, baby. Every single night.

788
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,300
我等你醒来等了好久，妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy.

789
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,450
现在让我看看你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, let me look at you.

790
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,490
哦
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh.

791
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:35,530
哇～哇～哇～
你真是个漂亮的小女生
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}My, my, my, what a pretty little girl you are.

792
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,330
你也很漂亮，妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're pretty too, Mommy.

793
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:47,270
告诉妈咪，我给你看她照片的时候，
你怎么说的？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Tell Mommy what you said when I showed you her picture.

794
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:51,180
说啊，别害羞
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Come on, shy girl.

795
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,910
你一定记得的，快说啊
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Come on. You know what you said.

796
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:58,250
快呀！告诉妈咪！
这会让她开心的！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Come on. Tell Mommy. It'll make her feel good. Come on.

797
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,810
对呀，快说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Mnh-mnh. - Yeah. Come on.

798
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,380
我说…我说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I said... I said,

799
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:09,660
"我说你是我见过这世界上
最美丽的女人."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"You're the most beautifulest woman I ever saw in the whole wide world."

800
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,070
没错
她是这么说的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's the truth. That's what she said.

801
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:21,870
宝贝，你是不是认为
妈咪的头发是世界上最漂亮的？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

802
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:25,750
- 对啊
- 实际上，比漂亮更漂亮
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Yes, I do. - Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

803
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:31,950
- 比漂亮更漂亮，该怎么说？
- 嗯…美丽
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- What's better than pretty? - Mmm... Gorgeous.

804
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:36,820
好极了. 美丽
妈咪很美丽
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Very good. Gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous.

805
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,730
你知道吗，甜心…
妈咪有点生爹地的气
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hmm. You know, sweetie, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

806
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,700
为什么？你是个坏爹地吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Why, Daddy? Were you being a bad daddy?

807
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:52,180
恐怕是的
我以前是个很坏的爹地
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy.

808
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:57,740
我们的小女儿
某天学到了生死的涵义
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.

809
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:02,720
告诉妈咪埃米利欧的事吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Wanna tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?

810
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:07,360
我杀了它
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I killed him.

811
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:12,520
- 埃米利欧是她的金鱼
- 埃米利欧是我的金鱼
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Emilio was her goldfish. - Emilio was my goldfiss.

812
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,260
她跑到我的房间，手里拿着金鱼
哭着说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She came running into my room, holding the fish in her hand and crying,

813
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,300
"爹地，爹地，埃米利欧死了."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Daddy. Daddy. Emilio's dead."

814
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:26,070
我说，"真的吗？ 太令人伤心了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

815
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,340
它是怎么死的？"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How did he die?"

816
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:31,510
- 你说什么来着？
- 我踩到它了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- And what did you say? - I stepped on him.

817
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:36,820
实际上，小宝贝
当时你很技巧的说…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Actually, young lady, the words you so strategically used were,

818
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:40,790
我"不小心"踩到它了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"l accidentally stepped on him."

819
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,790
那我就问她…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}To which I queried,

820
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:48,360
"你的小脚怎么会
不小心踩到鱼缸里去了呢？"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

821
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:52,700
她说，"不是…不是…
我是在地毯上踩到它的."
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was on the carpet when I stepped on him."

822
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:56,710
嗯…像是剧情的铺陈
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mmm. The plot thickens.

823
01:33:56,770 --> 01:34:01,680
埃米利欧到底是怎么
跑到地毯上的呢？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"And just how did Emilio get on the carpet?"

824
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:05,110
妈咪，你会为她感到非常骄傲
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And Mommy, you would've been so proud of her.

825
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:09,580
她没有说谎
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She didn't lie.

826
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:13,820
她说她把埃米利欧
从鱼缸拿出来…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She said she took Emilio out of his bowl...

827
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:17,420
放到地毯上的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and put him on the carpet.

828
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,020
埃米利欧在地毯上干嘛呢？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And what was Emilio doing on the carpet?

829
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,930
一直跳
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Flapping.

830
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,840
- 然后你就踩到它了？
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- And then you stomped on him. - Uh-huh.

831
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:33,710
你把脚移开时…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And when you lifted up your foot...

832
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:37,840
- …埃米利欧在做什么？
- 什么也没做
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-...what was Emilio doing then? - Nothing.

833
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,680
它不跳了，对吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He stopped flapping, didn't he?

834
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:45,660
后来她告诉我…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She told me later...

835
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,020
当她移开脚时…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...that the second she lifted up her foot

836
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:52,320
看见埃米利欧不跳了的时候
她就明白自己做了什么
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}and saw Emilio not flapping, she knew what she had done.

837
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:57,490
这不正是一幅生死交织
完美的画面吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?

838
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:02,730
地毯上跳动的金鱼
和地毯上不动的金鱼
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

839
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:13,640
这么强烈的感，即使一个对生死
完全没概念的4岁孩子都懂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So powerful, even a four-year-old with no concept of life or death knew what it meant.

840
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:17,450
- 你爱埃米利欧，是吗？
- 嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You loved Emilio, didn't you? - Uh-huh.

841
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,460
那么…我也爱妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well... I love Mommy, too.

842
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:24,160
但我对妈咪做了一件
和你对埃米利欧做的同样的事情
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio.

843
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:28,190
- 你踩了妈咪？
- 更糟糕
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You stomped on Mommy? - Worse.

844
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,360
我开枪打了妈咪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I shot Mommy.

845
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,600
不是像我们刚才那样玩的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not pretend shooting like we were just doing.

846
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:35,330
我真的用枪打了她
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I shot her for real.

847
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:37,870
为什么？
你是想知道会发生什么是吗？？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Why? Did you want to see what would happen?

848
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:42,680
不是. 我知道开枪打她
会有怎样的结果
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, I knew what would happen to Mommy if I shot her.

849
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:47,240
但我不知道我打了妈咪以后
自己会怎样？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What I didn't know was, when I shot Mommy, what would happen to me.

850
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,980
- 后来怎样？
- 我很伤心
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- What happened? - I was very sad.

851
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,550
所以那时我学到了……
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And that's when I learned...

852
01:35:55,630 --> 01:36:00,760
有些事做了以后
就无法再改变了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...some things, once you do, they can never be undone.

853
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:09,070
- 妈咪后来怎么样了？
- 你怎么不问妈咪呢？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- What happened to Mommy? - Why don't you ask Mommy?

854
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,300
妈咪，你没事吧？
疼不疼？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You OK, Mommy? Did it hurt?

855
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:16,070
不疼，甜心
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, sweetie.

856
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:18,550
不再疼了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Doesn't hurt anymore.

857
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,180
会使你生病吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Did it make you sick?

858
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:31,860
不会. 我只是让我睡着了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No. It made me sleep.

859
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:34,630
所有没能陪你，我在睡觉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's why I haven't been with you, B.B. I've been asleep.

860
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,430
但你现在醒了，对吧，妈咪？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

861
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:41,630
是啊，我全醒了，小美人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

862
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:46,970
宝贝，你要妈咪睡前
陪你看录相片吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}B.B., would you like Mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?

863
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,510
嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Uh-huh.

864
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:52,350
妈咪，你愿意陪我
在睡前看录相片吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mommy, do you wanna watch a video with me before sleepy time?

865
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,110
哦，当然，我愿意
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, yeah! I would love to.

866
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,980
- 你要看哪一片呢？
- 幕府杀手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Which one do you wanna watch? - Shogun Assassin.

867
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,420
不好，宝贝，那片子太长了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No, B.B. Shogun Assassin is too long.

868
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:04,550
- 嗯
- 不长.
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Mnh-mnh. - No, it's not.

869
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:08,900
那好吧，小姐们，我失陪了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

870
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:21,180
我小时候，我爸爸很有名
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}(boy) When I was little, my father was famous.

871
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:25,580
他是全帝国家最好的武士
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He was the greatest samurai in the empire.

872
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:28,950
他是幕府将军的刽子手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And he was the shogun's decapitator.

873
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:34,290
曾经砍掉131个诸侯的脑袋
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

874
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,900
当我爸爸回到家看见妈妈时
他就会忘记那些杀戮
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}My father would come home to Mother and when he would see her, he would forget about the killings.

875
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:46,830
他不怕将军，将军却怕他
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.

876
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,600
也许那就是问题所在
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Maybe that was the problem.

877
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:52,510
一天晚上….将军派出了…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}One night, the shogun sent...

01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:12,710
# 她不在那儿 #
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}@ She's not there

898
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,150
我正在欣赏你的刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was just admiring your sword.

899
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,750
真是把好刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Quite a piece of work.

900
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:25,060
说到这儿…半藏最近如何？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

901
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,060
他很好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He's good.

902
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:32,100
他的寿司愈做愈好了吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Has his sushi gotten any better?

903
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:40,040
我简直难以相信
他居然替你铸刀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, I couldn't believe it. You got him to make you a sword.

904
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:44,380
其实很简单
我只是提到了你的名字，比尔
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}It was easy. I just dropped your name, Bill.

905
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:46,540
哈…那就够了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That'd do it.

906
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:05,830
# 没人告诉我她的事 #
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}@ Well, no one told me about her

907
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:16,770
# 没人告诉我她的事 #
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}@ Well, no one told me about her

908
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:23,080
那么我们该用
半藏的刀来交手，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I suppose the idea is we cross Hanzo swords. Am I right?

909
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:26,720
嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well,

910
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:32,020
正巧这个庄园有片私人海滩
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}it just so happens this hacienda has its own private beach.

911
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:36,370
海滩沐浴在月光下
显得特别的非常美丽
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight.

912
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,240
今天碰巧又是满月
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight.

913
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:49,040
如果你愿意咱们就
去海滩用刀决斗
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So, swordfighter, if you want a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

914
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:53,340
但是如果你想用传统的方式…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But if you wanna be old school about it..

915
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:57,050
你知道我是最传统的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and you know I'm all about old school...

916
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,890
那就等到天亮后
再像正统武士道一般对决
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...then we could wait until dawn and slice each other up at sunrise

917
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,220
就像一对真的夫妻似的…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Iike a couple of real-life honest...

918
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:10,400
现在…如果你不冷静一下
我就在你膝盖上来一枪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap.

919
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:13,770
现在…如果你不冷静一下
我就在你膝盖上来一枪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And I hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in.

920
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:19,600
哈哈哈～，我只是跟你闹着玩的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm just fuckin' with you.

921
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,610
现在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now...

922
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,240
至于你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...when it comes to you...

923
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,310
至于我们…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and us...

924
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,080
我有些不明白的地方
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I have a few unanswered questions.

925
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:39,620
在这个血腥的复仇故事
达到最高潮之前…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So, before this tale of bloody revenge reaches its climax,

926
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:44,960
我要问你几个问题
你得照实回答我
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm gonna ask you some questions, and I want you to tell me the truth.

927
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:49,270
然而…这也有矛盾
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}However, therein lies a dilemma.

928
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,910
因为一谈到到我
我相信你不能也不会对我说实话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because when it comes to the subject of me, I believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth.

929
01:42:57,350 --> 01:43:01,750
特别是对我
甚至你不愿意对自己说实话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Especially to me. And least of all, to yourself.

930
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,310
同时…只要一谈到我…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And when it comes to the subject of me,

931
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:12,190
我不能也不会相信你所说的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say.

932
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,290
你认为该怎么解决这个矛盾？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?

933
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:16,130
哦…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well,

934
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,190
我突然想到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}it just so happens,

935
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:20,400
一个解决办法
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I have a solution.

936
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,910
- 啊！
- 打中了！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Aah! - Gotcha!

937
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:25,130
该死！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Goddamn!

938
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:31,050
妈的，你用什么射我？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What the fuck did you just shoot me with?

939
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,850
是我最伟大的发明
起码是我最喜欢的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}My greatest invention. Or at least my favorite.

940
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,490
别碰它，不然我会在
你脸夹上再来一枪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one right in your cheek.

941
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:49,500
你中的子弹里有一种物质
现正开始在你血管里流窜
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What lies within that dart, just begging to course its way through your veins...

942
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:54,100
是一种非常强而有效的麻醉剂
它能让人说实话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...is an incredibly potent and quite infallible truth serum.

943
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:57,300
我称它做"毋庸怀疑的事实"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

944
01:43:57,370 --> 01:44:02,870
比有钠成分的麻醉剂还要强两倍
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Twice as strong as sodium pentothal, with no druggie aftereffects.

945
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:08,680
除了会让你有点儿快感之外
没有其他副作用. 感觉到了吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Except for a slight wave of euphoria. You feel it?

946
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,740
- 快感？
- 对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- Euphoria? - Yeah.

947
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:14,790
- 不
- 真糟糕
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- No. - Too bad.

948
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:18,220
你知道…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}As you know...

949
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,750
我很喜欢漫画
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'm quite keen on comic books.

950
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:25,430
特别是那些关于超级大英雄的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Especially the ones about superheroes.

951
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:31,070
我对那些英雄式的神话非常着迷
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating.

952
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:35,740
拿我最喜欢的超人为例吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

953
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:38,870
虽然不算好漫画，也画的不好…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not a great comic book. Not particularly well-drawn.

954
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,210
嗯
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Mmm.

955
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:44,690
但就神话上的意义来说
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But the mythology...

956
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:48,120
他不仅伟大，而且是独一无二的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The mythology is not only great, it's unique.

957
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:52,460
这捞什子的药性多久会发作？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How long does this shit take to go into effect?

958
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:56,470
大约两分钟吧
正好够我讲完重点了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}About two minutes. Just long enough for me to finish my point.

959
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:04,830
英雄式的神话中都有个特点
他们同时是英雄也是凡人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is, there's the superhero and there's the alter ego.

960
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:09,140
蝙蝠侠原来是布鲁斯・伟恩
蜘蛛侠原来是彼得・派克
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

961
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:14,150
当蜘蛛侠早上醒来，他是彼得・派克
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When that character wakes up in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

962
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:19,380
他得穿上蜘蛛服才会变成蜘蛛侠
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man.

963
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:25,290
从这个观点来说，超人是更出众的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.

964
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,200
他不是后来变成超人的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Superman didn't become Superman.

965
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:30,960
而是天生的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Superman was born Superman.

966
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,370
超人早上醒来，他就是个超人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman.

967
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,960
他的凡人面是克拉克・肯特
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}His alter ego is Clark Kent.

968
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,140
他衣服上的大红"S"
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}His outfit with the big red "S" -

969
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:45,880
是当他父母
发现他时，原本就在包着他的毛毯上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him.

970
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:48,820
那是他自己的衣服
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Those are his clothes.

971
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:54,190
至于眼镜和西装，只是他
为了要融入凡人社会中而穿的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us.

972
01:46:00,430 --> 01:46:03,890
克拉克・肯特只是
超人眼中我们的化身
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

973
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:07,230
至于克拉克・肯特的个性…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?

974
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,640
他软弱…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He's weak...

975
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:12,570
缺乏自信…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...he's unsure of himself...

976
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,370
他是个懦夫
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...he's a coward.

977
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:20,350
克拉克・肯特是超人
对全人类的所下的定义
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.

978
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:26,850
有点儿像碧翠丝・基多和
汤米・普林顿的夫人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

979
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:30,290
原来如此
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Aso.

980
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,560
总算你说出了重点
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The point emerges.

981
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,790
你原本可以成维爱琳・普林顿的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You would've worn the costume of Arlene Plimpton.

982
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:41,630
不过你生来就是碧翠丝・基多
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

983
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:46,670
你每天早上醒来
还是碧翠丝基多
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And every morning when you woke up, you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

984
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,910
你可以把针头拔出来了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, you can... take the needle out.

985
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,520
你叫我超级英雄？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Are you calling me a superhero?

986
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:00,780
我叫你杀手…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm calling you a killer.

987
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:03,760
天生的杀手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}A natural born killer.

988
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:07,460
你一直都是…以后永远都是
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You always have been, and you always will be.

989
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,760
搬去艾帕索…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Moving to El Paso...

990
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:13,230
二手唱片行打工…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...working in a used record store...

991
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:15,830
和汤米一起去看电影…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

992
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,400
收集折价券
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...clipping coupons.

993
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:19,310
那只不过是你…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's you...

994
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:22,870
你想伪装成工蜂…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee.

995
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:25,970
躲在蜂巢里不被发现罢了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

996
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:28,450
但你不是工蜂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But you're not a worker bee.

997
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:32,290
你是变节的杀人蜂
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're a renegade killer bee.

998
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,150
不管你喝多少啤酒
吃过多少烤肉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate

999
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:38,520
或是你的屁股变得多肥
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}or how fat your ass got,

1000
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,460
世上一切都不能改变这个事实
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}nothing in the world would ever change that.

1001
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,930
第一个问题:
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}First question:

1002
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:54,480
你真的认为，从此能在艾帕索
过个普通人的生活吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Did you really think your life in El Paso was gonna work?

1003
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,210
不！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No!

1004
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,380
但宝贝本来是我的！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I would've had B.B.!

1005
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:11,160
别误会我的意思
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Don't get me wrong.

1006
01:48:11,230 --> 01:48:15,130
我认为你本来就会是个好母亲
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I think you would have been a wonderful mother.

1007
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,720
但你也是个杀手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But you are a killer.

1008
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,640
你能找到我之前所杀的那些人
也都是高手，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}All those people you killed to get to me...

1009
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:27,180
感觉不错，对吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...felt damn good, didn't they?

1010
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:31,810
对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

1011
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,180
每一个人都是吧？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Every single one of them?

1012
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,190
对
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

1013
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:52,130
那是给你暖身的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}That was the warmup round.

1014
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:57,500
现在到了要问你
值六万四千美元的问题了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Now comes the $64,000 question.

1015
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:07,840
你为什么要离开我
还怀着我的孩？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Why did you run away from me with my baby?

1016
01:49:11,690 --> 01:49:15,120
你记得你给最后的一个任务吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Do you remember the last assignment you sent me on?

1017
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:17,630
当然
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Of course.

1018
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:19,720
王丽莎
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Lisa Wong.

1019
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,620
出发的那天早上，我病了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The morning I left, I was sick.

1020
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:27,930
我在飞机上吐了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}On the plane, I threw up.

1021
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:33,640
我开始想:
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So I started thinking:

1022
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:35,870
我可能是怀孕了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Maybe I was pregnant.

1023
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:40,410
使用方便，打开盖子
将尿液浸泡5分钟
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1024
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:48,650
只要90秒，小窗口上
就会显示正确结果
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Accurate results in only 90 seconds. You can read the results as soon as the line appears in the window."

1025
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:26,050
妈的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Fuck.

1026
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:28,290
我不知道的是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}What I didn't know...

1027
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:32,430
旅途中我的踪迹已经败露
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...was that somewhere on my journey I had been spotted.

1028
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:38,600
我到了洛杉矶不久
王丽莎就派出了杀手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong long to send an assassin of her own.

1029
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,410
哈，有事儿吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-  Hello, can I help you?

1030
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:44,810
哈，我是金凯伦饭
诚志饭店的客服经理
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Hello, I'm Karen Kim. I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1031
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,680
我们有个见面礼给您
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I have a welcome gift from the management.

1032
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,950
真周到
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, that's nice. Um...

1033
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:52,010
留在门下就好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Can you just leave it by the door?

1034
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,700
- 你很会使长枪吗？
- 不是非得这么近我能才打中你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- You pretty good with that shotgun? - Not that I have to be at this range,

1035
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,670
我可是个使枪老手.
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}but I'm a fuckin' surgeon with this shotgun.

1036
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:12,800
告诉你吧，婊子，我比神枪手
奥克丽还准，你在我射程内
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well, guess what, bitch? I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1037
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,280
- 我的枪正瞄准着你
- 我能把你的猪脑袋轰掉
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}- And I got you right in my sight. - I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1038
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:20,510
不会比我打中你的眉心快
咱们还是谈谈吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not before I put one right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1039
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:24,350
凯伦…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Karen...

1040
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:28,620
我刚发现…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I just found out...

1041
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,660
现在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...right now...

1042
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:36,690
就在你刚破门而入后…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...not a moment before you blew a hole through the door...

1043
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:39,630
- …我怀孕了
- 说这干嘛？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}-...that I'm pregnant. - What is this?

1044
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,970
门边的地上…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}On the floor by the door...

1045
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,170
有个验孕器
上面显示我怀孕了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1046
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,400
鬼扯！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Bullshit.

1047
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:53,340
换做别时，你一定没错
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Any other time you'd be 100 percent right.

1048
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:56,280
但这次…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}This time...

1049
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,380
你完全错了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you're 100 percent wrong.

1050
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,520
我是世上能要人命的女人…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1051
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:06,790
但现在…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But right now...

1052
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:09,230
有了孩子我却怕了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1053
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,090
求你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Please.

1054
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,600
看一下验孕器
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Just look at the strip.

1055
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:19,400
求你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Please.

1056
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:25,440
待在原地别动
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Stay where you are and don't move.

1057
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,000
妈的，我不懂这表示啥？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1058
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:47,470
说明就在盒子上啊！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}The box with the directions - it's right there.

1059
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:00,910
使用方便
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}"Easy to use.

1060
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:05,550
打开盖子
将尿液浸泡海绵处5分钟
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end."

1061
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:07,280
蓝色代表怀孕
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Blue means pregnant.

1062
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:10,080
我自己会读，不用你多事
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll read it myself, thank you.

1063
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:19,900
哦，好
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh, OK.

1064
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:22,200
好吧，如果我相信你
下面该怎么做？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Say I were to believe you. What then?

1065
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:24,900
你回家吧
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Just go home.

1066
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:28,100
我也回家
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'll do the same.

1067
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:49,290
恭喜你！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Congratulations.

1068
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:55,770
在验孕器变蓝色前…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Before that strip turned blue...

1069
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,280
我是个女人，我是你的女人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1070
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,900
我是你的杀手…为你而杀
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was a killer who killed for you.

1071
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:06,070
在验孕器变成蓝色前
我愿意以从摩托车上…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Before that strip turned blue, I would've jumped a motorcycle

1072
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:09,140
跳到高速飞驰的火车上
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}onto a speeding train.

1073
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,210
为了你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}For you.

1074
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,890
一但验孕器变蓝色以后…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But once that strip turned blue...

1075
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:19,450
我再也无法做那些事了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I could no longer do any of those things.

1076
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:22,000
再也不能了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not anymore.

1077
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:24,630
因为我要做妈妈了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because I was gonna be a mother.

1078
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,500
你能了解吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Can you understand that?

1079
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:35,300
能
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

1080
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,540
但你为什么不…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But why didn't you...

1081
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:40,780
当时告诉我，反而是现在？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...tell me then, instead of now?

1082
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:43,150
你一旦知道，她就是你的了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1083
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,210
我不希望那样
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And I didn't want that.

1084
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,190
这不是你能决定的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not your decision to make.

1085
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:50,390
我能
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes.

1086
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:54,730
是我为我女儿所做的正确决定
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But it's the right decision, and I made it for my daughter.

1087
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,460
她来到的世界应该是清白的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}She deserved to be born with a clean slate.

1088
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,530
但是和你在一起
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But with you...

1089
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:05,740
她就会生在一个她不该在的世界
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...she would've been born into a world she shouldn't have.

1090
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:10,440
我必须作选择
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I had to choose.

1091
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:12,500
我选择了她
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I chose her.

1092
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:17,880
你知道…如果5年前
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You know, five years ago,

1093
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:22,820
要我列出绝不可能发生事情的清单
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen,

1094
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:28,530
你在我的脑壳上来一枪…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}you performing a coup de grace on me by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1095
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:33,600
绝对会排在第一位
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...would've been right at the top of the list.

1096
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:37,300
但是我错了，不是吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'd have been wrong, wouldn't l?

1097
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:40,540
对不起
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I-I'm sorry.

1098
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:42,740
那是个问我的问题吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Was that a question?

1099
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:49,910
如果说你认为那是不可能发生的事
这样说的话，你是错了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Of impossible things that could never happen - yes, in this instance, you would've been wrong.

1100
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,880
那么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Well?

1101
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:55,590
当你没回来…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}When you never came back,

1102
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:01,830
我当然会想到王丽莎
或者其他什么人杀了你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I naturally assumed Lisa Wong, or somebody else, had killed you.

1103
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:05,130
哦，说正格儿的…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Oh! And for the record...

1104
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:09,400
如果你没死
却让爱你的人误会你死了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...Ietting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they're not

1105
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:11,460
是非常残酷的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}is quite cruel.

1106
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,750
我为你伤心了三个月
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I mourned you for three months.

1107
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:23,920
在我痛苦的第三个月
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And in the third month of mourning you...

1108
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:26,350
我发现了你的踪迹
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...I tracked you down.

1109
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,550
我不是故意要去追查你的行踪
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1110
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:34,060
而是在追查
是找哪个混蛋杀了你
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I was tryin' to track down the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1111
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:37,620
结果我却找到你了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}So I find you...

1112
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,900
结果我发现什么？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...and what do I find?

1113
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:43,300
你不仅没死…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Not only are you not dead...

1114
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:47,430
还要嫁给一个该死的混蛋
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you're getting married to some fucking jerk.

1115
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:52,270
而且你还怀孕了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And you're pregnant.

1116
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:57,950
我…反应过度了些
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I overreacted.

1117
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:10,400
反应过度？ 这就是你的解释？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You overreacted? Is that your explanation?

1118
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,900
我没说我要解释什么！
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1119
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:15,400
我只是要告诉你实话
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1120
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:19,910
如果我说的太复杂
我就再说明白点
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1121
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:24,870
我是个杀手
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm a killer.

1122
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:27,850
我是个杀人的混蛋…你是知道的
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm a murdering bastard. You know that.

1123
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:35,750
如果你伤了这个混蛋的心
就会有很严重的后果
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.

1124
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:38,390
这你也曾经历过
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You experienced some of them.

1125
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:45,490
我的反应真的
那么出乎你的预料吗？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Was my reaction really that surprising?

1126
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:49,270
是的…没错
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Yes. It was.

1127
01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:55,440
你真能做出那种事吗…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Could you do what you did?

1128
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:59,240
你当然能
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Of course you could.

1129
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:05,740
可我没想到你居然忍心那样对我
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But I never thought you would, or could, do that to me.

1130
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:08,850
我真的很抱歉，小乖
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1131
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:11,090
但是你想错了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...but you thought wrong.

1132
01:58:17,330 --> 01:58:21,460
你我之间还有未了结的账
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You and I have unfinished business.

1133
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:25,640
宝贝…我知道你不是在开玩笑
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique?

1135
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,440
当然
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}'Course he did.

1136
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:13,350
你为什么不告诉我？
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Why didn't you tell me?

1137
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:19,290
不知道
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}I don't know.

1138
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:24,630
因为我是…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Because I'm...

1139
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:27,800
是个坏人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...a bad person.

1140
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:29,960
不
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}No.

1141
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:34,470
你不是坏人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're not a bad person.

1142
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:37,540
你是个了不起的人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're a terrific person.

1143
01:59:37,610 --> 01:59:40,110
是我最喜欢的人
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You're my favorite person.

1144
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:45,920
但偶尔…
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}But every once in a while...

1145
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:47,980
你还真像个婊子
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}...you can be a real cunt.

1146
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,470

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}How do I look?

1147
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,530
你像已经准备好了
{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}You look ready.

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Do you have a magpie in your home?

1153

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}If you do, you are most fortunate.

1154

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}Treat him gently. Treat him kindly.

1157
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:48,160

{\fnTahoma\fs12\b0}And always remember, the magpie deserves your respect.
