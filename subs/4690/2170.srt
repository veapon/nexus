1
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,030
顾问! 我找到他了!
Counselor! I've got him!

2
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,238
下来!你下来!
Down! You come down!

3
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,619
马上下来吧!
Down for good!

4
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,493
抱歉这么早打扰您.
Forgive this early intrusion.

5
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,057
你好啊
How are you?

6
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,660
我一直都很仰慕您. 很荣幸见到您.
I am a great admirer of yours. Honored to meet you.

7
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:06,470
可以么?
May l?

8
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:10,405
我可以用下打字机么, 先生?
Can I use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,506
你的手臂，放松.
Your arm, please. Relax it.

10
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,311
- 年龄? - 43.
- Your age? - 43.

11
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,882
那么，您的下一部作品是什么?
So, what are you cooking up?

12
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,286
又是一部没劲的戏?
Another film without hope?

13
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,448
－第一次治疗么? －是啊
- First time taking the cure? - Yes.

14
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:31,620
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

15
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:34,286
请进
Come in.

16
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:39,361
- 对不起.我待会儿再来吧 - 没关系，进来吧
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later. - No, do come in.

17
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:40,828
吸气
Breathe in.

18
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,474
深吸气
Deeper.

19
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:49,678
早上好啊...我能吸烟么?
Good morning... May I smoke?

20
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,180
咳嗽
Cough.

21
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,486
呼气
Breathe in.

22
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,584
- 您读过了吧 - 是的
- You've already read it? - Yes.

23
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:04,920
吐气
Breathe.

24
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,199
那么...您怎么看?
And... what do you think?

25
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:14,763
嗯，我记了东西，一会儿给你看
Well, I made some notes, but we'll talk later.

26
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,601
你身体有点疲劳 可以穿上衣服了
Your system is a bit worn out. You may get dressed now.

27
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,836
这姑娘看起来还行啊，是美国人吧
Nice looking girl. American, right?

28
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,440
你够专业的了
You've got some fine merchandise there.

29
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,414
这个治疗对您的病很有帮助， 你会很快恢复的
This treatment will do you good, you'll see.

30
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,656
护士，300毫升清水
Nurse. 300 ml of holy water,

31
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,558
空腹15分钟后，吃3 片
3 doses to be taken at 1 5 minute intervals, on an empty stomach.

32
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:42,154
- 隔一天清洗一次 - 什么时间了?
- Mud bath every other day... - What time is it?

33
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,426
泥疗后十分钟，在处方上的药水里泡十分钟
After the mud bath, ten minutes in the mineral water as prescribed...

34
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,335
我在温泉那等你 好，谢谢你了
- I'll wait for you at the spring. - Yes, thank you.

35
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,192
先生!
Sir!

36
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,431
您的杯子
Sir, your glass.

37
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,915
在这呢
Over here.

38
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,749
您想聊聊那部电影么? 那太好啊
You want to talk about the film? - Yes, of course.

39
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:27,450
好的.那就是说， 你想让制作人也看到我的意见么
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like the producer to see my report.

40
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:31,018
放心，我不会给您添麻烦的
Frankly, I wouldn't want to be the one to cause you any trouble.

41
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,359
别担心 让你来就是要听你的意见么
No, don't worry. I'm the one who called you in.

42
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,892
首先，我觉得这部片子
On first reading it's evident

43
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:40,835
缺少矛盾冲突， 或者说铺垫的还不够
that the film lacks a problematic, or a philosophical premise...

44
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,302
要坐下聊吗?
Would you like to sit down?

45
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,173
...整体上这部片子没有连贯性
...making the film a series of gratuitous episodes,

46
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,044
影片重点放在非现实主义
perhaps amusing for their ambiguous realism.

47
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:55,046
会让人觉得主题还不够突出
One wonders what the authors are trying to say...

48
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,950
这是一部让人联想的片子呢? 或者是惊栗?
Are they trying to make us think? To scare us?

49
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,550
影片的开端，就显得缺乏灵感
From the start, the action reveals a poverty of poetic inspiration.

50
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:07,986
希望您别介意，让我来解释一下原因
Forgive me, but this might be the definitive proof

51
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:14,061
影片的手法有点落后
that cinema is 50 years behind all other arts.

52
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:17,130
主题显得有些没有意义
The subject doesn't even have the merits

53
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:21,474
这部片子，确实需要改改
of an 'avant garde' film, but it has all the shortcomings.

54
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:25,511
看看我的笔记，也许会有点帮助
Here, my notes. I doubt they will be helpful.

55
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,912
我还是有点不敢相信您会考虑我的意见
It's still a mystery that you'd think of me

56
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,016
从合作的角度来讲，老实说 我觉得您不会考虑
for a collaboration that, frankly, I don't think can work.

57
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,759
不，绝对不.相反，这对我很有帮助
No, no. On the contrary. You'll be most helpful.

58
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:45,568
你看看，这部片子... 我真的很想拍出来
You see, the film... I really want to make this film.

59
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:48,799
我推迟两个星期拍就是因为...
I postponed the shoot for two weeks because...

60
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:57,238
马责柏塔! 你说什么?
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.

61
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,543
马责柏塔! 马里奥! 你也来了?
Mezzabotta! Mario! You're here too?

62
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,381
贵度!
Guido!

63
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,391
你这是怎么了?
What happened to you!

64
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,596
嘿，老贵度，最近怎么样?
Hey, big Guido, how are you?

65
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:18,066
你也开始长白头发了，老了啊!
You've sprouted quite a few white hairs, old Snaporaz!

66
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,663
你又喝这个? 对你不好的!
Are you drinking that stuff? It's bad for you.

67
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:25,002
他们说我的肝...唉 你这是治什么呢?
They said my liver is, well... And you, what's your treatment?

68
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,946
等一下...珂劳迪亚!
Just a second... Gloria!

69
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:34,750
你女儿.已经成人了啊 哦，她不是我女儿
- Your daughter. She's all grown up. - No, she's not my daughter.

70
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,423
残忍的蜜蜂，吸食了花朵美丽的生命
Cruel bees, sucking all the life from these poor flowers.

71
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:45,084
亲爱的，这是我的朋友... 对不起，我这鞋...
- Darling, this is my friend... - I'm sorry. My shoes...

72
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:48,428
珂劳迪亚，珂劳迪亚 莫仁 你好
Gloria. Gloria Morin. - Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,500
你好
Fine, thank you.

74
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,395
我认识你，你的爸爸常常提起你
I know all about you. Pupi always, always tells me.

75
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:58,931
我们还因为评论你的上一部片子大吵一架呢
We even had a big fight when I was very critical of your last film.

76
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,872
是啊.我们真的很喜欢看
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

77
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,777
去喝点东西吧，走
Let's go for a drink. Let's go.

78
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,214
你一个人来得么? 你夫人呢?
And you, are you here alone? And your wife?

79
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,685
是啊，一个人来的 一个人多好
- Yes, I'm alone. - Better that way...

80
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:13,182
哈哈，还是这样好啊
Well, I mean, better in general...

81
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,759
你听说我和蒂娜的事了吧 谁是蒂娜?
You heard about Tina and me? - Tina?

82
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,458
我们在等着宣誓
We're waiting for an annulment.

83
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:22,624
所以我们都来了. 我们已经订婚了
That's why we're here together. We're engaged.

84
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,228
恭喜你们!
Congratulations.

85
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,469
哈哈，老贵度.你在忙什么呢?
Well, big Guido. What are you working on? Something good?

86
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,036
我在想找一个世外桃源让我静一静
Sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.

87
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,736
丹米尔，我就是作者，这位小姐... 对不起，改怎么称呼你?
Daumier, the author, Miss... Pardon me, what is your name?

88
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,244
珂劳迪亚 莫仁
- Gloria. - Gloria Morin.

89
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,875
见到你很高兴! 我非常欣赏您的作品
Nice to meet you. I am a big admirer of yours.

90
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,416
过奖了!
I'm flattered.

91
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:44,610
你是演员么? 我好像在那见过你的照片
Are you an actress? Did I see your photo somewhere?

92
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,190
演员.是的, 嗯...
An actress. Yes, well...

93
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:52,058
我确实想过. 而且野心还不小
I have ambitions in that area. Actually enormous ambitions,

94
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,324
不过也只是想想而已
but that's all, for the moment.

95
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:55,762
她可是哲学毕业的哦
She's got a degree in philosophy.

96
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,926
见到你是我的荣幸.马里奥 很高兴见到你
Allow me. Mario Mezzabotta. - Nice to meet you.

97
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,960
我还没拿到文凭. 我正在写篇论文，有点不一样的论文
I don't have a degree. I'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.

98
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,667
在写什么? 是很难的那种
- And the subject? - A difficult one.

99
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,875
是探讨男性在现代生活当中的孤独
The loneliness of modern man in contemporary theater.

100
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,941
听起来不错，对吧，专家
Interesting subject. Right, Professor?

101
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,879
要反映点什么呢? 是反复无常的幻觉么
And what is the meaning of the capricious apparitions

102
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,715
来体现女性存在的意义
of the girl of the spring?

103
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,922
很纯洁的题材 主题很有亲和力
An offer of purity? Of warmth to the protagonist?

104
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:24,553
所有我见过的题材中 很明显，这是最糟的了
Of all your story's overabundant symbols, this is the worst...

105
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,938
希望她写不出来，最好是写不出来!
She didn't make it. Better that way.

106
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:38,965
别废话了，你怎么样? 还好吧
- Yack! How are you? - Not too bad.

107
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,061
有人认识你么? 我想不是吧
- Did anybody recognize you? - I don't think so.

108
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,696
这些包都是你的么?
You brought all that luggage?

109
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,175
有5个箱子 衣服就有好多
It's just five suitcases. Gowns occupy so much space.

110
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,905
我带来一个...给你看看 全是你带来的?
I brought one... you'll see. Did you get it all?

111
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,040
珂尔拉，这里晚上很安静的 什么活动都没有
Carla, it's quiet here at night. There's nothing going on.

112
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,574
这么时髦的地方 一定有节目的
But it's a fashionable spa. There must be some fashion shows,

113
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,917
有些酒吧很热闹的啊，酒店里就有
some trendy clubs, even at our hotel.

114
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,685
你去看看了么? 是啊
Have you been behaving? - Yes, yes.

115
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:04,625
可是...我的酒店里已经满了
Actually... I couldn't get you a room in my hotel,

116
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,664
而且酒店里的人都认识我
and besides it's full of people who know me.

117
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:10,924
这样吧，我来安排个地方 找个好点的...
So, I found someplace else. A perfect hotel...

118
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,433
那倒不错，可是... 为什么要这样?
Very pretty, you know... - But why?

119
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,602
这小子是谁? 斯古么?呵呵
- And how's this guy? - Sgulp? Great.

120
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,744
你脸色不太好，怎么了?
You look a little pale. How come?

121
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,808
就是这，我说的就是这
See, the hotel is right here.

122
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,282
斯格诺拉，房客
Signora, guests!

123
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,617
我就说么，也很一般...
See. Like I told you. It's not...

124
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,983
这里也很安静啊.你不是饿了么
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,

125
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,184
我去叫点三明治的来
I'll get them to bring a couple of sandwiches.

126
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:40,218
这给我感觉不太好 没有拉，这也不错
It feels a little sad here. - No, it's typical!

127
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,555
我当然饿了. 你都吃过午餐了，我还没呢
Besides I'm hungry. You had lunch, but I didn't.

128
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,232
你好，先生
Hello, Sir.

129
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,394
单人房间舒服么
How's the solitaire coming along?

130
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,439
什么都有的，有单独的卧室和洗手间
Everything's ready, the room, the bathroom.

131
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,838
放心休息吧 斯格诺拉会象在家一样舒服的
Rest assured. Signora will feel at home.

132
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,468
好的，谢谢你.有什么吃的么?
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't have anything ready for lunch?

133
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,102
休息室里就有 就在这边
- The restroom, please? - It's over there.

134
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,306
我自己去就可以了
I'll see to it personally.

135
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,913
真不好意思. 我的手好脏啊
Trains, such horrible things. They leave your hands so black.

136
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,748
我来了你不高兴么 当然高兴
Are you happy I'm here? - Yes.

137
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,224
是一点点还是很开心 特别的开心
- Really happy or a little happy? - Very happy.

138
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,191
嗯，不错
Hmm. Smack!

139
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,595
你笑起来真甜
Mm, what a nice smell!

140
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:16,165
贵度，这绒面一定会很皱起来的
Guido, I thought this black velvet was going to wrinkle.

141
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:19,134
是吗?好，好 不，不会皱的
- Really? Good, good. - But no. Not a wrinkle.

142
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:20,995
坐三个小时都不会皱的
Even after a three-hour trip.

143
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:30,205
你还没说喜不喜欢呢 觉得怎么样?
You didn't even tell me you like it. Do you like it?

144
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,110
你穿上更漂亮了
Such a beautiful lady!

145
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,082
她戴着很优雅
So refined. That thing she has on her head...

146
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,144
这是什么? 舒服么?
What is it? Ploosh?

147
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,918
舒服，舒服，哦，还不错
- Plush, plush. - Ah, ploosh.

148
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,694
我就是要找这个呢 真是踏破铁鞋呀
I looked around for it like crazy. I was quite desperate.

149
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:50,225
你真了解我啊 当珂尔拉后悔的时候...
But you know me. When Carla makes up her mind...

150
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,164
好了，好了
- Snarp! - Sgulp!

151
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,264
我上周读了一个唐那得的故事
I read a good Donald Duck last week...

152
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,966
有一只恐龙
There was a dinosaur...

153
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,408
她就在这，我的宝贝屁屁 正经点，一只恐龙...
- Here she is, my sweet-buns. - Be good, a dinosaur...

154
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:04,642
贵度正经点 你想知道什么
Guido be good. What do you want to do now?

155
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:07,509
你肯定会出席么? 当然了，为什么问这个?
Are you sure you've been behaving? - Sure, why?

156
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:12,644
随便吧，我已经饿了 哦，我的结婚戒指
Anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry. Oh, my wedding ring.

157
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,916
听着，贵度. 你可答应过我的...
Listen, Guido. That little thing you promised me...

158
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,387
答应什么了?
What little thing?

159
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,828
我打赌她一定要说她丈夫的事了
Now I bet she brings up her husband again.

160
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,801
你不觉得么? 看着吧!老家伙
You don't think so? You'll see, old Snaporaz.

161
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:30,131
可怜的，她看起来一点也不开心
My poor Luigi doesn't seem happy at all.

162
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,700
你看，我丈夫一点都不自信
You see, my husband is not the confident type.

163
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,202
他只是有点沮丧
He gets depressed.

164
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:39,843
他一点都不笨，还很聪明的
He's not stupid, you know. He's actually very clever...

165
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,275
呜啊，这儿好热
It's so hot here!

166
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,650
他对罗马的历史了如指掌
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

167
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,489
他只需要一点点的帮助
He just needs a push.

168
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,956
他在石油公司上班，只有那么一点点薪水
He's still working at the fuel company, same salary.

169
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:51,959
是么
Really?

170
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,794
快把钱包给我 别弄花了
Be good and put down my purse. You'll break it.

171
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:58,130
我很喜欢这个钱包 是他给我的
I love that little purse. He gave it to me.

172
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,268
你怎么不帮他找份别的工作
Why don't you find him a job?

173
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,905
你交际广 而且也答应过我的啊
You know so many people. You've promised it so many times.

174
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,274
我曾经梦到过
I even had a dream about it.

175
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,278
梦见你真的给他找了份工作
I dreamed that you did find him a job,

176
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,080
可是他疯了 还把我们一起杀了
but he'd lost his mind and killed us both.

177
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,387
啊? 你和我?
- Who? - You and me!

178
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,354
在那里呢?
Know where we were?

179
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,551
就是在我给你买领带的地方
In that little street, Via della Croce, where I bought you

180
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:28,564
你老婆也给你买过一条的， 还记得么?
the same tie your wife did. Do you remember?

181
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:32,932
我真想知道 你戴的是谁给你买的
And I never knew if you were wearing hers or mine.

182
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,607
梦里我们躺在床上， 相互依偎着，一丝不挂的
We were there on a cot, in each other's arms, naked.

183
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,875
然后他进来把我俩都杀了
And he came in and he killed us both with a broom!

184
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,909
把窗帘放下 对
- Draw the blinds more. - Yes.

185
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:54,380
可以了.现在去走廊散散步吧
That's it. Now go into the corridor for a minute,

186
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,084
然后假装你走错房间了
then pretend you've come to the wrong room

187
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,593
看到一个陌生人
and found a stranger.

188
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,997
哦!就是这样 我们从没这样过
Oh, that's good. We've never done this one.

189
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:02,825
站在那别动 让我再看看你
Hold it there. Let me look at you.

190
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,868
不，不是这样，你需要再补补的桩，再多一点
No. No. Your make-up needs to be more, more...

191
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:13,033
多点什么? 像个荡妇一样!
- More what? - More like a slut!

192
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,105
来我帮你画画
Give me your eyeliner.

193
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,517
这眼影不错 对，就要这样
- Nice lampshade. - Yes, yes.

194
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,579
这灯好漂亮，我也想要一个放在我家 别动
- I'd like one for my place. - Don't move.

195
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,354
这酒店叫什么来着?
What is this hotel called?

196
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:29,820
旅行宾馆
The Railway Hotel.

197
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,324
我要写信给我丈夫
I want to write to my husband so he'll send me

198
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,796
让他马上给我快递. 他写的信很得体的
an express letter right away. He writes such nice letters.

199
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,465
我会让你看看的 好，别动
I'll let you read them. - Fine, but keep still...

200
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,834
做个诱惑的表情
Make a slutty face.

201
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,534
走到走廊那
Go out in the corridor.

202
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,008
这就是我需要演的那部分么 是的
- So, it's a part I have to play. - Yes.

203
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,637
你怎么看我? 你的演员么?
Who do you think I am? One of your actresses?

204
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:51,941
你不觉得我可以变成他们一样么
You don't think I could be one of them?

205
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:55,283
那可不是我想要的生活
Not me. I wouldn't want to lead that life.

206
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,319
我喜欢一直在家待着
I like staying home.

207
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,884
好，快出去吧.我要假装睡觉了
Go on, get out. I'm sleeping now.

208
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,588
告诉我.你是不是很喜欢我这样呀
Tell me. If I were really to do something like this,

209
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,857
你有点嫉妒了吧
would you be jealous?

210
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,032
为什么?真的么?
Why? Would you really?

211
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,100
也许吧
Who knows?

212
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:19,434
你需要点什么 不，我只是走错房间了
- May I get you something? - No, I just came out on a whim.

213
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,070
要我给你放点水洗澡么 不用了，我只是...
- Would you like me to run you a bath? - No, I was just...

214
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,171
要喝点水么? 不了，谢谢你
- A glass of water, perhaps? - No, thank you.

215
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,517
碰到谁了? 说什么呢?
What did she want? What did she say?

216
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:33,488
是主人，她要给我杯水
The owner, she wanted to give me a glass of water.

217
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,754
过来点，来
Come here. Come.

218
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,494
拿开床单
Open up the sheet.

219
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:46,558
贵度，你喜欢我么? 当然了
- Guido, do you love me a little? - Yes, yes.

220
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,688
是你么，妈妈?
Is that you, Mama?

221
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:22,166
好难过，儿子，好伤心
So many tears, my son, so many tears.

222
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,035
爸爸，等等!别走
Papa, wait! Don't go.

223
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,402
我们还没谈完啊
We talked so little.

224
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,016
爸爸，我有好多事不明白
Listen Papa, I have so many questions.

225
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,650
我还不能马上回答你
I cannot answer them yet.

226
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:43,353
这的屋顶好低，你看看
See the ceiling here? It's so low.

227
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:47,786
我想要个高点的 这个太糟了，儿子，我不喜欢
I would have liked it higher. It's ugly, my son, ugly.

228
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:53,098
我想换一换了 你能帮我么?
I would have liked it different. Couldn't you take care of it?

229
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,228
你画画不错，能不能帮我...
You used to draw so well. I'd like...

230
00:21:56,706 --> 00:22:00,335
哦，卡门多，本不该麻烦他的
Oh, the Commendatore, he shouldn't have bothered.

231
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:08,677
嗨 我现在有点时间
- Hello. - Respects. He's got very little time.

232
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,512
嗨
Hi.

233
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,685
我的儿子怎么样了?
How is he doing, this son of mine?

234
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:18,452
小心啊，不要让他骗了你
Careful. Don't let him move you.

235
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:23,391
他不是很好?怎么了?
He isn't doing well? How come?

236
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:27,003
我知道这很难过，不应该犯这样的错的
It is so hard, realizing that one has made such huge mistakes.

237
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:27,867
可是我...
But l...

238
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,573
你妈妈给你做了点心
Mother prepared you a little something.

239
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,048
奶酪和桃子
A little cheese and two peaches.

240
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,808
不用担心我了
Don't worry about me.

241
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,350
好吧，虽然这里有点冷清
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

242
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,389
你妈妈会每天来陪我的
but your mother comes every day.

243
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:51,086
她给我做伴 帮我打点一切
She keeps me company, you know. And keeps everything in order.

244
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:53,326
应该客气点的
A little decorum is always necessary.

245
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,427
我们就是这么长大的
That's how we were brought up.

246
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,758
和你妻子，陆纱也是这样的么?
And with your wife, Luisa -- all fine?

247
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:59,200
是啊，陆纱
Yes. Luisa...

248
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,634
你们俩在一起真好. 再见了，我的儿子
You two together have been my joy. Goodbye, son...

249
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,504
这是什么地方? 你喜欢吗?
What is this place? Do you like it here?

250
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,049
我还没布置好呢
I haven't figured it out yet.

251
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:20,049
这里会变得很温馨的
But it's going much better.

252
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:25,528
首先，看这...
At first, you see, at first...

253
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:32,562
贵度! 我的宝贝儿子 让我看看你还需要点什么?
Guido! I do my best. What more can I do?

254
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,210
可怜的贵度，你肯定精疲力尽了 要不咱们回家吧
Poor Guido, you must be tired. Shall we go home?

255
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:50,744
我是陆纱，你的老婆啊 不记得我了么?
I'm Luisa, your wife. Don't you recognize me?

256
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:51,947
你想什么呢?
What are you thinking about?

257
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,588
嗨! 你好!!
- Hello. - Hello.

258
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,072
下午好!
Good afternoon.

259
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:16,233
贵度!过两天， 你就会适应的
Guido! In a few days, I'll get you an introduction

260
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,797
很快你就可以得到建议了
so you can get all the advice you need.

261
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,507
很奥妙的雕塑吧
Nice mystical figure. Right?

262
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,968
我做了三个老人
I brought you the three old men.

263
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,037
一个俄国人 还有一个退役的将军
One is a Russian, another is a retired general...

264
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:26,206
那个老人?
What old men?

265
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,874
就是演父亲的那个啊
The ones for the role of the Father.

266
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,078
挡着我，瑟萨芮诺
Cover me, Cesarino...

267
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,316
往那跑呢. 布冯
Come here, buffoon.

268
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:38,520
你好吗? 看到你太好了，我的老朋友
How are you? So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

269
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,192
我叫了你6遍了 哦，我知道了
- I called you six times. - Yes, yes I know.

270
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:43,391
珂劳迪亚的剧本怎样了 嗯?
- It's about Claudia's script. - So?

271
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,128
我本想寄过去给你的
I thought about mailing it to you.

272
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,192
其实我已经寄出去了 是么?
In fact, I've already mailed it. - Really?

273
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,304
你看起来还不错 怎么不回去继续演戏?
You've still got your looks. Why don't you go back to acting?

274
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,773
我整晚都在设想关于宇宙飞船的剧本
I was up all night with an idea for the spaceship.

275
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,434
我们一起来研究一下如何
Why don't we make the upper story...

276
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,276
别碰我的胳膊，我不喜欢这样，穿上夹克
Conocchia, don't take my arm! I hate it! And wear a jacket!

277
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,375
和你说话还要穿衣服...
Now I need to wear a jacket to talk to you...

278
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,508
你好啊，旅途如何?
How are you? How was your trip?

279
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:05,554
很好，有一个小时了
Good. It's been an hour...

280
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:11,150
好炫目的布景，太美了
What a blinding vision! Beautiful!

281
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:15,792
是么? 嗯
- Really? - Yes.

282
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,133
你总是夸奖我
You're always telling me I'm 'bellissima'

283
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,431
但是还没说过关于我的戏
but you never tell me about my part.

284
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:24,398
拍出来效果如何? 当然好了，所以还是让你继续演
How was my screen test? - Great, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:30,705
他们说我该更丰满些，多吃点通心粉
They told me I have to look motherly and eat a lot of pasta.

286
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:35,173
再胖点，是这样么?
I should gain six pounds. Is this all?

287
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:37,444
看看，你知道的都比我多了
See? You already know more than I do.

288
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:41,048
你是作者，你该知道的比我多阿
You are the author. You should be telling me something.

289
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,285
这位女士该如何呢? 什么?
- What should this lady do? - What?

290
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,588
阿哥思尼!
Agostini!

291
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,561
打扰一下 酒店已经可以了
I don't want to bother you. The hotel is grand,

292
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,797
威士忌，太好了 我还有3个问题
the whisky, excellent. But I have three questions.

293
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,637
好好，等一下 啊，什么?
Yes, yes, later. What is it? Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.

294
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,574
阿哥思尼，我们应该...
Agostini, we should...

295
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:03,134
我不太想和他谈
I just didn't feel like talking to that guy.

296
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,244
珂劳迪亚全世界都有档期
Claudia is getting offers from all over the world.

297
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:09,449
我可不想让她一直等 给她点什么
I can't keep her waiting. Give her something.

298
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,645
你有剧本么 随便什么，或者什么设想
Do you have a script, a few pages, an idea?

299
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:15,657
珂劳迪亚知道这主意不错吧
Does Claudia realize that this might be a great part?

300
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:18,923
这个角色她最合适 我跟她解释一下
Perhaps the best she's ever played? I'll explain...

301
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,461
我从一个朋友的角度说，你会失去她的
I'm telling you as a friend, you're gonna lose her.

302
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:32,235
你想看看老人么? 你怎么了?我们已经准备...
- You want to see the old men or not? - Are you crazy? We're ready...

303
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,042
什么? 老人啊
What? - The old men.

304
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,236
在那里? 这啊
- Where are they? - Here.

305
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:39,140
斯格诺拉打电话来，说不想住那个酒店了
Signora Carla called. She doesn't want to stay in that hotel.

306
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,581
很恶心.她是对的 我该怎么办?带她过来?
It's ugly. She's right. - What can I do? Bring her here?

307
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,247
我会去叫老人过来
I'll call the old men.

308
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,515
我想给你介绍一下我妻子
Sorry, I wanted to introduce you to my little wife.

309
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:50,424
见到你好激动啊!
Thrilled.

310
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,954
她有时候也写作的.是个女性杂志的专栏作家
She writes too. She's a columnist for some ladies' magazines.

311
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,795
她有点问题想讨教一下
She's got a few questions for you.

312
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:01,359
我的读者们疯狂的追求浪漫
My readers go crazy for romance.

313
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:05,730
跟我说说你的浪漫史吧
Could you tell me something about your love life?

314
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,174
他们在这呢! 跟多特里打个招呼吧
Here they are. Say hello to the Dottore.

315
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:12,707
坐下，将军你也坐下
Step down. You too, General.

316
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,412
您的年龄?
- How old are you? - 70.

317
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,215
您呢?
- And you? - 64.

318
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,587
您?
- And you? - 68.

319
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:27,192
他们还不够老啊
They aren't old enough.

320
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,026
还不够?这家伙可都快不行的人了啊
What? This one has one foot in the grave.

321
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:31,363
下次我会带来三个特别的 您要得那种悲剧型的
Next time I'll get three corpses. You asked for a pathetic type...

322
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:35,269
保证让你一看就想哭的那种
This one makes you wanna cry the minute you see him.

323
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:42,142
你好，卡门多
Hello, Commendatore.

324
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,408
你跪下后，我该怎么办?
If you kneel, what do I do?

325
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:50,008
快起来，别伤了你自己 你好吗?小贵度
Get up or you'll hurt yourself. How are you, little Guido?

326
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:54,417
你好，卡门多
Hello, Commendatore.

327
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,720
我们做直升机来的，吵死了
We took a helicopter. This one screamed the whole way.

328
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:57,555
游泳池在那里?
Where's the swimming pool?

329
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:59,492
我们还没入住呢，别吵
We haven't even checked in. Shut up!

330
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,022
怎么样，治疗有效么? 有的
Has the treatment helped? - Yes.

331
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,290
这里感觉好点了么? 这是什么?
- Feeling better? Here. - What is it?

332
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:03,490
纪念币
Just a token.

333
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,396
你总是带礼物来
- You're always giving me presents. - It's just like mine.

334
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,729
干吗包起来呢
It doesn't need winding.

335
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,734
是块表，一块表，快来看
A watch! A little watch, everyone!

336
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:15,876
那么，你的思路该清晰些了吧 是啊，我觉得是
- So, are your ideas any clearer now? - Yes, I really think so.

337
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,413
我们找到美国人了...
We've got the Americans...

338
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:49,611
我见过她的证件，已经52岁了
I've seen her passport. She's 52 years old?

339
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,613
哦，还不是很老嘛
Ah, she's a little girl.

340
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,240
晚上好，西诺拉
Good evening, signora.

341
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:56,781
这是谁啊，亲爱的
And who are you, darling?

342
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:06,010
导演先生，我还有个小问题
Mr. Director, another little question...

343
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,527
他想知道天主教和马克思之主义之间的联系
He wants to know the relationship between Catholicism and Marxism.

344
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:16,896
谢谢你，我知道了
Thank you, I got it.

345
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,657
你想知道我的政治倾向
You want to know about my political affiliation.

346
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:24,100
作为一个诚实的人，所有象我这样的意大利人
As an honest man, and all of you ltalians are,

347
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,165
都可以回答你的问题
you should be able to answer me.

348
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:31,475
意大利人天生就都信仰天主教么?
Is ltaly an essentially Catholic country?

349
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,208
是啊，就是这样的
Yes, it is!

350
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:34,216
吃你的冰激凌，别多嘴
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

351
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:37,550
这是飞船的初步构想
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

352
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:42,520
我等会儿好好和你谈谈，面对面的
I need to talk to you later, face to face,

353
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,892
我一点思绪也没有了 感觉一点也不好
I'm at the end of my rope. This is a madhouse!

354
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:50,330
那我们还是以后再谈好了 你的胆库醇还高么?
Fine, we'll discuss it later. What was that about your cholesterol?

355
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,046
一个伟大的作家. 菲茨杰拉德（英国小说家）
...only one great writer. The early Fitzgerald.

356
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:19,288
后来他的作品变得豪放，有些兽性的现实主义
Then his writing became an orgy of pragmatism or brutal realism.

357
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:23,027
呵呵，比较矛盾的问题
What does Left or Right mean?

358
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,966
你这么个乐天派居然相信这些
You're such an optimist to believe that in a world

359
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,833
在这混沌的世界，也有人自认清高的
this confused and chaotic there are people so lucid

360
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:32,067
这些都是矛盾的象征
as to belong exclusively to the Left or the Right.

361
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:36,272
这就是美国人的思维
The Americans have this new theory about cholesterol...

362
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,347
你的冰淇淋还不错吧 嗯，好吃
- Is your ice-cream good? - Very good.

363
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,449
能不能明确告诉我，她有多少出戏可演
Could you say approximately how many scenes she'll be in?

364
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,523
什么?
What?

365
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:49,718
戏么? 5场
- How many scenes? - Five.

366
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,388
只有5场么?
Only five.

367
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,121
或许6，7个
Maybe six, or even seven.

368
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,858
晚上好
Good evening.

369
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:59,794
Hi，贵度
Hi, Guido.

370
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:03,301
大使在看夫人呢
The Ambassador's got his eye on signora.

371
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:09,833
怎么了?
So?

372
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,812
我想您应该知道这些 好的，我已经知道了
- I thought you'd want to know. - Good, now I know.

373
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,675
我帮您约她跳舞怎样? 去问问她吧
- Do you want me to ask her to dance? - Yes, ask her.

374
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:17,547
亲爱的朋友们，事实是...
Dear friends there's only one truth...

375
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:22,856
我是多么渴望知道，我得角色是什么
But I am so anxious to know, to understand my character.

376
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,520
电影开始前，我需要酝酿一下角色
I need to coexist with my character for a while before shooting...

377
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:29,723
夫人说想知道她能演什么
The lady says she needs to know her character.

378
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:36,798
我要加深对她的了解 她的想法，要不我会演不好的
I need to get inside her skin, her ideas, or I'll fail.

379
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,707
作家还没根您解释你的角色么?
Hasn't the Maestro explained the part yet?

380
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:42,369
还没呢 真抱歉，亲爱的女士
- No. - I am sorry, dear lady.

381
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:46,074
我还不知道那么多 我只是个制作人
I don't have such information. I'm only the producer.

382
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:50,283
贵度，你知道我的 对，您并不了解电影那些事
Guido, isn't it true that I know nothing? - Right. Not a thing.

383
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,358
可以休息3天了
And now three days of rest.

384
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:08,401
春天的樱桃，过来我们一起享受一下这春色
They look like glass. The first cherries of spring.

385
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:13,935
祝贺贵度么
Thanks. And for Guido?

386
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,875
马里奥，好好祝贺他
Mario Mezzabotta, all 200 pounds of him.

387
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:26,846
我们散散步如何?
Shall we take a little walk?

388
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:37,556
我知道...你认为我注定失败
I know... Naturally, you think I've lost it.

389
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:38,463
嗯
Yes.

390
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,695
我比她大30岁，可这不是问题.
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what? - It's all right.

391
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:46,071
我也许有点愚蠢，老的有点笨了 在她身上花费点，没什么
I may be the fool, the old imbecile, the one who foots the bill. So what?

392
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:53,649
能不能说点建设性的意见
Could you create something important, beautiful and real on a commission?

393
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:55,674
比如，就当教皇让你这么做
For instance, if the Pope asked you?

394
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:58,682
好吧，好吧，我会考虑的 失陪一下
Yes, yes. I'll think about it. Excuse me.

395
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,216
听着，我并不怀疑自己
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

396
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:06,752
她可能只是为了钱和我在一起的
Maybe she's only with me for the money.

397
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,253
事实上就是这样的
Actually, that's certainly it.

398
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:12,059
可我从来没这么爱过一个人
But I've never felt closer to anybody in my life.

399
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:17,269
看看她，美貌，迷人，又那么惹人疼爱
Just look at her. She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

400
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,767
她是女人中的女人.难道只是钱这么简单?
She has it all. Only for the money?

401
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,404
现在有钱的年轻人很多啊
But there are so many rich young men around these days, loads of them.

402
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,741
很明显，她很在乎你
It's clear. She cares for you.

403
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:29,411
事实上，她从未让我觉得不舒服
Right. And she hasn't tried to pressure me.

404
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:31,946
我可是个理性的人
I made up my mind rationally.

405
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,557
她也从未要求取代我妻子
The poor thing has never even mentioned my wife,

406
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,888
我的家庭，一点怨言都没有
my family, never a reproach.

407
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,525
你们怎么认识的?
How did you meet her?

408
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:44,457
在伦敦，她和我女儿读一个学校的
In London. She was in school with my daughter.

409
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,192
您结婚了多久了?
How many years have you been married?

410
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:49,100
很久了，有31年了
Many. 31.

411
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,803
聊聊你的妻子...
And your wife...

412
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:54,305
我老婆一点都不喜欢她，对她很凶
My wife took it really badly. She hates her.

413
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:58,407
格洛里亚，这种事总是要露馅的
While Gloria, poor thing, is fond of her.

414
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,016
你是不是认为我很蠢
So spell it out. I am a fool!

415
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,853
我们定下档期吧，什么日子
There must be a shooting schedule. Dates.

416
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:09,084
我们可以不用德国人的 还有其他选择
Otherwise we're off to Germany. We have other offers.

417
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:12,252
你会支持我到最后么?
Will you be leaving me in the dark 'til the end?

418
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,725
你看起来一点也不自信
You look like a little snail.

419
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:21,468
那里不自信了?
- What is a little snail? - Une petite escargot.

420
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,142
我已经看到希望了
Can you hear the voice of the springs?

421
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,743
罗马人说这是“希望之泉”
The Romans used to call it 'Happy Waters.'

422
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:52,861
玛雅，我们来吧
Maya, let's entertain these bores.

423
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:55,566
可以嘛?
May l?

424
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,908
准备好了么，玛雅? 我拿的是什么啊
Are you ready, Maya? What am I holding?

425
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:04,042
有绒毛的钱包啊
A velvet purse.

426
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:06,838
我说的是里面 一个白色手帕
- And inside? - A white handkerchief.

427
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,712
红的吧
A red one.

428
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,488
没有药吧 哦不，没有药的
- No drugs, I hope. - No, it's aspirin.

429
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,255
一个钱包 里面有钱嘛?
- A purse. - Is there any money in it?

430
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,495
2，725 里拉
2,725 lire.

431
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:26,026
这位女士在想什么呢?
And this lady here. What is she thinking?

432
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,165
我希望她可别想歪了
No dirty thoughts, I hope.

433
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,670
也许真的在想事呢
Just think about something.

434
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:30,966
那在想什么呢?
About what?

435
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,507
也许是讨你喜欢呢 你在想么
Whatever you like. Are you thinking?

436
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:34,704
是啊
Yes.

437
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:38,244
我真想再多活上100年
I'd like to live another 1 00 years.

438
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,914
祝你好运
Best of luck!

439
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:46,913
这位漂亮的女士戴的是什么?
And what is in this pretty lady's head?

440
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:48,320
我说是
Let me be.

441
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,622
我想起一个人么
May I think about someone?

442
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,388
说吧，小姐
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!

443
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:56,197
我不好意思说
Forget about it. I'm ashamed.

444
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,960
为什么?
What about?

445
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,725
我真的想起一个人
Can I really think of a person?

446
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:02,430
我不想让你知道
I'd be afraid to have my thoughts read.

447
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,472
别怕，亲爱的 告诉我没什么的
Don't you worry darling, no risk there.

448
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,337
我们还是走吧 有点冷了
Would you like to leave? It's cold.

449
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:09,639
亲一下换一个耳光 对么?
A little kiss and a big slap. Is that right?

450
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:15,572
亲爱的女士们先生们， 你们一定在想，“这个骗子”
Ladies and gentlemen, you're thinking, 'What a trickster.'

451
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,313
对不起，其实这里并没有什么玄机
Well, sorry to disappoint you, but there's no trick.

452
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:21,550
这只是个巧合而已
And it isn't just a coincidence.

453
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:24,057
同时也证明了异性并不一定相吸
It's an exceptional example of magnetic fields and telepathy.

454
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:27,391
我这就是我要告诉玛雅小姐的
I transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.

455
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,958
你，真的认为可以骗过我们?
You! Do you believe you can hide your thoughts?

456
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:43,139
请离她远点 别再坚持了
Please, leave her alone. Don't insist.

457
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,210
有些想法很奇怪的
Thoughts are sacred.

458
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:48,006
其实这只是个游戏而已
See, it's all a game.

459
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,276
玛雅，你准备好了么?
Maya, are you ready?

460
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,853
等一下，请告诉我先生们在想什么
Just a moment, could we know what you gentlemen are thinking?

461
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,182
那么就问问您吧
You for instance.

462
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:57,657
您在想什么?
What are you thinking?

463
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,694
还有什么?我的大导演.
What else? My director. My cross and my delight.

464
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,298
你好吗? 不错，你呢
- How are you? - Fine. And you?

465
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,899
有些日子没见到你了...好几年拉!
It has been quite a while... years!

466
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,993
哦，真是，天啊
Unfortunately yes, my dear.

467
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:11,368
等等，你现在很出名了嘛
Just a moment. You're famous now.

468
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,537
少来了 快点告诉我这里面有什么名堂
Cut it out. Just tell me what's your trick?

469
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:19,172
嗯，半真半假吧
Well, it's partly a trick, but part of it is real.

470
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:22,081
我并不完全明白，但就是象这样的 能变成别的什么么?
I don't know how, but it happens. - Can you transmit anything?

471
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,676
什么都行，除非她失手
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

472
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:27,317
想试试看么? 好啊，等等
- Do you want to try? - Yes. Wait.

473
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,586
我跟你打赌，这肯定行的
I bet now, with you, it won't work.

474
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:39,900
我不太明白.可以再来一次...
I don't understand. I can't repeat...

475
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:10,058
阿撒...尼撒...摩挲? 是这样嘛?
Asa... nisi... masa? Is this right?

476
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,292
对的? 就是这样
- Right? - Yes.

477
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:15,694
那究竟什么意思呢?
But what does it mean?

478
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:24,211
贵度，过来这 你在那呢?
Guido, come here! Where are you?

479
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,977
别被宠坏了哦!太奇妙了
Don't be spoiled! What a wonder!

480
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,380
我还不想洗澡，真的不想...
I don't want to take a bath, I don't want to...

481
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,940
是你过来...还是让我去抓你?
Come here... Iet me catch you?

482
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,416
我知道这流氓想干什么
I know what that rascal wants.

483
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,079
他想她的宝贝背着他吧
He wants to be carried by his sweetheart,

484
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:34,747
是他吧，那个猛男
doesn't he, the strapping lad.

485
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:37,792
来，过来
Come here. Come here.

486
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,192
他从来不想洗药浴，淘气的孩子
He never wants to take the wine bath, the naughty boy.

487
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:42,890
难道你不想治好，将来变成真正的男人么?
Don't you know that if you do you'll grow into a strong man?

488
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:46,059
贵度 是胆小鬼，贵度 是胆小鬼
Guido is scared! Guido is scared!

489
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:00,011
恶棍是要被诅咒的
The Devil and damnation!

490
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:09,750
奶奶，奶奶
Granny, granny!

491
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,554
今年的木头都受潮了
The wood is all wet this year.

492
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,424
这猫每天四处乱窜，跟你爷爷一个样
This prowling cat is just like your grandfather.

493
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,963
整天乱跑，只有吃饭的时候才回来
Always on the prowl and only comes in for food.

494
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,294
真可耻，快睡觉吧!
Shame on you! Go to bed.

495
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:23,767
上次我就让他吃了闭门羹
Last time I slammed the door in his face

496
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,966
整整两天不让他回来
and left him outside for two days.

497
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:32,069
嫁给他真实委屈我了!
I could have married again and found a handsome man,

498
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:35,206
我的条件完全可以找个比他更好的
rest assured, better than your grandfather.

499
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,710
我当年真是太笨了
What an idiot I am!

500
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,518
要是我选了第一个丈夫的话，无论在天堂
I thought that if I took another husband, my first husband,

501
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:46,493
还是在地狱，我都会比现在幸福的
whether in heaven or hell, wouldn't have waited.

502
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:50,522
安静点，睡觉吧，你们这帮小鬼
Be quiet! Go to bed, children!

503
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,986
奶奶，珂劳迪亚身上湿了
Nanny, Claudio wet himself!

504
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:25,192
这是干什么呢?快睡觉去 你也是，快去
What are you doing? Go to sleep. You too, sleep.

505
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,903
小贵度, 快进被子里去 外面冷，别乱动
Little Guido, get under the covers. It's cold. Be still.

506
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:41,776
你祈祷了么?
Did you say your prayers?

507
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:46,812
看你这漂亮的小卷毛，太美了
Aren't you a beautiful sticky bun? The most beautiful!

508
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:48,685
我也要亲一下
Give me a kiss, too.

509
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:51,726
你最喜欢的是我嘛? 对不对呀?
Who do you love best? Me? Is that right?

510
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:53,624
你骗不了我的
You can't fool me.

511
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,822
小心我打你屁股
I'm going to give you a spanking.

512
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:03,304
你可逃不过我的眼睛的
I can tell when you're pretending.

513
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:08,235
小鬼，好好睡
Sleep tight, little creatures.

514
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:10,505
合上眼
Close your eyes.

515
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:28,889
贵度，别睡了好么
Guido, don't close your eyes tonight!

516
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,398
今天晚上怪怪的，你不会害怕，是吧?
It's the night the portrait's eyes move. You're not scared, are you?

517
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:32,933
你必须要安静!
You must be quiet!

518
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,663
古丝那叔叔将会窥探那个角落，并且发现那个宝藏的!
Uncle Agostino will look into the corner and find the treasure!

519
00:43:35,737 --> 00:43:37,671
别害怕!贵度!我们会有钱的!
Don't be afraid, Guido! We'll be rich!

520
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:44,838
你记得那个咒语嘛?阿撒...尼撒摩挲... 阿撒 尼撒摩挲...嘘!!
Do you remember the spell? Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!

521
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,839
先生，有几个从罗马打来的 电话找您，我猜是您的妻子
Sir, you got two or three calls from Rome. Your wife, I think.

522
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:26,183
好吧，让我听吧.
Fine. Get me the line.

523
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,885
基诺，让这位先生听电话. 好的.
- Gino, get the gentleman the line. - All right.

524
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,916
给您!晚安，先生! 晚安!
- This is for you. Good night, sir. - Good night.

525
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,722
玛赛勒，那个从罗马打来的电话?很快啊.
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

526
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:50,509
这没什么?
No, I'm not offended.

527
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,178
让我不舒服的只有一件事
There's only one thing that offends me.

528
00:44:54,383 --> 00:45:01,186
你认识我.不可能
You know me. No.

529
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,183
我原谅了他所有的一切.
I forgive him everything.

530
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:16,604
我们少聊一会吧.
Let's have a little chat.

531
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:18,530
挨着我坐一下!
Sit beside me for a moment.

532
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:22,131
不行，我要睡觉了，我很累，并且我在等一个电话.
No, I'm going to bed. I'm very tired and waiting for a call.

533
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:24,570
你想要点吗?
Would you like some?

534
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:26,443
不，谢谢.我觉得头很痛!
No, thank you. I have such a headache.

535
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:28,775
把你的手给我.
Give me your hands.

536
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,417
不，还是坐下吧!
No, sit down.

537
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:36,049
我有的左手有治疗的功效.
I have a healing fluid in my left hand.

538
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,616
当我腹痛的时候，我就用它止痛.
I put it on my belly when it aches.

539
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,691
脱掉你的帽子.
Take off your hat.

540
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:46,860
好些了吗?
Is it any better?

541
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:52,900
嗯，好一些了.
Yes, maybe.

542
00:45:57,979 --> 00:45:59,344
你为什么那样看着我?
Why do you look at me that way?

543
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:04,613
哦，不要说我漂亮.那会让我会觉得是一种侮辱.
Oh, don't say I'm beautiful. You make it sound insulting.

544
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,450
你没事吧?
What's with you?

545
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:09,415
我不知道.
I don't know.

546
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:18,190
我觉得我的生活和工作中 一切决定都是错误的.
I feel I made all the wrong decisions in my life and in my work.

547
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:25,573
不要折磨我了，快说吧
Tell me, why do you enjoy torturing me?

548
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,207
折磨你?
Torturing you?

549
00:46:28,343 --> 00:46:30,709
像个朋友一样的说真话吧!
Talk to me as you would to an old friend.

550
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:34,239
我应该多了解了解导演
I need to feel close to my director.

551
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:42,448
你看了我上一部片子么，在贝尔格莱德的那部
Did you see my last movie, the one shot in Belgrade?

552
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:47,123
我的角色是个妇人 显的有些苍老的女人
My character was a woman marked by the injuries of time,

553
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:50,164
但是风韵犹存
yet still desirable...

554
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:53,732
来点 “神秘感” 虽然我并不知道那是什么
- Play "Mystification". - I don't know it.

555
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,600
但是可以演...
But yes...

556
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,535
太刺激了...这角色...
What a character... this woman...

557
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,568
可是...
But...

558
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,509
一个让人感到安逸和被爱着感觉
In whom people find protection and love.

559
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:08,446
我就是这样一个人 生活中和她一样的
I am this character. I am like her in life and love.

560
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:11,212
所以我感到很孤独
That's why I'm so lonely.

561
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,055
我总是原谅男人所作的不对...
And I have always forgiven everything in the man...

562
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,751
因为我爱他们.
the men, I love.

563
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:20,391
先生，罗马的电话 谢谢
- Sir, Rome on the line. - Thank you.

564
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,862
我很恶毒，贪欲
I am very sensual. Wicked, too!

565
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:24,899
对，对，就是这样的感觉! 我马上就回来
Yes, yes, you're very close. I'll be right back.

566
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,804
罗马的电话通了，您可以通话了

569
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:39,639

Feeling guilty, you beast? This is Rossella.

570
00:47:39,714 --> 00:47:42,547
嗨，罗瑟拉，你好嘛 陆纱在找我
Hi, Rossella. How are you? Luisa was looking for me.

571
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:46,644
你这次又跑那去了? 治疗?真会编...
Where were you this time? Your rest cure? What an excuse...

572
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,552
陆纱来了
Here comes Luisa.

573
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:52,056
贵度，我打过电话给你，你在那?
Guido, I called you twice. Where were you?

574
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:53,856
我刚知道，真对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

575
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,830
我在工厂这，在开工
I was up in the production office. We're working.

576
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:57,999
你还好么?
How are you?

577
00:47:58,066 --> 00:48:00,728
还不错...那治疗进展如何?
Not bad... And the treatment?

578
00:48:00,802 --> 00:48:02,929
有点作用了.
Is it helping?

579
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:06,804
也许吧，但是，你知道 我还不能好好休息
Perhaps. But, you know, I can't really rest.

580
00:48:07,008 --> 00:48:08,532
你呢?在忙什么? 过得好么?
And you? What are you doing? Having fun?

581
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,339
还是老样子.我和罗瑟拉在一起，还有 泰裕恩科.他们正要走呢
The usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, Enrico. They were about to leave.

582
00:48:12,414 --> 00:48:14,848
那你过得好么? 找到你的红颜知己了么
But are you having a good time? Did you meet anybody?

583
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,645
好难啊.我觉得不太可能了
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.

584
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:18,618
但是为了工作，只能这样了
But for my work, it's better this way.

585
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,813
晚安吧，贵度 晚安
- Good night, Guido. - 'Night.

586
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:24,657
你没和谁约会吧? 你总是这样一个人么?
You've met no one you know? Are you always alone?

587
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:26,057
就是这样的
Of course.

588
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:27,723
真的么?
Really?

589
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:31,561
陆纱，你来我这散散心吧
Luisa, why don't you come visit?

590
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,695
来住几天. 况且过来也很方便
Just a short stay. It's easy to get here.

591
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:35,999
你什么时候开始拍摄， 现在很无聊么?
When are you going to start shooting, you bore?

592
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:38,130
我还不知道. 还是让我和陆纱说吧
I don't know. Let me talk to Luisa, please.

593
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,772
那，我真的可以去么? 你想让我去么?
So, should I come? Do you want me to?

594
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:42,434
我当然想了
If you'd like to.

595
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,640
你还可以带个朋友一起来
You could even bring a friend.

596
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,941
这样好么?
But would it make you happy?

597
00:48:46,014 --> 00:48:48,346
当然好了，要不我也不会让你过来
Of course, or I wouldn't ask you.

598
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,608
先生，您还要继续通话么? 不了
- Sir, are you staying on? - No.

599
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:52,449
我该什么时候过去呢?
When should I come?

600
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,748
随时都可以
Whenever it's good for you.

601
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:55,255
小心咯，我真的要来了

亲爱的，那还犹豫什么，来吧

My friend here says... you can't make a love story.

651
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,496
住嘴 她说得很对

要我明早叫你起来么?

虽然有时候他们也胡闹 可是本质却不坏
They're always horsing around, but they're good guys.

658
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,122

Do you need anything, Guido? Is it a new idea?

659
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:45,625
有事要跟我说么
Do you have something to tell me?

660
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:47,490
不了，谢谢你，没什么
No, thank you, no.

661
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,291
快回去睡觉吧 我不需要什么了
Go back to bed. I don't need anything.

662
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:51,025
说吧，什么都行 真的没有了，谢谢，晚安!
- Anything at all. - No, thank you. Good night.

663
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,324
睡你个头
Good night my ass!

664
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:58,163
这怎么能让人睡啊 根本就睡不着
Who can sleep here? How can I get any sleep?

665
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,232
可卡尼亚，别生气啊
Conocchia, calm down.

666
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,635
快饶了我吧，我干这行30多年了
Allow me. I have been in this business for 30 years,

667
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,578
我拍电影得时候你还小呢
I've worked on movies you couldn't begin to imagine

668
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,479
我什么没经历过啊
and I have never been afraid of anything!

669
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,484
你胡乱发什么牢骚 老家伙!
What are you shouting for, you crazy old man!

670
00:52:11,386 --> 00:52:13,786
看，你终于说出来了，我老了
There, you've said it now. Old.

671
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:17,850
这才是你的心里话 可卡尼亚老了啊
Finally you've spat it out. Conocchia is old.

672
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,517
在这看什么? 快进去
What do you want? Get back inside.

673
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:24,989
你们总是蒙骗我 总是让我什么都不知道
You always keep me in the dark. I never know what to do.

674
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:29,433
对我指指点点得 我也不想烦你的
When to talk or when to shut up. I don't want to bother you.

675
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:31,505
我跟本就不在乎你的电影
I don't want to know what this movie is about.

676
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:34,631
你还想保密?随便你 好了，快睡觉吧
- You want to keep it a secret? Go ahead. - Please, go back to bed.

677
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:38,437
可是我还是象以前一样帮助你
But if I'm to help you out, as I've always done,

678
00:52:38,513 --> 00:52:41,505
你以前不是很高兴么 跟我分享一下好不好
and you were so happy then, you must tell me something!

679
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,847
提醒提醒我，不要再和那些法国女人在一起...
Tell me: get rid of the French woman...

680
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:46,887
我总是梦想着有搜宇宙飞船 让我自由得飞翔
this is how I want the spaceship... tell me: go hang yourself,

681
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,219
能不能跟我说说话啊
but do tell me something.

682
00:52:50,058 --> 00:52:52,390
你变了，贵度，我的老朋友
You've changed so much, Guido my friend.

683
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:58,326
你这是干什么? 别激动，你还是以前的那个你
What are you doing now? Crying? Aren't you ashamed?

684
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:01,061
我明天就走了 不干了
I'll be leaving tomorrow. I'm quitting.

685
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:04,400
我不耽误你了 你放手干吧
I don't want to be in your way. You need some young blood.

686
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:08,772
但是小心点，你可不是以前的你了
Just be careful. You're not the man you used to be, either.

687
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:35,160
这是批评还是鼓励啊?
A crisis of inspiration?

688
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:39,004
如果是不及格你怎么办?
And what if it weren't a passing one, my dear?

689
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:42,774
也许只是那个老头子骗你呢?
What if it's the final collapse of a filthy liar

690
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:45,641
没用的笨蛋，闭嘴
with no flair or talent? Sgulp!

691
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,307
就当什么也没发生吧
Let's say you are purity itself.

692
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,240
可他到底是什么意思啊
But what the hell does it mean to be really honest?

693
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,550
你听到法卡丝奥说什么了?
Didn't you hear what the Falcaccio said?

694
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:28,954
是时候放下包袱了 轻松的，清白的，放弃吧
"It's time to set all the symbols aside, the echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

695
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:32,956
那你到底需要什么呢
What is it you want then?

696
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,632
可能就是这个吧
Yes, this could be it.

697
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,378
城里有个博物馆 你是看门人的女儿吧
There's a museum in the town, and you, the guard's daughter,

698
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:58,248
从童话里走出来的仙女么
grew up surrounded by images of ancient beauty...

699
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:15,800
你说的对了
You're right.

700
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,403
我要永远留在这了
I've come to stay forever.

701
00:55:55,476 --> 00:56:00,106
我要重新整理一下 我要纯净的....
I want to create order, I want to cleanse...

702
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:04,948
我要重新整理一下 我要纯净的....
I want to create order, I want to cleanse...

703
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:16,819
喂?
Hello?

704
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:18,761
他们在找你 是旅游宾馆打过来的
They're asking for you from the Railway Hotel.

705
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,266
好的，转过来吧
Fine. I'll take it.

706
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:25,797
喂?你是...?喂?
Hello? Who's that? Hello?

707
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:29,777
贵度，我好怕 我有点水土不服了
Guido, I feel dreadful. The mineral water made me sick.

708
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,870
我发烧了. 快来，过来陪陪我
I have a temperature. Come. Come here, immediately.

709
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:36,041
已经很晚了 不行，我明天去吧
At this time of night? I can't. I'll come tomorrow.

710
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,274
来嘛!
Come.

711
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:39,615
这小可怜，她很想见你的
The poor thing, if you only knew how she was asking for you.

712
00:56:39,654 --> 00:56:40,814
这是冰块
Here's the ice.

713
00:56:43,825 --> 00:56:47,124
她烧的厉害.起码38度了 好了，这里有我
- She's melting. She's got at least 1 04. - Yes, fine. Just go now.

714
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:51,022
要我把豌豆拿过来么? 豌豆?
- Should I bring the peas? - What peas?

715
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,691
刚才她昏昏沉沉的时候说要豌豆
When she was delirious she asked for peas. It's a good sign.

716
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:56,532
不用了，算了吧
No, just forget about it.

717
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:58,469
需要什么，就叫我吧 好的，谢谢了
- If you need anything, let us know. - Yes, thanks.

718
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:10,782
卡尔拉，你怎么会突然发高烧呢?
Carla, is this the first time you've run such a high fever so suddenly?

719
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:18,918
不.这是怎么了?
No. It shoots up over nothing.

720
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:21,723
我会没事的 我丈夫都习惯了
Then it goes away. My husband is used to it.

721
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,991
他从来都不怕
It doesn't scare him

722
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:28,028
躺在床上，不要起来.
No, don't get up. Stay under the covers.

723
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,796
我很热，也很渴.等一下，喝点水吧，在.
- I'm so hot. I'm thirsty. - Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.

724
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,343
慢慢喝水，不然你会全身浮肿的.
Drink slowly or you'll get all bloated!

725
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:42,441
现在是白天还是晚上?你说什么啊?
- Is it day or night? - What are you talking about?

726
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:44,041
现在是下午四点.
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:47,179
听好，我们现在在等医生，听听它怎么说.
Listen, now we'll wait for the doctor and see what he has to say.

728
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,315
最好给你丈夫发个电报.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to send your husband a telegram.

729
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:54,019
我们不能对此全全负责.对，他应该知道.
We can't take full responsibility for this. Yes, he ought to know.

730
00:57:55,796 --> 00:57:58,822
不，我不想和你分开.如果他来了，他要带我带走的.
No, I don't want it to be over. If he comes, he'll take me away.

731
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:02,059
并且我已经带来这么多漂亮的衣服.
And I have bought so many nice little dresses.

732
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:03,933
慢点喝啊?
Why did you gorge on all that water?

733
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,870
有病的人才那样，你生病了嘛?
That's for sick people. Are you sick?

734
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,868
你总是准备好要狼吞虎咽一顿.
You're always ready when there's something to gorge on.

735
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:12,602
我也是没有办法啊?你总是丢下我一个人.
What else should I do? You're always leaving me here alone.

736
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:19,282
我两年前就想好了我的遗愿.
I drafted my will two years ago.

737
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,886
其实，立了遗愿也不会那么快就死掉的
Anyway, it's not like you die sooner just because you make a will.

738
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:29,195
你知道的，我还有一个哥哥，和一个妹妹.
You see, I have a brother and a sister too,

739
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:32,759
但是，我希望我的丈夫继承那个公寓.
but I'd like the apartment to go to my husband.

740
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,002
它是我的，但是我可怜的丈夫没有它可怎么办啊?
It's mine, but how would the poor thing manage with out it...

741
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:39,096
即使他再婚.
even if he does get remarried?

742
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,341
哦，这些可恶的被单!
Ah, these sheets!

743
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:50,877
听我说，告诉我那真相，真相，你知道我说什么么?
Listen, tell me the truth, the truth, you hear?

744
00:58:51,886 --> 00:58:53,979
你为什么和我在一起?
Why do you stay with me?

745
00:58:55,957 --> 00:58:58,585
我明天要怎么和那个教父说呢?
What can I tell the Cardinal tomorrow?

746
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:03,994
是的，我读过了你的制片人的大纲.
Yes, I did read the little synopsis your producer sent us.

747
00:59:04,065 --> 00:59:07,057
它真的是很生动有趣!我可是实话实说
It's very interesting. From a factual point of view though,

748
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:09,568
角色之间的摩擦很生动
the meeting between the protagonist

749
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:12,231
可是王子什么的就不太现实了
and a prince of the church could not happen during a mud treatment

750
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:15,798
象你说的 很抱歉，事实上不太现实
as you describe it. I'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.

751
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,276
一个高级教士拥有他自已的私人房间.
A high prelate has his own private room.

752
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,179
是这样，可是我再找一个非传统的背景.
True, but I was looking for an unconventional setting.

753
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:22,375
你指什么?
What do you mean?

754
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,248
这个主角得到了一个天主教徒得抚养，并且....
The protagonist received a Catholic upbringing and...

755
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,550
早上好. 阁下，这位是安瑟米
- Good morning. - Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

756
00:59:28,623 --> 00:59:30,181
你好.你一定是导演吧.
Nice to meet you. You must be the director.

757
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:31,350
是的.
Yes.

758
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:34,326
这部电影得主题是关于宗教吗?
Is the subject of this film a religious one?

759
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:36,124
嗯，是的.
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

760
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,031
象我说过得，这个主角得到了一个天主教徒的抚养，
As I was saying, the protagonist had a Catholic upbringing,

761
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:42,899
象每个人一样，他的个性也很复杂.
Iike all of us, for that matter. So, he has certain complexes,

762
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:45,872
他已经不能再压抑.
certain needs he can no longer repress.

763
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:49,333
教会的人帮助他
And a prince of the church appears to him like the depositary of a truth

764
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,776
神魂颠倒的他已经不能承受太多了
that he can no longer accept although it still fascinates him.

765
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:55,748
所以，他寻找帮助 或者只是些理解
So, he seeks contact, some help, perhaps a flash of understanding.

766
00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:57,644
大马士哥（叙利亚首府）的索尔么?
Saul in Damascus, right?

767
00:59:57,718 --> 00:59:59,618
我们不都是和他一样么
Don't we all harbor such hopes?

768
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,451
这构思也许有点肤浅，粗俗，可是我...
I do realize the idea might sound a bit superficial, gothic if you want...

769
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:04,286
不，真不是这样的
No, no, that's not it.

770
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:08,385
电影院不可能总是放映那几个单调的题材的
I don't believe cinema lends itself well to certain topics.

771
01:00:08,462 --> 01:00:12,922
你可别混淆视听，赎渎世间的爱情啊
You mix sacred and profane love too casually.

772
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,592
难道不是这样么? 也许是吧
Isn't that so? - Maybe.

773
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:16,933
你这反映也太强烈了吧
Yours is a great responsibility.

774
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:20,132
你可能成为前车之鉴啊
You can either corrupt or educate thousands of souls.

775
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:22,504
他可是很崇高的
His Eminence will listen to you all the same.

776
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,301
你可以问问他的意见
You can ask him some questions.

777
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,046
请允许我介绍导演
Allow me to introduce you to the director.

778
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:36,184
请，请坐
Please, do sit down.

779
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:41,261
从头说说 我不会介意的
Please pardon the intrusion, Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume,

780
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:45,425
我的制作人总是说让我来请教你 他是对的
But my producer is restless, perhaps he's right,

781
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:47,228
他还坚持说我...
and he insisted that l...

782
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:50,227
结婚了么? 是啊
- Are you married? - Yes.

783
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:53,265
有孩子么 还没有呢
- Any children? - Yes. I mean, no.

784
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,038
年龄?
- How old are you? - 43.

785
01:01:00,881 --> 01:01:03,349
听到鸟的歌声了么 你说什么?
- Do you hear this singing bird? - Pardon?

786
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,446
知道这歌叫什么名字么
- Do you know what it's called? - No.

787
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:08,146
这是 狄莫尼亚
It's called Diomedeo.

788
01:01:09,023 --> 01:01:13,187
狄莫尼亚的死造就了一个不朽的神话
The legend has it that when Diomedes died,

789
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,253
鸟儿们飞到一起 在他的墓碑前守候
all these little birds gathered and accompanied him to his grave

790
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:20,526
唱着哀曲
singing a funeral lamentation.

791
01:01:22,737 --> 01:01:25,103
听....它们像是在哭泣
Hear? It sounds like wailing.

792
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:05,404
贵都贵都，我们去看看吧
Guido, Guido let's go see the Saraghina.

793
01:02:09,617 --> 01:02:10,845
来
Coming.

794
01:02:44,685 --> 01:02:46,550
萨拉纪娜，跳段伦巴
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.

795
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:49,480
在这
Here.

796
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:41,227
丢人，太丢人了...
Shame on you, shame on you...

797
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,689
这次饶不了你了!
It's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

798
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:46,631
这不是真的吧
I don't believe it, it can't be true...

799
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:51,028
看着你妈妈，看着她的眼镜
Look at your mother, look at her!

800
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:52,766
妈妈! 别过来
- Mother. - Stop there.

801
01:05:52,940 --> 01:06:00,369
天啊，我好难过 你让我好伤心
Oh God, I'm so ashamed, so ashamed and hurt!

802
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:40,283
总之，在他的有生之年里
But above all, during his whole life and in any place where he lived,

803
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:45,314
这种感觉一直没有逝去 不愿意和任何女人接触
the pious Luigi most abhorred any talk or dealing with women,

804
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:48,190
就是这样，不管见到谁
whose presence he avoided in such a way that whoever

805
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:52,562
很自然的就想回避
saw him thought he had a natural dislike of them...

806
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:55,695
跪下!
Get down!

807
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:27,626
你不知道 萨拉迪诺 是个恶魔么
Don't you know that Saraghina is the devil?

808
01:07:28,402 --> 01:07:30,632
我不知道的 真的不知道
No, I didn't. I really did not.

809
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,027
这个情节有什么意义么?
So, what does it mean?

810
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:44,270
这个角色刺激了这个孩子的童年
It's a character inspired by your childhood memories.

811
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:47,446
这是良心的谴责么
No connection with a real critical conscience.

812
01:08:48,615 --> 01:08:51,641
不，除非你想挑起争执
No, if you really want to make a polemical piece

813
01:08:51,718 --> 01:08:56,587
你并不了解意大利的天主教，
about the ltalian Catholic consciousness, you would need

814
01:08:56,657 --> 01:09:01,754
你应该更深入的了解他们的文化
a much higher degree of culture

815
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:05,888
而且要无比的深入和透彻的了解
as well as inexorable logic and clarity.

816
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:13,230
请原谅我，可是... 你的天真注定要失败的
Forgive me, but... your naivete is a serious failing.

817
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,876
你的思乡情节太浓了
Your little memories, bathed in nostalgia,

818
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,038
这让人觉得你非常脆弱
your inoffensive and fundamentally sentimental evocations

819
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,580
你也只能这样了
are all the expressions of an accomplice...

820
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:24,515
“什么?” 和共产主义者?
"How?" said the parish priest, "With a communist?"

821
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:26,618
看看，他都没说是一个 “人”
See? He didn't say: 'a man'.

822
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:28,946
天地良心
Catholic conscience?

823
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,487
想想恺撒时期的政治家们
Just think what Suetonious was at the time of the Caesars!

824
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:42,231
你的初衷本是谴责，可是结果呢?
No, your intention was to denounce, but you end up

825
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:44,896
却像个同僚一样
supporting it like an accomplice.

826
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:48,333
我就说吧，这很不清晰
See? What confusion... what ambiguity!

827
01:09:55,749 --> 01:09:59,617
我可爱的医生啊，你让我又爱又恨
Dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!

828
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:01,654
你已经不需要我了
But you don't need me anymore.

829
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:03,553
这你可错了，大错特错了
That isn't true, absolutely not true.

830
01:10:03,624 --> 01:10:06,923
场景：洗澡和泥疗
1 27: showers and mud treatments.

831
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,654
场景：按摩
1 29: massages.

832
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:13,395
场景：走近
1 31 : inhalations.

833
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:31,917
你好，监督
Hello, Commendatore.

834
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:37,152
看，我明白了 你要说的是...
You know, I've figured out what you're trying to talk about...

835
01:10:37,224 --> 01:10:42,218
是男人内心的挣扎 这要表现的更清晰些才行
Man's inner confusion. But you've got to be clearer.

836
01:10:42,296 --> 01:10:45,527
你自己一定要十分清楚 要不就没有意义了
You have to make yourself understood. Otherwise what's the use of it?

837
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,169
我们走吧，贵都
Let's go, Guido.

838
01:11:00,213 --> 01:11:01,805
除非你能说服我
If what you have to say is interesting,

839
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,372
要不然每个人都会象我这么想的
it must be so for everybody.

840
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,913
你怎么能不理观众的感受呢
How can you not care if audiences understand?

841
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:12,049
真对不起，这样太专横自大了
I'm sorry, but that is arrogant and presumptuous

842
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:16,094
监督，我们去哪边看看
Commendatore, let's go over there. Inhale. Breathe deeply.

843
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:17,330
你好，贵都
Hi, Guido.

844
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,665
我给你占了个好位置
I've saved you a spot by the jet.

845
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,667
我早上去看飞船模型了
I went to the spaceship this morning

846
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,499
已经有点模样了
and it's already gone up 50 meters...

847
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:43,947
马里奥
Mario.

848
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:11,816
贵都，再说一遍，我们都在恭候你
Guido, his Eminence is waiting for you. I repeat.

849
01:12:12,652 --> 01:12:16,418
- 我们都在恭候你的光临
His Eminence is waiting.

850
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:20,522
快点穿上
Get dressed, quickly.

851
01:12:20,594 --> 01:12:22,755
教主已经在等了
The Cardinal is already waiting.

852
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:23,796
全都告诉他吧
Tell him everything.

853
01:12:23,864 --> 01:12:25,661
都认了吧，别再隐瞒了
Confess everything, don't hide anything

854
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:29,190
你要是还有时间，也跟我聊聊
and if you have any spare time just put in a good word for me too.

855
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:33,269
这可天赐良机，贵都 那可是教主啊，你太幸运了
It's a golden opportunity, Guido. The Cardinal! You're so lucky.

856
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,672
他能给我一切的...
He can give dispensations for anything...

857
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:38,506
记得我在墨西哥的婚姻么 帮我问问看
Remember my divorce in Mexico City. Get me my Mexican divorce.

858
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:40,011
他不会拒绝你的
He won't say no to you.

859
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,106
忏悔之前，记得跪下
And above all show you're devout, throw yourself down on your knees,

860
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:46,050
亲吻他的戒指，伤心的说，你要忏悔
kiss his ring, cry, say you've repented.

861
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:50,852
这样你以后就会心想事成的
Getting in their good graces means you can have anything you want in life.

862
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:52,158
听好了
Listen to me.

863
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:55,887
小心了，贵都，我们永远支持你
Careful, Guido. We're in your hands.

864
01:13:01,935 --> 01:13:03,835
你要珍惜这5分钟啊
You only get five minutes.

865
01:13:19,152 --> 01:13:22,178
你说的对，我并不开心
Your Eminence, I'm not happy.

866
01:13:24,591 --> 01:13:29,358
为什么? 你不需要这样的
Why should you be? That isn't your job.

867
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:35,301
我们并不是生来就快乐的
Who told you we come into the world to be happy?

868
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:42,833
圣经上说，人非圣贤
Origen says in his homilies: Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.

869
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:47,280
主可以帮助你们解脱
There's no salvation outside the church.

870
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:51,373
让主来帮你解脱
Extra Ecclesiam, nemo salvatur.

871
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:55,782
出了教堂你就会全部解脱
No one will meet salvation, outside the church.

872
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:02,455
主会宽恕你的罪过
Salus extra Ecclesiam, non est.

873
01:14:04,097 --> 01:14:07,328
主会宽恕你的罪过
There's no salvation outside the church.

874
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:13,631
有人会去天堂
Civitas dei. He who isn't in the City of God,

875
01:14:14,307 --> 01:14:17,936
有人会去地狱
belongs to the City of the Devil.

876
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:45,336
欢迎大家来参观这人类伟大的发明
Come see this great human phenomenon, the fakir Siva,

877
01:14:45,472 --> 01:14:47,997
它打破了所有同类的记录
who has broken all previous records...

878
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:52,204
有欧洲的专家来精心打造的...
our experiment is controlled daily by European experts...

879
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:22,002
20,000...22...23,000... 后面的女士们
20,000... 22... 23,000... and the lady in the back?

880
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:25,408
25,000 很好，有人出到24,000了
25,000? Very well, the bid is 24,000.

881
01:15:25,478 --> 01:15:27,275
还有没有人出30,000
Do I hear 30,000?

882
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:33,115
太好了35,000...40,000 加油啊，快要得到了....
Splendid. 35,000... 40,000. Going, going...

883
01:15:33,186 --> 01:15:38,624
最后一次竞价! 50,000 50,000块成交!
One more offer? 50,000, the bid is 50,000...

884
01:15:59,646 --> 01:16:01,773
你来多久了? 有5天了吧
- When did you get here? - Around five.

885
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,475
我去过酒店了，可你不在
We went to the hotel, but you weren't there.

886
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:05,984
你还好嘛? 好，很好
How are you? - Fine, fine.

887
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:08,945
你和谁来的?
Who did you come with?

888
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,582
罗瑟拉和恩瑞克，泰迪也来了
With Rossella and Enrico. Tilde's here too.

889
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:19,127
我的宝贝，你终于是来了 你知道么，看起来挺好
Good girl. You actually came. You look good, you know?

890
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,528
嗨，罗萨
Hey there, Rossa.

891
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:25,797
我们很久没跳舞了，一年?
It's been a year since we last danced together.

892
01:16:28,408 --> 01:16:31,275
陆纱，亲爱的，你对我很珍贵
Luisa, darling. You're my treasure.

893
01:16:31,645 --> 01:16:35,012
你能来我真高兴 永远都是
I'm so happy you came. It's always the same.

894
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:37,914
你一离开我就...
As soon you're away...

895
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:39,380
觉得孤单
You feel lonely.

896
01:16:39,686 --> 01:16:42,314
真的嘛?亲亲我好么 来吧
Is it true? Did you miss me? - Yes.

897
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,258
有谁不喜欢女士们的陪伴啊
You weren't enjoying the company of all these lovely ladies?

898
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,222
你通知他们了...
So you've noticed them...

899
01:16:49,296 --> 01:16:51,730
你走后我一直很难平静
No flings since you left?

900
01:16:51,798 --> 01:16:54,733
可怜的贵都，大男子主义
Poor Guido. And your famous virility?

901
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:56,864
看你笑的多甜 你喜欢我笑嘛?
- You smell so good. - Do you like it?

902
01:16:56,936 --> 01:16:58,164
这屋子里的人都为你黯然失色
You're so light.

903
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,268
你的作品怎样了? 有进展了么
And how's your project going? Better?

904
01:17:02,342 --> 01:17:05,834
哦，还没什么突破性的进展
Well, I don't think I've had any major breakthroughs.

905
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:09,771
这次碰到什么麻烦了?
But what's it about? What are you up to this time?

906
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:13,112
哦，我不该说这些的
Oh, sorry.

907
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:17,045
我没猜错的话，恩力克也来了吧
Listen, am I mistaken or has Enrico fallen for you?

908
01:17:23,863 --> 01:17:25,125
她很可爱啊，不是么
She's adorable, isn't she?

909
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,762
好!太精彩了!!
Bravo. Very good.

910
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,430
晚上好斯格诺拉 看到你太好了
Evening signora. So nice to have you here.

911
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:36,497
谢谢
Thanks.

912
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:40,479
麦斯，我们随时效劳 我们可以开始么?
Maestro, we're at your service. Should we get going?

913
01:17:40,547 --> 01:17:41,809
我来了
I'm coming.

914
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:43,778
我亲爱的，晚上你就知道了
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

915
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,081
看看一个制作人的疯狂
the depths of insanity a producer can fall into.

916
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:50,452
坦白说，我不想跟他握手
Frankly, I'd rather not shake hands with this one.

917
01:17:50,523 --> 01:17:53,549
她一碰你，就知道你想什么
The moment she touches you she knows what you're thinking.

918
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:55,821
这还能有谁?
Who else could it be?

919
01:17:55,895 --> 01:17:57,658
她是你的精神向导啊!
Your guiding spirit.

920
01:17:57,731 --> 01:18:00,029
我们有那么亲密么?
Haven't you reached that stage of intimacy yet?

921
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,864
我能介绍我的姐妹给你么 真可爱的妹妹
- May I introduce my sister? - Ah, the beautiful little sister!

922
01:18:02,936 --> 01:18:05,928
大导演，你很有吸引力嘛
You see the kind of women your director attracts?

923
01:18:06,005 --> 01:18:07,267
幸会幸会
Delighted to meet you, Commendatore.

924
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,037
我刚拍了一部核战争的片子
I just finished a screenplay about nuclear warfare.

925
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,670
只有你这样有胆识的制作人才能做到
Only a producer of your courage could get it made.

926
01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:15,442
这位漂亮的女士也是你的妻子么?
Does the beautiful sorceress belong to your harem too?

927
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:18,780
事实上是监制的
Iet's say I'm a sort of overseer.

928
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,149
现在好多了，有人开始帮你了
So are you any better? Has your isolation helped?

929
01:18:24,257 --> 01:18:26,316
你看上去确实好多了
You do look better. - Really?

930
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,627
嘿，开个玩笑.真的，好点没? 其实，还有点担心
No. Just kidding. Are you better? Actually, I was a little worried.

931
01:18:29,696 --> 01:18:31,425
你能让陆纱来，对她很好
It was good of you to ask Luisa to come.

932
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,227
只有让她来，她才能开心
The very thought made her happy.

933
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:36,826
如果你不坚持，我到是没想过要来 我来也没什么用的
If you don't mind I'd rather not come. My presence is futile.

934
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:41,169
快上车吧 不了，我还是上克诺斯雅的车吧
- Suit yourself. -No, my friend. I insist. Get in Conocchia's car.

935
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:43,399
开车吧，和劳拉一起
Sweetie move it, go with Laura.

936
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:45,637
你的老婆呢? 不知道，我也在找她
- Where's your wife? - I don't know. She was just here.

937
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,373
罗瑟拉，跟我们走吧
Rossella, come with us.

938
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:50,814
我有个很特别的故事要告诉你
Yes, I want to tell you a strange story.

939
01:18:51,384 --> 01:18:53,978
我的妹妹是个修女 很早就去世了
My sister was a nun. She died very young

940
01:18:54,053 --> 01:18:58,888
有天晚上，她的雕像突然变了个表情
and one night her portrait suddenly changed its expression.

941
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,721
来，上车吧
Please, get in.

942
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:03,388
好像预示着某种危险
Changed as if it wanted to warn me about some danger...

943
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,920
我做前面吧
I'll sit in the front.

944
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:08,627
几天后，我的叔叔说...
So a couple days later my uncle says,

945
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:10,259
我们去市场吧，孩子们
Let's go to the market, kid.

946
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:14,397
我觉得这是某种先兆
He drove an lsotta Fraschini... I was recounting a premonition...

947
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:43,227
你觉得是么?
So what do you think?

948
01:19:43,302 --> 01:19:45,566
听导演说话你得思维敏捷点才行
You have to be a little crazy to listen to this director.

949
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:48,100
少来了，胡扯什么
Bundle up. It's damp.

950
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,908
罗那多，你在那儿?
Renato, where are you?

951
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:55,974
这呢，监督
Here, Commendatore.

952
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:58,072
我们要准备好第20个
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

953
01:19:58,517 --> 01:20:01,509
跟我来，女士们 小心点，路不太平坦
Follow me, ladies. Careful. The ground is bumpy.

954
01:20:01,987 --> 01:20:06,253
我们得进度有点落后了 不是得，我们已经到70公里了
It seems to me we're a bit behind. - No. We're already up to 70 meters.

955
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:07,450
你说，陆纱这是怎么了?
Listen, what's up with Luisa?

956
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:09,926
她突然变得怪怪得 好像很紧张，害怕什么
She's changed all of a sudden. She's turned so nervous and angry.

957
01:20:09,995 --> 01:20:12,361
我想是因为看到你太激动了吧
I don't know. She was so happy to come see you.

958
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:14,023
你可能说了一些让她难过得事.
You might have said something that upset her.

959
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:16,159
不可能. 那么这又是什么?
- Never. - And what's this?

960
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:18,498
我对这个格外地着迷.
I find this extraordinarily fascinating.

961
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,165
这个模型很有层次感
This model will be superimposed on the structure,

962
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,470
有一触即发的感觉.
to create the illusion that the rocket is on the launch pad.

963
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:25,908
对嘛? 对的.
- Am I right? - Right.

964
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:30,009
这就是触发它的平台.
This is the rocket's launch pad.

965
01:20:30,082 --> 01:20:32,516
是整部电影的精华
The most important moment in the movie.

966
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:36,684
不许拍照. 就一个，监督.
No photos. - Just one, Commendatore.

967
01:20:37,522 --> 01:20:40,491
你丈夫现在在忙什么啊?写科幻小说?
What is your husband up to this time? Science fiction?

968
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:43,323
我怎么知道?你问他.
What do I know? Ask him.

969
01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:46,292
Giancarlo给他写了个非常美妙的关于火星人的故事.
Giancarlo wrote him such a beautiful story about Martians.

970
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:49,834
这个游乐园是干什么用的?
What is this amusement park for?

971
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:51,994
你根本不了解这需要多少的工作量.
You have no idea what a job this was.

972
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,369
没有一家建筑公司愿意接下它
No construction company wanted to take it on.

973
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,135
它整个都要修筑在沙子上.
It rests entirely on sand.

974
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:59,734
它需要多少的混凝土多少?
How much concrete did it take?

975
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:04,013
非常多!400吨.
Tons! 400 tons.

976
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:06,175
监督，如果你不介意
Commendatore, if you don't mind,

977
01:21:06,251 --> 01:21:09,152
我不想再爬楼梯了，我有点头晕.
I'll stop at the end of this first flight. I have vertigo.

978
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:12,150
八千万你可以至少可以买10座公寓.
For 80 million you could buy at least ten apartments.

979
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:14,920
有点华而不实，和他一样
It's a pompous shack, just like him.

980
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:18,588
你这女孩对你的导演姐夫一点也不客气啊
The little sister-in-law is not exactly tender with our director.

981
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:20,324
没准她看上导演了 啊?
Maybe she's in love with him. - With him?

982
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:23,094
我整天都在祈祷能有个这样的丈夫呢
I pray day and night that I'll be spared a husband like him.

983
01:21:23,335 --> 01:21:24,927
怎么? 还得爬楼梯啊!
What now? More climbing?

984
01:21:25,003 --> 01:21:26,595
我倒是很乐意背你上去
I'd be glad to carry you.

985
01:21:26,905 --> 01:21:31,399
这建筑可是花费不菲啊
When I think he made me spend 80 million on this structure.

986
01:21:31,476 --> 01:21:34,445
要是有个好的布景就锦上添花了
Wouldn't a well-crafted backdrop have been better?

987
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:37,713
布景?那一点也不新鲜
A backdrop! That's out of your grandfather's time.

988
01:21:37,782 --> 01:21:39,841
克诺斯雅，就这也花费了几百万么?
Besides, are they your millions, Conocchia?

989
01:21:42,254 --> 01:21:46,315
陆纱，冷不冷? 穿上我的衣服
Luisa, are you cold? Take my jacket.

990
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:48,325
没关系，我不冷
No, no. Thank you.

991
01:21:48,393 --> 01:21:50,156
那好吧，反正我们也快回酒店了
Anyway, we're going back to the hotel.

992
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:55,022
那里不对么?
Is something wrong?

993
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,935
怎么郁郁不乐啊
You've gotten sad all of a sudden. Am I wrong?

994
01:22:00,839 --> 01:22:04,138
我没有啊
No. I'm not sad at all.

995
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:10,711
首先开始的是地球的画面
The sequence starts with an image of planet Earth

996
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:13,979
然后看到是核爆发时候的蘑菇云
completely wiped out by a thermonuclear war...

997
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:17,848
贵都，见到你很高兴 真的
Guido seemed glad to see you, really.

998
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:22,223
...剩余的人类试图乘坐飞船逃跑
...and the spaceship, our new Noah's Ark, tries to escape, while the rest of humanity

999
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:25,058
到其他星球上避难
seeks refuge on another planet.

1000
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,622
十万，越来越多的人开始聚集
More than 1 0,000 extras, even 1 5,000, a tragic crowd.

1001
01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:33,462
电影里真的有这么壮观的场面么?
We're really going to see all this in your movie?

1002
01:22:33,772 --> 01:22:38,334
有个领袖开始大声喊着 他想吸引大家的注意
The prophet is raising his voice. He's decided to scare everybody.

1003
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:41,470
当然了，电影就要标新立异才能吸引观众
Why not? Don't tell me you also love movies where nothing happens?

1004
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,610
我的电影更是要这样
In my movie I have all sorts of things happen.

1005
01:22:45,584 --> 01:22:48,610
我尽量注入更多的元素
I'm putting everything in. Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1006
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:51,011
赛拉，过来这
Sailor, come here.

1007
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:53,114
你也会说美国话了?
What did you learn in America?

1008
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,786
不是，我不喝水 跳段舞看看，我给你安排点戏
No, I don't want water. Dance and I'll give you a part.

1009
01:22:57,095 --> 01:22:58,323
跳吧
Dance.

1010
01:23:06,504 --> 01:23:08,631
你这是怎么了?
What's up with you? What's going on?

1011
01:23:08,707 --> 01:23:12,108
罗斯卡，可别这么教训我了 让我一点心情都没了
Rossella, cut the big sister tone. It puts me off right away.

1012
01:23:13,845 --> 01:23:16,370
大导演先生，我打算给我演什么呢
Mr. Director, what part do I get?

1013
01:23:22,187 --> 01:23:24,519
陆纱怎么看我啊?她想干什么呢?
What does Luisa think about me? What does she want to do?

1014
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,956
我演什么呢?您想好了么?
What's my part? My part?

1015
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:28,250
别捣乱!
Go away!

1016
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:31,156
你了解陆纱的.她话不多
You know Luisa. She doesn't say much.

1017
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:32,856
我是她最好的朋友，她的话也不多
Not even to me, and I'm her best friend.

1018
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:37,128
我真的不懂她
I really don't know. She's lost.

1019
01:23:37,202 --> 01:23:39,261
今天这样，明天那样，从来都没谱
One day she says one thing, another day, something else.

1020
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,804
可是，她对你
Unfortunately, I think the only thing she'd like

1021
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:44,938
却从来没改变过
is for you to be someone else.

1022
01:23:45,277 --> 01:23:46,403
为什么?
Why?

1023
01:23:46,478 --> 01:23:48,844
这也是人之常情么
It's the mistake everyone makes.

1024
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:55,811
我看那傻小子是不是有点喜欢她啊
But that kind little fellow, is he in love with her?

1025
01:23:56,087 --> 01:23:59,318
你喜欢这样么，你的内心是这么想的么?
You'd like that, so your conscience won't gnaw at you anymore.

1026
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,988
你个混蛋
You're such a scoundrel.

1027
01:24:02,594 --> 01:24:07,691
可怜的恩瑞克，他好奇怪 可不是我一个人这么说
Poor Enrico, he's so awkward. Everybody's noticed.

1028
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:10,997
陪她走走，多顺着她点
He hangs around, listens to her, keeps her company.

1029
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:13,036
他人很不错的
He's a great friend.

1030
01:24:17,175 --> 01:24:19,006
我想我的思路还是很清晰的
I thought my ideas were so clear.

1031
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:23,745
我想做点真实的电影 不蒙骗观众
I wanted to make an honest film. No lies whatsoever.

1032
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:29,080
我要说的就就是...
I thought I had something so simple to say.

1033
01:24:30,388 --> 01:24:32,413
对每个人都有意义的
Something useful to everybody.

1034
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:34,821
能名垂千史的
A film that could help to bury forever

1035
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:37,757
这样的才有价值
all those dead things we carry within ourselves.

1036
01:24:40,432 --> 01:24:44,425
事实上，这样才能让我充满激情
Instead, I'm the one without the courage to bury anything at all.

1037
01:24:45,937 --> 01:24:51,375
现在我好困惑 这开关是控制...
And now I'm utterly confused. This launch pad to deal with...

1038
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:56,743
我为什么总是感觉不对
I wonder why things turned out this way.

1039
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:01,247
是那里出错了呢
When did I go wrong?

1040
01:25:04,122 --> 01:25:06,249
我无话可说了...
I really have nothing to say...

1041
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:09,192
其实我说还是老毛病
but I want to say it all the same.

1042
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:14,521
你的意思是，为什么救援队伍不来么?
And your spirits, why don't they come to my rescue?

1043
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,466
你总说他们有很多要对我说
You always said they had plenty of messages for me.

1044
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:19,465
告诉他们少说多做
Let them get to work!

1045
01:25:19,671 --> 01:25:23,266
我提醒过你注意自己的态度
I've already told you, your attitude is wrong,

1046
01:25:23,341 --> 01:25:26,003
你对他们太严厉了
Your curiosity toward them is childish.

1047
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:28,445
你总是要万无一失
You want too many guarantees.

1048
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:32,244
好了，他们到底怎么说的? 总是有麻烦事
- Fine, but what do they say? - Always the same thing. Even now.

1049
01:25:33,284 --> 01:25:35,912
他们做的也很好的 对你的需要也了如指掌
They're very reasonable spirits. They know you very well.

1050
01:25:36,788 --> 01:25:38,119
哪有怎样?
So?

1051
01:25:39,824 --> 01:25:43,590
他们说你天马行空 你也该有点条理了
They say you're free, but you must learn to choose.

1052
01:25:44,162 --> 01:25:48,258
你时间不多了，抓紧点吧
You don't have much time. And you have to hurry.

1053
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:55,402
贵都，你过来么? 到底来不来?
Guido, are you coming up? Yes or no?

1054
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:44,550
请到320房间来
Room 320, please.

1055
01:26:44,722 --> 01:26:45,916
没人在啊
Nobody's in.

1056
01:26:46,658 --> 01:26:47,852
好的，谢谢
Fine, thanks.

1057
01:27:30,969 --> 01:27:32,129
你头痛了吧
Have you got a headache?

1058
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,638
恩，吃了点阵痛片
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1059
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,600
常吃这个?
Do you take them often?

1060
01:27:38,343 --> 01:27:39,867
有时候吧，失眠的时候吃
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1061
01:27:43,314 --> 01:27:44,838
你就别担心我了
What's worrying you now?

1062
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:10,897
恩?
What?

1063
01:28:11,276 --> 01:28:13,369
没什么，你要好好照顾自己
Nothing. If you could only see yourself.

1064
01:28:14,078 --> 01:28:15,409
笑什么呢?
Why are you laughing?

1065
01:28:15,747 --> 01:28:19,274
我可没想过背叛你，就算我看不惯你
I don't think I could ever betray you, if only because I couldn't bear

1066
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:24,310
欺骗多么可笑啊
the ridiculous effort of having to hide and lie.

1067
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,654
对你来说太容易了
But obviously it's easy for you.

1068
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:30,916
听着，陆纱.我真高兴你能来
Listen Luisa. I am very happy you're here,

1069
01:28:31,396 --> 01:28:34,661
我已经精疲力尽了
but I am very tired and sleepy.

1070
01:28:39,037 --> 01:28:42,473
睡会儿吧，晚安
Sleep then. Good night.

1071
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:52,539
我不知道你怎么看我的
I don't know what you think my life is like, reducing it all

1072
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:54,881
变成别人希望的那样
to the pettiness of somebody stealing from the cookie jar.

1073
01:28:54,986 --> 01:28:58,513
你了解我什么呢?我的喜好你知道么
What do you know about my life? What I hate and what I don't.

1074
01:28:58,856 --> 01:29:00,551
我只了解我看到的
I only know what you show me.

1075
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:06,591
那我是什么样的?
What am I showing you?

1076
01:29:07,632 --> 01:29:09,031
说吧，你觉得我是什么样的人
Come on, tell me what you see.

1077
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:12,893
说说你的道德标准
You and your judgmental moralism. What are you getting at?

1078
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:16,837
没什么，我们好久没有倾心的聊聊了
Nothing. I know we've been stagnating for years.

1079
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:20,136
这都是因为你；你总是不让我说
But it's you; you're the one who always calls me back

1080
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:21,872
所以我们才没机会
and wants to start all over again.

1081
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,012
我只求你这一次，不要再重新开始了
Once and for all, I don't want to restart anything.

1082
01:29:25,483 --> 01:29:26,745
那该怎样?
But what do you want?

1083
01:29:27,285 --> 01:29:30,652
你要我来一定有原因吧 说说看
Why did you want me here? What good am I to you?

1084
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:33,651
为什么要我来，我能帮你点什么呢?
What are you trying to get from me? What is it you want?

1085
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:58,501
别烦，我昨晚已经去的时候已经找到她了
Don't fret. I'd already spotted her last night when I got in.

1086
01:31:07,485 --> 01:31:09,919
我没问，她也没提起
I've asked no questions, so don't say a word.

1087
01:31:10,088 --> 01:31:14,081
你就是要我听你撒谎来的么?
Spare me the embarrassment of having to listen to your lies.

1088
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:20,755
她长的真可爱
She must have been born in March or April.

1089
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:23,961
她一定是个白羊座的，典型的
She's got all the characteristics of an Aries. She's the Aries type.

1090
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:26,231
还是我来告诉你吧
I'll tell you what type she is.

1091
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:30,098
将来绝对是个可塑之材
Exactly the type most likely to make

1092
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:34,805
一个没有个性和主见的人
a good companion for feeble, spineless, confused men.

1093
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,871
陆纱，我不明白
Luisa, I didn't know.

1094
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:41,681
我和你一样，也是第一次见到她
I'm seeing her for the first time, like you.

1095
01:31:42,587 --> 01:31:45,351
真的，就像这里一样，很多人
Really, in a place like this, where there are so many people,

1096
01:31:45,423 --> 01:31:48,551
她处境也不好，不用很奇怪
it's no surprise to run into the poor thing.

1097
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:53,595
难怪你从昨晚开始就折磨我
So this is why you've been tormenting me since last night.

1098
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:55,590
你也应该说清楚嘛
You should have told me.

1099
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:00,898
最让我接受不了的是
What annoys me most is that people could think

1100
01:32:00,972 --> 01:32:02,735
人们认为我只接触有品味的人
I'd go with somebody who dresses that way.

1101
01:32:03,441 --> 01:32:04,772
你怎么知道她的品味的?
Have you seen her clothes?

1102
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:06,673
我们走走好吗
Listen, can't we go for a walk?

1103
01:32:06,744 --> 01:32:08,268
还是换个话题吧
Let's not talk about this anymore.

1104
01:32:08,346 --> 01:32:11,042
这三年来你总是这样 好了，够了!
It's been over for three years. Finished. Enough.

1105
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:17,986
你快让我疯了 他装正经的
He drives me crazy. He pretends he's telling the truth.

1106
01:32:18,055 --> 01:32:21,821
他的诚实都是虚伪的 觉得自己总是对的
He acts honest. As if he's the one who's right.

1107
01:32:23,361 --> 01:32:25,386
你怎么能接受这些呢?
How can you live this way?

1108
01:32:27,698 --> 01:32:29,165
这么活着多累啊
It's not right living this way,

1109
01:32:29,233 --> 01:32:31,633
对谁都没有句真心话
not letting others know what's true and what's false.

1110
01:32:31,702 --> 01:32:34,432
你能不能改变一下呢? 你到底能不能改改啊?
Is it possible that for you it's all the same? How?

1111
01:32:34,472 --> 01:32:37,805
你说的对，我是很乏味
You're right. I know, I'm boring.

1112
01:32:39,143 --> 01:32:43,170
这样的生活难道你不痛苦么
How sad having to play the bourgeois wife who doesn't understand.

1113
01:32:43,815 --> 01:32:45,908
那你说，我该怎样好?
You tell me, what should I do.

1114
01:32:46,117 --> 01:32:47,914
我其实不该取笑你的
I really can't laugh about it the way you do.

1115
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,953
亲爱的，我不是取笑你的
No darling, I'm not laughing.

1116
01:32:52,456 --> 01:32:55,050
你跟她说了什么啊?
What do you tell her?

1117
01:33:00,097 --> 01:33:03,498
最让我难以忍受的是，你把她带进我们的生活
What disgusts me the most is that you've mixed her up in our life.

1118
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:06,093
她知道我和你的一切
She knows everything about you and me.

1119
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:10,536
这婊子，真可恶!
That whore. Cow!

1120
01:33:13,678 --> 01:33:16,272
你的痛苦你自己清楚
You're a real pain, you know.

1121
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:25,587
还有...
And yet...

1122
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,542
斯格诺拉 卡尔拉，你唱歌真的很动听
Signora Carla, you sing so well.

1123
01:33:51,716 --> 01:33:53,479
那只是业余爱好罢了
No, I'm just an amateur.

1124
01:33:53,618 --> 01:33:55,051
你看上去还是那么迷人
And how pretty you look.

1125
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,121
我一直都想一睹尊容 真的
I've wanted to meet you for so long. - And l, you.

1126
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:07,588
你可真够时髦的了
You're so stylish.

1127
01:34:07,632 --> 01:34:11,762
不，你才是真正时髦的呢 我?事实上，很随便的
No, you're the stylish one. Me, frankly, I'm a bit trashy.

1128
01:34:11,836 --> 01:34:13,571
开什么玩笑，这再普通不过了
What are you talking about? This is so refined.

1129
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:14,469
你也喜欢嘛?
Do you like it?

1130
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:16,598
这是我在一个时装展览上找到的 是吗!
It's a little outfit I found in Vogue. - Really?

1131
01:34:16,641 --> 01:34:18,632
你要知道我可花费了不少心思
If you only knew how long it took me to find it.

1132
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:21,270
可你不知道，如果卡尔拉要是喜欢她就会...
But you know, when Carla wants something...

1133
01:34:35,026 --> 01:34:37,358
他到了!
Here he comes!

1134
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:40,192
贵都来了
Guido's here.

1135
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:42,725
晚上好，女士
Good evening, women.

1136
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,064
快关上门，外面有暴风!
Close the door, there's a storm.

1137
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:47,999
你还好吗?感觉怎么样?
How are you? Well?

1138
01:34:48,072 --> 01:34:49,801
礼物上都有你们的名字
Every gift comes with its nametag.

1139
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:52,505
别弄混了，这是卡塔锐娜的
Don't get mixed up. This is Caterina's.

1140
01:34:53,611 --> 01:34:55,135
他太可爱了
He's a darling!

1141
01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:57,677
这个是姐夫给你的
And this one is for my darling sister-in-law,

1142
01:34:57,715 --> 01:35:00,650
因为她越来越善解人意了
because she's finally understood how things should be.

1143
01:35:00,851 --> 01:35:02,443
我们这就给你放水洗澡
We'll draw your bath right away.

1144
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,351
格劳瑞，这就是你想要的
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1145
01:35:04,422 --> 01:35:07,414
谢谢.贵度，待会儿我想跟你谈谈
Thanks. I need to talk to you, Guido.

1146
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,423
我知道她想说什么
I know what she wants to tell you.

1147
01:35:10,494 --> 01:35:12,985
我们得把她支开了 因为她已经开始吃醋了
Now we'll have to send her away because she's acting jealous.

1148
01:35:13,264 --> 01:35:15,596
我们在楼上说什么来着?
What were you doing upstairs?

1149
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:19,602
我猜到她想说什么了 这个角色非我莫属了
I went to see those poor things. They'd always be alone, if not for me.

1150
01:35:19,637 --> 01:35:23,129
对她不合适，她根本就不适合演这个角色
The role doesn't suit her. She's only a common bourgeoise.

1151
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:24,401
她一点见地也没有
She has no class.

1152
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:27,103
让他安静会儿，他该洗澡去了
Leave him alone now. He's got to take his bath.

1153
01:35:27,378 --> 01:35:30,347
哦，贵都，我就是喜欢这种款式的 我做梦都想要一个呢
Oh Guido, this is splendid, I've always wanted one like it.

1154
01:35:30,514 --> 01:35:32,982
快点，卡尔拉，寒迪!拿着桶
Hurry, Carla, Hedy! Get the buckets.

1155
01:35:36,053 --> 01:35:38,078
贵都，我丈夫来信了
Guido, my husband wrote.

1156
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:40,953
他让我回去过新年 一天就行，你不会介意吧?
He wants me home for New Year's, just for a day, do you mind?

1157
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:44,092
除非你自己不想做 回去吧，没关系的
If you do, I'll tell him I can't. - I think that will be fine.

1158
01:35:44,428 --> 01:35:45,759
快来，卡咯塔
Come on, Carlotta!

1159
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,533
看看这位小姐 给你来点惊喜
- Who's that little black girl? - A surprise from us.

1160
01:35:52,603 --> 01:35:55,071
她是夏威夷来的，你不记得拉
She's from Hawaii, don't you remember her?

1161
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:58,798
你不是跟我们提过好多次了么
You told us about her so many times.

1162
01:36:04,015 --> 01:36:06,142
谢谢你，陆纱，你对我太好了
Thank you, Luisa. You're so kind.

1163
01:36:06,484 --> 01:36:08,213
这礼物好精致!我太喜欢了
Such a delicate little present.

1164
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,225
那个发卡是我的啊
That tiara is mine.

1165
01:36:17,294 --> 01:36:19,023
哦，知道 我看看就给你
Yes, I know. I'll give it back to you later.

1166
01:36:21,565 --> 01:36:22,827
哦，亲爱的
Oh, darling!

1167
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:25,627
看到你好高兴
What a thrill to find you here.

1168
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:27,902
你好吗! 好
- How are you? - Fine.

1169
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:32,331
还没告诉我你是谁呢
But do tell me, who are you?

1170
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:35,402
名字并不重要，我只是相见见你
The name doesn't matter. I'm happy to be here.

1171
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:38,341
可别再问我问题了，我留下好吗?
Don't ask me any questions. - Can I stay?

1172
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:42,580
当然了，你这么可爱，留下吧 我现在有点忙.
Of course, you pretty thing. I'm busy now.

1173
01:36:42,653 --> 01:36:44,280
待会儿再聊吧
But later?

1174
01:36:47,058 --> 01:36:49,219
罗瑟拉? 你在这干吗啊?
Rossella? What are you doing here?

1175
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,894
当然是来当女主角的啊 你同意嘛?
Playing Pinocchio's wise cricket. Do you mind?

1176
01:36:51,962 --> 01:36:53,224
是什么让你这么开心啊?
No. But why are you laughing?

1177
01:36:53,297 --> 01:36:55,731
没什么啊.我只是想看看你在这如何风流
It's nothing. I just want to see how you get out of this one.

1178
01:36:56,233 --> 01:36:59,760
你总是生活在花丛中 我的王子
You've finally got your harem, King Solomon!

1179
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,667
那都是过去的事了 一直都是吧
- It was high time. - Sure was.

1180
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,805
等我下来
Lower me down.

1181
01:37:08,112 --> 01:37:11,343
你胆子好大哦
Aren't you a little scared?

1182
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:13,483
有什么可怕的啊?
Of what? Everything is going great.

1183
01:37:13,884 --> 01:37:15,408
我也能留下嘛?我玩的好开心哦
Can I stay too? I'm having such fun.

1184
01:37:15,453 --> 01:37:17,717
我不会添麻烦的，只要看着你就足够了
I don't want anything. I'll just watch you.

1185
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:19,949
我们有规定，这样是不行的
We have rules that must be respected. Do you know that?

1186
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:21,116
过来，帮我拉一下
Come, help me.

1187
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:27,630
这可是份贵重的礼物哦
It's a two piece suit with a busby in ostrich feathers. Do you like it?

1188
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:30,523
嗨，亨迪，你好漂亮
Hi Hedy, it's beautiful.

1189
01:37:31,702 --> 01:37:33,294
有什么规矩呢?
So, what are the rules?

1190
01:37:33,637 --> 01:37:36,572
还不清楚，不过导演答应个角色，而且还有
I don't know. He promised me a part in his movie and said

1191
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,608
我要不停的换漂亮衣服
I'd have to change dresses a lot.

1192
01:37:43,948 --> 01:37:46,610
行了，姑娘们，快让我出来吧
Girls, that's enough. Get me out.

1193
01:37:48,486 --> 01:37:51,114
格劳瑞，爽身粉给我 好的，来了
- Gloria, the talcum powder. - Ah, yes.

1194
01:37:53,824 --> 01:37:56,190
贵都，你知道嘛，她给你准备了你最喜欢的
Guido, do you know she prepared something just the way you like it?

1195
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,524
那是什么? 蛋糕啊
- Really? - A cake.

1196
01:37:58,596 --> 01:38:00,860
你快乐嘛，我的姑娘
- Are you happy, girls? - Of course!

1197
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:02,893
这不就是你一直说要的嘛
Isn't this just what you always wanted?

1198
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:06,232
就是这个了!世界上最美的孩子
Certainly! Isn't he the best kid in the world?

1199
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:08,504
纳迪，快拿爽身粉过来
Nadine, hurry up with the powder!

1200
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:11,902
哦，纳迪，这就是你在哥本哈根说得
Oh Nadine, what was it you used to say in Copenhagen?

1201
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,609
欢迎我们的客人
We're delighted to invite our passengers

1202
01:38:14,678 --> 01:38:17,806
和我们一起度过这美好的哥本哈根夜晚
to spend the night in Copenhagen due to a problem with the motor.

1203
01:38:17,982 --> 01:38:20,644
多么美好的声音啊
Just listen to her voice...

1204
01:38:20,718 --> 01:38:23,346
制作组会买单的
The company will cover all expenses.

1205
01:38:23,687 --> 01:38:25,780
大家好好睡吧
Good night to you all.

1206
01:38:32,396 --> 01:38:34,523
马德林，帮我一下
Madeleine, come help us.

1207
01:38:34,732 --> 01:38:37,792
撒拉都 在这呢，我来照顾贵都好了
- Saraghina! - Here I am. I'll carry Guido.

1208
01:38:37,868 --> 01:38:41,304
可怜的人，水很烫吧，他都烫红了
Oh, my poor man. The water was scalding. He's turned all red!

1209
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:45,536
噢，好健壮的腿啊 真是太吸引人了
- Such nice, thin legs. - Straight like when he was a boy.

1210
01:38:45,609 --> 01:38:48,271
他总是表现的那么天真 可是内心却很丰富
He likes to act like a kid, but he's really very complex.

1211
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:50,939
别傻了.我太了解他了 一个伪君子罢了
Don't be fooled. I'm onto him. He's a hypocrite.

1212
01:38:51,015 --> 01:38:52,448
不是这样的
No, he's not.

1213
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:54,347
可他从来不跟我们讲真话
But why does he have to tell everything to anybody?

1214
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:56,613
他知道怎么处理这些事的
He knows how to stand up for himself.

1215
01:38:57,054 --> 01:38:59,522
贵都，你也不帮帮我
Guido, help me.

1216
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:00,921
这是谁在喊叫?
Who's screaming like that?

1217
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:03,425
杰奎琳，她不愿意上楼去陪那个老头
Jacqueline. She refuses to go upstairs with the old ones,

1218
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:06,395
我们把她关进地窖里去了
so we've locked her in the cellar.

1219
01:39:06,463 --> 01:39:10,092
简直是侮蔑!我可不原和这些婆娘说话
It's scandalous. I don't want to have to speak to those witches,

1220
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:15,002
他太老了，而我才26啊
so much older than me. I'm 26. Go to the Paris public register.

1221
01:39:15,773 --> 01:39:21,871
杰奎琳，今年才26， 生于1938年7月1日
Jacqueline Bon Bon, 26, the 4th of July 1 938.

1222
01:39:22,313 --> 01:39:24,804
你凭什么让我走?
You have no right to send me upstairs.

1223
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:29,346
还没年轻着呢 看看我，浑身都是青春的活力
It's not my time yet. Look, I'm so agile. Look at my legs.

1224
01:39:30,254 --> 01:39:33,553
你们谁的腿象我的一样有弹性?
Which one of you has such a tight little ass? Look at my chest.

1225
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:38,853
贵都，不要让我上楼嘛 我不要上去
Guido, don't send me upstairs. I don't want to go upstairs.

1226
01:39:39,897 --> 01:39:43,333
规矩就是规矩，上去吧
You know the rules. The rules are the rules.

1227
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:43,991
贵都, 我....
Guido l...

1228
01:39:44,134 --> 01:39:47,262
安静点，其实楼上不是很好么
Calm down. Apparently it's nice upstairs, too.

1229
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:50,332
给你个耳环好了 这还差不多
- Your earring. Here. - Thank you.

1230
01:39:52,843 --> 01:39:57,678
你一直这么爱我的，就让我多呆会儿吧
You've always loved me. Please, tell him to give me an extension.

1231
01:39:57,848 --> 01:40:00,510
贵都，我们就给她个例外吧
Guido, couldn't we give her an extension?

1232
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:03,075
小心点，你压到我了
What are you doing? You're breaking my balls too?

1233
01:40:03,153 --> 01:40:06,680
求求你了，一年就这一次么
I beg you Guido, just for one year.

1234
01:40:06,757 --> 01:40:09,692
不行 我是不会上楼去的
- No extension. - I'm not going upstairs.

1235
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,455
你说什么? 我不要上楼去!
- What did you say? - I'm not going upstairs.

1236
01:40:11,528 --> 01:40:14,019
你敢再说一遍!
- Say it again if you dare. - I'm not going upstairs!

1237
01:40:14,098 --> 01:40:17,363
她疯了，我就早说不该让她来的
This one is crazy. I told you we should never have let her in.

1238
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:20,193
你，看看你的合约
Hey, girl! Just look at your rulebook.

1239
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:22,967
凡是到了年龄的，必须要上楼去的
Whoever passes the age limit shall be removed to the upper floors,

1240
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,031
你也能不例外!
where she shall be treated equally well,

1241
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:26,940
凭什么她就可以搞特殊
but shall live basking in her memories.

1242
01:40:26,977 --> 01:40:29,241
这很荒诞，我们为什么要接受呢
It's so disgusting, absurd, we shouldn't have accepted it.

1243
01:40:29,313 --> 01:40:31,577
不可能，必须遵守
Never, right from the start.

1244
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:37,420
这本来就不公平!
It's not fair!

1245
01:40:38,055 --> 01:40:40,114
规矩定了就必须遵守
These are rules invented by someone

1246
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:44,752
没有遵守规矩的人
who doesn't pass the test himself.

1247
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:47,996
根本就是个耻辱
In France such a man would be the shame of the nation.

1248
01:40:48,065 --> 01:40:50,192
榨完了油水就想甩了，是么
Are we lemons to thrown out after we're squeezed?

1249
01:40:50,267 --> 01:40:52,861
贵都，她们说得没错 你就是个禽兽
- Guido, they're so right. - You're a monster.

1250
01:40:55,873 --> 01:40:58,307
是时候了
Our time has come!

1251
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,707
杰奎琳是对的，我们要争取自由
Hurray for Jacqueline, who has shown us the way to our freedom.

1252
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:02,939
打倒这个负心的男人!
Down with the tyrant, down with Bluebeard!

1253
01:41:03,614 --> 01:41:06,583
我们有被爱的权利，哪怕我们老了也有!
We have the right to be loved 'til we're 70 years old.

1254
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:10,847
打倒他!
Down with him!

1255
01:41:11,322 --> 01:41:13,256
你以为你是谁? 你很年轻么?
And what do you think you are? A boy?

1256
01:41:13,324 --> 01:41:15,884
让我们再说一遍，他跟本不会享受性爱
Let's say it once and for all, he doesn't know how to make love.

1257
01:41:16,327 --> 01:41:18,386
根本就不会
That's the truth.

1258
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:20,258
不懂得怜香惜玉，不理会我们感受的人
- And he falls asleep right away. - I don't sleep. I think.

1259
01:41:20,331 --> 01:41:23,391
贵都，我们老了就都不要了，是么
Guido, don't send us upstairs when we get old.

1260
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:25,802
打倒他!打倒他!
Down, down.

1261
01:41:27,771 --> 01:41:30,262
来吧，让我们推翻他吧
Quick! They're rebelling upstairs too.

1262
01:41:34,945 --> 01:41:37,812
哦，太好了
Oh, delicious!

1263
01:41:38,849 --> 01:41:43,946
你这个狼心狗肺得，骗子!我从巴黎特地 赶来，我的戏呢?
You pig, you liar. I came all the way from Paris. What's my part?

1264
01:41:50,594 --> 01:41:52,858
贵都，没人再给你演了 这样你开心了吧
Guido, who will dance for you? You liked it so much.

1265
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,591
我现在不喜欢这样了
I don't like it anymore.

1266
01:41:55,232 --> 01:41:56,859
陆纱，别走，帮帮我
Luisa, help me!

1267
01:41:57,101 --> 01:41:59,160
对不起，我不该干涉你的事
Sorry, but I don't meddle in my husband's business.

1268
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:02,303
如果他觉得这么做好，我就会支持他 这是早就定好了的
If this is his decision, it's good. Those are the rules.

1269
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:04,864
快点，贵都，洗澡水凉了
Hurry up Guido, the soup's getting cold.

1270
01:42:05,109 --> 01:42:06,576
看不到我正焦头烂额么
Can't you see I'm busy?

1271
01:42:07,745 --> 01:42:09,440
他可真是与众不同啊
What an extraordinary man.

1272
01:42:09,513 --> 01:42:11,037
是啊，却...
Yes, but...

1273
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,682
他已经习惯这样了，每晚都是
He needs to act this way. He does it almost every night.

1274
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,182
贵都，你还记得我么?
Guido, do you remember me?

1275
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,690
亲爱的，让你受惊吓了 我会给你温暖的
But darling, you're wounded; I'll get you some cream...

1276
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,318
我只想要你的安慰
- I don't want any cream. - Some balm.

1277
01:42:24,395 --> 01:42:26,226
我只想你安慰安慰我
- I don't want any balm. - Drops...

1278
01:42:26,463 --> 01:42:28,829
他是不会抛弃你的
It's not true that he dumps you like squeezed lemons.

1279
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:30,958
他会一直留你在身边的
Actually, he'd like to keep you all with him always.

1280
01:42:31,034 --> 01:42:33,127
他真的很有风度
He is too good, too patient.

1281
01:42:38,275 --> 01:42:40,004
我，不会留下我的
No, not me, no.

1282
01:42:58,262 --> 01:43:01,629
他不喜欢你了，你已经不年轻了
He doesn't like you. You're old.

1283
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:06,761
亲爱的杰奎琳，我们只想要一个机会就够了
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy to have had the opportunity

1284
01:43:06,837 --> 01:43:10,603
只要和你在一起，能在楼上也很满足了
to live with you and we wish you the best of luck upstairs.

1285
01:43:11,008 --> 01:43:13,636
我们代表贵都向你保证
We'd like to reassure you on Guido's behalf

1286
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,769
你会第一个在他的片子里出演的
that you were the first showgirl in his life.

1287
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:20,048
你现在就可以尽情唱歌跳舞了
You're now entitled to a song and dance of your choice,

1288
01:43:20,117 --> 01:43:22,950
就在这聚光灯下
with your very own spotlight.

1289
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:26,248
姑娘们，谢谢你们，你们对我太好了
Thank you girls, you're so kind.

1290
01:43:26,323 --> 01:43:28,621
我来唱支情歌吧
Would you like me to sing a love song?

1291
01:43:29,026 --> 01:43:31,620
来点性感的 好啊，性感的我最在行了
No, better something sexy. That was my specialty.

1292
01:43:31,995 --> 01:43:34,828
贵都，记得意大利最大的阿波罗电影院么
Guido, remember the Apollo theater in Bologna?

1293
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:35,922
当然了
Yes, I do.

1294
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:37,864
还是来首欢快的歌曲吧
No, better a happy song!

1295
01:43:45,275 --> 01:43:47,505
哦，我的项链掉了
Oh, I've lost my pearls.

1296
01:43:57,921 --> 01:43:59,582
哦，再来一次
Oh, again!

1297
01:44:08,265 --> 01:44:10,028
你听都不听
You're not even listening.

1298
01:44:25,749 --> 01:44:26,773
再见了，贵都
Farewell, Guido.

1299
01:44:57,481 --> 01:45:00,075
这太好笑了
I thought it was such a funny situation,

1300
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:03,879
整部片子的精华都在这了
the funniest part of my story.

1301
01:45:04,621 --> 01:45:07,715
我有点话想跟大家说
I'd even prepared a little speech to give at the table:

1302
01:45:09,293 --> 01:45:15,254
亲爱的，快乐永远属于最真实的人们
Darlings, happiness is being able to tell the truth

1303
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:17,493
真诚会带给大家幸福
without ever making anybody suffer.

1304
01:45:18,635 --> 01:45:21,331
下面卡尔拉准备弹提琴给我们听
Carla would have played the harp, as on any night,

1305
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:24,430
相信你们会喜欢的
and we would have been happy hiding in here,

1306
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:27,869
在那遥远的地方.献给所有人
far away from the world. All of you and l.

1307
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:35,207
你怎么了，为什么悲伤?
What's wrong? Why this sadness?

1308
01:45:35,719 --> 01:45:38,688
看，他也觉得空虚了
See? We've made him feel guilty.

1309
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:50,732
不是这样吧，贵都
That's not it, Guido.

1310
01:45:50,801 --> 01:45:52,359
这个夜晚太美好了
It has been a wonderful evening.

1311
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:53,869
你怎么可以伤心呢
You mustn't be sad.

1312
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:57,165
你来点什么喝的?
Do you need anything?

1313
01:46:01,545 --> 01:46:06,448
她们待会儿都会睡了 我还要收拾一下
Now they'll all go to bed and I still have a lot to do:

1314
01:46:08,418 --> 01:46:16,883
洗衣服，刷碗，还要擦地板
the laundry, all the dishes, mend the sheets, scrub the floors

1315
01:46:17,628 --> 01:46:20,096
然后还要准备明天的早餐
and set up breakfast for tomorrow.

1316
01:46:26,903 --> 01:46:29,371
我们大家住在一起不是很好么
Aren't we fine living all together this way?

1317
01:46:31,642 --> 01:46:34,543
起先我也不太理解
At first I didn't understand,

1318
01:46:35,579 --> 01:46:38,480
可事实都已经这样了
that this is the way things are meant to be.

1319
01:46:39,182 --> 01:46:41,241
现在已经...
But now...

1320
01:46:41,418 --> 01:46:44,387
你看我不是很好么? 我不会给你添麻烦了
Don't you think I'm good now? I don't bother you anymore.

1321
01:46:44,454 --> 01:46:45,944
我不会再问你问题了
I don't ask questions.

1322
01:46:49,826 --> 01:46:54,559
有点晚了 20年了，我才明白
A bit slow, wasn't l? It's taken me 20 years to understand.

1323
01:46:55,132 --> 01:46:59,228
我都结婚20年了，才有今天
20 years since the day we got married

1324
01:47:01,038 --> 01:47:04,201
你是我的丈夫，我是你的妻子
and you became my husband and I your wife.

1325
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:09,312
你还记得么，记得我们结婚那天么
Do you remember Guido? Do you remember that day?

1326
01:47:12,382 --> 01:47:15,545
如果你再多一点耐心
If you could only be patient a little longer, Luisa.

1327
01:47:16,653 --> 01:47:18,450
你可能早就明白了
But perhaps you've had it.

1328
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:23,182
事实上，我真的想听听更多的意见
Frankly, I'd love to be able to offer a word of advice.

1329
01:47:23,593 --> 01:47:25,857
可是今晚，你全部都解决了
But I think tonight you're called

1330
01:47:25,929 --> 01:47:30,161
事实上根本就没有答案
to solve a problem for which there is no solution.

1331
01:47:30,233 --> 01:47:33,600
给每个人都找到一个位置
Finding a precise face for a crowd of characters

1332
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:37,731
有的人生是那么肤浅，平淡，乏味!
that in your script are so rough, so vague, so superficial...

1333
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:40,342
我们看的是什么片子?
What is it we're watching?

1334
01:47:40,844 --> 01:47:42,175
我不知道，只是个片断吧
I don't know... screen tests.

1335
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,640
你觉得不好么
You're not well.

1336
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:46,478
完全相反，我觉得还不错
Quite the contrary.

1337
01:47:52,856 --> 01:47:55,484
阿哥斯蒂娜，走段猫步再加上点舞蹈
Agostini, get on the catwalk and do a little dance for us.

1338
01:47:55,559 --> 01:47:58,187
我用钢琴给你伴奏
I'll accompany you on the piano.

1339
01:47:58,995 --> 01:48:00,826
听这段， “孤独的岁月
Listen here. "The solitary ego

1340
01:48:00,897 --> 01:48:03,866
一直在重复，从不间断，
that revolves around itself and feeds upon itself, ends up

1341
01:48:03,934 --> 01:48:06,732
结局总是哭泣，或者狂笑”
strangled by a great cry or a great laugh."

1342
01:48:07,104 --> 01:48:10,665
这段是他在意大利流浪的时候写的
Words that Stendhal wrote during his stay in ltaly.

1343
01:48:10,974 --> 01:48:14,137
如果我们再多一点点幻想
If we sometimes read those sayings on chocolate wrappers

1344
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:17,510
而不是盲目的听，就能体会里面的意境
instead of throwing them away, we would be spared many an illusion.

1345
01:48:47,677 --> 01:48:51,613
终于找到他了. 原来在门旁边准备逃跑呢
There he is. By the door, always ready to run away.

1346
01:48:55,786 --> 01:48:58,118
大家晚上好，让你们就等了
Good evening to you all and apologies for the delay.

1347
01:48:58,688 --> 01:49:00,451
现在要来点什么呢?
Well, what are you up to now?

1348
01:49:01,258 --> 01:49:02,691
贵都在那? 我在这呢!
- Guido where are you? - Here.

1349
01:49:02,759 --> 01:49:04,784
下来! 还是让我在这吧
- Come down. - I'd rather stay up here.

1350
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:08,422
晚上好，原来你也在 我们开始吧
Evening... Good, you're here too. Let's get going.

1351
01:49:08,498 --> 01:49:09,624
马上开始
Right away.

1352
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:12,595
他们取消了今晚所有的活动让我们用场地
They skipped the variety act tonight so we could use the theater.

1353
01:49:14,604 --> 01:49:15,502
好，开始
Let's go.

1354
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,164
年轻人，是时候觉醒了
Young man, it's time to make up your mind.

1355
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:20,704
我把所有的剪辑带过来了
I've brought all the screen tests...

1356
01:49:20,777 --> 01:49:23,610
你说什么克诺斯雅，刚才你说什么?
Pardon me Conocchia, but the time for his jokes is over.

1357
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:26,005
他的所有猜疑，都是幻想而已
All his doubts, his uncertainties, his whims.

1358
01:49:26,082 --> 01:49:29,142
他已经有足够时间准备 我们今晚就来作出选择吧
He had all the time he wanted, but tonight we're here to choose.

1359
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:31,119
这就是为什么我们来这 是啊
- That's why we're all here. - Right.

1360
01:49:31,188 --> 01:49:32,849
克诺斯诺已经得到他想要的一切
Conocchia has gotten everything from Rome.

1361
01:49:32,923 --> 01:49:36,256
前后所有的剪接片断，甚至5个月前拍的都给他了
The new and the old screen tests, even the ones we shot five months ago.

1362
01:49:36,526 --> 01:49:39,222
就让我们一个个的看 然后说：
Now we'll go through them one by one, and you have to say:

1363
01:49:39,262 --> 01:49:41,526
那个是妻子，那个是情人
This is the wife, this is the mistress,

1364
01:49:41,598 --> 01:49:43,896
那个是教主，你们清楚了嘛?
this is the Cardinal, this is Saraghina. Clear?

1365
01:49:44,467 --> 01:49:47,527
我可不想让整个意大利电影界笑话
I don't want to be the joke of the ltalian film industry

1366
01:49:47,604 --> 01:49:49,629
最主要的我不想让你们失望
but above all I don't want you to end up that way.

1367
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:51,931
他们都开始抨击你了
They're all ready to shoot you down.

1368
01:49:52,309 --> 01:49:55,244
你还有几个朋友在支持你，一个都没有
You've got very few friends left, on the Left or the Right.

1369
01:49:55,312 --> 01:49:58,281
只有我在一直日日夜夜的帮助你
But I am here to help you each and every way.

1370
01:49:58,481 --> 01:50:00,949
我们必须，而且马上重新开拍
We must start shooting and we must do it immediately.

1371
01:50:01,017 --> 01:50:02,450
放片子吧
Roll the screen tests.

1372
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:07,454
奥林帕小姐的片断
Miss Olimpia's screen test.

1373
01:50:09,226 --> 01:50:10,318
奥林帕小姐的...
Miss Olimpia...

1374
01:50:13,096 --> 01:50:18,159
要关门么? 好的，关上吧
- Should I shut the door? - Yes. Sway, sway your big hips.

1375
01:50:18,835 --> 01:50:21,929
把东西放下
Put down your stuff. Good.

1376
01:50:22,172 --> 01:50:26,336
现在到镜子那去，欣赏一下自己
Now go to the mirror. Admire yourself.

1377
01:50:27,477 --> 01:50:33,438
继续，挺起你的胸 就是这样
More. Swell your chest. There.

1378
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:36,777
走到电话那 慢一点，不要太快
Now go to the phone. Slowly. Don't run.

1379
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,354
你不要跑! 我没跑啊
- Why are you running? - I'm not.

1380
01:50:39,689 --> 01:50:42,021
好，走到这，到地板上的标记这
Look, hit that mark. There, on the floor.

1381
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:45,991
你好，我找下门卫
Hello, the concierge please?

1382
01:50:46,329 --> 01:50:47,523
这就是
Speaking.

1383
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:50,896
给我送杯水来
I'd like a bottle of flat water.

1384
01:50:50,967 --> 01:50:51,934
开水么?
Fiuggi.

1385
01:50:52,002 --> 01:50:53,492
不，开水太热
No, Fiuggi is sparkling.

1386
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:57,006
往这里看! 水没有那么热
No, look this way. Fiuggi is the least sparkling.

1387
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,707
那好吧
Fine, I'll take the Fiuggi.

1388
01:50:58,775 --> 01:51:00,436
这个怎样?贵都
Will this one do, Guido?

1389
01:51:00,543 --> 01:51:03,478
她能不能改变主意， 不要离别英格兰
He's got to make up his mind because she's leaving for England.

1390
01:51:03,546 --> 01:51:05,173
她下周才走呢，贵都
She's leaving next week, Guido.

1391
01:51:05,248 --> 01:51:06,716
这位是谁啊? 你别插嘴!
- And who's this one? - Shut up, you!

1392
01:51:06,716 --> 01:51:08,616
你喜欢这个演员么?
Or do you prefer this one.

1393
01:51:08,685 --> 01:51:09,777
这可是个重要的角色
This is an important character.

1394
01:51:09,853 --> 01:51:12,583
观众的第一印象就应该非常好 对吧，贵都
People need to like her right off the bat. Right, Guido?

1395
01:51:16,092 --> 01:51:17,992
斯格诺拉，累了就坐下吧
Signora, sit down as if you were drained.

1396
01:51:18,061 --> 01:51:20,154
这个女性角色，失去了挑战生活的勇气
This character is a woman who has lost the desire to fight.

1397
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,926
因为...说你的台词
because... say your line...

1398
01:51:23,667 --> 01:51:24,531
一直不停么? 什么?
- Without stopping? - What?

1399
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:26,228
真的不停么? 对，是的
- Without stopping? - Yes, yes.

1400
01:51:29,773 --> 01:51:32,207
你可以完全自由发挥
I am the one who's offering you complete freedom.

1401
01:51:33,543 --> 01:51:36,307
总之，这样对你不好的 我其实并不惹人喜欢
Anyway, I'm no good to you this way. I'm just a nuisance.

1402
01:51:41,251 --> 01:51:43,378
这位是谁? 她代表谁呢?
And who's this? What should she represent?

1403
01:51:43,987 --> 01:51:46,046
你听不到么? 她是你的老婆
Didn't you hear? She's the wife.

1404
01:51:50,226 --> 01:51:53,957
别停，她很可爱，充满热情 你是这么认为么?
Still, she's likable, soulful. Don't you think?

1405
01:51:54,597 --> 01:51:57,760
给我支烟 我也没有了，恩力克帮我们买盒烟去
- Gimme a cigarette. - I've run out. Enrico, fill us up.

1406
01:51:58,501 --> 01:52:00,366
我这有 哦，谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1407
01:52:00,437 --> 01:52:01,301
别客气
You're welcome.

1408
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:04,672
我不能这样活下去了
I cannot go on like this any longer.

1409
01:52:04,741 --> 01:52:07,073
现在，你告诉我，我该是什么样的
Now, you tell me how I should be.

1410
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:09,441
做一个永远不对别人撒谎，欺骗的人
Not someone who lies and swears he's telling the truth

1411
01:52:09,512 --> 01:52:11,173
哪怕一会儿
every second of the day.

1412
01:52:11,247 --> 01:52:14,045
这样的要求你做的到么? 你从来都做不到
That would be enough. You don't even do that.

1413
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:16,945
和你在一起，我从来都没有知道过真相
With you I never, never know the truth.

1414
01:52:17,387 --> 01:52:18,854
一点点的小事你也欺骗
Even in the smallest things.

1415
01:52:20,357 --> 01:52:22,382
陆纱，那是因为我考虑你的感受
Luisa, I care for you.

1416
01:52:23,026 --> 01:52:24,721
撒谎对你太平常了
Lying is like breathing to you.

1417
01:52:24,928 --> 01:52:26,020
请再说一次
Repeat that, please.

1418
01:52:26,363 --> 01:52:27,955
撒谎对你太平常了
Lying is like breathing to you.

1419
01:52:29,632 --> 01:52:31,031
你是个厚颜无耻的人
So brazen.

1420
01:52:34,604 --> 01:52:36,333
他的生活一直都是这样 没错
- All lines from his life. - Right.

1421
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:40,307
我认识她，还是个公主呢
I know this one. She's the princess.

1422
01:52:41,044 --> 01:52:43,239
我不是已经一个人了么? 你还能给我什么呢?
Am I not alone already? What are you giving me?

1423
01:52:43,947 --> 01:52:45,244
我还能企盼什么呢?
What have I got to look forward to?

1424
01:52:45,315 --> 01:52:47,078
看这边，然后戴上眼镜
Look this way. Put on the glasses.

1425
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:50,110
重复最后一句的台词
Repeat the last line.

1426
01:52:50,186 --> 01:52:51,778
我难道不是一个人么?
Am I not alone already?

1427
01:52:51,855 --> 01:52:53,755
你一定要说么 对，一定要说
You have to say it, yes, aggressively,

1428
01:52:53,823 --> 01:52:55,381
再掺杂点感情
but also with deep bitterness.

1429
01:52:55,825 --> 01:52:58,555
他说：什么? 你要分开?
He said:. What? You want a separation.

1430
01:52:58,628 --> 01:52:59,720
你要一个人么?
You want to be alone.

1431
01:52:59,896 --> 01:53:01,796
你一个人怎么生活啊?
But what would you do on your own?

1432
01:53:01,831 --> 01:53:05,961
她回答说：为什么不? 我不是已经一个人了么?  照着说
And she answers:. why, am I not alone already? Go on.

1433
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:09,868
贵都，从来都不要怀疑，她是个完美的女人
Guido, there's no doubt about this one. She's perfect.

1434
01:53:15,945 --> 01:53:18,641
5个月.我们都分开5个月了
Five months. We've been going this way for five months.

1435
01:53:18,982 --> 01:53:20,472
可是她们都老了啊
But they're all so old!

1436
01:53:22,819 --> 01:53:23,877
水好了
Fiuggi is sparkling.

1437
01:53:23,953 --> 01:53:27,013
不，这水一点也不热 “大声点说”
No, it's the least sparkling. Louder.

1438
01:53:29,492 --> 01:53:30,652
好，放下电话
Put down the phone.

1439
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:33,388
奥莉帕的片断
Screen test for Miss Olimpia.

1440
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:35,993
这个怎样?
What about this one?

1441
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:40,799
离开我你会很危险的
It's dangerous leaving me alone.

1442
01:53:42,138 --> 01:53:43,833
为什么，你干什么了?
Why, what do you do?

1443
01:53:43,907 --> 01:53:45,101
我要再说一次么?
Should I repeat the line?

1444
01:53:45,175 --> 01:53:51,080
不用了，把你的头转过来一点点 好，停!
No, just turn your little head this way. Now, stop.

1445
01:53:52,215 --> 01:53:53,876
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1446
01:53:55,418 --> 01:53:56,942
当然是回酒店，我好困了!
Back to the hotel. I'm sleepy.

1447
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,288
等等，听我说
Wait a second. Listen.

1448
01:53:59,856 --> 01:54:01,289
发生什么事了么?
What happened?

1449
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:04,950
没什么，我们之间也发生不了什么了
Nothing. Nothing ever happens between us.

1450
01:54:06,596 --> 01:54:08,530
你看到什么不开心的事了么?
Were you offended by something you saw?

1451
01:54:09,032 --> 01:54:09,862
只是拍电影而已
It's just a movie.

1452
01:54:09,999 --> 01:54:11,796
我是第一个醒悟的
I'm the first to understand that.

1453
01:54:11,868 --> 01:54:14,894
电影，只是个新的发明罢了，骗人的机器
It's a movie, another invention, another lie.

1454
01:54:14,971 --> 01:54:17,599
你把所有的感情放进去，都变成你希望的那样
You put everybody in it, but the way you like to see them.

1455
01:54:17,674 --> 01:54:19,539
可我知道真相!
But I know the truth.

1456
01:54:19,609 --> 01:54:23,545
不同的是我不会去
The difference is that I would never have the impudence

1457
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:25,171
告诉别人你的厚颜无耻了!
to tell everybody the way you do.

1458
01:54:25,949 --> 01:54:28,042
去拍你的电影吧!
Go ahead. Make your movie.

1459
01:54:28,118 --> 01:54:29,176
不，我不会
No, I won't.

1460
01:54:29,252 --> 01:54:31,152
再放纵我自己，任你们的自私滋长
Indulge yourself. Stroke your ego.

1461
01:54:32,355 --> 01:54:34,721
你能告诉大家你很伟大
Go make everyone think you're so wonderful.

1462
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:38,150
可是你不能告诉人们
What could you ever teach strangers when you can't

1463
01:54:38,228 --> 01:54:40,662
你最真实的一面
even tell the simplest truth to the ones closest to you?

1464
01:54:40,697 --> 01:54:42,426
我们永远看到的你真实的那一面
To the one who's been growing old with you?

1465
01:54:42,465 --> 01:54:44,126
好了陆纱，别说这些了
Come on Luisa. Cut the drama.

1466
01:54:46,169 --> 01:54:48,103
你叫我来是对的
You were right to ask me here.

1467
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:51,272
我们该结束了
We needed to find closure.

1468
01:54:51,574 --> 01:54:54,099
这次，我保证不会再回心转意了
This time, I assure you, I won't be coming back.

1469
01:54:54,477 --> 01:54:56,104
你可以去死了
You can go to hell!

1470
01:55:09,058 --> 01:55:12,459
好吧，走吧，走吧!
Fine, just run, run.

1471
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:15,157
你快走吧
Do what the doctor ordered, run!

1472
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:19,998
闭嘴!把这个无知的人赶走!
Shut up! Throw this ignoramus out.

1473
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,060
好了，你快唱吧
Fine, now sing.

1474
01:55:22,772 --> 01:55:25,400
你可能以为我弄错了 可是帐单还在没结...
You may say I'm losing it, but I have the bills here...

1475
01:55:26,543 --> 01:55:30,809
让我付这个，做梦! 克诺斯雅，你做梦去吧
I'll never pay this one, never! Conocchia, you're losing it.

1476
01:55:31,281 --> 01:55:33,841
萨拉娜看，我们有钱了
Saraghina look, we've got the money.

1477
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:36,917
萨拉娜，跳舞吧，跳伦巴吧!
Saraghina, the Rumba, the Rumba...

1478
01:55:37,086 --> 01:55:40,021
贵都，说点什么吧，求求你了
Guido, would you please say something? Please!

1479
01:55:42,058 --> 01:55:43,355
这个合格么，贵都?
What about this one, Guido?

1480
01:55:44,561 --> 01:55:46,392
我还是喜欢前面那个
Frankly I preferred the one before.

1481
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:48,427
这人是南方来的
This one is from Naples.

1482
01:55:48,498 --> 01:55:52,594
你看不出来我...很烦么?
Can't you see that I'm... stuttering.

1483
01:55:52,936 --> 01:55:56,201
你什么时候开始，我已经等烦了
When are you coming? I'm tired of waiting.

1484
01:55:56,372 --> 01:55:57,202
看着我的眼睛
Look at me.

1485
01:55:57,273 --> 01:55:59,468
不要离开我，我好怕
Don't leave me alone! You know it's dangerous.

1486
01:55:59,842 --> 01:56:04,506
不要离开我，我需要依靠，亲爱的
Don't leave me alone. You know it's dangerous, darling.

1487
01:56:04,647 --> 01:56:05,511
看这边!
Look over here.

1488
01:56:05,648 --> 01:56:08,947
你怎么还不来? 不要让我再等待了
Why aren't you coming now? Why are you keeping me waiting?

1489
01:56:09,319 --> 01:56:11,378
你知道让我在这等是不安全的
You know it's dangerous when I have to wait.

1490
01:56:11,454 --> 01:56:13,649
大声，再大声点儿，行不行啊
Louder, louder!

1491
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:16,124
伯爵夫人，继续走
Countess, walk.

1492
01:56:18,461 --> 01:56:19,655
不要碰我
Don't touch me.

1493
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:21,754
这边来，到这边
This way, this way.

1494
01:56:24,133 --> 01:56:26,601
格瑞斯小姐，片断一
Screen tests Mrs. Grazia, one.

1495
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:28,528
露出你的肩来，要快!
Just bare your shoulders all of a sudden.

1496
01:56:28,605 --> 01:56:31,506
萨拉娜，我们有钱了，有钱了!
Saraghina, we've got the money. The money.

1497
01:56:32,475 --> 01:56:34,705
停，非常好.可以通过么?
Stop. Very good. Was it all right?

1498
01:56:36,846 --> 01:56:39,406
斯诺格拉，你看可以么?
Signora, what do you think?

1499
01:56:39,482 --> 01:56:41,313
如果都不表态，我们看还有什么意义
If he won't speak up, at least we can say something.

1500
01:56:41,384 --> 01:56:44,717
都说说意见，我们很民主的嘛，对不对?
Somebody say something! This is a democracy, right?

1501
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:50,421
你不要躲了，呵呵，还好嘛?
You can't hide. We've found you anyway. How are you?

1502
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,752
我是勃利迪，是珂劳迪亚的经纪人
Hi, I'm Poletti, from Claudia's press agency.

1503
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:57,027
15年前见过的，不过您可能不记得了
We met 1 5 years ago. You might not remember me...

1504
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,762
看，她过来了 那呢?
- Look, she's here. - Where?

1505
01:57:06,442 --> 01:57:07,704
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1506
01:57:16,753 --> 01:57:19,221
珂劳迪亚，你好吗?
- Claudia. - How are you?

1507
01:57:19,289 --> 01:57:23,089
还不错，谢谢 你终于来了
Well, and you? You're finally here.

1508
01:57:23,259 --> 01:57:24,487
我们出去聊聊，可以吗?
Let's go outside, all right?

1509
01:57:25,295 --> 01:57:27,263
这是卡罗琳，我的女秘书
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1510
01:57:30,033 --> 01:57:31,557
我想和你单独谈谈
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1511
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,807
我们什么时候开拍?
When do we start shooting?

1512
01:57:39,275 --> 01:57:41,869
快了，马上 我的那部份剧本呢
- Soon, very soon. - And what's my part?

1513
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:43,873
我等会儿会告诉你的
I'll tell you everything later.

1514
01:57:43,946 --> 01:57:45,811
真高兴能和你合作
I'm very happy to be working with you

1515
01:57:45,882 --> 01:57:47,281
我希望能帮上你的忙
and I hope I'll be able to help you.

1516
01:57:47,617 --> 01:57:48,914
快跟我讲讲
But you must tell me everything.

1517
01:57:50,386 --> 01:57:51,580
我们这是去哪?
Where are we going now?

1518
01:58:01,564 --> 01:58:05,056
哦，是这边
Well? - This way.

1519
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:24,484
你真的太漂亮了 任何语言在你面前都显得苍白
You're so beautiful. I'm at a loss for words.

1520
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:26,249
你让我心跳不已，像个孩子一样
You make my heart beat like a school boy's.

1521
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,082
你不信我吗，嗯?
You don't believe me, do you?

1522
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,658
是你让我重新燃起对生命的激情
You inspire such deep respect.

1523
01:58:33,563 --> 01:58:37,192
你爱的是谁? 珂劳迪亚，你喜欢我么?
Who do you love? Claudia, who are you with?

1524
01:58:37,266 --> 01:58:39,131
我最关心的是谁? 当然是你啊
- Who do you care for? - You.

1525
01:58:42,305 --> 01:58:44,000
知道么，你来的太是时候了
You arrived just in time, you know.

1526
01:58:45,508 --> 01:58:47,169
你在坏笑什么?
Why do you smile that way?

1527
01:58:47,243 --> 01:58:50,610
我连想都不敢想你会这么看我 不要嘲讽我了
I never know if you're judging me, absolving me, mocking me.

1528
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,672
我想听听你的意见，告诉我 你怎么看这部电影
I'm listening. You said you wanted to tell me about the film.

1529
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,081
其实我不懂什么
I don't know anything.

1530
01:59:01,224 --> 01:59:04,990
你能不能先把别的事放一放 然后我们从头来说
Could you leave everything behind and start from zero again?

1531
01:59:06,396 --> 01:59:09,490
一件一件事聊 我们好好探讨一下
Pick one thing, and one only, and be absolutely devoted to it?

1532
01:59:09,799 --> 01:59:11,994
我们生存的意义
Make it the reason for your existence,

1533
01:59:12,068 --> 01:59:14,400
是因为世间的人和事是互相关联的
the thing that contains everything, that becomes everything,

1534
01:59:14,437 --> 01:59:18,066
只要我们认真去做好每一件事，就会成功的 你能做到么?
because your dedication to it makes it last forever? Could you?

1535
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:22,602
好，听着，如果我问你，珂劳迪亚...
All right, listen. If I were to say, Claudia...

1536
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:27,576
今后你打算怎么办? 我不知道该怎么办...
Where are we going? I don't know the way...

1537
01:59:28,785 --> 01:59:31,219
你会怎么说?
And what about you? Could you?

1538
01:59:32,188 --> 01:59:35,783
春天已经不远了 看着我，转过来
The springs must be nearby. Listen. Turn here.

1539
01:59:38,294 --> 01:59:40,421
你眼前的我，决不会
No, this guy here, he couldn't.

1540
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:44,488
放弃任何人和事，他要抓住一切机会
He wants to grab everything, can't give up a single thing.

1541
01:59:45,301 --> 01:59:46,359
他每天都在进步
He changes his mind every day,

1542
01:59:46,436 --> 01:59:48,563
因为他不想和成功擦肩而过
because he's afraid he might miss the right path.

1543
01:59:48,638 --> 01:59:50,731
他会这样一直追求到底 这就是这部电影的结局么?
And he's slowly bleeding to death. - So this is how the movie ends?

1544
01:59:50,773 --> 01:59:52,070
不，这是电影的开始
No, this is how it starts.

1545
01:59:52,175 --> 01:59:54,143
他会碰到一个如春天一样美丽的姑娘
Then one day he meets the girl of the spring.

1546
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:56,974
她会给人们带来希望
She's one of those girls that distributes the healing water,

1547
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:04,442
她是一个美丽，善良，淳朴的女人
she's beautiful, young and ancient, a child and a woman already,

1548
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:09,287
真实而又饱满 她绝对可以拯救心灵
authentic and radiant. There's no doubt that she's his salvation.

1549
02:00:10,893 --> 02:00:12,690
你又着披肩长发，穿着洁白的裙子
You'll be dressed in white and your hair will be long,

1550
02:00:12,762 --> 02:00:14,286
就象你现在穿的一样
just the way you wear it.

1551
02:00:24,841 --> 02:00:26,274
把灯关了吧
Turn the headlights off.

1552
02:01:05,181 --> 02:01:06,307
然后呢?
And then?

1553
02:01:21,764 --> 02:01:23,129
我们离开这里
Let's leave.

1554
02:01:25,067 --> 02:01:28,161
可我不喜欢这，不够真实
I don't like this place. It doesn't feel real.

1555
02:01:29,038 --> 02:01:31,199
我喜欢大的场景，这有点奇怪么?
I like it enormously. Isn't that odd?

1556
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:37,611
我还不能体会你的意境
I didn't get much from your story.

1557
02:01:38,414 --> 02:01:42,373
这个角色很像你自己 一个不会真正去爱的人
A guy like your character, who doesn't love anybody,

1558
02:01:42,685 --> 02:01:44,346
是不会轻易坠入爱河的
is not very sympathetic you know.

1559
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:49,754
这是他的错，他还能想得到什么?
It's his fault. What does he expect?

1560
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:53,125
你以为我真的不懂么?
You think I don't know that?

1561
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:56,755
你真的是顽固不化
You're a bit of a bore too.

1562
02:01:57,099 --> 02:01:59,932
难道一点批评都不能接受?
You really can't take the least bit of criticism.

1563
02:02:00,169 --> 02:02:03,798
你戴那顶帽子太好玩了，像个老头子一样
You're so funny with that big hat, made up like an old man.

1564
02:02:06,576 --> 02:02:11,343
我不明白.他需要一个女人带给他全新的生活
I don't understand. He meets a girl that can give him a new life

1565
02:02:11,847 --> 02:02:13,314
又把她推走?
and he pushes her away?

1566
02:02:13,382 --> 02:02:15,077
是因为他不再相信...
Because he no longer believes in it.

1567
02:02:16,686 --> 02:02:18,551
他自己会真的去爱一个人
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1568
02:02:18,788 --> 02:02:21,120
他相信没有任何女人可以改变他
Because it isn't true that a woman can change a man.

1569
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:23,048
事实上他根本不懂得爱
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1570
02:02:23,125 --> 02:02:26,617
总之我觉得这次很真实
And above all because I don't feel like telling another pile of lies.

1571
02:02:26,796 --> 02:02:28,696
因为他真的不懂得爱
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1572
02:02:30,366 --> 02:02:34,427
我真的抱歉 让你这么远道而来
I'm sorry, Claudia, for making you come all the way here.

1573
02:02:35,304 --> 02:02:37,465
别再虚伪了
You're such a fake.

1574
02:02:37,707 --> 02:02:39,402
电影里面根本就没有我的角色
So, there's no part in the film.

1575
02:02:40,476 --> 02:02:43,570
是啊，找不到这样的角色
You're right. There isn't.

1576
02:02:43,846 --> 02:02:47,873
事实上也没有电影 什么都没有
And there's no film. There's nothing anywhere.

1577
02:02:48,484 --> 02:02:52,079
如果我可以拿主意 我会把所有人遣散了
If it were up to me we would call it all off now.

1578
02:02:57,493 --> 02:02:59,358
哦，原来你在这呢
Ah, here you are.

1579
02:02:59,428 --> 02:03:02,693
下周就开拍了，你去了那了?
Where did you go? We're starting next week.

1580
02:03:03,966 --> 02:03:05,695
你的制片人有个好的打算
Your producer had a great idea.

1581
02:03:05,768 --> 02:03:08,760
准备办个舞会庆祝开拍
The greatest cocktail party ever to launch a movie.

1582
02:03:08,838 --> 02:03:10,863
那你知道在那么? 明天下午，午饭的时候
And you know where? - At the launch pad. Tomorrow afternoon.

1583
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,703
电视台，广播台，还有国外记者呢
Radio, television, and all the foreign press.

1584
02:03:13,042 --> 02:03:15,237
来吧，贵都，我们要真正开始了
Come on, Guido, we're starting for real.

1585
02:03:40,703 --> 02:03:41,727
抓住他!
Catch him!

1586
02:03:49,011 --> 02:03:50,706
走，我们聊聊
Let's go. Walk!

1587
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,576
我要回家了!
I want to go home.

1588
02:03:51,647 --> 02:03:54,138
这呢，他在这呢
Here, he's here.

1589
02:04:02,992 --> 02:04:04,755
贵都你去那?这没事了 别走啊
Guido, where are you going? It's over here.

1590
02:04:10,733 --> 02:04:13,258
贵都，今天一定是个伟大的时刻
Guido, I'm sure today will be a beautiful day.

1591
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:22,435
我对你的构思非常好奇...
I'm really curious to finally hear the story...

1592
02:04:23,913 --> 02:04:27,144
你是不是过于自爱了，安瑟门先生?
Don't you take yourself a little too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1593
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:36,956
别烦我，我自己可以走
Leave me alone, I can walk by myself.

1594
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:44,226
祝你成功!
Good luck!

1595
02:04:47,269 --> 02:04:49,464
多特瑞，原来你在这儿
Dottore, here he is!

1596
02:04:52,341 --> 02:04:53,968
安静!
Calm down!

1597
02:04:54,043 --> 02:04:56,807
我们都等你这么长时间了，快冷场了啊
We've been waiting three days for you. It's winter already.

1598
02:04:57,213 --> 02:04:58,544
请安静!
Attention, please.

1599
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:07,878
您认为色情也是艺术的分支么, 或者...
...do you think of pornography as an art form or...

1600
02:05:07,957 --> 02:05:10,425
或者色情会打破传统的...
...is pornography a more intense form of...

1601
02:05:10,493 --> 02:05:14,054
您为什么从来不拍爱情片?
...why don't you ever make a film about love?

1602
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:29,068
我希望声明一下...
I wish to announce that...

1603
02:05:29,145 --> 02:05:30,874
明天...明天...
Tomorrow... tomorrow...

1604
02:05:31,213 --> 02:05:33,613
这部片子您在传达一种什么精神?
What do you think you can teach us?

1605
02:05:33,682 --> 02:05:35,741
您认为你的生活可以更加生动么?
Do you really think your life can be of any interest to others?

1606
02:05:38,053 --> 02:05:40,749
他要讲话了
He wants to say something.

1607
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:53,227
快回答，说点什么啊，快
Answer, say something, go on.

1608
02:05:53,836 --> 02:05:57,465
什么都行，随便说也行
Anything at all! Say anything!

1609
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:59,705
求求你了!
Do it for me!

1610
02:06:02,478 --> 02:06:03,809
我保证你...
I promise you...

1611
02:06:03,879 --> 02:06:07,610
...这部电影结束后，你想怎样都行
...this film. And afterward, what will you live on?

1612
02:06:08,918 --> 02:06:11,079
您是怎样看离婚的? 能谈谈么...
Are you for or against divorce? Tell me, frankly...

1613
02:06:11,153 --> 02:06:14,179
难道你要离婚么?
Is that your main problem?

1614
02:06:14,256 --> 02:06:16,247
您不想说，还是这只是您的借口?
That you can't communicate? Or is that just a pretext?

1615
02:06:16,492 --> 02:06:19,120
你的问题有点不太好!
Your questions betray a certain hostility.

1616
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
我相信我走的路是正确的
I assure you my director is in great form...

1617
02:06:21,831 --> 02:06:23,628
我要怎么办?我该怎么办?
What should I do? What am I supposed to do?

1618
02:06:24,166 --> 02:06:26,396
他们该对他友好一点，因为...
...he should be treated with respect, because...

1619
02:06:26,669 --> 02:06:28,762
克诺斯雅，原谅我，如果我态度不好的话
Conocchia, forgive me if I treated you badly.

1620
02:06:29,171 --> 02:06:32,140
你是世上最伟大的人
You were wonderful, the best of them all.

1621
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:34,199
充满了智慧和爱心
He ponders, considers, reflects.

1622
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:35,768
请讲话!谈谈吧!
Speak! Answer!

1623
02:06:35,845 --> 02:06:37,745
我花钱就是要你做事的
I've paid for your confusion, your breakdown.

1624
02:06:37,813 --> 02:06:39,337
这几个月来我该做的都做了
For months I've been paying for everything.

1625
02:06:39,415 --> 02:06:41,576
现在退出的话我会杀了你
Quit this film and I'll ruin you.

1626
02:06:41,984 --> 02:06:43,781
他现在可以认我摆布了
He'll now be at your disposal.

1627
02:06:43,853 --> 02:06:45,184
新闻界一直...
The press always has been...

1628
02:06:45,254 --> 02:06:48,280
珂劳迪亚，你在那? 给我点鼓励吧，罗瑟拉?
Claudia, where are you? And your spirits, Rossella?

1629
02:06:50,759 --> 02:06:53,353
我该怎么做? 可以走么?
What should I do? Leave you? Disappear?

1630
02:06:53,429 --> 02:06:55,363
这次不用了
You will never be what you once were.

1631
02:06:55,631 --> 02:06:58,998
我还会是你的妻子么? 你什么时候可以和我结婚?
Will I ever be your wife? When will you truly marry me?

1632
02:06:59,168 --> 02:07:01,659
陆纱，你真的打算分手么?
Luisa, is it really true that you want a separation?

1633
02:07:01,737 --> 02:07:02,795
你舍得离开我么?
That you want to leave me?

1634
02:07:02,872 --> 02:07:04,464
我到最后还是接受不了
How can I go on like this 'til the end?

1635
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:06,167
想想你老婆会怎么想?
...and what does your wife think?

1636
02:07:11,413 --> 02:07:13,506
在你的右边口袋里，多特里
It's in your right-hand pocket, Dottore.

1637
02:07:14,483 --> 02:07:15,677
够了，贵都
So long, Guido.

1638
02:07:15,851 --> 02:07:17,682
我放你右边口袋里了
I put it in your right-hand pocket.

1639
02:07:27,196 --> 02:07:30,825
谁都不可以带走. 布冯!
Nobody gets away with this. Buffoon!

1640
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,802
滚出去，滚! 你个胆小鬼!
Out of there, out! You coward!

1641
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:38,638
马上就好，马上! 让我想想怎么说
Just a minute, a little moment. I'm thinking of what to say.

1642
02:07:39,975 --> 02:07:42,876
我马上就来...很快的!
I'm coming... right away!

1643
02:07:45,614 --> 02:07:47,980
真是个多情的种子
Such an incurable romantic.

1644
02:07:52,488 --> 02:07:54,956
你要跑到那里去?
Where are you running, you low-life?

1645
02:08:13,175 --> 02:08:15,735
都拆了，伙计们 电影结束了
Take it all down, guys! The film is off.

1646
02:08:16,045 --> 02:08:19,105
两天内都拆了，马上开始行动
In two days it all has to be gone. Start right away.

1647
02:08:19,448 --> 02:08:20,915
都给我拆了，动手吧!
Tear it all down. Come on!

1648
02:08:21,183 --> 02:08:23,048
这就完了，多特里? 是的，十分感谢!
- Is that it, Dottore? - Yes, thanks.

1649
02:08:23,185 --> 02:08:25,983
大家保重了 下次再见吧
So long, guys. See you next time.

1650
02:08:26,322 --> 02:08:27,584
我们希望是
Let's hope so.

1651
02:08:33,028 --> 02:08:34,222
保重，赛乐!
So long, sailor.

1652
02:08:38,634 --> 02:08:40,295
你的决定是对的
You've made the right choice.

1653
02:08:40,369 --> 02:08:42,303
相信我，今天是个好的开始
Believe me, today is a good day for you.

1654
02:08:43,238 --> 02:08:45,399
这些决定不容易，我能理解
These are tough decisions, I know.

1655
02:08:45,908 --> 02:08:49,674
我们是对的，我说我们 是因为我一直在乎你的感受
But we intellectuals, and I say we because I consider you such,

1656
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:52,675
任何时候都是一样的
must remain lucid to the bitter end.

1657
02:08:53,148 --> 02:08:55,241
生命本来就有好多疑惑
This life is so full of confusion already,

1658
02:08:55,317 --> 02:08:58,047
我们何必自寻烦恼呢
that there's no need to add chaos to chaos.

1659
02:08:59,822 --> 02:09:02,882
损失点钱其实是很正常的
Losing money is part of a producer's job.

1660
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,328
我祝贺你 因为你没有办法
I congratulate you. You had no choice.

1661
02:09:07,629 --> 02:09:09,324
他却得到报应了
And he got what he deserved,

1662
02:09:09,531 --> 02:09:13,331
这么愚蠢的冲动，错误是必然的
for having joined such a frivolous venture so lightheartedly.

1663
02:09:15,371 --> 02:09:17,703
听我的，不用自责
Believe me, no need for remorse.

1664
02:09:17,973 --> 02:09:19,463
人要学会放弃
Destroying is better than creating

1665
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:22,237
如果我们走的路是错的，就要学会放弃
when we're not creating those few, truly necessary things.

1666
02:09:22,678 --> 02:09:25,272
在这个世界上
But then is there anything so clear and right

1667
02:09:25,347 --> 02:09:27,611
没有什么事是绝对的
that it deserves to live in this world?

1668
02:09:28,984 --> 02:09:31,953
对他来说，电影失败了，也只是破财而已
For him, the wrong movie is only a financial matter.

1669
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:35,488
对你来说，追求完美才更重要
But for you, at this point, it could have been the end.

1670
02:09:36,225 --> 02:09:38,989
放弃没什么不对，象古人一样
Better to quit and strew the ground with salt,

1671
02:09:39,061 --> 02:09:42,428
我们总有一天化作尘土，净化这个世界
as the ancients did, to purify the battlefields.

1672
02:09:42,865 --> 02:09:45,834
生命尽头，我们需要的是...
In the end what we need is...

1673
02:09:45,901 --> 02:09:49,029
纯洁的，透彻的世界
some hygiene, some cleanliness, disinfection.

1674
02:09:49,371 --> 02:09:53,831
如果我们玷污了画面，语言，声音
We're smothered by images, words and sounds

1675
02:09:53,909 --> 02:09:59,040
我们就没有权利生存，一点价值都没有了
that have no right to exist, coming from, and bound for, nothingness.

1676
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:03,784
真的的艺术家，是不会象任何人索取什么的
Of any artist truly worth the name we should ask nothing

1677
02:10:03,852 --> 02:10:07,151
除了对艺术的追求，什么都可以不要!
except this act of faith: to learn silence.

1678
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:10,217
还记得一本诗集上写着...
Do you remember Mallarme's homage to the white page?

1679
02:10:10,292 --> 02:10:11,589
等等，贵都
And Rimbaud... - Guido, wait!

1680
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:14,458
把我当作朋友吧，忘了我的身份
...a poet, my friend, not a movie director. What was his finest poetry?

1681
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:16,521
我们已经准备好了.
We're ready to begin.

1682
02:10:16,598 --> 02:10:20,090
那个作者现在已经停笔了，去非洲体验生活了
His refusal to continue writing and his departure for Africa.

1683
02:10:20,169 --> 02:10:21,466
恭喜了
Congratulations.

1684
02:10:21,537 --> 02:10:25,337
如果我们什么灵感都没有 就算拍了也一文不值
If we can't have everything, true perfection is nothingness.

1685
02:10:25,741 --> 02:10:30,678
原谅我的直言，可是批评家就要敢于说这话
Forgive me for quoting all the time. But we critics... do what we can.

1686
02:10:31,346 --> 02:10:35,442
我们的义务就是...排除一切不该有的错误
Our true mission is... sweeping away the thousands of miscarriages

1687
02:10:35,517 --> 02:10:39,977
每时每刻...都要...去寻找光明
that everyday... obscenely... try to come to the light.

1688
02:10:40,656 --> 02:10:45,116
你真的要放弃这部电影了么?
And you would actually dare leave behind you a whole film,

1689
02:10:45,661 --> 02:10:49,256
走了一半的路就要放弃了?
Iike a cripple who leaves behind his crooked footprint.

1690
02:10:49,965 --> 02:10:52,297
我真的不敢相信这是真的
Such a monstrous presumption to think

1691
02:10:52,367 --> 02:10:56,633
这么说别人不用受你的折磨了
that others could benefit from the squalid catalogue of your mistakes!

1692
02:10:57,639 --> 02:11:00,301
你这样会快乐么
And how do you benefit from stringing together

1693
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:01,774
你难道不会后悔么?
the tattered pieces of your life?

1694
02:11:01,844 --> 02:11:04,642
你脑海里，有那些深爱着的人么
Your vague memories, the faces of people

1695
02:11:04,713 --> 02:11:06,908
还有他们的身影么?
that you were never able to love...

1696
02:11:15,591 --> 02:11:18,116
你做这个决定的时候不会哆嗦么
What is this sudden happiness that makes me tremble,

1697
02:11:18,193 --> 02:11:19,785
生命啊，给我力量吧!
giving me strength, life?

1698
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:23,455
原谅我，亲爱的
Forgive me, sweet creatures.

1699
02:11:23,532 --> 02:11:25,466
我还是不能理解，不明白
I hadn't understood. I didn't know.

1700
02:11:26,268 --> 02:11:28,828
爱上你应该是很自然的事
It's so natural accepting you, loving you.

1701
02:11:29,171 --> 02:11:30,798
又这么简单
And so simple.

1702
02:11:31,373 --> 02:11:34,342
陆纱，我觉得自由了!
Luisa, I feel I've been freed.

1703
02:11:34,843 --> 02:11:37,038
什么事都很美好，有意义了!
Everything seems so good, so meaningful.

1704
02:11:37,112 --> 02:11:38,374
这世界开始真实了
Everything is true.

1705
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,748
我希望可以释怀
I wish I could explain.

1706
02:11:41,416 --> 02:11:43,316
可不知道该怎样去
But I don't know how to.

1707
02:11:44,153 --> 02:11:48,089
事情又开始混沌了，象以前一样
So. Everything is confused again, as it was before.

1708
02:11:48,223 --> 02:11:49,087
光芒!
The lights!

1709
02:11:49,158 --> 02:11:50,716
这次，混沌的是...我
But this confusion is... me.

1710
02:11:50,792 --> 02:11:53,852
虽然不是我想要的，顺其自然吧
Not as I'd like to be, but as I am.

1711
02:11:54,329 --> 02:11:58,265
我再也不怕讲真话了
I'm not afraid anymore of telling the truth,

1712
02:11:58,333 --> 02:12:02,292
无论是我不理解的，正在寻找的，都不怕了
of the things I don't know, what I'm looking for and haven't found.

1713
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:04,061
这样我才能活的更真实
This is the only way I can feel alive

1714
02:12:04,139 --> 02:12:06,801
我的眼睛可以诚实的看着你
and I can look into your faithful eyes without shame.

1715
02:12:07,576 --> 02:12:09,134
人生本就是个庆典
Life is a celebration.

1716
02:12:09,211 --> 02:12:10,872
我们要勇敢面对
Let's live it together!

1717
02:12:12,014 --> 02:12:14,881
这就是我要说的 陆纱， 对你也好，对别人也好
This is all I can say Luisa, to you or the others.

1718
02:12:15,017 --> 02:12:17,042
如果你还爱我，请接受我吧
Accept me for what I am, if you want me.

1719
02:12:17,419 --> 02:12:19,853
只有这样我们才能够相互接受
It's the only way we might be able to find each other.

1720
02:12:21,023 --> 02:12:22,923
我不知道你说的是不是对的
I don't know if what you said to me is right.

1721
02:12:23,659 --> 02:12:26,719
要是你帮我，我可以试试看
But I can try if you help me.

1722
02:13:26,588 --> 02:13:28,715
等一下，我就会让你们去做
Just a minute. I'll give you the go-ahead.

1723
02:13:39,334 --> 02:13:42,269
现在，都走到窗帘那
Now. Go to the curtain.

1724
02:13:51,913 --> 02:13:52,971
把它画下来
Draw it.

1725
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,009
大家都下来
Everyone come down.

1726
02:13:57,085 --> 02:13:59,610
好好谈谈
Talk to each other.

1727
02:14:51,006 --> 02:14:52,098
妈妈
Mother.

1728
02:14:57,746 --> 02:15:01,147
闭嘴!我知道你要跟我说什么
Sgulp! I did understand what you wanted to say, you know.

1729
02:15:01,216 --> 02:15:03,081
你还是离不开我们的
That you can't do without us.

1730
02:15:03,518 --> 02:15:07,477
你明天什么时候给我电话? 好了，好了，现在排好队!
At what time will you call me tomorrow? - Fine, fine. Now join the line!

1731
02:15:07,522 --> 02:15:08,511
马里思
Maurice!

1732
02:15:12,728 --> 02:15:16,858
过来，快!别四处闲逛了.
Come, quickly! Stop fooling around.

1733
02:15:17,099 --> 02:15:21,798
每个人都手拉手一起转吧!
Everybody hold hands! Spread out! All together.

1734
02:15:24,406 --> 02:15:25,373
大师!
Maestro!

1735
02:15:26,007 --> 02:15:28,305
让我们跳舞吧
Let's all hold hands!

1736
02:15:29,305 --> 02:15:30,305
