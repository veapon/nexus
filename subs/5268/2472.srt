1
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:31,626
为了展示出
In order to show you how

2
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,209
一个大型交响乐团是怎么组成的
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

3
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,376
Benjamin Britten创作了一长段
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

4
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,209
由小的片段组成的乐章
which is made up
of smaller pieces

5
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,292
向你展示交响乐团的组成部分
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

6
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:45,167
这些小的片段就叫变奏曲
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

7
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,751
意思就是用不同的方法演奏同样的旋律
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

8
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,084
他首先让我们听曲调或者主旋律
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

9
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,292
这是一段由年长的多的英国作曲家Henry Purcell
which is a beautiful melody

10
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:56,751
创作的美妙旋律
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

11
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:01,292
现在听到的就是整个乐团一起演奏的主旋律
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

12
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:34,501
现在Britten先生会让你听到乐团中四个不同的部
Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra

13
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,542
用不同的方式演奏同一段主旋律
playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

14
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,417
我们首先听到的是木管乐器部
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

15
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,167
长笛，双簧管，单簧管和低音管
The ?utes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.

16
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,376
现在是铜管乐器部
Here comes the brass family.

17
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,751
小号，号，长号和大号
The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.

18
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,251
一比四
One to four.

19
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,667
现在Britten先生让弦乐部来演奏主旋律
Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.

20
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,792
我烦死这雨了
I'm sick of this rain.

21
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:39,292
小提琴，中提琴，大提琴和低音提琴
The violins,
the violas, the cellos and the double basses.

22
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,751
当然了，还有竖琴
And of course, the harp.

23
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,126
最后是打击乐部
And finally
the percussion family,

24
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,501
鼓，锣，还有你敲的东西
all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.

25
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,667
之后，你会听到所有四个部一起
After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell

26
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:18,667
按主旋律原来的形式再演奏一遍
played once more in its original
form by all four families together.

27
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:21,042
这就是整个交响乐团
That is, the whole orchestra.

28
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,042
这就是新潘赞斯岛
This is
the island of New Penzance.

29
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,292
16英里长
16 miles long.

30
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,459
满布老松树和枫树
Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.

31
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:58,209
浅溪流在其间交错
Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.

32
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,709
Chickchaw聚居区
Chickchaw territory.

33
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,292
没有公路，但是……
There are no
paved roads, but...

34
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,584
送信的来了
Here comes Jed
with the mail.

35
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,709
但是有长长的交错的足迹和土路
But instead many
miles of intersecting footpaths and dirt trails,

36
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,834
还有从石洞每天往返两次的渡轮
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

37
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,167
现在是1965年
The year is 1965.

38
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,209
我们在Black Beacon Sound的远端
We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,

39
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,959
这地方因为有记录在案的猛烈风暴而出了名
famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,

40
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:28,292
风暴会在9月5日从东部袭击而来
which will
strike from the east on the 5th of September.

41
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,542
就是三天之后
In three days' time.

42
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,959
早，小子
Morning, Gadge.

43
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,334
早，先生
Morning, sir.

44
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,334
Deluca，检查厕所
Deluca,
latrine inspection.

45
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,376
好
Good.

46
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,709
Roosevelt，系绳弄得怎么样？
Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?

47
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,876
太烂了
Horrible.

48
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,709
Skotak，这些木材是干嘛用的？
Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?

49
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,126
我们在搭树屋
We're building a tree house.

50
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,542
- 在哪？
- 就在这
- Where?
- Right here.

51
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,501
这个高度不安全。弄这么高干什么？
That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?

52
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,667
要是有人摔下去，就死定了
If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.

53
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,876
那要是你的话，你建在哪？
Well, where would
you have built it?

54
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,126
低一点的地方
Lower.

55
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,792
Nickleby？你干嘛呢？
Nickleby?
What are you doing?

56
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,501
防控害虫。我在烧蚂蚁
Pest control.
Burning some ants.

57
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,251
抽查啦
Spot check.

58
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,001
袜子没提起来，衬衫没掖进去
Your socks are down,
your shirt tails are untucked,

59
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:54,501
裤子也没扣好
your trousers are
not properly pressed.

60
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:57,042
记你制服违规
You are reported for
a uniform violation.

61
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,292
Panagle，你做了多少火箭？
How many rockets
you up to, Panagle?

62
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,417
十六个半，先生
Sixteen and a half, sir.

63
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,792
够叛乱用了没有？
Is that enough
for the Hullabaloo?

64
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,459
Izod，去军火库再拿一品脱火药
Izod, go fetch another pint of
gunpowder from the armory shed.

65
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,917
Redford！停下！我看见了！
Redford! Halt!
I saw that!

66
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,042
- 你刚刚开多快？
- 我这是为了安全检测，先生
- How fast were you just going?
- Safety test, sir.

67
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,167
再来一遍？
Come again?

68
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,501
这车看起来运转良好
The vehicle
appears to be in good working order,

69
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,667
我就是想检验一下……
I'm just checking if...

70
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,167
鲁莽驾驶，第二次警告
Reckless cycling.
Second warning.

71
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,042
你再这样，我就没收钥匙
Next time,
I take away the keys.

72
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,751
早上好，大厨
Morning, Chef.

73
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:32,959
肃静！
Clear!

74
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,042
少谁？
Who's missing?

75
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,084
- 少谁？
- 沙考斯基
- Who's missing?
- Shakusky.

76
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,292
- 沙考斯基
- 沙考斯基
- Shakusky.
- Shakusky.

77
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,959
沙考斯基！吃早饭啦！
Shakusky! Breakfast!

78
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,584
沙考斯基，人呢？
Shakusky, you in there?

79
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,417

80
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,084
是从里面拉上的
It's zipped from the inside.

81
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:38,209
我的天，他逃了
（肖申克又被黑了-_-）
Jiminy Cricket,
he flew the coop.

82
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,626
你好，我是夏普警长，完毕
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp, over.

Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

84
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,334
早上好，兰迪，我能帮你什么？完毕
Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.

85
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:10,001
我还不确定。我这有个童子军逃跑了。完毕
I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

86
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,126
什么意思？完毕
What does that mean? Over.

87
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,834
我这有个小男孩，好像是偷走了
One of my boys
seems to have stolen

88
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,834
一条小船和一些渔具

10 pounds of sundries,

91
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:23,459
知道为什么吗？完毕

92
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,709

a letter of resignation. Over.

93
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,001
亲爱的沃德童子军长
Dear Scout Master Ward,

94
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,792
我遗憾地告知您，我没法呆在
I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved

95
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,709
北美童子军中
with the Khaki
Scouts of North America.

96
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,001
余下部队应该很高兴听到这个消息
The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.

97
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,126
这不是你的错
It is not your fault.

98
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,792
祝好
萨姆 沙考斯基

99
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,959
呃，我觉得我们还是通知他家人吧，完毕
Well, I guess we better
notify his folks. Over.

100
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,292
好，完毕，结束通话
Okay. Over and out.

101
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:01,626
你好，戴安
Hello, Diane.

102
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,376
贝琪，从Chesterfield的电话
Becky, I have your
person-to-person from Chesterfield

103
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,626
别挂
Hold the line, please.

104
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:08,501
喂？
Hello?

105
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,334
你好，先生 我是夏普警长
Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.

106
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,751
是，先生，我收到你的消息了，非常感谢
Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.

107
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:17,292
我们以家庭名义做出了决定
In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,

108
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:21,542
因为在萨姆闹出的这么多乱子当中这才只是最近的一个意外
because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,

109
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,751
而且对其他人也不公平，所以，很遗憾
and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

110
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,209
这个时候我们不能让他回来
we can't invite him
back at this time.

111
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:34,376
不是警告，先生。我们会找到他的
There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.

112
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,167
我们只是礼节性地通知您
We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.

113
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:40,542
我明白，我是告诉您我这边的情况
I understand that.
I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.

114
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,584
你这么就把我说糊涂了。你不能把他带回来？
I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?

115
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,542
恐怕不行。他是个好孩子，心地很好
I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.

116
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,334
但这样对其他人不公平，明白吗？
But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?

117
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,292
他情绪混乱
He's emotionally disturbed.

118
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,667
您是萨姆的父亲吗？
Am I speaking
with Sam's father?

119
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,417
不是，先生
No, sir.

120
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:05,709
萨姆的父母几年前去世了
Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.

121
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,834
我们是比林斯利夫妇，养父母
We're Mr. and
Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents.

122
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,042
从去年六月萨姆就在我们家住
Sam's been with
us since last June.

123
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:14,959
打扰了，先生 我是童子军长沃德
Excuse me, sir.
This is Scout Master Ward speaking.

124
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,792
你是说萨姆是个孤儿？
Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?

125
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,459
嗯，这是事实。当然。
Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.

126
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,667
那他登记的时候怎么不他妈的说清楚？
Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?

127
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,834
抱歉我说脏话了
Excuse my language.

128
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,167
我不清楚 什么登记？
I don't know.
What register?

129
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,876
我们给他寄了封信，现在你们应该收到了
We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.

130
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,042
比林斯利先生，有个童子军失踪了
Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.

131
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,417
我们礼节性地通知您
We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.

132
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:39,709
你说你不能让他回来？他是孤儿？
You say you can't
invite him back? You say that he's an orphan?

133
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,042
我不懂这是怎么回事
I don't understand
how that works.

134
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,667
那我拿他怎么办？
What am I supposed
to do with him?

135
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,376
这就是社工的事了，他们会联系你的
That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.

136
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,251
他们会照顾萨姆的，祝你好运
They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.

137
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,792
听好指令
You have your orders.

138
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,834
用追踪和寻找足迹的方法
Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills

139
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,501
你们都练了一个夏天了
that you've been
practicing all summer.

140
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:07,459
找到我们的人，把他安全带回营里
Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.

141
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,751
记住了，这可不是什么寻宝
Remember, this isn't
just a search party,

142
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,959
是当一级童子军的机会
it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.

143
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,209
有问题么？
Any questions?

144
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,417
瞌睡虫？
Lazy-Eye?

145
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,084
你真正的工作是什么，先生？
What's your real job, sir?

146
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,959
- 我是数学老师。问这个干什么？
- 教几年级？
- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?

147
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,751
- 初二
- 你要拿博士学位么？
- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?

148
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,167
不用，瞌睡虫，但是你注意了
Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,

149
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,792
我们现在在干正事
we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.

150
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,001
我们中间有人失踪了，很危险
One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.

151
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,126
还有人有问题吗？Redford？
Anybody else?
Redford?

152
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,292
他要是拒捕怎么办？
What if he resists?

153
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,459
- 谁？
- 沙考斯基
- Who?
- Shakusky.

154
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,584
我们能对他采取强制措施么？
Are we allowed to
use force on him?

155
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,834
不行。这是非暴力营救行动
No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.

156
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:39,292
你的任务就是找到他，无论如何也不能伤害他
Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.

157
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,251
懂了没？
Am I making
myself understood?

158
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:43,126
- 是
- 很好
- Yes.
- Good.

159
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,292
我要重新回答一下，现在这就是我真实的工作
I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.

160
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:50,959
童子军55营长。除此之外我是个教数学的
Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.

161
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,792
机灵点。好不好？
Be leery out there. Okay?

162
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,292
现在开始吧。谁看见史努比了？
Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?

163
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,709
在这
Right here.

164
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,126
让他闻一闻
Give him the scent.

165
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,959
我听说他逃跑是因为他父母死了
I heard he ran away
because his family died.

166
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,334
我听说他从来没有家
I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

167
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,751
估计就因为这个他才不正常
That's probably
why he's crazy.

168
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:09,959
告诉你们
I'll tell you one thing,

169
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,792
如果咱们找到他了，我可不要成为那个忘了带武器的
if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.

170
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,834
我也不要
Me, neither.

171
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,959
Ivanhoe营，那可是在岛的另一边
Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.

172
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,292
你真的觉得一个12岁小孩
You really think
a 12-year-old boy

173
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,334
用这么小的船能划那么远？
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

174
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,459
不太可能
Most likely not.

175
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,001
有这个可能，管理员
It is possible, Counselor.

176
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,292
我不同意，管理员。他得至少划上三天
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

177
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,834
我不同意。两天最多了
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

178
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,167
- 我不和你争这个了
- 不管这个了
- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,

179
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,209
- 你发现什么异常情况就告诉我，好吗？
- 好
- will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
- Yup.

180
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:32,126
童子军长日志，9月2日
Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.

181
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,626
寻找萨姆 沙考斯基第一天
First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky

182
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,292
士气低迷
Morale is extremely low,

183
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,417
我觉得也许是
in part, I suppose,

184
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,792
因为萨姆是最不受欢迎的一个童子军
because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.

185
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,251
他比其他人都不受欢迎的多
By a significant margin.

186
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,626
我困惑又着急
I'm confused
and I'm worried.

187
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,626
保佑我们明天能找到他吧
Please let us
find him tomorrow.

188
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,042
不要让他摔下悬崖
Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,

189
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:56,334
淹死在哪个倒霉湖里什么的
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.

190
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,001
Ivanhoe营糟糕的一天
A terrible day
at Camp Ivanhoe.

191
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,876
希望明天能变更好
Let's hope
tomorrow's better.

192
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,126
一年前
One Year earlier

193
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,459
你是什么鸟？
What kind of bird are you?

194
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,709
我是麻雀，她是鸽子
I'm a sparrow,
she's a dove...

195
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,959
不是，我是说，你是哪种鸟？
No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?

196
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,417
我是渡鸦
I'm a raven.

197
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,959
男生不许进来
Boys aren't
allowed in here.

198
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,709
我马上就走
I'll be leaving soon.

199
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,042
你的手怎么了？
What happened to your hand?

200
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,834
砸镜子砸的
I got hit in the mirror.

201
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,667
真的？怎么弄的？
Really, how did that happen?

202
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,876
我发脾气了
I lost my temper at myself.

203
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,459
你叫什么？
What's your name?

204
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,792
萨姆。你呢？
Sam. What's yours?

205
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,626
苏西
I'm Suzy.

206
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,709
瞪着人不礼貌
It's not polite to stare.

207
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,417
鸟儿们，准备好了吗？你是谁？
Birds, ready?
Who are you?

208
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,042
从哪冒出来的？回座位上去
Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.

209
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,917
他喜欢你哎
He likes you.

210
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,542
你被跟踪了没？
Were you followed?

211
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,542
- 应该没有
- 很好
- I doubt it.
- Good.

212
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,334
那里面是只猫吗？
Is that a cat in there?

213
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,834
- 你会看地图吗？
- 嗯哼
- Can you read a map?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,417
我画了地图
I do cartography.

215
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,626
我觉得我们应该今天走到半路，明天走另一半
I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow

216
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,126
因为你没什么远足经验
since you're a less
experienced hiker,

217
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,251
你还穿着周末学校的鞋子
and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.

218
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,376
这不是周末学校的鞋子
They're not really
Sunday school shoes.

219
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,501
给
Here.

220
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,626
哦，谢谢
Oh, thank you.

221
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,667
我们现在在这
Here's where
we are right now.

222
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,876
我想16点前在这扎营
I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,

223
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,792
就是四点。怎么样？
which means 4:00.
How does that sound?

224
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,792
- 好
- 想要点牛肉干么？
- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?

225
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,292
- 好
- 走吧
- Okay.
- Let's go.

226
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,501
渴不渴？
Are you thirsty?

227
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:28,959
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

228
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,126
如果你口干舌燥
Well, if your throat
gets parched,

229
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:33,001
就在嘴里放块鹅卵石，然后吸它
stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.

230
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,959
用口水就能解渴了，应该是这样
You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.

231
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,542
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

232
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:40,417
有时候我在头上粘叶子，能让你的头降温
Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.

233
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,542
嗯，是个好主意
Hmm. That's a good idea.

234
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,959
如果你没戴皮毛帽子，这样也能取暖
It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.

235
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,001
对
Yeah. True.

236
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,584
你可以走了，小心
You can go ahead.
Be careful.

237
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,459
有个小窍门，往天上扔松枝
Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air

238
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,459
你就能看见风往哪边吹
and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.

239
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,084
哪边走？
Which Way?

240
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,001
我觉得不要紧
I guess it
doesn't really matter,

241
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,376
只要我们能把足迹掩盖掉
just as long as we
cover our tracks.

242
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,876
你闻起来有香水味
You smell like perfume.

243
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,376
哦，是我妈妈的
Oh, it's my mother's.

244
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,792
嗯 嗯
Hmm. Hmm.

245
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,167
我带水了
I brought water, too.

246
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,167
- 你在这等
- 好
- You wait here.
- Okay.

247
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,792
我马上就回
Be right back.

248
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,167
小心头顶
Watch your head!

249
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,626
这是什么玩意？
Where the hell is it?

250
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,001
找到了！
Found it!

251
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:29,917
好了
It's ready.

252
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,376
他知道有人在看他
He knows someone's
watching him.

253
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:37,042
同意。等等，你为什么这么说
I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?

254
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,251
嗯……不知道，我就是觉得他能感觉到我们的存在
Mmm... I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.

255
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,209
跟我走
Follow me.

256
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,292
你游泳有多好？
How strong of
a swimmer are you?

257
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:20,126
很好。我破了我们学校的仰泳纪录呢
Pretty good.
I broke our school record for the backstroke.

258
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,792
好吧，嗯，我游泳没那么好，所以我穿救生衣
Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.

259
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:30,834
小心有乌龟
Watch out for turtles.

260
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,417
如果你把手放进它们嘴里，它们就会咬你的
They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.

261
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,084
好吧
Okay.

262
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,876
让我看看能不能抓住这只
Let me see if I
can catch this one.

263
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,209
感觉到了
Feel something.

264
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,126
嗯
Hmm...

265
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:48,501
有人在它身上写字了
Somebody wrote on him.

266
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,542
鱼竿动了
The stick's moving.

267
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,792
钓到了！
You got one!

268
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:56,792
上钩啦！把线卷回来，慢一点
Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.

269
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:07,667
嗯
Mmm.

270
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:13,501
很好吃。你很懂露营，对不对？
Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?

271
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:18,459
我是个受过训练的童子军。呃，是这样，我以前是
I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.

272
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,959
可以把内脏和眼球拿来喂猫
Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.

273
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,709
哦，不用了 他只吃猫粮
Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.

274
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:27,126
哦
Oh.

275
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,542
你还带了什么？没准我们可以做点什么出来
What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.

276
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,501
好
Okay.

277
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,084
来吧
Go ahead.

278
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,126
这是我的唱机，放上电池才能用
This is my record player.
It works with batteries.

279
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,584
呃，实际上，是我弟弟莱昂内尔的
Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

280
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,126
- 我给他留了张条
- 好的
- I left him a note.
- Okay.

281
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,084
- 你喜欢音乐？
- 嗯
- Do you like music?
- Yeah.

282
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,167
这是我最喜欢的唱片
This is my
favorite record album.

283
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,251
我教母给我的生日礼物
My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.

284
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,084
她住在法国
She lives in France.

285
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:05,501
这些是我的书，我喜欢有魔力的故事
These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.

286
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:08,042
地球上的王国，或者外星上的
Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.

287
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:11,251
我喜欢女英雄的故事，但不总是这样
Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.

288
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,459
我没法把书都带着，太沉了
I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.

289
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,667
你要是想要，可以借给你
You can borrow any you want.

290
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:15,792
谢谢
Thank you.

291
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:20,751
我还带了左撇子剪刀，因为我是个左撇子
I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,

292
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:25,376
皮筋，备用电池，牙刷
some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,

293
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,542
还有，望远镜，你看见了
and my binoculars,
as you know.

294
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,667
嗯
Yeah.

295
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,959
我忘带梳子了，但是用手就行
I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.

296
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,376
嗯
Huh.

297
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:42,667
等等，这些可都是图书馆的书
Wait, these are all
library books.

298
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,667
在我们学校，一次只能借一本
In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.

299
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:49,959
有些都要到期了
Some of these are
going to be overdue.

300
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,084
你偷的？
Do you steal?

301
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,376
为什么？你又不穷
Why? You're not poor.

302
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:02,251
我可能某一天会还一部分，我还不确定呢
I might turn some of
them back in one day. I haven't decided yet.

303
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,917
我知道这样不好。我觉得我偷书只是为了有秘密
I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.

304
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,667
不管怎样，出于某种原因
Anyway,
for some reason,

305
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,417
有时候这样能让我心情更好
it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.

306
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,626
你抑郁？
Are you depressed?

307
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,626
怎么？
How come?

308
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:18,001
如果你愿意我可以给你举个例子
Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,

309
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,751
但我不太好受
but it doesn't make
me feel very good.

310
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:26,167
管他呢。这是我家冰箱上面发现的
（书：如何与问题儿童相处）
Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.

311
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,584
指的是你？
Does that mean you?

312
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,126
应该是
I think so.

313
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,709
你在笑？
Are you laughing?

314
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,126
这不好笑
It's not funny.

315
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,417
你还真懂怎么交朋友
You really know
how to make friends.

316
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,626
抱歉
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,792
哦，没事
Oh. It's okay.

318
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,792
我支持你
I'm on your side.

319
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,584
我知道
I know.

320
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,042
谢谢
Thank you.

321
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,584
哪本最好？
Which one's the best?

322
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,834
他眼睛低垂，他的王国成为废墟，Mynar把他沉重的爪子
"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw

323
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,876
伸过浅滩波动的表面
"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows

324
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,584
触到石质的河床
"and down to its stone floor.

325
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,751
我的人民曾经被伟大而高贵的野兽领导着
"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast

326
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:43,042
而我在这倒影里再也看不到他的样子
"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'

327
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:01,001
与此同时，Francine栖息在Tabitha的平原上
"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested.

328
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,042
还会有另一次战争的
"There would be
another time for war."

329
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,542
苏西，吃饭啦！叫你最后一遍！
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.

330
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,334
你们姐姐呢？
Where's your sister?

331
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,751
不知道，但是她连问都没问就借我唱机10天
I don't know, but she borrowed
my record player for 10 days without asking.

332
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,501
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

333
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:22,001
亲爱的莱昂内尔，我需要用你的唱机
Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.

334
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:25,626
我十天之内还给你，不要告诉妈妈爸爸
I will give it back
in 10 days or less. Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.

335
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,917
我换了电池还给你。签名，苏西 毕肖普
I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.

336
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:33,459
沃特！你跑哪去了！
Walt! Where the hell are you?

337
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,667
在这呢
Right here!

338
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,667
你冲我喊什么？
Why are you cursing at me?

339
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,417
你女儿离家出走了你都不管？
Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?

340
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:43,876
你怎么知道她离家出走了
That's a loaded question.

341
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,709
下来看这个
Come down and read this.

342
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:49,001
童子军长沃德确定，他们没有运气
Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.

343
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,126
他们就会回家……
They're going home for...

344
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,292
那是谁？
Who's there?

345
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:02,084
晚上好，抱歉吓你一跳
Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.

346
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,709
你在这干嘛？没人报警
What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.

347
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,084
我知道 呃……
我知道
I know. Uh...
I know.

348
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,584
搜寻活动还没结束。换句话说
The search party's
not over yet. In other words...

349
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,834
苏西也丢了！快去找
Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.

350
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,084
上周在英属洪都拉斯海岸形成的
The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week

351
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,001
热带气旋急速增强
off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly

352
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,667
成为Mabeline飓风
and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.

353
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,459
请持续关注后续报道
Stay tuned for
further information

354
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:34,376
我们怎么帮她？她有那么多麻烦
How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.

355
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,876
更糟了
It's getting worse.

356
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,167
是谁的错？
Whose fault is it?

357
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,376
我不知道
I don't know.

358
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:44,876
但是，记录在案的是，95%的离家出走的人在六个小时之内
But just for the record
95 % of all runaways

359
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,834
就都跑回了家
return home within
the first six hours.

360
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,417
这些现在都没用。只是统计数字
That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.

361
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,292
但也有可能，苏西没准藏在她最好朋友家
But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet

362
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,667
的衣柜里玩中国象棋呢
at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers

363
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,084
就现在我们说话这会儿
at this very moment,
as we speak.

364
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,376
她没有一个朋友
She doesn't have any friends.

365
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,251
劳拉怎么样？
How's Laura?

366
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,834
什么“劳拉怎么样”
"How's Laura?"

367
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,459
毕肖普太太，我是说
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

368
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,126
我不懂
I don't understand.

369
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:13,584
她很失落？
Is she upset?

370
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,376
有只豪猪
There's a porcupine.

371
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:43,459
她有个笔友！很私密，他们一起计划逃跑的
She has a pen pal!
It's very intimate. They planned this together.

372
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:47,751
萨姆 沙考斯基
那是我那逃跑的童子军
Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.

373
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,917
他家人都死了
His family died.

374
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:51,001
我的天哪，这是什么
Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?

375
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:54,417
他画水彩。大部分是风景，也有几张裸体
He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.

376
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,542
这画的是她？
She sit for this?

377
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,667
他说什么了？
What's he say?

378
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,459
亲爱的苏西，你的声音太美了
Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.

379
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,834
你是我在这个节目里到目前为止最喜欢的动物
You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.

380
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,251
你在信封里找……
Please find enclosed...

381
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,001
亲爱的萨姆
非常感谢
Dear Sam,
thank you very much.

382
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,834
因为我冲着林恩太太大喊，我换成了渡鸦
I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.

383
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,667
在那之后，我只是只蓝鸟
After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...

384
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:14,584
亲爱的苏西，很遗憾你的弟弟们这么自私
Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.

385
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,042
也许长大了就不这样了
Maybe they will
grow out of it.

386
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:18,626
有时候人们会无意识地做出……
Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...

387
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,459
亲爱的萨姆，你是个优秀的画家
Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,

388
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,251
尤其是画树和电线杆
especially trees
and telephone poles.

389
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:25,417
水里的女孩是我吗？我最喜欢的颜色……
Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...

390
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:29,209
亲爱的苏西，我梦游的时候不小心点着了火
Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.

391
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,417
我记不清了，但是我养父母说我骗人
I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.

392
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,542
不幸的是……
Unfortunately, it is...

393
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,626
亲爱的萨姆，我又惹麻烦了
Dear Sam,
I am in trouble again

394
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,209
因为我冲着窗户扔石头
because I threw a rock
through the window.

395
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,709
我妈妈到现在头发里还有玻璃，还有……
My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...

396
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,292
亲爱的苏西，我有非常努力地交朋友
Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,

397
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,834
但我觉得别人不喜欢我的性格
but I feel people do
not like my personality.

398
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,751
其实我能理解他们为什么不……
In fact, I can understand
why they might not...

399
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,751
亲爱的萨姆，现在我被停学了
Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended

400
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,334
因为我和莫莉打了一架
because I got in
a fight with Molly.

401
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,417
她说我是个疯子，我们校长也不向着我。为什么有人……
She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...

402
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,834
亲爱的苏西，我知道你父母伤害了你的感情
Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,

403
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:58,917
但他们还是爱你的。这个更重要。如果他们……
but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...

404
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,667
亲爱的萨姆
我觉得你确实应该
Dear Sam,
I do think you should

405
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:01,917
每天想起他们的脸
think of their
faces every day,

406
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,459
就算是这样会让你很伤心
even if it makes you sad.

407
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,001
好遗憾他们没有留给你
It is too bad they
did not leave you

408
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,001
更多他们的画。你能不能……
more pictures of themselves.
Can you...

409
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:09,001
亲爱的苏西，这是我的计划
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

410
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:11,084
亲爱的萨姆，我同意
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

411
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,584
亲爱的苏西，什么时候？
Dear Suzy, when?

412
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,251
亲爱的萨姆，在哪？
Dear Sam, where?

413
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:17,834
亲爱的苏西，从你家往北走400码
Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house

414
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,459
走到那条没名的土路
to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.

415
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:24,417
右拐走到头。我在草地和你会合
Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.

416
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,501
天，你觉得他会怎么样？
Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?

417
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:38,001
我不知道，他应该是天黑的时候出去找人了
I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.

418
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,042
她把我手电筒里的电池都偷了
She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.

419
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:43,667
偷手电筒里的电池……
Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...

420
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,084
我觉得他是冲着我们来的
I think he's onto us.

421
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,376
当然了
Of course he is.

422
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:48,959
当然了？
Of course he is?

423
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:50,792
当然了
Of course he is.

424
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:54,834
那为什么我们不担心？
Then why aren't we
worried about that?

425
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,542
我担心着呢
I am.

426
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,251
我不知道了
Well, I didn't know.

427
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:01,709
或者，我觉得我搞错了
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

428
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,834
你打他了？
Did you hit him?

429
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,042
没有，他摔进沟里了
No. He fell in a ditch.

430
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:08,751
嘿！有猫粮！我觉得这是线索
Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.

431
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,584
那是她的
That's her.

432
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,917
他要去哪
Where's he going?

433
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,167
我不知道
I don't know.

434
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,376
好吧，我们知道了他俩是在一起的
All right,
we know they're together.

435
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,667
我们知道了他俩就在这方圆不远距离内
We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.

436
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:28,001
我要向县里报案
I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.

437
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,584
到有人来帮忙之前，我任命这个小孩，瘦的这个
Until help arrives,
I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one,

438
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,084
还有蒙眼的这个小孩
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

439
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,501
和我到警车里来
to come with me in
the station wagon.

440
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:37,667
兰迪，你顺便和余下部队去河边
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

441
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,001
分头步行
split up on foot.

442
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,167
贝琪，你叫杰德绕着
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

443
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,709
岛的这一头低飞
this end of the island
and fly low.

444
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,251
这是他们？
Is it them?

445
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,376
是，是
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,834
他们找到了营火
They found the campfire.

447
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:05,751
老鼠！我应该多放些松针的。走吧
Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.

448
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,334
小心
Be careful.

449
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,084
你们这些疯子想干嘛？
What do you creeps want?

450
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,292
我们在找你
We're looking for you.

451
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:50,376
为什么？
Why?

452
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,334
嗯，因为你逃跑了
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

453
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,667
没有。我退出童子军了
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

454
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,167
那也没用。你没那个权力
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

455
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,542
我们被任命来找你
We've been deputized.

456
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:01,876
你是服服帖帖跟我们走，还是要怎样？
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

457
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,334
听我说理由
Listen to some reason.

458
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,501
我不喜欢你们，你们也不喜欢我
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

459
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,292
那你们为什么不干脆让我们消失？
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

460
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:15,167
嗯，很有诱惑力，但是我们不准这样
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

461
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,584
你知道，你不应该和他交朋友
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

462
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,459
为什么？
Why not?

463
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,334
因为他是个疯子
Because he's crazy.

464
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,251
你可能只是不了解他
Maybe you just
don't know him.

465
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,501
实际上我们比你了解得多
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

466
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,501
他情绪紊乱，因为他家人都死了
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

467
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,292
Nickelby，把他绑起来
Nickleby, tie him up.

468
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:40,209
你敢越过这根树枝一步
Do not cross this stick.

469
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,542
你死定了，沙考斯基
You're doomed, Shakusky.

470
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,667
莫莉说得对，我是疯了
Molly's right,
I do go berserk.

471
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,626
还好是他，不然我们就死定了
It was him or us.

472
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,334
哦，不
Oh, no.

473
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,334
她用左撇子剪刀戳了Redford的后背
She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.

474
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,084
请再说一遍 完毕
Repeat that, please? Over.

475
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,334
他受了刺伤，在腰下面
在机舱里挪点地方放担架
Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.

476
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:51,959
你会没事的
You're going to be okay.

477
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:55,001
谢天谢地她没戳中动脉。咬着这个
Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.

478
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:56,917
我想砍他的，但是他躲开了我的斧头
I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.

479
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,501
他枪法太好了
He's got
excellent marksmanship.

480
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,792
把Deluca两条胳膊都打中了
Shot Deluca in both arms.

481
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:02,167
我觉得我们要错过叛乱了
I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.

482
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:03,584
史努比呢？
Where's Snoopy?

483
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,876
这些混蛋
Those sons of bitches.

484
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,542
他们打穿了他的脖子
They got him right
through the neck.

485
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,209
他是条好狗吗
Was he a good dog?

486
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,917
谁知道呢。但他不该死
Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.

487
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,167
怎么了？那是谁？
What happened?
Who is that?

488
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:37,334
把码头清开，埃德加
Clear the dock, Edgar!

489
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,001
- 他怎么流血了？
- 苏西和你在一起吗？
- Why is he bleeding?
- Is Suzy with you?

490
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,792
不，她和沙考斯基在树林里
No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.

491
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:41,917
我要去哪？
Where am I going?

492
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:44,917
黎巴嫩堡的治疗室。我们就在你后面。知道了吗？
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?

493
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,126
嗯
Yup.

494
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:47,501
发动机打上火，我马上就回
Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.

495
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:48,876
不许动
Hold it right there!

496
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,042
你不许离开这座岛
You're not
leaving this island.

497
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:54,001
咱们的女儿被一个疯子童子军拐走了
Our daughter has been
abducted by one of these beige lunatics.

498
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,459
沃特，这很明显
Walt, it's very clear.

499
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,501
这两个人密谋私奔了
The two of them
conspired in this together.

500
00:38:58,584 --> 00:38:59,917
别着急，毕肖普先生 她会没事的
Don't worry,
Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

501
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,292
萨姆很会伪装
Sam's got excellent
wilderness skills.

502
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,417
你怎么不管好你的童子军？
Why can't you
control your Scouts?

503
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,542
我很努力啊
Well, I'm trying.

504
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,667
哇 哇 嘿
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

505
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,834
停下 停下
Stop it! Stop it!

506
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,501
- 停下
- 停下
- Stop it!
- Stop it.

507
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:19,251
我确实怪他。但是我也怪我自己和你们俩
I do blame him.
But I also blame myself and both of you.

508
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:23,834
恕我直言，你可不能让你孩子捅人
With all due respect,
you can't let your children stab people.

509
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,459
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

510
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,167
她有暴力倾向，毕肖普太太，这是袭击
She's violent,
Mrs. Bishop, it's assault.

511
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,376
- 你是律师？
- 不我不是律师
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not a lawyer.

512
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,584
哈，我们可是！
Well, we are!

513
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,751
把你手从我老婆身上拿下来
Take your hands
off my wife!

514
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:35,584
放开她
Take them off!

515
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:40,417
抱歉，抱歉，夏普警长
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Sharp!

516
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,376
你们有些人知道，我教萨姆
As some of you know,
I taught Sam

517
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:48,751
得到了绘地图技术的勋章
for the cartography
accomplishment button.

518
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,167
他是个聪明的孩子，表现出对
He's a smart boy
and he expressed a keen interest

519
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,792
岛上土著人历史的兴趣
in the history of the island's
indigenous peoples.

520
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:57,334
我还记得他对古Chickchaw人收获季迁徙
In particular,
I recall his fascination with the idea

521
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:01,709
的遗迹特别感兴趣
of retracing the original
path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration.

522
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:09,917
我是说，我知道他们会往哪走
What I'm getting at is this.
I think I know where they're going.

523
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,876
在鸟舍
Onto the birdhouse,

524
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:20,042
所有你能想象得到的鸟儿
where every kind
of bird imaginable

525
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,209
都在旋转的地方
is whirling
and wheeling around.

526
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,709
这是我们的地盘
This is our land!

527
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,417
是的
Yes, it is!

528
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,626
喔
Whoo!

529
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,709
喔
Whoo!

530
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:37,834
跑啊
Run!

531
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,792
跳吧
Let's jump!

532
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:21,876
数到三
On three!

533
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,001
一，二，三
One, two, three!

534
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:38,542
你们有谁曾经很辛苦地练习钢琴的
Any of you who have ever
had to sweat through piano exercises

535
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,792
就会同情这些……
will sympathize with these...

536
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:52,001
我喜欢这里，但我不喜欢这个名字
I like it here,
but I don't like the name.

537
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,501
我也不喜欢
Me, neither.

538
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:58,417
3.25里潮汐湾
这也不是环形的
"Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"
It's got no ring to it.

539
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,417
换个名字吧
叫什么呢
Let's change it.
What should it be?

540
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,376
让我想一会
Let me think
for a minute.

541
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,542
我给你做了些首饰
I made you some jewelry.

542
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,626
你耳朵有洞么
Are your ears pierced?

543
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:33,917
很漂亮
It's pretty.

544
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,209
另一只也戴上
Do the other one.

545
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,751
为什么你总拿着望远镜？
Why do you
always use binoculars?

546
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,084
让我能更近地看东西，即使是不太远的东西也可以
It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.

547
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,001
我假装这是我的特异功能
I pretend it's
my magic power.

548
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,376
嗯
Hmm.

549
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,376
听着就像一首诗
That sounds like poetry.

550
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,417
诗歌不总是押韵的，你知道
Poems don't always
have to rhyme, you know.

551
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,126
就该有创造性
They're just
supposed to be creative.

552
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,959
那你长大了想干什么？
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

553
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:15,917
不知道，我想去冒险，我觉得
I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.

554
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,834
不能总呆在一个地方。你呢？
Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?

555
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:24,584
我也想去冒险。我也不想呆在一个地方
Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.

556
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:27,459
但是我们没法预见未来
Anyway, we can't
predict the exact future.

557
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:29,417
是啊
That's true.

558
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,001
顺便说一句，我有可能尿床的，晚上，我是说
It's possible I may
wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.

559
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,334
没事
Okay.

560
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,167
我希望我不需要提起这事，但就是以防万一
I wish I didn't
have to mention it, but just in case.

561
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,751
我不想让你觉得被冒犯
I don't want to
make you be offended.

562
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,876
当然不会
Of course I won't.

563
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,167
那个是干吗用的？
What's that one for?

564
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,626
- 这个？
- 对
- This?
- Yeah.

565
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,501
这不是勋章
It's not
an accomplishment button.

566
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:54,459
我妈妈传给我的
I inherited it
from my mother.

567
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:58,334
不应该是男生戴的，但我才不管呢
It's not actually meant for a male to
wear, but I don't give a damn.

568
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,501
你养父母还因为你总惹麻烦
Are your foster parents
still mad at you,

569
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:04,459
而生你的气吗
for getting in
trouble so much?

570
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,876
不了
I don't think so.

571
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,959
我们开始更加了解对方了
We're starting to get to
know each other better.

572
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,042
我感觉到我在一个真正的家庭里
I feel I'm in
a real family now.

573
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,042
和你家不一样，但是差不多了
Not like yours,
but similar to one.

574
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:16,667
我总是希望自己是个孤儿
I always wished
I was an orphan.

575
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,917
我喜欢的角色大部分都是
Most of my
favorite characters are.

576
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,959
我觉得你的生活更特别
I think your lives
are more special.

577
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,959
我爱你，但是你不知道你在说什么
I love you, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,084
我也爱你
I love you, too.

579
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,001
- 我嘴里有沙子
- 哦
- I've got sand in my mouth.
- Oh.

580
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:38,209
呃……你会法式舌吻吗？
Uh... Can you French kiss?

581
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,376
应该会吧。有什么秘诀么？
I think so.
Is there any secret to it?

582
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,542
要碰到对方的舌头
The tongues touch each other.

583
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,334
好，试试看
Okay, let's try it.

584
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,251
感觉很硬
It feels hard.

585
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:01,167
你介意吗？
Do you mind?

586
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:02,292
我喜欢
I like it.

587
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,417
把你的头歪到一边
Tilt your head sideways.

588
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:16,292
你可以摸我的胸
You can touch my chest.

589
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,209
我……我觉得他们开始长了
I... I think they're
going to grow more.

590
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,376
手电筒的光束把月光从黑暗中引出来
"The flashlight's
beam drew a moon through the black

591
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,084
穿过阁楼，落在护壁板的缝隙中
"across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard.

592
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,792
一个没有怀表大的老鼠洞
"A mouse hole,
no bigger than a pocket watch.

593
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,751
平足的埃里克蹲下来
"Eric crouched
on his flat feet

594
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:41,917
把他的手放在那细小的开口前面
"and placed his hand in
front of the tiny opening.

595
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:43,251
起风了，他说
"'It's windy,' he said.

596
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,667
就像有人在往我手上吹气
"'Like someone in there's
blowing on my fingers.'

597
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,959
克里斯蒂翻翻眼睛，叹了口气
"Christy rolled her
eyes and sighed a sigh.

598
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:49,709
他又说对了，她想
"'He's right again,'
she thought.

599
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,459
小男孩让人发疯
"'Little brothers
drive people crazy."'

600
00:46:57,626 --> 00:46:59,126
我听着呢，继续念
I'm listening. Read on.

601
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:02,584
第二部分
Part two.

602
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,459
不！
No!

603
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,084
亲爱的萨姆，很伤心写这封信给你
Dear Sam, it saddens
me to write this letter,

604
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,167
但比林斯利太太和我决定
but Mrs. Billingsley
and I have decided

605
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,251
我们不能让你回我们家了
we cannot permit you
to return to our home.

606
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:25,042
我知道你本意是好的，但是相信我，这是为了你好
I know you mean well.
Do trust me, this is for the best.

607
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:27,376
祝好
赫伯特 比林斯利
Godspeed,
Herbert Billingsley.

608
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:43,626
听好了，你们俩再也不会见到对方了
Be advised, the two of you will
never see each other again.

609
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:47,584
这些就是临别赠言了 懂了没？
Those were your last words.
Do you understand?

610
00:48:48,084 --> 00:48:49,626
如果我是你，我会小心
I'd be careful
if I were you.

611
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:52,042
这几天，有人走得太远了
One of these days,
somebody's going to get pushed too far,

612
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,876
谁知道他们能做什么
and who knows what
they're capable of.

613
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:55,792
这是在威胁吗？
Is that a threat?

614
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,334
这是在警告
It's a warning.

615
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,334
你是我们家的叛徒
You're a traitor
to our family.

616
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,126
真好。我倒想当叛徒呢
Good. I want to be.

617
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:23,376
我很抱歉 我不知道你的情况
I'm sorry about this.
I didn't know your situation.

618
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,501
你登记的时候没说
It wasn't in the register.

619
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,751
你父母是怎么死的？
How'd you lose your parents?

620
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:32,876
算了，我不需要问这个的
Never mind, I don't
need to ask about that.

621
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:41,459
我希望我们能有时间回去在海边巡查
I wish we had time
to do an inspection back there. On the beach.

622
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,667
我会表扬你的
I would have given
you a commendable.

623
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:47,876
你做的是我看到过的最好的营房之一了
That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.

624
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:49,084
说真的
Honestly.

625
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,501
谢谢
Thank you

626
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:56,126
你不想再当童子军了吗？
You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?

627
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,001
喂，贝琪
Hello, Becky?

628
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:13,334
朱迪，从新潘赞斯打来的电话
Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.

629
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,459
继续，新潘赞斯
Go ahead, New Penzance.

630
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:16,584
喂，我是夏普警长
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp.

631
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,042
你好，夏普警长 这里是社会服务部
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

632
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,709
我打电话是问萨姆 沙考斯基的事，他是被监护人
I'm calling in
reference to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state.

633
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,959
我知道他现在在你的监护下
I understand he's
in your custody.

634
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:24,167
对
That's correct.

635
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:26,084
他情况怎样？他有受伤
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

636
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,417
或者遭到心理创伤吗？
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

637
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,251
- 他很好
- 很好
- He's fine.
- Very good.

638
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:31,667
我怎么去找你？
How do I get to you?

639
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,292
最快的方式是海上飞机
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

640
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,959
杰德可以把你和信一起送来
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

641
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,959
如果你同意，我明早过来
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

642
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,834
有人能在这孩子成年之前
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

643
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,542
好好看护和抚养他吗？
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

644
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,251
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

645
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:43,792
你是在说是吗？
Is that a yes?

646
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,251
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

647
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,834
很好，我今天晚上之前会再联系你一次
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

648
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,001
等一下
Wait a second.

649
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:52,292
什么？
Yes?

650
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,542
社会服务？
Social Services?

651
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:54,834
夏普警长？
Captain Sharp?

652
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:57,792
他会怎么样？
What's going to
happen to him?

653
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:03,584
呃，正常情况下我们会给他再找一个寄养家庭
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

654
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,792
但我觉得那种方式我们做不到
but that option's no
longer available to us,

655
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,084
从他的档案来看是这样的
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

656
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,417
也就是说，他会去少管所
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

657
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,334
等等。这是什么意思？孤儿院么？
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

658
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,042
是谁？
Who's speaking?

659
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:17,209
我是童子军营长兰迪 沃德
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

660
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,251
对，是孤儿院
Right, an orphanage.

661
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,167
但第一步，收容小组
But the first step is
the admissions panel

662
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,917
需要对他进行心理评估
requires
a psychological evaluation

663
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:32,417
来确定这孩子是需要
to determine
whether or not the boy

664
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,459
专业医疗
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

665
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:37,084
还是电休克疗法
or electroshock therapy.

666
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,167
等等。休克疗法？
Excuse me.
Shock therapy?

667
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,417
为什么要对他来这个？他又没有攻击性。
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

668
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:44,417
报告中描述了他用剪刀袭击人
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

669
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,667
那是那女孩
That was the girl.

670
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:46,917
是那女孩干的
That was the girl
that did that.

671
00:51:47,459 --> 00:51:52,501
也许那女孩也需要帮助，但这不是我们的责任，知道了吗？
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

672
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:57,334
好吧
Okay.

673
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,376
我要去后院
I'll be out back.

674
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:39,417
我要找棵树砍掉
I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.

675
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:47,459
我懂你的感受，苏西亲
I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

676
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:51,501
有时候我自己也会问，我在这干什么？
I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?

677
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,042
谁做的决定？
"Who made this decision?

678
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:57,042
我怎么可能允许自己做出这种傻事？
"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?

679
00:52:57,126 --> 00:52:59,459
为什么它还会发生？
"And why is it
still happening?"

680
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:03,126
我们女人更感性
We women are
more emotional...

681
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,626
我恨你
I hate you.

682
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:06,959
不要说恨
Don't say "hate."

683
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,501
为什么？我是说真的
Why not? I mean it.

684
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:12,542
你现在觉得自己说真的，你是在伤害我
You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

685
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,834
就是这样
Exactly.

686
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,542
我知道你和那个可悲的傻警察干了什么
I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.

687
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:26,917
他不傻
He's not dumb.

688
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,167
但是我觉得他有点悲哀
But I guess
he is kind of sad.

689
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,542
不管怎样我们不该讨论这事
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

690
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,542
我连承认我刚刚说过的话
It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge

691
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,126
都不可以
what I already just said.

692
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:49,292
可怜的苏西
Poor Suzy.

693
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,834
为什么生活对你来说这么难呢？
Why is everything
so hard for you?

694
00:53:55,501 --> 00:54:00,501
我们恋爱了。我们只是想在一起，有什么错？
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?

695
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:10,542
哦我的天！我们要怎么把这些鱼钩拿出来？
Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?

696
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,042
我承认我们知道我们惹麻烦了。这是真的
I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.

697
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:21,084
我知道大家会着急的，我们还是私奔了
We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

698
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:24,459
但有些事情发生了，我们不是故意的
But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.

699
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:28,709
当我们第一次遇见的时候就擦出火花了
When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

700
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:31,667
你真会说话
That's very eloquent.

701
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,584
你说什么我都无言以对
I can't argue against
anything you're saying.

702
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:38,417
但是，我没必要反驳。因为你只有12岁
But then again,
I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old.

703
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:43,626
你看，面对现实
Look, let's face it.

704
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:48,834
你应该比我聪明得多
You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.

705
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,876
实际上，我承认
In fact,
I guarantee it.

706
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,792
但聪明的孩子
But even smart kids
stick their finger

707
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:55,459
有时候也会触电
in electrical
sockets sometimes.

708
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,834
懂事是需要时间的
It takes time to
figure things out.

709
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:04,084
历史已经证明了这一点。所有人都会犯错误的
It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.

710
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,417
保护你不做危险行为
It's our job to
try to protect you

711
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,709
是我们的责任，如果我们做得到的话
from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.

712
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,459
想来一杯吗？
You want a slug?

713
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,542
你急什么？
What's your rush?

714
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:28,209
你的人生还长着呢
You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.

715
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,667
长着呢
Ahead of you, I mean.

716
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,542
也许吧。再怎么说。你就是个单身汉
Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.

717
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,042
你也是
So are you.

718
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,167
对
That's true.

719
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,917
你爱过别人吗？
Did you love someone ever?

720
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:44,292
有
Yes, I did.

721
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:45,542
发生什么了？
What happened?

722
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:49,126
她不爱我
She didn't love me back.

723
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:50,667
啊
Ah.

724
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,667
我很遗憾
I'm sorry for your loss.

725
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:58,542
你就该这么说
Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.

726
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,376
童子军长日志 9月4日
Scout Master's log.
September 4th.

727
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:46,209
我听说他要去少管所
I heard he's going
to reform school.

728
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:48,167
我听说他们要拿掉他大脑的一部分
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

729
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,751
然后把他送去疯人院
send him to
an insane asylum.

730
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:50,959
我喜欢他女朋友
I like his girl.

731
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:52,126
我觉得她太邋遢了
She's too scruffy for me.

732
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,417
你说，他们上到三垒了吧
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

733
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,001
没有。他只是搂着她
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

734
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,126
隔着衣服还是没隔衣服？
Over shirt or under shirt?

735
00:56:58,042 --> 00:56:59,292
得了吧
Damn us.

736
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:05,126
不管我们的事
It's none of our business.

737
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:14,334
我们这个军队对萨姆 沙考斯基这个伙伴太烂了
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

738
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:17,292
实际上我们就是一帮刻薄的混蛋
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

739
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:22,667
他为什么这么不受欢迎？
Why's he so unpopular?

740
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:26,042
我承认他情绪紊乱
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

741
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:30,626
但他也是个可怜的孤儿。你会作何感想？
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

742
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:31,792
Nickleby？
Nickleby?

743
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:33,667
Deluca？
Deluca?

744
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:35,417
瞌睡虫？
Lazy-Eye?

745
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:36,959
Gadge？
Gadge?

746
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,709
他是个童子军，他需要我们的帮助
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

747
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,542
我们够不够男人来帮他
Are we man enough
to give that

748
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,709
这样他就不用开脑子了？
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

749
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,251
我们是准备好为彼此牺牲的
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

750
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:56,542
好吧，好吧
你要怎样？
Okay. Okay.
What do you need?

751
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,542
对初学者？
三码铁丝网
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

752
00:57:58,626 --> 00:58:00,876
一些碎报纸，一桶浆糊
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

753
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:30,876
换句话说，完了
In other words, it's over.

754
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:34,751
我觉得是。现在来说
I guess so.
For the moment.

755
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:37,126
等另行通知
Until further notice.

756
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:38,334
对
That's right.

757
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:39,459
我明白
I understand.

758
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:44,251
我需要做更好，为了大家
I have to do better,
for everybody.

759
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:45,792
除了我
Except me.

760
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:47,292
除了你
Except you.

761
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:52,167
我希望你可以。我觉得你能做到
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

762
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,459
你做得对
You're doing
the right thing.

763
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,626
谁知道会发生什么呢，Duffy
Who knows what's
going to happen, Duffy?

764
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:14,459
很可能明天还会见到
I'll probably
see you tomorrow.

765
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,209
滚出我家烟囱
Get out of my chimney.

766
00:59:58,292 --> 00:59:59,459
听我说
Listen to me.

767
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,626
我们很友好
我们是来把你带下这座岛的
We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

768
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:03,792
不用，谢谢
No, thanks.

769
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:06,209
用，谢谢
这是紧急救援
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

770
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:10,251
对我没意义。我不能没有苏西
It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

771
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,209
你们怎么过来的？
How'd you get here?

772
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:18,959
他们把我顺着洗衣槽滑下去
They snuck me down
the laundry chute

773
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,917
在我床上放了个纸人假装是我
and left a papier-mache
dummy in my bed.

774
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,292
嗯……转移策略。聪明。
Hmm... Diversion tactics.
Good thinking.

775
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:42,751
我们要去哪？
Where we going?

776
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:43,876
黎巴嫩堡
Fort Lebanon.

777
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:47,042
我表哥本为叛乱管理着供给前哨
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and
Resources outpost for the Hullabaloo.

778
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:50,376
他是鹰级童子军，是哨兵。他会知道该怎么做的
He's a Falcon Scout,
Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.

779
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:52,001
我们能相信他吗？
Can we trust him?

780
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:53,917
正常情况下，我觉得不能
Normally, I'd say no.

781
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,542
你给莱昂内尔留字条了吗？
Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

782
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:59,709
这回不行。他从来管不住自己的嘴
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

783
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,459
而且，我很有可能再也见不到他了
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

784
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:02,584
对
True.

785
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:22,251
这是圣杰克伍德的岛
This is the island
of St. Jack Wood,

786
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:24,042
从大陆的尽头向北延伸
extending far north
from Land's End

787
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:27,459
沿着深峡直到断岩
along the deep water channel
that leads to Broken Rock.

788
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:35,209
低平的河滩把海岸和小镇分开
A low flood plain
separates the beach from the township above.

789
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,792
那是个小而繁华的居住区
A small but
prosperous community.

790
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:41,459
气压计的度数是28寸，还在下降
The barometer reads
28 inches and dropping.

791
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:46,084
强风，你看，已经达到了22里每时
Strong winds, as you can see,
already at 22 knots.

792
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:52,334
现在是凌晨4:35
The time is now 4:35 a.m.

793
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:16,876
你对Peabody对Henderson案提起延期审理了吗？
Did you file the motion
of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?

794
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,209
确认了
It was sustained.

795
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:19,542
很好
Good.

796
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:23,584
法官考虑你对宽大处理的申请了吗？
Did the judge consider
your application for leniency?

797
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:25,001
Rogers对Yentob案的？
Rogers v. Yentob?

798
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:26,959
- 他同意了
- 太好了
- He granted it.
- Great.

799
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,126
对不起，沃特
I'm sorry, Walt.

800
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,459
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

801
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:43,209
你具体是在对什么伤害道歉？
Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

802
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,626
具体？
Specifically?

803
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:48,042
只要还痛苦的
Whichever ones still hurt.

804
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:51,417
这些有一半都是自己造成的
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

805
01:02:57,876 --> 01:03:01,709
我真希望房顶飞出去，我被吸进太空里
I hope the roof flies off,
and I get sucked up into space.

806
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,209
没有我你会过得更好
You'll be better
off without me.

807
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,667
不要为自己感到遗憾了
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

808
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,501
为什么
Why?

809
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:19,959
我们只有自己，沃特
We're all
they've got, Walt.

810
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,751
那不够
That's not enough.

811
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,209
但我不会走的，巴纳比杰克说
"'But I'm not going,'
said Barnaby Jack.

812
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,542
我今晚就逃跑
"'I'm running away
tonight for good.

813
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:43,751
这一回我不会再被抓到
"'And this time I
won't get caught.'

814
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,167
安娜贝尔低声说，我和你走
"Annabelle whispered,
'I'm coming with you.'

815
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,042
她黄色的头发，根部显出棕色
"Her yellow hair,
now brown at the roots,

816
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,917
在风中飘舞
"caught up in
the wind and danced.

817
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:51,584
巴纳比杰克拉着安娜贝尔的手
"Barnaby Jack
took Annabelle's hand

818
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,334
把一个糖豆大小的东西摁进她手里
"and pressed something into it
the size of a jellybean.

819
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:57,417
藏到你袜子里，半夜准备好
"'Hide this in your socks,
and be ready at midnight."'

820
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,917
继续
Continue.

821
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:03,042
继续
Keep going.

822
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:04,584
- 继续啊
- 接着念
- Keep going.
- Go on.

823
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,792
- 我们在听
- 很好
- We're listening.
- That's good.

824
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:11,459
他跳出窗，落在新落的雪地上
"He leapt out the window
and landed in the fresh fallen snow."

825
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,626
我的唱机呢？
Where's my record player?

826
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,542
你不会相信的，先生
You're not going to
believe this one, sir.

827
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:35,626
新潘赞斯岛的童子军长的整个队都丢了
That Scout Master on
New Penzance has now lost his entire troop.

828
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,292
奇了怪了！
Well, I'll be damned!

829
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:43,542
这人是谁？
Who is this bimbo?

830
01:05:43,626 --> 01:05:44,792
不知道，先生
Couldn't say, sir.

831
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,792
马上就回
Be right back.

832
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:10,834
零食帐篷后面有个口香糖机坏了
There's a broken
gumball machine right behind the snack tent.

833
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:14,042
我不管他们怎么做，你从哪来
I don't care how they do it
where you come from.

834
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:17,042
你想要汽水？想要糖？想要蛇咬急救箱？
You want pop? You want candy?
You want a snake bite kit?

835
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,251
拿钱来
Get some money.

836
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:19,917
本表哥？
Cousin Ben?

837
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:22,042
五分钟之后回来
Come back in five minutes.

838
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,584
那是他吗？
Is this him?

839
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,667
55营的萨姆 沙考斯基 辞职了
Field Mate Sam Shakusky,
Troop 55, resigned.

840
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,542
他很火，太火了
罐子里是什么？
He's hot. Almost too hot.
What's in the can?

841
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:32,042
76美元，但都是五分的
$76, but it's mostly
in nickels.

842
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:33,209
给我
Give it to me.

843
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,917
- 你有海军勋章？
- 是的，先生
- Your badge in seamanship?
- Yes, sir.

844
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:37,417
很好 断岩下面绑着一条冷水捕蟹船
Good. There's a cold water
crabber moored off Broken Rock.

845
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:38,667
船长还欠我一张欠条
The skipper owes me an IOU.

846
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:40,917
看看他能不能带上你就当砸蟹爪的
We'll see if he
can take you on as a claw cracker.

847
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,917
会很难，但总比休克疗法好
It won't be an easy life,
but it's better than shock therapy.

848
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,209
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

849
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,001
还有，教堂帐篷呢？
By the way,
where's the chapel tent?

850
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,292
在那，但是神父在家生气呢
Back there,
but the padre's home with the mumps.

851
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,542
为什么问这个？
Why do you ask?

852
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,626
我想带上我妻子
I want to bring my wife.

853
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:54,501
但我们还没结婚
But we're not married yet.

854
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:55,709
你是他女朋友？
You his girl?

855
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:56,834
对
Yeah.

856
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,709
实际上，我是个民事公证人
Technically,
I'm a civil law scrivener.

857
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:02,417
我有权公证出生，死亡和婚姻
I'm authorized
to declare births, deaths, and marriages.

858
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:04,084
你们俩小了点。有许可证吗？
You're kind of young.
You got a license?

859
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,459
- 没有
- 没有
- No.
- No.

860
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:10,001
那我不能让你们合法结合
I can't offer you
a legally binding union.

861
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,584
在州里县里都不合法
It won't hold up in
the state, the county,

862
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,042
或者，说真的，这世界上所有法庭都不承认
or, frankly,
any courtroom in the world

863
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:14,542
因为你们太年轻，没有许可证明
due to your age,
lack of a license,

864
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:16,251
父母也不同意
and failure to get
parental consent.

865
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:18,917
但这个仪式在你们心中
But the ritual does
carry a very important

866
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,709
有很重要的意义
moral weight
within yourselves.

867
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,751
你们不能草率了事。看着我的眼睛
You can't enter
into this lightly. Look into my eyes.

868
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:25,542
- 你们相爱吗？
- 是
- Do you love each other?
- Yes, we do.

869
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:26,709
但是考虑一下我说的话
But think about
what I'm saying.

870
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,834
你们确定你们准备好了吗？
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

871
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:29,542
- 准备好了
- 你们没在听我说话
- Yes, we are.
- They're not listening to me.

872
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:31,417
- 让我重复一遍
- 我们很着急
- Let me rephrase it.
- We're in a hurry.

873
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:32,626
你还在嚼……
Are you chewing...

874
01:07:32,709 --> 01:07:34,126
把口香糖吐了，小妹
实际上，每个人
Spit out the gum, sister.
In fact, everybody.

875
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,667
我不喜欢这草率态度
I donˇt like
the snappy attitude.

876
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:41,042
这是你们人生中最重要的决定
This is the most
important decision you've made in your lives.

877
01:07:41,126 --> 01:07:42,542
在你们草率决定之前
Go over by that trampoline
and talk it through

878
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:45,417
去那个蹦床那边商量一下
before you give me
another quick answer.

879
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:04,376
我们确定了
We're sure.

880
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,459
好吧 我们做个血检
Okay. Let's do a blood test.

881
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,042
在上帝的注视下
Under the eye of God,

882
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,334
在本区法律的管辖下
and within the boundaries of
this local jurisdiction,

883
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:15,209
我们在此举行这个神圣的仪式，在今天，1965年9月5日
which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the 5th of September, 1965.

884
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,376
这个简短的仪式到此结束
That's the end
of the short form.

885
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,417
见证人有异议吗？
Do any of the witnesses
have objections or remarks?

886
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:20,876
他们一般没有。Scotak？
Usually they don't. Skotak?

887
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:23,167
我们能把这些五分钱借给他们吗？我担心他们的未来
Can we loan them the nickels?
I'm worried about their future.

888
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:25,167
那是我的钱
That's my fee.

889
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,417
- 你怎么想？
- 不知道
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

890
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,917
我说什么了？那是我的钱。我要存着这些五分钱
What'd I just say?
That's my fee. I'm keeping the nickels.

891
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,126
好吧，他们可以拿走网球罐
Okay, they can have
the tennis ball can.

892
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:43,542
在这签名，签首字母缩写，这，还有这
Sign here,
initial here and here.

893
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,251
拿着副本，圣经留下，走吧
Take the carbon,
leave the Bible. Let's go.

894
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,042
他们又要去哪？
Where are they going, again?

895
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:20,709
如果我没记错的话，他要去捕虾船上工作了
He's going to
work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.

896
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,709
- 祝他们好
- 我也是
- I wish them well.
- Me, too.

897
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,584
我也是
Me, too.

898
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,292
我觉得他们会回来的
I think they're coming back.

899
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,126
- 快点，水手
- 怎么了？
- Be quick, sailor!
- What happened?

900
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:33,417
她把她的望远镜落在教堂帐篷的钩子上了
She left her
binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.

901
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:35,501
就扔在那吧
Just leave them.

902
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:37,417
不行 那是她的特异功能！
We can't.
It's her magic power!

903
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:53,251
顺便说，你杀了你的狗
You killed your dog,
by the way.

904
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:54,792
- 史努比？
- 嗯哼
- Snoopy?
- Mmm-hmm.

905
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:57,626
嗯，没办法
Well, it couldn't be helped.

906
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:02,126
为什么把我当成敌人？
Why do you
consider me your enemy?

907
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,959
因为你女朋友用左撇子剪刀
Because your
girlfriend stabbed me

908
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,584
捅我的背
in the back with
lefty scissors.

909
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:08,667
她现在是我妻子了
She's my wife now.

910
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:11,751
祝贺你们
Congratulations.

911
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:15,959
谢谢，但我是说在那之前，六周前，从一开始
Thank you, but I'm saying before
that, six weeks ago, from day one.

912
01:11:17,126 --> 01:11:18,959
你为什么不喜欢我？
Why don't you like me?

913
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:22,959
我为什么要喜欢你？没人喜欢你
Why should I?
Nobody else does.

914
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:37,042
天！他在这！那个逃跑的！停下！
My God! He's here!
The fugitive! Stop him!

915
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,709
阻止他！
Stop him!

916
01:12:35,459 --> 01:12:37,792
在这时候，我不会再反抗了，永远不会
On this spot,
I'll fight no more, forever.

917
01:12:37,876 --> 01:12:40,001
来抓我啊你们这群混蛋
Come and get me,

你说你是童子军？

抱歉，先生？

他们会死的！

killed out there!

957
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,542
我要当场拆掉你的指挥权

Let's move!

967
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,376
快，跟着我！
Come on, follow me!

968
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:50,126
谁是管事的？
Who's in charge here?

969
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:51,709
兰迪，怎么了？
Randy, what happened?

970
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:52,876
让指挥官下来！
Take the commander off me!

971
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,542

01:17:58,959 --> 01:18:00,042
他们又逃跑了。
They ran away again.

974
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,792
我们需要回去，我需要志愿者

I need volunteers.

975
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:07,042

- Are you all right?

977
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:10,292
当然
Of course I am.

978
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,126
那孩子呢？
Where's the boy?

979
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,251
我们还不知道
We don't know yet.

980
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:27,667
不接受你这个回答
That's not acceptable.

981
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,376
那你想让我说什么，女士？
What do you
want me to say, lady?

982
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:31,792
给杰德倒杯咖啡

Jed a cup of coffee.

983
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,626

- 对
- You're Captain Sharp.
- That's correct.

984
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:38,751
我是社会服务部的，我遣送这孩子让您个人监护
I'm Social Services. I remanded the
boy into your personal custody.

985
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,167
你对他的安全负有责任
You're responsible
for his safety.

986
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:42,667
我听说他刚被闪电击中
I'm told that
he's just been struck by lightning.

987
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,084
我是第一次听说这种事
That's the first
I've heard of it.

988
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,209
是真的
It's true.

989
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,584
你就是童子军长沃德吧
Scout Master Ward,
I presume.

990
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:47,709
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

991
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,167
你赶不上你的名声好啊
Your reputation
precedes you.

992
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:51,667
你们两个是最骇人听闻地
You two are
the most appallingly

993
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,251
不负责任的监护人

custodial guardians

994
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:55,334
27年来社会服务部
Social Services has
ever had the misfortune

995
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:57,792
还从来没遇见过你俩这样的！
to encounter in
a 27-year career!

996
01:18:58,584 --> 01:19:00,167
你们还有什么可说？
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

997
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:02,751
你们不能这样。他们会把他在那活活吃掉的
You can't do this.
They'll eat him alive in there.

998
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:03,876
在哪？
Where?

999
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:05,376
那地方叫什么来着？
What's the name
of the place again?

1000
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:08,376
少管所
Juvenile Refuge.

1001
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:10,084
听着就像监狱
Sounds like jail.

1002
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:14,959
找到那孩子，送到社会服务部
Just find the boy,
and deliver him to Social Services.

1003
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,834
你不用做别的了
Nothing else
is in your power.

1004
01:19:16,917 --> 01:19:18,792
对不起。我们能回到救援中吗？
I'm sorry.
Can we get back to the rescue now?

1005
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,542

那个捅人小孩的父母？
The parents of the stabber?

1008
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,042
我反对这个描述。她是先被袭击的
I object to that description.
She was attacked.

1009
01:19:26,126 --> 01:19:27,167
什么？
Excuse me?

1010
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:29,542
我需要细节，她捅的那个童子军呢？
I want the details about that.
Where's the Scout she knifed?

1011
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:31,001
就在这
Right here.

1012

1016
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,001

- 停下！
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1017
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:42,459
没人能出去
Nobody's going anywhere.

1018
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:46,792
他不能被休克疗法
He's not getting
shock therapy.

1019
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:51,042
够了！你这是明知故犯
That's it!

起诉你虐待……
Be notified that
you stand accused of mistreatment...

1023
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,292
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

1024
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:58,417
我不会让你这样做的！
I won't let you do it!

1025
01:19:58,501 --> 01:19:59,542
看！
Look!

1026
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:09,792

等等，拿着
Wait, take these!

1033
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:04,209
你要去哪？你在干嘛？

1034
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,001

swim for it.

1037

有多深？我没带救生衣
How deep is it?
I didn't bring my life jacket.

1038
01:21:48,209 --> 01:21:50,667
我不知道，但如果太浅，我们也会摔断脖子的
I don't know, but if it's too
shallow, we'll break our necks anyway.

1039
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:54,209
抓住我
Hang on to me.

不，我没结婚，但是我是个警察
