片名：《黑天鹅》

4
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,354
昨晚我做了一个疯狂至极的梦
I had the craziest dream last night.

5
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:01,704
我扮演着“白天鹅”
I was dancing the White Swan.

6
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:06,668
编舞不太一样，有点像莫斯科大剧院的版本
It was different choreography, though. It was more like the Bolshoi's.

7
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,309
那是序幕中的一场戏
It was the prologue,

8
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:15,131
魔法师罗斯巴种下了诅咒
when Rothbart casts his spell.

9
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,556
粉粉的，好漂亮…
Look how pink. So pretty...

10
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,355
真漂亮！
Pretty!

11
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,415
- 你今天心情不错 - 他答应我，这一季让我演大角色
- You're in a good mood. - He promised to feature me more this season.

12
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,628
早该如此
Well, he certainly should.

13
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,557
你在团里熬了那么久
You've been there long enough,

14
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:41,442
你是最努力的舞蹈演员
and you're the most dedicated dancer in the company.

15
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,809
起来
Up.

16
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:49,678
- 那是什么？ - 怎么啦？
- What's that? - What?

17
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:50,877
背后
There.

18
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:55,323
没关系
Nothing.

19
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,245
你真不要我陪你去？
You're sure you don't want me to come with you?

20
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,436
乖女儿
You're a sweet girl.

21
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,691
你今天看见贝丝了吗？
Did you see Beth today?

22
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,965
她居然还有脸回来
I can't believe she's back.

23
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,348
- 回来很正常啊 - 不会吧，她还没看出来？
- Of course she's back. - What, she can't take a hint?

24
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:29,586
咱们团要破产了，她过气了
The company is broke. No one comes to see her anymore.

25
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,273
如今，能坚持看完整场芭蕾的人没有喽
Oh, nobody actually comes to see ballet full stop.

26
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,690
才不是呢，皇家芭蕾舞团上一季不知道有多火爆！
That's not true. I heard The Royal had one of their best seasons yet.

27
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,641
他得换点新花样，没别的
He just needs to try something new. That's all.

28
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,843
不是换新花样，得换新人
No, someone new.

29
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,514
- 换成谁？ - 老女人肯定不行
- Like who? - Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

30
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,982
真让人难过
It's sad.

31
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,649
难过什么？
What's sad?

32
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,883
贝丝多美啊！
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

33
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,454
是啊，我奶奶也不丑
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

34
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,997
（玛格・芳廷，英国人，20世纪最优秀的芭蕾舞演员之一）
- 玛格・芳廷一直跳到了50岁 - 是，我们知道
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties. - Yeah, we know.

35
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,423
太好了
Great.

36
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,950
我他妈坐过了站
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

37
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,405
从79街一路狂奔过来
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

38
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,704
跳得很好，尼娜
Beautiful as always, Nina.

39
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,971
放松
Relax.

40
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,588
一、二、三、四
And one, and two, and three, and four.

41
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,112
约翰，停一下
Stop, John. One second.

42
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,899
准备，各就各位
Okay, take position.

43
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:40,885
一、二、三、起
And one, and two, and three, and up.

44
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,344
一、二、三、四
And one, and two, and three, and four.

45
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:57,649
你好，亲爱的
Hello, dear.

46
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,323
故事情节耳熟能详
We all know the story.

47
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:10,068
纯美无暇的纤纤处子
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

48
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,738
被坏人变成了一只天鹅
trapped in the body of a swan.

49
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:16,246
她渴望自由
She desires freedom

50
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,219
但只有真爱才能解除魔咒
that only true love can break the spell.

51
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,562
王子的到来，使她的愿望几乎成真
Her wish is nearly granted in the form of a Prince.

52
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:31,766
可就在，他要表白真爱之际
But before he can declare his love,

53
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:37,881
淫邪的黑天鹅，施展手段迷惑了他
The lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.

54
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:47,760
白天鹅悲痛欲绝，跳崖自尽
Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

55
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,724
在死亡里…
killing herself. And in death...

56
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,551
她得到了解脱
finds freedom.

57
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,137
- 早上好，团员们 - 早上好
- Good morning, company. - Good morning.

58
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,425
这一季的开幕戏是“天鹅湖”
We will open our season with Swan Lake.

59
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,654
我知道，“天鹅湖”是部老戏
Done to death, I know.

60
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,254
但这部不同
But not like this.

61
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:17,152
我们重新改编，使爱更真，情更切
We strip it down, make it visceral and real.

62
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:22,043
这部新作品需要一个新的天鹅女王
A new production needs a new Swan Queen.

63
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,792
我要向世界展示一张全新的面孔
A fresh face to present to the world.

64
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:33,027
不过…你们有谁可以同时演绎两个角色？
But... Which of you can embody both Swans?

65
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,395
白天鹅，和黑天鹅
The White, and the Black.

66
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,417
我刚才用手拍过的演员：
All the soloists I tapped:

67
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:48,521
下午照常彩排
Go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon.

68
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,136
而我没拍过的女演员：
And the girls I didn't tap:

69
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,446
下午5点到主角排练室见我
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

70
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,922
谢谢各位
Thank you.

71
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,211
好了
All right.

72
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,916
- 继续，刚才是左侧练习吗？ - 是的，老师
- Let's go. Did we do left side? - Yes, mistress.

73
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:45,030
该死！该死！
Fuck! Fuck!

74
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:51,734
看什么？
What?

75
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,442
如果只是选白天鹅，你是不二人选
If I was only casting the White Swan, she'd be yours.

76
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,464
可现在不是
But I'm not.

77
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,240
音乐老师，奥黛儿之终篇，谢谢
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

78
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,017
让我看看你的黑天鹅，尼娜
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

79
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:09,645
放开，诱惑我们
Not so controlled. Seduce us.

80
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,950
不仅要诱惑王子，还有在场的人、观众、整个世界
Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world.

81
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,141
加油，要像一只结网的蜘蛛
Come on, like a spider spinning a web.

82
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,632
强一点！强一点！加油！
Attack it, attack it! Come on!

83
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,063
- 大驾光临 - 对不起…
- Good of you to join us. - Sorry...

84
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:34,948
姑娘们，这位是莉莉
Girls, this is Lily.

85
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:38,557
她从旧金山来，填补丽贝卡的位子
Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

86
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,250
去热热身
- Hey. - Get warmed up.

87
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:41,134
不用，没关系
No, it's okay.

88
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,341
不用热身
I'm good.

89
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:45,703
需要我再来一次吗？
Should I go again?

90
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:48,622
不用，谢谢你，尼娜，够了
No, thanks, Nina. I've seen enough.

91
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,219
维罗妮卡，白天鹅变奏曲
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

92
00:14:58,224 --> 00:14:59,108
快点，快点，快点
Come on, come on, come on, please.

93
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:02,034
好了，音乐老师
All right, Maestro.

94
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,768
二、三…
Two, three...

95
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,023
面试怎么样？
So how'd it go?

96
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,018
你回来晚了，我给办公室的苏茜打了电话
You were late, so I called Susie in the office.

97
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,196
面试！真不敢相信，他让你面试主角
An audition! I can't believe he just sprang that on you.

98
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:21,404
怎么样？
So?

99
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,231
还好
It was fine.

100
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,213
还好？
Just fine?

101
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:28,855
小宝贝…
Oh, sweetheart...

102
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,687
别急，慢慢说
You tell me about it.

103
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,136
尼娜，没事吧？
Nina, everything all right?

104
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,177
我没事
I'm fine.

105
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:44,798
快好了
Almost done.

106
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,005
你练得太猛了
You're working yourself too hard.

107
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:52,610
- 我们都有不在状态的时候 - 那个女孩，突然闯了进来
- We all have off days. - That girl, um, barged in.

108
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,483
我相信她不是有意的
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

109
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:02,728
你刚跳舞那会，如果我不领着你去教室，你一定迷路
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

110
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:05,237
明天我去找他，我要告诉他，我做到了
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow. I'm going to tell him I finished it.

111
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:06,698
没必要撒谎
You don't need to lie.

112
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,468
他不会相信的
You won't convince him one way or the other.

113
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,352
宝贝
Oh, sweetheart.

114
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,050
我知道这让你很沮丧
I know it's disappointing.

115
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,728
年纪一大，种种压力…
When you start getting older, there's all this

116
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,495
如影随形，我太了解啦
ridiculous pressure. God knows I understand.

117
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:28,612
不过，没关系
But it's all right.

118
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,533
不管怎样
No matter what.

119
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,241
你也许会再演猫那个角色
You'll probably get to dance the part of the cat again.

120
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,623
那个角色真不错
That's such a wonderful part.

121
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:42,368
或者，他会让你演大天鹅
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

122
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:46,336
不管怎样，你都会光彩照人
Either way, you'll shine.

123
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,006
我知道
You know...

124
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:51,821
一觉醒来，一切会变得更美好
Everything will be better in the morning.

125
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,115
一定会的
It always is.

126
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,526
乖女儿
Sweet girl.

127
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:27,486
有事吗？尼娜
Yes, Nina?

128
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:28,801
你现在有空吗？
Do you have a minute?

129
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,801
- 我知道你很忙 - 不，时间正合适
- Now's not a good time. I get it. - Now is perfect.

130
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,732
我想告诉你
I just wanted to tell you that

131
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,655
昨晚，我又练了一次终篇
I practiced the coda last night and

132
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,538
我完成了
I finished.

133
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:54,866
我想让你知道
I thought you should know.

134
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,711
尼娜，听着，老实说我关心的不是你的技巧
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly, I don't care about your technique.

135
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:01,697
- 这一点你要明白 - 可昨天…
- You should know that by now. - Yeah, but yesterday...

136
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:02,867
别说了，还有…
No. Anyway...

137
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,315
我已经选了维罗妮卡，抱歉
I've already chosen Veronica. Sorry.

138
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,084
抱歉
Sorry.

139
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:10,166
明白了，谢谢你
Okay, thank you.

140
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,071
放弃了？
That's it?

141
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:16,592
不试一试说服我，让我改变心意吗？
You're not going to try and change my mind?

142
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:19,994
我也许真得会改变心意
You must have thought it was possible.

143
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,288
不然，干嘛打扮的这么漂亮到这来？
Otherwise, what are you doing here all dolled up?

144
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,488
我想要这个角色
I came to ask for the part.

145
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,923
老实说…
The truth is...

146
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,860
我一直认为，你很适合白天鹅
When I look at you, all I see is the White Swan.

147
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:44,099
你美丽，怯懦，娇柔
Yes, you're beautiful, fearful, fragile.

148
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,917
演白天鹅最合适
Ideal casting.

149
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:51,276
可黑天鹅怎么办？一人饰两角，很难的
But the Black Swan? It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

150
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,970
黑天鹅我也能跳
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

151
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,108
真的吗？
Really?

152
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:58,199
这四年来，你每一次跳黑天鹅…
In four years, every time you dance,

153
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:03,082
关心地总是每个动作的完美，但我却从没看见过你的激情
I see obsess getting each and every move perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

154
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:07,204
从没见过，为什么会这样？
Ever. All that discipline for what?

155
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:12,641
- 我想要完美 - 什么？
- I just want to be perfect. - You what?

156
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,457
我想要完美
I want to be perfect.

157
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:20,609
完美不是控制出来
Perfection is not just about control.

158
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,234
是爆发出来的
It's also about letting go.

159
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:28,899
超越自我，征服自己，征服观众
Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence.

160
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:31,146
能做到的人不多
And very few have it in them.

161
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,762
我认为我能做到
I think I do have it in me.

162
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:42,600
你咬我？
You bit me?

163
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,702
你居然咬我！
I can't believe you bit me!

164
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,308
对不起
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,519
老天，真他妈疼！
Man, that fucking hurt!

166
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,133
看什么？
What?

167
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:09,342
她为什么总盯着我？
Why's she always staring at me?

168
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,703
结果出来了
Hey, it's been posted.

169
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,297
结果出来了
Hey, it's up!

170
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,049
维罗妮卡 
Veronica.

171
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:26,088
恭喜你
Congratulations.

172
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,789
为什么胡说八道？
Why would you say that?

173
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,994
耍我吗？
Your idea of some sick joke?

174
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,394
你说什么？
What?

175
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:51,861
去死吧
Fuck you.

176
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:06,829
尼娜！
Hey, Nina!

177
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:08,297
恭喜！
Congratulations!

178
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,069
恭喜！
Congratulations.

179
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,533
你好漂亮
You're so beautiful.

180
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:20,519
恭喜！
Congratulations.

181
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,070
喂？
- Hello? - Hi.

182
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,048
怎么了，有麻烦？
What is it? What's wrong?

183
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,654
我很好
I'm fine.

184
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,195
他选了我，妈妈
He picked me, Mom.

185
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,528
你能听见吗？
Do you hear me?

186
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,416
- 跳天鹅湖？ - 我要跳天鹅女王啦！
- For Swan Lake? - I'm going to be Swan Queen!

187
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:56,877
妈妈！
Mom!

188
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,344
我一会就回来，想提前让你知道
I'll be home soon. I just wanted to let you know.

189
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:01,446
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you, too.

190
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:37,310
妈妈？
Mom?

191
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:42,048
妈妈，你在你房间吗？
Mom, are you in your room?

192
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:16,679
尼娜？
Nina?

193
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,150
你在家吗？
Are you home?

194
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,442
尼娜，我在厨房等你
Nina, when you get out I'm in the kitchen.

195
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:35,886
快来，宝贝
Come on, sweetie.

196
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:42,618
我的女儿，天鹅女王
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

197
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:50,593
我们的最爱，香草蓝莓馅蛋糕
It's our favorite. Vanilla with strawberry filling.

198
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:52,187
妈妈，别切太大
Oh, Mom, not too big.

199
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:54,162
太多了…
Oh, that's way, way too much.

200
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:56,284
- 我们在庆祝，就吃这一次 - 妈妈…
- It's a celebration. It's just this once. - Mom...

201
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:58,784
我的胃不舒服
My stomach's still in knots.

202
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:02,259
好
Fine.

203
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,120
好
Fine.

204
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,403
倒了！
Then it's garbage!

205
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,655
不要，妈妈，不要，对不起
No, Mom, don't. I'm sorry.

206
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:19,127
我太为你骄傲了
I'm just... I'm just so proud of you.

207
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:21,897
看起来真好吃
It looks so yummy.

208
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,275
好，好
Okay, okay.

209
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,780
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

210
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,866
谢谢你，尼娜
Thank you, Nina.

211
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,652
非常好
That's very nice.

212
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:42,835
非常好
Very nice.

213
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,642
我知道白天鹅不成问题
But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem.

214
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:51,372
你的任务是如何蜕变成邪恶的黑天鹅
The real work will your metamorphosis into her evil twin.

215
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,148
昨天我看见了她的影子
And I know I saw a flash of her yesterday.

216
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:58,458
再加一把劲
So get ready to give me more of that bite.

217
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:21,780
非常好
Excellent.

218
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:27,806
邪恶力量牵扯你，无法逃离，难以抵制
That evil force is pulling you that you can't escape. That's just out of your control.

219
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:33,462
你的感觉越来越清晰“它在占有我，占有我”
So you sense it, you get aware of it more: "It's taking me, it's taking me."

220
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:36,162
多一丝绝望
A little bit more desperate.

221
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,939
对，你可以挥高一些，然后放下…
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit and then come down, and then...

222
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:42,237
就是这样
That's it.

223
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,587
瞧她的动作
Watch the way she moves.

224
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:23,927
不精准，却很轻盈
Imprecise, but effortless.

225
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:27,432
真实无虚
She's not faking it.

226
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:36,553
非常漂亮！好，漂亮
Gorgeous! Okay, that's beautiful.

227
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:38,433
从头再来一遍
Let's start again from the beginning.

228
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:50,351
从现在起，你和贝丝一个化妆间，小心点
You'll room with Beth from now on, so be considerate.

229
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,720
谢谢，苏茜
Thanks, Susie.

230
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,174
这是卢莱先生送给你的
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

231
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,154
真漂亮
They're beautiful.

232
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,457
我一会就来
I'll be back in a second.

233
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:19,813
失陪一会
Let me come back to you, please.

234
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,162
我们走
Let's go.

235
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:31,415
准备好让这群狼品头论足了吗？
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

236
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,076
我们需要钱，保持微笑
We need our cash, so please don't forget to smile.

237
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:39,434
女士们先生们，请静一静，好吗？
Ladies and gentlemen, please, may I have your attention?

238
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,987
晚上好
Good evening.

239
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:44,867
我想宣布一件非常重要的事
Let me make this very important announcement.

240
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:51,132
有一个人的表演曾让各位目眩神迷、情难自禁
You all had had the chance and the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

241
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,932
有时甚至是悲痛欲绝
and even sometimes devastated, by the performances

242
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,966
她是真正的艺术家
of this true artist of our company.

243
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:58,986
也是我作品灵感的源泉
She's been a crucial inspiration to my work.

244
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:02,804
她是众舞者的榜样，更是…
A role model to all dancers, and even more than that,

245
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,826
舞台上最值得欣赏的一抹芳姿
a deeply appreciated presence on our stage.

246
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,953
你们都知道我说得是谁
You all know who I am talking about.

247
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:11,296
女士们先生们，贝丝・麦金泰尔
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

248
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:17,741
不过，我们知道
But as we all know,

249
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,155
每个伟大的事业都有结束的一天
every great career has to come to an end.

250
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,044
贝丝将于本季末退出舞台
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

251
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,381
并在“悲剧女神”中作告别演出
She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene,

252
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,939
这也是我的第一支芭蕾舞剧
the role she originated in my first ballet.

253
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:35,995
我的小公主
My little princess,

254
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,299
我们向你致敬，将你深深怀念
we honor you. You will be greatly missed,

255
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:42,391
永记心间
and never forgotten.

256
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:46,488
不过，江山代有才人出
But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another.

257
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,510
这一季我们将推出新版“天鹅湖”
We're opening our season with my new version of Swan Lake.

258
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:55,518
领衔主演“天鹅女王”的是这位楚楚动人的尼娜・塞耶斯
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen, the exquisite Nina Sayers.

259
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:03,893
不久，各位将一睹她的舞姿
You'll soon have the pleasure of seeing her perform,

260
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:11,387
不过现在，让我们举杯：敬在场的各位，敬贝丝，敬尼娜
but right now, let's please raise a glass: To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

261
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:14,505
敬永恒的美
To beauty.

262
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:33,342
马上就好！
Just a second.

263
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:43,543
马上就好！
Just a second!

264
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,693
快点！我憋不住了！
Come on! I'm about to burst!

265
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,011
嗨，是你！
Hey, it's you!

266
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,622
我想我们还没正式介绍过
I don't think we ever officially met.

267
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:20,309
- 我叫莉莉 - 嗨，我叫尼娜
- I'm Lily. - Hi, I'm Nina.

268
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:22,529
我知道，新的天鹅女王
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

269
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:24,127
- 帮我拿一下 - 好的
- Here, hold this. - Yeah, sure.

270
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:29,237
你一定兴奋地要命
You must be so excited.

271
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:32,686
你紧张吗？
Are you freaking out?

272
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,758
- 是的… - 是吗？
- Yeah... - Yeah?

273
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:36,832
没关系
Oh, it's okay.

274
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,699
换成是我，一定会晕头转向
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

275
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,958
我得过去了…
I should get back...

276
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:42,697
别…别这样，等一会
No, no, no, come on, stay.

277
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,523
陪我一会
Keep me company.

278
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,021
失陪
Excuse me.

279
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,408
你在这，跟我来
Oh, there you are. Come on.

280
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:01,092
他们恨不得把你吞了，你却飘然在此
Hey. They tried to eat you alive, but here you are.

281
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,404
表现得很好
You did well.

282
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,808
真的？
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

283
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:06,897
你去哪？
Where are you going?

284
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,251
上西区
Upper west side.

285
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:11,059
顺道去我家喝一杯
Stop at my place for a drink. It's on the way.

286
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,856
托马斯，过去和凯伦・哈罗维打个招呼
Thomas, you need to say hello to Karen Holloway.

287
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:19,298
我得去拍个马屁，一会就回来，在这等我，好吗？
A minute more of ass-kissing. I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

288
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:23,333
你好，凯伦！
Hello, Karen!

289
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,507
贝丝！
Beth!

290
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:10,438
真遗憾，你要离开我们
I'm so sorry to hear you're leaving the company.

291
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,297
你是怎么得到这个角色的？
What did you do to get this role?

292
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,332
他总说你缺乏激情
He always said you were such a frigid little girl.

293
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:24,482
你怎么让他改变了主意？
What did you do to make him change his mind?

294
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:28,641
和他上床？
Did you suck his cock?

295
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,407
不是每个人都需要这么做
Not all of us have to.

296
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:34,585
你个无耻的婊子！
You fucking whore!

297
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,987
你就是个无耻的小婊子！
You're a fucking little whore!

298
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:39,433
冷静，怎么回事？
Whoa, what's going on here?

299
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,598
我得和你谈谈
Hey, I need to talk to you.

300
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,766
- 你喝醉了，回家吧 - 我得和你谈谈
- You're drunk. You should go home. - I need to talk to you.

301
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:48,484
不！你敢！你敢就这样踢掉我！
No! Don't you do that! Don't you dismiss me like that!

302
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,666
我的小公主，拜托，冷静一点
My little princess, please. Pull it together.

303
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:57,075
- 走吧 - 我会去找你的
- Come. - I'm coming by later.

304
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:01,786
我有件东西送给你，以表我的感激之情
I have something for you. It's a token of my appreciation.

305
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:04,548
- 好 - 别客气，下手狠点，尼娜
- Right. - You make the most of it, Nina.

306
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,110
别介意，这行就是这样
Don't worry. It's typical.

307
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:15,911
请坐，我们应该谈谈角色
Please. I thought it'd be good to talk about the role.

308
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,252
冲谈一下拘谨的气氛
Drown this a little.

309
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,536
我们不想彼此有隔阂
I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.

310
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,619
- 我也这么想 - 很好
- No, me neither. - Good.

311
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:26,021
那么…你有男朋友吗？
So... You got a boyfriend?

312
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:28,263
没有
No.

313
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:32,145
过去交的男朋友多吗？
Have you had many in the past?

314
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,216
交过几个
A few.

315
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,901
不过，都不是正式的
But no one serious.

316
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:41,762
你不会是处女吧？
You're not a virgin are you?

317
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:45,964
不是
No.

318
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:48,211
那就用不着害羞
So there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

319
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,457
你喜欢做爱吗？
And you enjoy making love?

320
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,811
什么？
Excuse me?

321
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,997
别大惊小怪，性
Come on, sex.

322
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,429
喜欢吗？
Do you enjoy it?

323
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,286
我们必须谈这个话题
We need to be able to talk about this.

324
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,089
我给你布置一个家庭作业
I've got a little homework assignment for you.

325
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:20,581
回家后，自慰
Go home and touch yourself.

326
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:23,695
放松一下
Live a little.

327
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,557
天晚了，明天还有很多工作
Well it's late. Lots of work tomorrow.

328
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:33,488
门房会为你叫出租车
The doorman will find a cab for you.

329
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:40,863
听起来今晚很精彩，真希望我也能去
Sounds like quite an evening. I wish I could have been there.

330
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:42,433
我向他们提过
You know I asked.

331
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,239
我知道，苏茜对我说了
I know you did. Susie told me.

332
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:47,148
我猜他想和你单独在一起
Guess he wanted you all to himself.

333
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,304
可是为什么？
But why?

334
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,728
我不怪他
Don't blame him.

335
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:54,191
耳环哪来的？
Where'd you get these?

336
00:37:54,226 --> 00:37:56,050
假的
They're fake.

337
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:59,870
我以为是真
Fooled me.

338
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,159
我自己能行
I can do it.

339
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,367
他一定整晚都在你身边
He must have been by your side all night.

340
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:17,873
带着你四处招摇
Showing you off.

341
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,863
- 尼娜… - 疹子而已
- Oh, Nina... - It's just a rash.

342
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:24,061
疹子？你在说什么？
Rash? What are you talking about?

343
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,673
前几天更严重，现在好多了
It was worse a few days ago. It's fine already.

344
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,836
- 你一定又用手抓了 - 没有
- You've been scratching yourself again. - No I haven't.

345
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,789
妈妈！
Mom!

346
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,265
怎么有这个坏毛病…
This disgusting habit...

347
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,715
老天，我以为你改了这个坏毛病，尼娜
Jesus Christ, I thought you were done with this, Nina.

348
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:37,458
披肩，从明天起披肩不许离身
Shrugs. You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

349
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:38,846
坐下，你有一件白色的
Sit down. You have the white one,

350
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,906
还有一件粉色的，应该能遮住
and the pink one. And that'll hide it.

351
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:45,643
然后，我再找一点那种贵粉底，我们还剩一些
And then I'll dig out that expensive coverup. We still have some.

352
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:48,117
不会有人发现的
No one will see it.

353
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,759
妈妈，别这样
Mom, please,

354
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:54,025
因为这个角色，是吗？压力太大
It's the role, isn't it? It's all this pressure.

355
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,932
我就知道你承受不了，我就知道
I knew it'd be too much. I knew it.

356
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:00,704
你会没事的
You're all right.

357
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:04,074
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

358
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,330
贝丝进医院了
Beth's in the hospital.

359
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,389
发生了车祸
She had an accident.

360
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,091
不！
Oh no!

361
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:14,565
贝丝？
Beth?

362
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:23,076
怎么回事？
What happened?

363
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:27,415
她冲进马路被车撞了
She walked into the street and got hit by a car.

364
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:30,662
你知道吗？
You know what?

365
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:34,413
我敢肯定，她是故意的
I'm almost sure she did it on purpose.

366
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:36,936
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

367
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:41,955
因为贝丝做任何事都带着一股黑暗的冲动
Because everything Beth does comes from within, from some dark impulse.

368
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,868
所以她的表演充满着快感
I guess that's what makes her so thrilling to watch.

369
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,490
让人战栗
So dangerous.

370
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,922
某一时刻，甚至完美无缺
Even perfect at times.

371
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:57,240
但却充满着该死的毁灭性
But also so damned destructive.

372
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,374
是吵架那天发生的吗？
Was it right after we saw her?

373
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:05,288
等等…这些跟你没关系
Wait, wait, wait. This has nothing to do with you.

374
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,434
和你没有关系，别担心
It's not your problem, so don't let yourself be distracted.

375
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:11,661
现在你是主角，尼娜
This is your moment, Nina.

376
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,243
好好把握
Don't let it go.

377
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:44,876
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

378
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:27,353
尼娜？
Nina?

379
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,110
宝贝，我要来喽？
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

380
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:44,686
加油！
And... Come on!

381
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:47,215
别控制，尼娜，我要看见激情
Forget about control, Nina. I want to see passion.

382
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,045
加油！
Come on.

383
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,890
伸臂

384
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:54,149
太僵硬了，没有生气，放松
Stiff like a dead corpse. Let it go.

385
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:57,446
放松，放松
Let it go. Let it go.

386
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,890
再一次
And again.

387
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,902
感觉你的横隔膜
Feels like you have your diaphragm

388
00:46:02,937 --> 00:46:05,654
有点收缩？
is in a bit of a contraction?

389
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:06,812
好
I'm okay.

390
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:14,511
将气吸入我手的方向，吸气
Breathe in to this hand. Breathe in to this hand.

391
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:16,611
深吸一口气，好
Breathe in, all the way. Good.

392
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:19,320
呼气
And exhale.

393
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,052
做挺背曲膝的时候，前面是不是有点僵硬？
Does it feel jammed in the front every time you plie?

394
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,856
有时会，不常发生
Sometimes, not always.

395
00:46:30,897 --> 00:46:31,808
- 再拉一次，好吗？ - 好
- One more pull, okay? - Okay.

396
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:38,284
- 好点吗？ - 是的
- Is that okay? - Yeah.

397
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,968
大卫，能问你一个问题吗？
David, can I ask you a question?

398
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:03,215
说实话，你会和那样的女孩上床吗？
Honestly, would you fuck that girl?

399
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:07,092
不会
No.

400
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:08,654
没人会
No one would.

401
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:10,840
尼娜
Nina...

402
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:14,061
你的舞蹈缺乏激情
Your dancing is just as frigid...

403
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,479
该死！
Fuck!

404
00:47:21,612 --> 00:47:23,442
我们还在工作，请把灯打开！
We're still working here, please. Lights!

405
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:24,891
开灯！
The lights!

406
00:47:26,368 --> 00:47:26,995
谢谢！
Thank you!

407
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,630
各位，你们可以走了，谢谢
Okay, guys, you can go. Thanks for your patience.

408
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:33,563
不是你，你留下
No, no, you stay. You stay.

409
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:37,159
你们好好玩
Have fun, you two.

410
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:41,468
好
Okay.

411
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:42,833
到这来
Come here.

412
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:43,875
过来，过来…
Come, come, come, come.

413
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:47,906
我来演王子
I'll be the Prince.

414
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:09,998
别控制，别控制
Let it go. Let it go.

415
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:32,690
感觉我的抚摸
Feel my touch.

416
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:33,865
迎合我
Respond to it.

417
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,153
快
Come on.

418
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,645
张开嘴，张开，张开
Open your mouth. Open it. Open up.

419
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:18,588
现在是我在引诱你
That was me seducing you,

420
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,314
应该你引诱我
when it needs to be the other way around.

421
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:22,461
等等…
Please...

422
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,362
谁在那？
Who is that?

423
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,385
你没事吧？
You okay?

424
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,056
你不能在这吸烟
You can't smoke in here.

425
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:59,676
你知我知…
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

426
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:06,924
大日子越来越近，是不是？
The big day's getting closer and closer, huh?

427
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,469
我已经等不及了，相信你的表演会很精彩
Well, I can't wait. I think you're going to be amazing.

428
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:14,975
谢谢
Thanks.

429
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:31,220
那么…
So...

430
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,862
你想谈谈吗？
Do  you want to talk about it?

431
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,669
不知怎么说
It's that hard to.

432
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:41,961
卢莱对你太凶是吗？
Leroy playing a little too rough for you?

433
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:44,703
没事的，尼娜，他是个混蛋
Come on, Nina. He's a prick.

434
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:46,767
他很了不起
He's brilliant.

435
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:50,186
没错，可他也很凶
Sure, but it's not like he's all warm and fuzzy.

436
00:50:52,063 --> 00:50:53,128
你不了解他…
What you don't know is...

437
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:58,249
有人暗恋老师！
Someone's hot for teacher!

438
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:02,370
别激动，没事，很正常
Oh, come on, it's okay. I don't blame you.

439
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:03,793
我要回家了
I should go home.

440
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:06,545
尼娜，别这样，我开玩笑的
Nina, come on. I'm just playing around.

441
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,129
尼娜！
Nina!

442
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:33,258
宝贝？你在里面干什么？
Sweetie? What are you doing in there?

443
00:53:01,491 --> 00:53:02,034
再来
Again.

444
00:53:35,343 --> 00:53:36,341
再来
Again.

445
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,914
到底什么问题？
Do you have any corrections?

446
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:57,077
莉莉告诉我，看见你在哭
Lily told me that she saw you crying.

447
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:00,577
心情很不好
That you were very upset

448
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,515
让我对你温和一点
and that I should take it easy on you.

449
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,068
不是我让她说的
I didn't tell her that.

450
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,505
也许你该休息一下
Maybe you need a little break.

451
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,410
休息一、两天，或者一个月，你觉得呢？
A day or two. Or maybe a month. What do you think?

452
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:10,626
她不该乱说话
She shouldn't have said anything.

453
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:12,785
不，是你不该发牢骚
No, you shouldn't be whining in the first place.

454
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,569
我没有
I didn't.

455
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:18,416
你本该更优秀
You could be brilliant.

456
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:20,354
可你是个胆小鬼
But you're a coward.

457
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,691
对不起
Sorry.

458
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,188
别再说这句话！这就是你的问题
No, stop saying that! That's exactly what I'm talking about.

459
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:26,740
别再软弱下去
Stop being so fucking weak.

460
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:28,170
再来！
Again!

461
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:42,029
莉莉…
Lily...

462
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:45,143
瞧瞧，是谁大架光临了
Oh, look who's decided to grace us with her presence.

463
00:54:45,178 --> 00:54:46,106
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

464
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:47,057
好
Okay.

465
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:48,551
马上
Now.

466
00:54:49,932 --> 00:54:50,417
闭嘴
Shut up.

467
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:51,668
来吧
Come on.

468
00:54:55,803 --> 00:54:56,246
什么事？
What's up?

469
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:58,893
你和托马斯说了昨晚的事？
You told Thomas about last night?

470
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:03,485
是啊，早上我碰见他，他说你们遇到了问题
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and he said you guys were having some trouble.

471
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,610
他为什么要和你说这些？
Why would he talk to you?

472
00:55:04,645 --> 00:55:07,305
你说什么，陛下
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

473
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,195
我告诉他你很努力，我相信你会很棒的
I just told him you're working your ass off and I think you'll be great.

474
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,129
你不该说
Well you shouldn't have.

475
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:17,004
好
Okay.

476
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:51,438
他对你毛手毛脚吗？
Has he tried anything with you?

477
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:57,618
他可是恶名在外
He has a reputation.

478
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:04,787
我有理由担心，尼娜，你每天回来的很晚
I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights.

479
00:56:04,822 --> 00:56:08,946
彩排，我希望他别占你便宜，就担心这事
Rehearsing. I just hope he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

480
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,386
他没有
He's not.

481
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:12,036
很好
Good.

482
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:16,692
我不想你走我的老路
I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.

483
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:18,818
谢谢
Thanks.

484
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:21,025
不是因为你
Not like that.

485
00:56:22,348 --> 00:56:24,388
别像我一样，毁了事业
I just mean as far as my career was concerned.

486
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,327
你什么事业？
What career?

487
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:31,040
因为生你放弃的事业
The one I gave up to have you.

488
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:34,394
我28了
I'm twenty-eight.

489
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,820
接着说？
So?

490
00:56:36,498 --> 00:56:37,684
仅仅…
Only that...

491
00:56:39,823 --> 00:56:40,743
仅仅什么？
Only what?

492
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:42,407
没什么
Nothing.

493
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:43,676
- 什么？ - 没什么
- What? - Nothing.

494
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:48,404
你皮肤怎么样？
How is your skin?

495
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,517
很好
Fine.

496
00:56:50,552 --> 00:56:52,198
还抓没抓？
- Are you leaving it alone? - Mm-hmm.

497
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,990
让我看看
Let me see.

498
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:02,488
- 脱掉衬衣 - 不
- Take off your shirt. - No.

499
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:16,183
有事吗？
Can I help you?

500
00:57:20,757 --> 00:57:21,543
是谁？
Who was that?

501
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:23,127
没人
It was no one.

502
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:25,908
没人
It was no one.

503
00:57:31,223 --> 00:57:31,722
有谁？
Hello?

504
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:37,240
怎么是你？
What are you doing here?

505
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:39,228
我是来道歉的
I just came by to apologize.

506
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:41,462
你说的对，我不该和他谈你的事
You're right. I should have never spoken to him about you.

507
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:43,675
- 宝贝 - 等一会
- Sweetheart. - Give me a second.

508
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,370
- 吃晚饭… - 妈妈，拜托
- Your dinner... - Mom, please.

509
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:48,934
她可真难缠
Oh, she's a trip.

510
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,336
你怎么知道我住哪？
How do you know where I live?

511
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:52,866
山人自有妙计
I have my ways.

512
00:57:54,955 --> 00:57:57,284
老天，别紧张，办公室的苏茜告诉我的
Jesus, relax. I got it from Susie in the office.

513
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:01,862
这件事让我很不舒服，我真的想弥补一下
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did, and I really want to make it up to you.

514
00:58:01,874 --> 00:58:04,140
我请你出去吃饭怎么样？
So how about I take you out to dinner?

515
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:07,669
- 我不知道… - 好吧，没关系
- I don't think... - Okay, that's fine.

516
00:58:07,704 --> 00:58:09,924
喝一杯呢？
What about drinks?

517
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:11,599
宝贝，你该休息了
Sweetie, you need to rest.

518
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:13,835
- 老天 - 等等
- Jesus. - Wait.

519
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:16,512
你干什么？
What are you doing?

520
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:18,685
出去
I'm going out.

521
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,259
什么？尼娜！
What? Nina!

522
00:58:20,294 --> 00:58:22,963
你明天要上台
You're on the stage tomorrow.

523
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:26,187
他居然那么叫她
I can't believe he calls her that.

524
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:28,811
- 真恶心 - 我倒觉得很贴心
- It's so gross. - I think it's sweet.

525
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:30,665
小公主？
Little Princess?

526
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,139
- 他可能对每个女孩都这么叫 - 不可能
- He probably calls every girl that. - No way.

527
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:35,156
只对贝丝
That's just for Beth.

528
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:39,802
我打赌，过几天他就会叫你小公主
Well, I bet he'll be calling you Little Princess any day now.

529
00:58:39,837 --> 00:58:41,352
我不知道
I don't know about that.

530
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:44,620
他会的，上床的时候可别饶了他
Oh, sure he will. Just got to let him lick your pussy.

531
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:48,421
干酪汉堡包，大份番茄酱
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

532
00:58:48,456 --> 00:58:50,263
非常感谢
Mmm, dankesche.

533
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,558
酱不够可以叫我
Let me know if that's juicy enough for you.

534
00:58:53,593 --> 00:58:55,401
我会的
Oh, I will.

535
00:58:57,413 --> 00:58:59,159
干酪够吗？
You have enough cheese?

536
00:58:59,194 --> 00:59:01,572
你可多的很（意思是你很烦）
No, but you do.

537
00:59:04,251 --> 00:59:04,964
慢用
Enjoy.

538
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:15,511
来
All right.

539
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:23,711
想打扮打扮吗？
Wanna spruce up?

540
00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:26,854
干嘛，我带着备用
What, I carry a spare

541
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:30,118
以防玩过头
in case I wake up somewhere unexpected.

542
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:35,535
他怎么样？
So how is he?

543
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,309
托马斯
Thomas.

544
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:42,304
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

545
00:59:42,339 --> 00:59:45,723
- 少来 - 我真的不想谈他
- Oh, come on. - I really don't want to talk about that.

546
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,615
好吧
Okay.

547
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:53,373
你真得放松放松
You really need to relax.

548
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:01,856
一颗给你
One for you,

549
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:03,853
一颗给我
one for me.

550
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:09,063
别担心，货很纯，我保证是从旧金山带过来的
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise. I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

551
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,464
这是什么？
What is it?

552
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:14,553
开玩笑？
Are you kidding?

553
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,788
你从没嗑过药？
You've never rolled?

554
01:00:20,112 --> 01:00:23,373
别担心，它能帮你放松下来
Oh, relax. Here. It'll loosen you up.

555
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:27,369
你会看见无垠的夜空
Wait till you see the night sky.

556
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,551
药力会持续多久？
How long does it last?

557
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:35,073
最多，几个小时
A couple hours, tops.

558
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,325
不用了
It's okay.

559
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,987
好吧
Okay.

560
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:47,466
尼娜！
Nina, hi!

561
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:54,024
我们有伴了，这是汤姆，这是杰瑞
I thought we could use some company. So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

562
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:57,721
- 实际上，我叫安德鲁 - 汤姆
- Actually it's Andrew. - Tom.

563
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:01,419
- 我得走了… - 不行，不能走，我刚点了酒
- I have to go... - Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

564
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:03,742
我不应该…
I shouldn't...

565
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:05,557
我们明天要上台
We're on the stage tomorrow.

566
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:07,686
去哪？回家找妈妈？
So what are you going to do? Go home to Mommy?

567
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:13,057
来吧，玩一会
Come on, live a little.

568
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:19,117
药力只有几个小时，是吗？
It's just a couple hours, right?

569
01:02:20,451 --> 01:02:21,561
是的
Tops.

570
01:02:25,897 --> 01:02:26,501
干杯
Cheers.

571
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,088
你还没告诉我你是谁
You haven't told me who you are.

572
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,472
我是个舞蹈演员
I'm a dancer.

573
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:34,053
不是这意思，你的名字
No, I mean your name.

574
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:37,069
- 尼娜 - 你俩是姐妹？
- Oh. Nina. - So are you two sisters?

575
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:38,020
- 是的 - 不是
- Yes. - No.

576
01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:42,363
- 闺中姐妹 - 我们在同一个团跳舞
- Blood sisters. - We dance in the same company.

577
01:02:42,398 --> 01:02:46,109
芭蕾舞女演员，难怪你们长的这么像
Ah, ballerinas. No wonder you two look alike.

578
01:02:46,144 --> 01:02:49,101
我也看出来了，你俩是同志小情人
I see now. Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

579
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:51,091
- 真幽默 - 我喜欢自娱自乐
- Very funny. - I like to amuse myself.

580
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:52,577
我从来没接触过芭蕾
I've never been to the ballet.

581
01:02:52,612 --> 01:02:55,521
这么看，你绝对不是同志
Then you are definitely not gay.

582
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:57,465
我是说，芭蕾有点枯燥，是不是？
I mean, it's kind of boring, isn't it?

583
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,617
- 老实说 - 不，不是这样
- Be honest. - No it's not.

584
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:01,654
这么说吧，不是每个人都能接受
You know what? It's just not for everyone.

585
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:04,567
找个时间过来看看，我给你们赠
You should come sometime. I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

586
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:06,011
好，好
Yeah. Yeah.

587
01:03:06,873 --> 01:03:08,562
- 那真是太棒了，谢谢 - 好了…
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks. - Okay well...

588
01:03:08,597 --> 01:03:10,547
我们再喝一杯
I think it's time for another round.

589
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:14,044
干杯
Bottoms up.

590
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,041
你们在排什么戏？
So what are you guys working on now?

591
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:24,173
不好意思
Sorry.

592
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,002
天鹅湖
Swan Lake.

593
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,299
是吗？
Yeah?

594
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:30,986
你看过？
You know it?

595
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:32,883
没有
No, not really.

596
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:33,925
听说过
Heard of it.

597
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,355
说的什么？
What's it about?

598
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:38,957
是说一个女孩被人变成了天鹅
It's about a girl who gets turned into a swan,

599
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:41,563
她需要爱的力量打破诅咒
and she needs love to break the spell.

600
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,250
可她的王子却爱上了不该爱的人
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

601
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:50,290
于是她自杀了
and so she kills herself.

602
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:53,527
是个悲剧
It's not a happy ending then.

603
01:03:53,562 --> 01:03:56,698
实际上，很美
It's beautiful, actually.

604
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:00,945
像你一样
Like you.

605
01:04:02,077 --> 01:04:03,028
什么？
Huh?

606
01:04:04,264 --> 01:04:05,292
我说你很美
I said you're beautiful.

607
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:10,112
很好笑？
That's funny?

608
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:22,425
某人的情绪上来喽
Looks like someone might be rolling.

609
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,739
好了，过来，去跳舞
All right, come on. Come on, it's time to go dance.

610
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:49,200
尼娜！
Nina!

611
01:05:25,813 --> 01:05:28,314
搞什么？你去哪？
Hey, what the fuck? Where you going?

612
01:05:51,423 --> 01:05:51,906
尼娜！
Nina!

613
01:05:53,311 --> 01:05:54,181
你去哪？
Where are you going?

614
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,241
你知道现在几点了吗？
Do you have any idea what time it is?

615
01:07:20,276 --> 01:07:22,133
很晚了？
Late?

616
01:07:24,928 --> 01:07:26,185
你去了哪？
Where have you been?

617
01:07:26,995 --> 01:07:29,167
到月亮上去了
To the moon and back.

618
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,609
- 你喝酒了 - 猜 对 啦！
- You've been drinking. - Ding ding ding ding ding!

619
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,347
还有什么？
- What else? - Hmm?

620
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,907
你还做了什么？
What else have you been doing?

621
01:07:39,593 --> 01:07:41,513
原来你想知道他们的名字？
Oh, you want to know their names?

622
01:07:43,704 --> 01:07:47,403
- 快去睡觉 - 是两个人，汤姆和杰瑞
- You need to sleep this off. - There were two. Tom and Jerry.

623
01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:49,845
- 闭嘴，尼娜 - 我和他们都上了床
- Be quiet, Nina. - And I fucked them both.

624
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,934
闭嘴！
Shut your mouth!

625
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:06,065
- 不许进来 - 你干什么？
- Don't come in here. - What's this?

626
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,470
懂不懂什么叫隐私，我不再是小女孩了
It's called privacy. I'm not twelve anymore.

627
01:08:09,505 --> 01:08:12,052
- 你现在脑子不清楚 - 走开！
- You're not my Nina right now... - Leave me alone!

628
01:10:09,453 --> 01:10:10,921
小甜心
Sweat girl.

629
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,344
为什么不叫醒我？
Why didn't you wake me up?

630
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:13,091
我要搬出去
I'm moving out.

631
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:18,583
是我的曲子！
My music!

632
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,876
托马斯，真对不起
Thomas, I am so sorry.

633
01:11:37,911 --> 01:11:39,790
继续跳
Keep on going.

634
01:11:41,376 --> 01:11:42,440
去热身
Go get warmed up.

635
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:25,677
很好
That was good.

636
01:12:28,297 --> 01:12:29,166
非常之好
Actually, really good.

637
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:31,373
好，休息十分钟
Okay, let's take ten.

638
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,963
他只是让我示范一下，明白吗？
Look, he just wanted to mark it and asked me to step up, okay?

639
01:12:42,882 --> 01:12:44,097
我睡过了头
I overslept.

640
01:12:45,049 --> 01:12:47,798
惨喽，不过你玩很开心，对吗？
Oops. But hey, at least you had a good time, right?

641
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,473
你在我酒里下了东西
You put something in my drink.

642
01:12:49,508 --> 01:12:51,303
没错
Yeah.

643
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:53,005
早上却一个人先走了
And then you just took off in the morning.

644
01:12:54,463 --> 01:12:55,188
早上？
In the morning?

645
01:12:55,223 --> 01:12:57,157
你在我家过的夜
Yeah, you slept over.

646
01:12:59,718 --> 01:13:00,580
没有
Um, no.

647
01:13:02,323 --> 01:13:04,973
除非你叫汤姆，还长了一根老二
Unless your name's Tom and you had a dick.

648
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,590
我们…

649
01:13:07,573 --> 01:13:08,602
我们怎么了，尼娜？
What, Nina?

650
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:17,654
是不是在梦里和我上床了？
Did you have some sort of lesbian wet dream about me?

651
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:20,091
- 别说了 - 老天！
- Stop. - Oh my God!

652
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:23,434
老天，是真的！我成了你的性幻想对象！
Oh my God, you did! You fantasized about me!

653
01:13:23,454 --> 01:13:25,881
- 闭嘴！ - 我床上功夫好吗？
- Shut up! - Was I good?

654
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,323
最后一幕
The final act.

655
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:13,313
你的最后一场戏
You're trying to dance.

656
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:18,941
梦想几乎成真！如此真实！
You've tasted your dream! Touched it!

657
01:15:21,203 --> 01:15:23,302
可却被砸得粉碎！
Only to have it crushed!

658
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,390
你的心破碎了！
Your heart is broken,

659
01:15:28,425 --> 01:15:31,750
受伤了，你的生命在枯萎
wounded. Your life force fading.

660
01:15:31,785 --> 01:15:35,469
鲜血滴滴下坠
The blood drips.

661
01:15:37,473 --> 01:15:41,725
黑天鹅偷走了你的爱人，只有一条路可以熄灭痛苦
The Black Swan stole your love. There is only one way to end the pain.

662
01:15:43,862 --> 01:15:47,359
你不再恐惧，接受了命运的安排
You are not fearful, but filled with acceptance.

663
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:52,623
你垂目看了看罗斯巴
And you look down at Rothbart,

664
01:15:52,624 --> 01:15:53,743
又看了看王子
and then at the Prince,

665
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:58,859
之后，对，注视观众
and then, yes, at the audience.

666
01:15:58,894 --> 01:16:01,984
然后，纵身跃下
And then you jump.

667
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:07,639
快点，跳，没事的，跳！
Go ahead. Jump. Jump!

668
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,007
好了，大家去喝杯水，然后做分段练习
Okay, everybody get a drink of water, then it's notes.

669
01:16:34,211 --> 01:16:35,405
你瘦了
You lost weight.

670
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,047
请脱下披肩
Take off your shrug, please.

671
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:49,546
很好
Very good.

672
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:57,801
向前看，快好了
Face front. We're almost done.

673
01:17:02,061 --> 01:17:04,083
完成，好了
And that's it. Okay.

674
01:17:04,118 --> 01:17:06,214
好了，非常感谢
We're done. Thank you very much.

675
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:11,622
乔治娜，我叫莉莉，托马斯让我来…
Georgina, I'm Lily. Thomas sent me...

676
01:17:11,657 --> 01:17:14,462
我知道，给你也做一身天鹅女王的服装
Yes, we have to get you measured for the Swan Queen costumes.

677
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,623
她怎么在这？
What's she doing here?

678
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:19,186
他让我做你的替补
He made me your alternate.

679
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,338
只是以防万一
Look, it's just in case.

680
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:27,457
托马斯，托马斯
Thomas. Thomas.

681
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,588
- 托马斯 - 什么事？
- Thomas. - Yes?

682
01:17:28,623 --> 01:17:30,741
不可以用她
It can't be her.

683
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:32,639
不可以用她
It can't be her.

684
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:34,155
你先去，我一会来
Okay, why don't you just go. I'll catch up later.

685
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,939
怎么了？
What's going on?

686
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:39,006
莉莉...你让她做我的替补？
Lily... You made her my alternate?

687
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:43,303
这是惯例，莉莉是最佳人选
There's always an alternate. Lily is the best choice.

688
01:17:43,338 --> 01:17:44,737
不，她想顶掉我
No, she wants my role.

689
01:17:44,772 --> 01:17:47,110
每个人都想顶掉你
Every dancer in the world wants your role.

690
01:17:47,145 --> 01:17:49,642
不，这不一样，她别有用心
No, this is different. She is after me.

691
01:17:49,677 --> 01:17:53,094
- 她想取代我 - 没有人别有用心
- She is trying to replace me. - Nobody is after you.

692
01:17:53,129 --> 01:17:55,971
不，请相信我…
- No, please believe me...

693
01:17:58,526 --> 01:18:03,844
我知道你压力很大，不过，你早上的表演很有突破
I know it's been a struggle. But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

694
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:10,245
明天是属于你的，演一出好戏，谁也不用想
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

695
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:14,877
现在回家，好好休息
Now go home and rest.

696
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:30,600
从“幻梦”再来一次
From the vision again.

697
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:48,732
怎么回事？
What happened?

698
01:18:50,843 --> 01:18:54,826
我有我的生活，别太拼了，明天是大日子
I've got a life.don't work too hard. It's a big day tomorrow.

699
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:40,910
我还在工作
I'm still working in here.

700
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:52,919
请把灯打开好吗？
Could you please turn the lights back on?

701
01:19:59,073 --> 01:19:59,523
有人吗？
Hello?

702
01:21:47,854 --> 01:21:48,938
你来干什么？
What are you doing here?

703
01:21:48,973 --> 01:21:50,880
对不起
I'm so sorry.

704
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:53,213
对不起
I'm so sorry.

705
01:21:53,248 --> 01:21:57,826
现在我才了解那种感受，她想取代我
I know how it feels now. She's trying to replace me.

706
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,444
我该怎么办？
What do I do?

707
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:04,880
你偷我东西？
You stole my things?

708
01:22:04,915 --> 01:22:07,554
我想完美，像你一样
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

709
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:11,149
完美？
Perfect?

710
01:22:17,061 --> 01:22:18,292
我一点也不完美
I'm not perfect.

711
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:21,800
我什么都不是
I'm nothing.

712
01:22:24,756 --> 01:22:27,360
什么都不是！
Nothing!

713
01:22:36,272 --> 01:22:37,567
不是！不是！
Nothing, nothing!

714
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,505
乖女儿
Sweet girl.

715
01:23:46,935 --> 01:23:47,412
妈妈？
Mommy?

716
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:53,735
乖女儿，乖女儿
Sweet girl. Sweet girl.

717
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,889
闭嘴！
Stop!

718
01:24:08,678 --> 01:24:09,556
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

719
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:12,961
宝贝？
Sweetie?

720
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,437
尼娜？
Nina?

721
01:24:21,472 --> 01:24:23,224
尼娜！
Nina!

722
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:24,527
走开！
Go away!

723
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:26,978
开门！
Open the door!

724
01:24:27,013 --> 01:24:28,210
走开！
Go away!

725
01:24:37,017 --> 01:24:38,790
开门！尼娜！
Open the door, Nina!

726
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,927
尼娜！
Nina!

727
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:54,238
出去！
Get out!

728
01:24:54,273 --> 01:24:56,515
- 你到底怎么了？ - 出去！
- What's wrong with you? - Get out!

729
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,554
- 出去！ - 你看见什么了？
- Get out! - What do you see?

730
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:00,260
出去！
Get out!

731
01:25:39,037 --> 01:25:40,171
没事了
It's okay.

732
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:42,275
妈在这
I'm here.

733
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:48,761
你整晚都在抓
You were scratching all night.

734
01:25:48,796 --> 01:25:51,062
我的闹钟呢？
Where's my clock?

735
01:25:51,097 --> 01:25:53,388
- 别管了 - 几点了？
- Don't worry about that. - What time is it?

736
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:56,669
- 今晚演出，我必须… - 不行，不行…
- The show is tonight, I have to... - No, no, no, no.

737
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:57,966
别担心
Don't worry.

738
01:25:58,001 --> 01:26:00,982
我给剧院打了电话，告诉他们你不舒服
I called the theater and I told them you aren't feeling well.

739
01:26:01,017 --> 01:26:02,118
我一定得去！
I have to go!

740
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:03,714
- 不行，不行，不能去 - 放开我
- No. No, you don't. - Let go of me.

741
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,448
你身子不好，不能离开
You're staying in here until you feel better.

742
01:26:08,483 --> 01:26:09,967
门把手呢？
Where is it?

743
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,384
这个角色会毁了你
This role is destroying you.

744
01:26:15,074 --> 01:26:16,674
- 过去！过去！ - 尼娜…！
- Move. Move! - Nina...!

745
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:20,127
- 我的乖女儿到底怎么了？ - 她死了！
- What happened to my sweet girl? - She's gone!

746
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,138
尼娜！尼娜！
Nina! Oh, Nina!

747
01:26:24,092 --> 01:26:24,884
不，求你！
No, please!

748
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:27,051
- 你生病了！ - 放开我！
- You're not well! - Let go of me!

749
01:26:27,086 --> 01:26:28,755
你承受不了
You can't handle this.

750
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,620
我承受不了？
I can't?

751
01:26:30,655 --> 01:26:33,700
我是天鹅女王，而你只能一辈子跑龙套
I'm the Swan Queen. You're the one who never left the corps.

752
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,031
尼娜！
Nina!

753
01:26:52,503 --> 01:26:53,297
你来干什么？
What are you doing here?

754
01:26:53,332 --> 01:26:54,563
尼娜？
Nina?

755
01:26:54,598 --> 01:26:56,506
她不是病了吗？
She was supposed to be sick.

756
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,991
等等，我和她谈一会
Give us a minute.

757
01:27:03,387 --> 01:27:03,935
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

758
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,702
我很好
I'm fine.

759
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:10,981
尼娜
Nina.

760
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,013
尼娜
Nina.

761
01:27:14,248 --> 01:27:15,315
干什么？
What?

762
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:18,032
我已经让莉莉上了
I've already asked Lily.

763
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:20,011
你正式宣布了吗？
Have you announced it?

764
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:26,094
经过贝丝那件事，你还想制造新话题吗？
After Beth, do you really need another controversy?

765
01:27:30,555 --> 01:27:32,162
我来了，托马斯
I'm here, Thomas.

766
01:27:32,197 --> 01:27:33,671
我来演
I'm doing it.

767
01:27:39,874 --> 01:27:42,270
你的本性在障碍你
The only person standing in your way is you.

768
01:27:42,305 --> 01:27:46,958
赶走它，释放你自己
It's time to let it go. Lose yourself.

769
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:03,708
白天鹅，十分钟后上场
White Swan, up in ten.

770
01:28:57,668 --> 01:28:59,391
你在干什么？该你上台了
What are you doing? You need to be upstage.

771
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:01,629
你演得真差
You suck.

772
01:31:03,232 --> 01:31:04,649
尼娜
Okay, Nina.

773
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:44,468
搞什么？
What the fuck?

774
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,557
- 你没事吧？ - 尼娜，你没事吧？
- Are you okay? - Nina, are you okay?

775
01:32:41,101 --> 01:32:42,400
你说，到底他妈怎么回事？
Can you tell me what the fuck happened?

776
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:47,994
- 不是我的错，是他失的手 - 真他妈失败
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. - This is a fucking disaster.

777
01:32:56,268 --> 01:32:59,779
开局不顺吧？一定丢死人了
Rough start, huh? Must have been pretty humiliating.

778
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:02,856
滚出我的房间
Get out of my room.

779
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:05,309
我真为下一场捏一把汗
I'm worried about the next act.

780
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,067
我觉得你心有余而力不足
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

781
01:33:09,102 --> 01:33:10,602
别说了，快别说了
Stop. Please stop.

782
01:33:10,637 --> 01:33:15,889
黑天鹅还是让我跳吧？
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

783
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,652
走开！
Leave me alone!

784
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:33,254
该我了！
My turn!

785
01:33:34,218 --> 01:33:34,874
该我了！
My turn!

786
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,659
该我了！
My turn!

787
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:45,468
该我了！
It's my turn!

788
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:06,549
黑天鹅，五分钟后上场
Black Swan, places in five.

789
01:37:09,424 --> 01:37:11,297
快过来
Come on.

790
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,817
跳得漂亮，十五分钟以后，最后一幕
Good job. Fifteen to the last act.

791
01:38:26,649 --> 01:38:29,666
嘿，你真绝了
Hey. You were amazing.

792
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:33,424
说真的，我知道我们之间有点小误会
Seriously, I know that things got a little messed up between us,

793
01:38:33,459 --> 01:38:36,862
但是，老天，我服你了！
but I mean, holy shit, you completely blew me away!

794
01:38:39,561 --> 01:38:41,499
好了，不说了
Okay, well I guess that's it.

795
01:38:41,534 --> 01:38:43,272
不妨碍你了，再见
So I'll let you finish. Bye.

796
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,053
听见观众的欢呼吗？
Can you hear them?

797
01:42:09,388 --> 01:42:12,093
他们爱你！他们爱你！
They love you!

798
01:42:12,128 --> 01:42:15,820
我的小公主，我就知道你有那股魔力
My little princess, I always knew you had it in you.

799
01:42:15,855 --> 01:42:18,475
来，我们一起出去
Come on. Let's take you out.

800
01:42:24,698 --> 01:42:25,451
快去叫人！
Go get some help.

801
01:42:25,486 --> 01:42:26,450
快去叫人！
Go get some help!

802
01:42:26,485 --> 01:42:27,917
你都干了什么？
What did you do?

803
01:42:27,952 --> 01:42:29,073
你都干了什么？
What did you do?

804
01:42:29,108 --> 01:42:33,265
- 我感觉到了 - 什么？
- I felt it. - What?

805
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,580
完美
I felt perfect.

806
01:42:41,397 --> 01:42:42,595
我完美了
I was perfect.

807
01:42:53,678 --> 01:42:56,112
尼娜！尼娜！尼娜！
Nina! Nina! Nina!

808
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:46,890
