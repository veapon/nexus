1
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,470
我小时候
When I was younger

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,720
想做一个牧师
I wanted to be a priest.

3
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,520
和世上的邪恶作战
I was going into battle

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,310
拯救人们的灵魂
to save men's souls from the evil of the world.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,230
但随着年龄的增大
But as I got older,

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,730
我看到了世界的真实面目
I saw the world for what it really was.

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,530
不是我能拯救谁的问题
It wasn't so much who I was going to save,

8
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,070
而是谁能阻止我破坏世界
but who was gonna save the world from me.

9
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,870
（ 二个月以前 ）

10
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,100
? No friends, no jokes, no money ?

11
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,930
?Try to shove me when I'm working my shit ?

12
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,980
? I'll be bringing 'em out, I'm cool ?

13
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,980
? Can't take shit from me in the street ?

14
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,440
? When they come with that beef you know what I'm about... ?

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,280
- 他还好吗　- 还行
- How is he? - He's holding up.

16
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,700
你要知道　他很高兴你去看他
You got to know he appreciates you coming to visit.

17
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,120
我知道
Yeah, I know, man.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,620
只是看见爸爸坐牢　心里不舒服
It's just hard seeing your old man sitting in a fucking cage.

19
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,660
我们走
Let's roll.

20
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,750
? Standing out in the rain ?

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,300
? I never thought this is where I'd be... ?

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,840
真是的　怎么这么多女性杂志
Jesus, what is with all these girlie magazines?

23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,550
你真的需要吗
I mean really, do you need all this?

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,010
- 是的　- 《十招…》
- Yeah, I do. - "10 ways--

25
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,510
- 《接吻十招》　- 闭嘴
- 10 better ways to be a better kisser." - Shut up.

26
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,260
《你不了解的男人的十件事》
"10 things you don't know about him."

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,850
使劲打我　用点力气
Come on, hit me harder. Hit me, come on.

28
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,930
钢铁男人　你是伤害不了的
You can't hurt the man of steel. Come on, honey.

29
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,520
我需要这杂志
I need them.

30
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,360
好吧
- Okay.

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,070
钢铁男人　该把箱子带到车库了吧
Is the man of steel gonna finish taking the boxes out of the garage or what?

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,450
好
- Okay. - Ooh.

33
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,530
我爱你
I love you.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,620
我要走了　我爱你
I've got to go. I love you.

35
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,290
我要走了
I've got to go.

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,250
喂
Hey.

37
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,750
早点回家
Come home soon.

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,380
好
Yeah.

39
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,630
嗨　桑尼
Hey, Sonny.

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,050
你好
How are you doing?

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,100
喂　大卫　和我们一起打球吧
Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?

42
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,520
不行　我还有事
Can't, man. I've got to go.

43
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,600
喂　你刚搬来一周
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.

44
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,810
怎么别人都已经知道你的名字了?
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?

45
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,190
- 你怎么老烦他　- 这是本事
- Why you always riding him? - it's a gift.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,610
只有个性出众　有吸引力的人才有
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.

47
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,570
你也就能说罢了
Big fucking mouth you mean.

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,530
好吧　不近人情的家伙　等你将来看见美女
Okay, Mr. Antisocial. Next time you're standing next to some chick

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,870
想泡她的时候　会需要我这张嘴的
trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,540
得了吧
Yeah.

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,210
泡妞还用得着你帮忙?
The day I need you to help me get laid--

52
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,830
你老婆都对我眉来眼去呢
I see the way your woman looks at me.

53
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,720
你用眼睛强奸我吗
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?

54
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,010
没
No, dog.

55
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,260
我在监狱长办公室的朋友说　到下周
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass

56
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,810
就把你转移到普通监狱　到时会有人强奸你的
back in general next week. Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.

57
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,850
去你的　黑鬼　我怕个屁
Fuck you, nigger. Anytime.

58
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,560
你很牛X啊
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?

59
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,360
所以才把你关押在C区
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,190
那是关押娘们和叛徒的地方
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.

61
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,530
你是其中哪种人
Which one you be?

62
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,290
喂
Hey!

63
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,710
你还有话要说吗　黑鬼?
You got something to say now, nigger?

64
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,130
谁才是娘们啊　混蛋?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?

65
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,090
怎么不说话了啊
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?

66
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,090
说啊　大点声　我听不见
Come on, I can't hear you. Come on, motherfucker.

67
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,350
说啊　我随时都可以收拾你
Run your mouth. I'll fuck you anytime, man.

68
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,390
- 随时都可以　- 闭嘴
- Any fucking time. - Shut up!

69
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,480
闭上你的嘴　闭上你的嘴
Keep your mouth shut. Keep your mouth shut.

70
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,600
我们到普通监狱再见
Hey, general population, I'll see you there.

71
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,320
别老抱着酒瓶　你到底喝不喝了
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle or are you gonna drink it?

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,980
怎么　你等不及了?
What, you in a hurry, man?

73
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,360
给我　我喝两口暖暖
Pass that shit. I need to warm up.

74
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,830
我还记得你第一次
I was just remembering the first time

75
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,830
见我爸爸的时候
Dave ever met my pop.

76
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,210
吓得都要尿裤子了
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.

77
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,790
记得吗　你说话都结巴了
You remember that? You were stuttering.

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,420
很…很高兴见到你　先…先生
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."

79
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,170
去你的吧
Fuck you. Whatever, man.

80
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,800
我不笑话你怕他　我也怕他
I don't blame you for being scared, man. I've been scared of him too.

81
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
这老头很凶的
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.

82
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,050
他只是说话凶
Nah, he was just all talk.

83
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,890
你就是这样　也就嘴上能说
All talk? That's all you've been doing is talking.

84
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,560
快喝吧
Start drinking.

85
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,060
- 天　这里真冷　- 冷死了
- Man, it is cold up here. - Fucking freezing.

86
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,230
嗨　嗨
Hey, man, hey.

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,240
知道我为什么喜欢来这里吗
You know why I love being up here, man?

88
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,160
到这里就心胸开阔了
It's just like being above it all, man.

89
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,490
一切困难都看得淡了
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.

90
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,580
你如果心里有疙瘩　我可以开导你
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

91
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,910
- 不过　你能让我喝两口吗　- 去你的
- But can I have the bottle? - Yeah, right.

92
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,130
什么假期啊
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.

93
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,670
高兴点
Lighten up, man.

94
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,890
别难过　哥们　我们爱你
Come on, bro, relax. We love you, man.

95
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,850
来　拥抱一下
Come on, hug it out. Rrr.

96
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,350
哥们　放开我
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,690
我就知道他来这套
I knew he wasn't going for that.

98
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,110
我们走吧　明天还有事呢
Come on, let's bounce. We've got work tomorrow.

99
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,360
? I won't fade out, I won't back down ?

100
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,150
I We're gonna raise up from the underground ?

101
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,160
? Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud ?

102
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,950
? I'm not going to fade... ?

103
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,330
把音乐关掉吧　烦死了
We got to turn this shit off. it's annoying.

104
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,870
喂　几点了
Hey, man, what time is it?

105
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,170
距离你上次问我　过去了5分钟
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.

106
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,670
别紧张
Chill the fuck out.

107
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,090
他迟到了
He's late, man.

108
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,970
是啊
Yeah.

109
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,390
- 他来了　- 我们干
- Shit, there he is. - Let's do this.

110
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,350
下车　趴在地上别动　否则就宰了你
Get out. Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.

111
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,820
别逼我砸破窗户
Don't make me break this fucking window.

112
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,070
趴下
Get down!

113
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,040
出来　宝贝　出来
Come here, sweetheart. Come here.

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,870
- 别开枪　我只是送货的　- 你闭嘴
- Don't shoot. I'm just a courier. - You shut the fuck up.

115
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
我只是送货的　别杀我
I'm just a courier. Don't kill me.

116
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,420
拿去吧　别伤害我
- Take it, take it. Don't hurt me. - Shut up!

117
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,750
- 别开枪　- 别再看我
- Don't shoot! - Quit looking at me.

118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,510
你闭嘴
You, shut the fuck up!

119
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,510
别开枪　我只是送货的
Don't shoot! I'm just a courier!

120
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,890
我们走　离开这儿
Let's go, let's go! Let's fucking get out of here!

121
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,930
快走　我们离开这里
Come on, let's go. Get the fuck in here!

122
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,850
我们必须走　快
We've gotta move! Come on!

123
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,900
快上车
Get in here!

124
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,650
快上车　快
Get the fuck in! Dude, let's go.

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,530
快点　我们必须走了
Let's fucking get out of here! We've got to fucking go, man!

126
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,610
快　快
Come on. Fuck, come on.

127
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,410
你是怎么了　文斯
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?

128
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,750
杀那个人　不是我们的计划
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.

129
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,040
我和你说话的时候看着我
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

130
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,170
不必杀人的
Nobody was supposed to die, man.

131
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,010
他已经躺在地上　我控制了局势
He was fucking laying there. I had the situation under control.

132
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,340
不杀他　他就会
You think I want that guy out there looking for us

133
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,510
找机会给我一枪
trying to put a bullet in my head?

134
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,310
在我看来　我也是帮你们一个忙
Come on, man. The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.

135
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,520
帮忙?　那我以后不需要你帮这种忙
A favor? Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?

136
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,310
两位　两位
Ladies, ladies.

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,520
你俩别这么亲热了
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?

138
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,270
哥们　你…
Dude, what does that--

139
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,570
已经发生的事无法改变了
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?

140
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,110
- 我们需要团结　- 对
- We've just got to stick together. - Yeah.

141
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,620
这个笨蛋
Stupid.

142
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,580
- 你的人呢　- 他会来的
- Where's your guy? - He'll be here.

143
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,960
他知道我们会到废弃的卡车站?
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?

144
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,630
他知道
Yeah, I told him.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,380
- 他知道是河边的卡车站　- 对　他知道
- You say down by the river? - The river, yeah.

146
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,810
这一天我们等了很久了
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.

147
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,020
就别再搞砸了
Let's not fucking fall apart.

148
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,730
你们来看看
Yo, come check it out.

149
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,500
500万美元
- Five milly. - Whoo!

150
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,170
天　这么多钻石　500万呢
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man. Five million.

151
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,630
看见我为什么那么做了吧　我保护了你们
See, now you see why i did what i did, man. I got y'alls back.

152
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,390
他来了
Here he comes.

153
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,020
你俩在这儿等着
Why don't y'all wait here?

154
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,860
500万美元呢
$5 million, man.

155
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,280
足够我养活老婆了
I can take care of my girl.

156
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
你整天就知道想着你老婆
That's all you think about. Valerie this, Valerie that.

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,860
- 你想要什么　- 我等着这笔钱
- What do you want? - I'm waiting on that money.

158
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,620
- 你怎么样　- 没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

159
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,580
你真要这么做?
You sure?

160
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,000
没别的办法
Like I got a choice.

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
Oh!

162
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,550
- 你干什么　- 对不起了　哥们
- What the fuck are you doing? - I'm sorry, bro.

163
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,720
走　走
Let's go! Let's go!

164
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,570
在我躺着喘不过气来的时候
As I laid gasping for my next breath,

165
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,150
我知道上帝给了我第二次机会
I knew God had given me a second chance.

166
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,740
但我愚蠢的放弃了
But I was too stupid to take it.

167
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,740
当时只想得到我的东西
I was going to get what was mine.

168
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,120
桑尼　怎么回事
Sonny, what the fuck?

169
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,330
- 天　- 他对我开枪
- Fuck! - He shot me.

170
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,290
- 谁　- 文斯
- Who shot you? - Vince, man.

171
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,210
没开玩笑吧　坐下
Are you fucking kidding me? Sit down.

172
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,210
- 哪里中枪了　- 上面
- Where'd you get hit? - Up top.

173
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,470
躺下　躺下
Lay down. Lay down.

174
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,090
天
Oh fuck.

175
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,220
嵌入你的锁骨里了
It's lodged in your collarbone.

176
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
你手脏　拿开　让我看看
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there. Let me have a look.

177
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,020
你命大　子弹打中了你的十字架　我摘下来
You got lucky. Looks like it hit your cross. Let me get this off.

178
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,480
- 我妈给我的　- 我知道
- My mom gave me that. - Yeah, I know.

179
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,990
等一下　你需要喝两口
Hold on, you're gonna need this. Here.

180
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,110
因为会很疼的
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.

181
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,910
拿开　准备好了吗
Move this. Ready?

182
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,040
啊
Oh shit.

183
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,960
没那么深
It ain't even that deep.

184
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,710
火辣辣的
It's fucking burning, man.

185
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,960
我听说出事了
I heard something was gonna go down.

186
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,550
没想到是你们干的
I didn't think it was you guys.

187
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,010
你听说什么了
What did you hear, Joe?

188
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,890
让我先把这事干完
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?

189
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,760
啊
Ahh! Shit!

190
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,430
就在里面　坚持住
Fuck, it's in there. Hold on.

191
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,690
我看见了　感觉到了
I see the shit. I feel it.

192
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,940
啊
Oh Shit. Shit.

193
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,650
别动
Hold on, hold on.

194
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
天
Oh fuck.

195
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,780
不错吧　可以用它做个舌钉了
Nice, huh? I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.

196
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
真不敢相信他对我开枪　你听说什么了　乔
I can't believe he shot me, man. What'd you hear, Joey?

197
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,290
文斯找了一个
Vince was running his mouth

198
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,130
很有势力的人　说他有一笔大买卖
to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.

199
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,300
他为什么这么说　我们没找过他们
Why would he say that? We never kick back to them.

200
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,300
不知道　我觉得他是寻找保护
I don't know. I think he was just trying to buy some protection.

201
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
按住　按住
Hold that there. Hold that.

202
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,190
去哪儿　你要躺下
Where the fuck are you going? You need to lay down.

203
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,020
- 我要找到他　- 是吗
- I got to find him. - Oh, yeah, genius?

204
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,740
你穿着有洞的血衣在大街上走?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?

205
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,030
这不是往警察枪口上撞吗　脱了
Cops won't be looking for that. Take that shit off.

206
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
给
Here.

207
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,710
- 听着　你知道约翰・R吧　- 知道　黑社会的　有个赌场
- Listen, you know John R, right? - Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.

208
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,920
对　在伍德沃路　本周五晚上
Yeah, down on Woodward. Now I'll bet

209
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,330
我肯定有人会去那里
if someone was to go down there this Friday night,

210
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,590
他或许见过文斯　或知道他下落的人
he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.

211
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,930
- 谢谢　乔　- 等一下
- Thanks, Joey. - Hey, hold on.

212
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,810
尽量别再中枪了
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?

213
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,560
有什么需要就回来
You need anything, you come back here.

214
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,020
- 好吗　- 好的
- All right? - All right.

215
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,590
你想谈谈吗
Do you want to talk about it?

216
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,930
谈什么
Talk about what?

217
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
让你来这里的原因
Whatever brought you here.

218
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,350
我来替朋友祈祷的
I'm here to pray for a friend.

219
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,770
哦
Ah.

220
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,810
他病了吗
Is he sick?

221
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,900
不他死了
No. He's dead.

222
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,450
原谅我问起
Forgive me for asking.

223
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,870
你们亲近吗
Were you close?

224
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,780
是的
Yeah.

225
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,950
情同兄弟
We were like brothers.

226
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,500
那你放心　他肯定去了更好的地方了
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.

227
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,050
你怎么能肯定　你死过吗
How do you know? You ever been dead before?

228
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,890
条条大路通往上帝　孩子
There are many paths to God, my son.

229
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,520
但愿你的路不会特别艰难
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.

230
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,480
（ 职业杀手）

231
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,490
- 给　- 谢谢
- There you are. - Thank you, sir.

232
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,170
漂亮的线条
Hey, beautiful lines.

233
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,090
是啊
Yeah.

234
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,550
500万美元能买很多辆这种车吧
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?

235
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,930
朋友　看来我们都在找同一样东西
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.

236
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,600
我不是你的朋友　也不找什么东西
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.

237
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,820
好吧　那我就直说了
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?

238
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,690
你们拿走了我们的东西　我们想要回来
You took something from us and we want it back.

239
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,280
他们派了我来办这事
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.

240
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,740
不过　如果你帮助我们
However, if you help us,

241
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,580
我们可以不追究你的责任
we are willing to overlook your part in it.

242
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,880
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

243
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,380
拜托　我只用了两天就找到你了
Hey, come on. It only took me two days to find you.

244
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,760
如果你不帮忙　我也找到钻石的话
And if I get those stones without your help,

245
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,840
我们还会见面的
we are going to meet again.

246
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,220
只不过到那时候　你就是一具死尸了
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.

247
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,930
知道吗
Are we clear?

248
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,520
本来按他们的意思
Look, if it was up to my friends

249
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,270
直接杀了你算了
you'd be dead already.

250
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,900
但我是有耐心的人
But I'm a patient man.

251
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,910
给你一周时间
You've got one week, huh?

252
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,950
很高心见到你
It was very nice meeting you.

253
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,950
两位女士　你们好吗
Oh, hey, ladies. How's it going?

254
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,370
你们今晚去哪儿
What you guys up to tonight?

255
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,590
拜托　别这样嘛
Oh come on, don't be like that.

256
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,630
你给我打开门
Could you get that door for me, big man?

257
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,420
没问题
Sure, no problem.

258
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
你打牌别这么没用好不好
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?

259
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,970
- 我不跟　- 你就闭嘴吧
- I'm out. - Shut your trap, you fuck stick.

260
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,770
你把钱拿去吧
In fact, take that.

261
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,270
把手举起来
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

262
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,770
- 你要抢劫我们吗　- 别高兴的太早
- Are you robbing us? - Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

263
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
你知道你招惹的是谁吗
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

264
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,280
重新开始谈
All right, now let's start over.

265
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,030
好吧　你有何贵干
Okay, what can we do for you?

266
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,620
这样才对　我在找文斯・朗
Now we're getting somewhere. I'm looking for Vincent Long.

267
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,660
- 谁见过他吗　- 没有
- Anybody seen him? - No.

268
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,210
谁都会有健忘症
Of course everyone's got amnesia.

269
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,000
但如果你们记起来的话
But if you get your memory back,

270
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,380
告诉他　有个老朋友在找他
tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?

271
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,420
现在再抢劫你们
And now I'm robbing you.

272
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,840
- 你小子看什么　- 没什么
- What the fuck are you looking at? - Nothing.

273
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,400
- 你们怎么样　- 挺好
- How's everything over here? - Very good.

274
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,360
好的
Okay? Good.

275
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,160
- 吃完了?　- 对　吃完了
- All done? - Yeah, I'm finished.

276
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,080
- 结账吧　- 好
- I just need the check, please. - Okay.

277
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,540
给
Here you go.

278
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,960
今晚顾客不多啊
Slow night tonight, huh?

279
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,670
是啊　挣钱糊口吧
Yeah well, it pays the bills.

280
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,640
其实我是歌手　不会再在这里干下去了
I'm really a singer. I'm not gonna be here much longer.

281
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,680
为什么呢
And why is that?

282
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,560
我每晚祈祷
Well, I pray every night

283
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,430
上帝给我一个唱片合同
that God gets me a record contract.

284
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,020
- 他听见了吗　- 当然听见了
- Does He hear you? - Of course He does.

285
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,900
我只要等着轮到我
I just have to wait my turn.

286
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,820
不　这是给你的小费
No no, that's for you.

287
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,860
谢谢
Thank you.

288
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,860
你也会交好运的
Good things are coming to you too.

289
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,570
我保证
- I promise.

290
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,450
节日快乐
Happy holidays.

291
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,510
（ 打手 ）

292
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,340
能听见吗
You with me?

293
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,720
- 叫什么名字　- 桑尼
- You got a name? - Sonny.

294
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,560
是春光明媚的桑尼吗
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"

295
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,310
去你的　你是谁
Fuck you. Who are you?

296
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,810
好了　桑尼　该睡觉了
All right, Sonny. Sleepy-time.

297
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,810
（ 黑帮老大 ）

298
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,660
你疯了吗
Are you out of your fucking mind?

299
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,030
是吗
Are you?

300
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,410
我在找一个所谓的朋友　他对我开枪
I'm looking for my so-called friend. He shot me.

301
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,750
- 我要找到他　- 然后对他开枪?
- I'm gonna find him. - So you can shoot him?

302
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,880
你白痴吗　你弱智吗
Are you retarded? Are you handicapped?

303
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,670
你以为到了我的地盘
You think you're gonna come into my town

304
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,180
不经过我的允许
and take down poker games,

305
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,800
就可以打扰别人打牌　开枪杀人吗
shoot whoever you want without my permission?

306
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,140
你说完了吗
Are you done with your speech?

307
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,310
别激动佩蒂
Take it easy, Petey.

308
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,110
对你开枪的人是谁
What's the name of the kid that shot you?

309
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,860
文斯　文斯・朗
Vincent. Vincent Long.

310
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,120
文斯・朗和约翰的人有来往?
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?

311
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,120
对他经常去玩
Yeah, he's been hanging around.

312
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,000
祝贺你
Congratulations.

313
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,670
你成功的惹恼了我的一群
You managed to piss off a very important group of people

314
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,750
重要的生意伙伴　也就等于你欠了我的债
that I make money with. That means you owe me now.

315
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,510
- 是这样吗　- 是这样的
- Is that right? - Yeah, that's right.

316
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,090
我说的每句话都是事实
Every fucking thing I say is right.

317
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,140
但我是公平的人
But I'm a fair guy.

318
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,390
你帮我解决麻烦
You help me out with my problem

319
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
我就帮你解决麻烦
and I can help you out with your problem.

320
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,270
你说
I'm listening.

321
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,230
我以前认识一个人　为俄国人洗钱
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.

322
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,360
但他的方式很有意思
But he had a funny way of counting.

323
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,530
每洗三块钱　他就自己留下一块钱
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.

324
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,950
积攒了很多钱
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.

325
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,080
200万美元
$2 million.

326
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,710
但后来被俄国人发现了
Only problem is the Russians found out about it

327
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,250
用斧子砍掉了他两条腿
and chopped both his legs off with a axe.

328
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
但没有找到钱
But they never found the money.

329
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,630
他的家人把钱和尸体一起埋了
His family buried it with him.

330
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,510
我可不去挖什么尸体
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.

331
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,430
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

332
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,180
我不让你挖尸体
I don't want you to dig anyone up.

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,640
俄国人找到了钱在哪里
The Russians found out where the money is.

334
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,060
他们今晚要挖出来
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight

335
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,770
你要把钱抢过来
and you're gonna take it from them.

336
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,110
对我有什么好处呢
What's in it for me?

337
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,240
很少有人知道自己的命值多少钱
Very few men know the exact value of their life.

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,570
现在你知道你的命值多少钱了
Now you know what yours is worth.

339
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,870
200万美元
$2 million.

340
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,450
为了确保你能把钱带回来
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,

341
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,500
我会派佩蒂和你一起去
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.

342
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,830
出去吧
Get out of here.

343
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,220
他们来了
Okay, there they are.

344
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,770
放松　等他们挖出来
Kick back, relax. We'll let them dig it up.

345
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,770
你有什么计划吗
Hey, you got a plan?

346
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,520
计划?　有　计划很复杂
A plan? Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.

347
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,400
你偷偷溜过去
You're gonna sneak your ass down there

348
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,990
打死那几个混蛋　抢过钱来
and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.

349
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,530
然后你就跑回来
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger

350
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,780
越快越好　明白了吗
at a police funeral. You down with that, homie?

351
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,240
那你在哪儿
And where you gonna be at?

352
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,830
在你不远处　你办砸了就一枪打死你
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,420
我带了钱来　怎么保证你不会杀了我?
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?

354
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,420
这就需要你赌一把了
That's what we call a calculated risk.

355
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,460
Ssst

356
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,880
好　挖到钱了
All right, they got it.

357
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,510
去抢钱吧
- Let's go. Go get it. - Shit.

358
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,500
跪下
Get down.

359
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,990
拿到了
Got it.

360
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,530
给了你200万美元　你还是要打死我?
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?

361
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,450
不
No.

362
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,160
但我不能一边开车　一边监视你
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.

363
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,540
需要你把枪交出来
I need that other gun.

364
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,380
谢谢　桑尼　你没事了
Thanks, Sonny. You're all right.

365
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,670
你真有胆
You've got some balls.

366
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,390
你现在不用担心了
You don't have to worry about your problem now.

367
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,350
比格斯是言而有信的人
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.

368
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,520
虽然你开始惹了她
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.

369
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,390
但你完成了任务　拿到了他要的钱
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.

370
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,310
我们去庆祝一下吧
Shit, let's celebrate.

371
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,150
你知道哪里能买到大麻吗
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?

372
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,940
我认识几个人　打电话联系一下
I know a few people. Let me make some phone calls.

373
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,990
买两包
Make it happen.

374
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,830
喂　哥们　我是桑尼
Hey, what's up? It's Sonny.

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,040
我知道
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.

376
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,550
我想去你那里　买点东西
Hey, I want to stop by there. You know, got to get a little something.

377
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,680
好　好的
All right. All right, cool.

378
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,110
你把钱留在后备箱里?
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?

379
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,740
是啊　怕什么
Yeah, why not?

380
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,110
没人知道我车里有200万美元
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?

381
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,510
你这么久才来
About time you showed up, man.

382
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,180
拜托
Come on, man.

383
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,560
这是谁
Who this?

384
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,600
佩蒂・G
G, Petey; Petey, G.

385
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,190
他是警察吗
Is he a cop?

386
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,560
怎么问这种傻问题
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?

387
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,440
我总要问问嘛
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.

388
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,780
你俩进来吧
Y'all come on in.

389
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,360
天
Damn.

390
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,250
你没听说战争结束了吗
Hey man, the war is over. Didn't you hear?

391
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,540
那要看是什么战争了
Depends on which war you're talking about.

392
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,830
你要买多少
How much you need?

393
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,840
好的　我可以安排
Oh yeah. I can handle that.

394
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,600
你最近可好　桑尼?
So how you been, Sonny?

395
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,480
还活着罢了
Hey, surviving.

396
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,650
这家伙什么人
What's up with this motherfucker, man?

397
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,440
- 生意伙伴　- 是啊　理解
- That's business. - Yeah, I can dig it.

398
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
我在这里就闻到大麻了
I can smell that weed from over here, man.

399
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,710
这种确实够劲
Ooh, this is that fire.

400
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,830
我们称之为“蛇大麻”
Now we call this that snake weed.

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,540
我有个朋友　经营一家特殊宠物店
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--

402
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,920
喂　混蛋　你干什么
Hey, motherfucker. What are you doing?

403
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,510
这可不是玩具枪
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."

404
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,930
激动什么　我会用枪
Relax. I can handle a fucking gun.

405
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,510
得了吧
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.

406
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,810
我刚花了两千美元修好了扳机
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.

407
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,190
他是你的朋友?
He's your boy, huh?

408
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,740
接着说　他把大麻放在蟒蛇肚子里走私
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.

409
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,500
- 海关不检查一下吗　- 没有哪个笨蛋
- And customs don't check it? - There ain't nobody dumb enough

410
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,290
会把手伸进蟒蛇嘴里
to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.

411
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,210
而且也不值得用X光检查
They're too cheap for the X-rays.

412
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,540
所以摆摆手　就过海关了
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.

413
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,840
天
Holy shit!

414
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,720
- 天　- 糟了
- Oh shit. - This is bad, man.

415
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,380
- 拿条毛巾　- 什么
- Get a towel. - What?

416
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,720
- 拿条毛巾　- 为什么
- Get a towel. - Why, man?

417
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,300
他已经死了
This motherfucker's dead.

418
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,100
- 枪里有子弹?　- 你车库里的汽车
- The fucking guns is loaded? - Man, do you keep a car in the garage

419
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,600
会没有汽油吗　你也听见了吧
without no gas in it? You heard me, right?

420
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,980
我说过别碰我的枪
I told this motherfucker. I said do not touch the guns.

421
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,730
可这小子非要玩火
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.

422
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,070
我可不愿承担这个责任
I am not going down for this shit.

423
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,400
找东西把他包起来
Get me something to wrap him up in.

424
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,320
我杀过两个人　但这个不是我杀的
I got two strikes. This ain't gonna be my third.

425
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,110
- 找东西把他包起来　- 把他带到哪里
- Get me something to wrap him up in. - Shit, where are we gonna take him?

426
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,570
- 我认识一个人　- 住的远吗
- I know a guy. - Is he far?

427
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,200
混蛋　你别再废话了好不好
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?

428
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,080
你说得对
No no no. You're right.

429
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,910
- 天　- 好
- Shit. - Okay.

430
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,250
你也真是的
Okay. Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself

431
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,500
把这个疯子带到我家里来
bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.

432
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,300
- 你知道吗　- 帮我把他翻过来
- You know that? - Help me turn him over.

433
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,210
- 天　- 天
- Oh shit. - Oh shit.

434
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,260
- 好　- 把他抬起来
- All right. - Help me pick him up.

435
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,090
我再也不和你来往了
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.

436
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,640
再也不和你来往了　1　2　3
I am not fucking with you no more. One, two, three.

437
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,230
天
- Oh. - Oh shit.

438
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,940
天
Damn.

439
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,480
好稳住好
All right, all right. Hold on. All right.

440
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,360
他吃了什么　这么沉
What the hell were you feeding this man?

441
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,040
钥匙呢
Right, where are the keys?

442
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
在他身上
He's got the keys.

443
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,120
在他身上?
He got the keys?

444
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,420
你找吧　我不愿碰他
Well, you get 'em. I ain't touching him.

445
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,970
我的枪
Getting my gun.

446
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,720
别把你的老二打掉了
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.

447
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,860
好
Okay.

448
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,620
你知道我的邻居爱管闲事
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.

449
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,170
好
All right.

450
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,130
喂桑尼
Hey, Sonny man.

451
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,170
你是我哥们
Look, bro, you're my boy. All right?

452
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,840
我喜欢你　但你以后不要再来了
Love you, man. But don't come around here no more, all right?

453
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,300
对生意不好
Bad for business, man.

454
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,340
（ 屠夫 ）

455
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,950
嗨　你提前来了
Hey, you're early.

456
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,710
领导还在这里
The suits are still here.

457
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,750
- 你等会再来吧　- 好
- Come around the side in a mo. - Okay.

458
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,250
好吗
All right?

459
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,500
抓着他的腿
Grab his legs.

460
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,800
帮我给他脱衣服
Help me get him undressed.

461
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,590
他真是个大汉啊
He's a big boy, isn't he?

462
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,810
他的衣服怎么处理
What are we gonna do with his clothes?

463
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,680
后面有个炉子
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.

464
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,740
Hmm.

465
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,120
好
All right.

466
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,580
好
All right.

467
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,400
把箱子拿近点
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.

468
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,780
好了
There we go.

469
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,040
好
Right.

470
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,750
你知道人体有207块骨头吗
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?

471
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,380
其中27块　在头骨里
And 27 of those are in the cranium.

472
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,590
现代人颅容量的
Now the average cranial capacity

473
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,010
平均值　帮忙按一下
of modern man-- hit it, would you?

474
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,470
是1200毫升
--is 1200cc.

475
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,470
而尼安德特人颅容量
And the average cranial capacity

476
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,100
的平均值
of Neanderthal man

477
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,270
是1800毫升
is 1800cc.

478
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,650
很奇妙吧
I was just thinking how fascinating

479
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,860
在我们看来原始的洞穴人
that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman

480
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,240
其大脑却比现代人
actually had 27% more brains

481
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,990
多27％
than anyone alive today.

482
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,660
听着屠夫嗦的时候
As I listened to the butcher rambling on

483
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,500
我突然想到　文斯安排的抢劫案
it hit me-- Vince set up the score.

484
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,540
肯定是买通了开车的司机
So the driver must have been in on it.

485
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,830
只要找到她　距离找到他就近很多了
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.

486
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,880
至于佩蒂
As for Petey, well...

487
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,590
这么说吧　从那以后　我就再也不吃汉堡包了
let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.

488
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,160
（ 司机 ）

489
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,000
在附近转转
Drive around the block.

490
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,790
好
Okay.

491
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,670
好　好　求你
Okay. Okay, please.

492
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,670
请别冲动
Please take it easy.

493
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
可以了　停车
This is far enough. Pull over.

494
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,600
请不要伤害我
Please don't hurt me.

495
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,100
熄火
Shut it off.

496
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,690
- 好　- 你叫什么名字
- Okay. - What's your name?

497
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,520
米亚
Mia.

498
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,570
你认出我来了吗
You recognize me?

499
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,360
没　对不起　应该认出你吗
No, I'm sorry. I don't. Should I?

500
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,700
一个伊朗珠宝商　在第六大道和圣达菲大道路口被抢劫
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.

501
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,290
是的
Yeah, that's right.

502
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,080
我没分到钱　他在哪儿
I didn't get my share. Where is he?

503
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,960
黄头发的那个?　我发誓　从那以后我就没见到他
The blonde guy? I swear I have not seen him since then.

504
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,250
我通过朋友认识的他
L-- I met him through some friends.

505
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,630
他给我5万美元　让我把这个人带到一个地方
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.

506
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
- 胡说　- 没有　没有
- Bullshit. - No no no no.

507
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,010
我对天发誓
I swear to God.

508
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,640
说的是实话　你一定要相信我
I'm telling you the truth. You have to believe me.

509
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,270
我没想到我的客户会受到伤害
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.

510
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,190
他向我保证不会伤人的
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.

511
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,480
我发誓说的是实话　你一定要相信我
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth. You have to believe me.

512
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,820
求你相信我
Please, believe me.

513
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,240
- 米亚　- 什么
- Mia. - Yes?

514
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,530
如果骗我　你就惨了
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.

515
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,790
天啊
Oh God.

516
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,330
找到你了
Gotcha.

517
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,100
喂喂
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

518
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,310
家里没钱
There's no money in the house.

519
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,810
文斯・朗　你认识他吗
Vincent Long, you know him?

520
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,650
不　我没听说过他
No, I've never heard of him.

521
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,700
好吧　我认识他
Okay, yeah, I know him.

522
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,200
给我坐下
Sit your ass down.

523
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,000
先说一下你是谁
Let's start with who you are.

524
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,460
我叫罗塞尔
I'm Russell.

525
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,790
为钻石交易所工作
I work for the diamond exchange.

526
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,510
你的朋友来找我　问我能不能交易500万美元的未加工钻石
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.

527
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,430
他把钻石带来　我给他钱
He brought 'em, I paid him.

528
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,390
交易结束　每个人都有好处
Done deal. Everybody got their share.

529
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,890
不是每个人
Not everybody.

530
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,390
显然
Well, obviously.

531
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,140
- 为什么找那个女的　- 米亚?
- What's the girl's angle? - Mia?

532
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,850
她是我女友
She's my girlfriend.

533
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,230
我们需要一个能沉得住气的司机

534
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,940
就把她安插在租车行里
So we planted her at the car service.

535
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,610
我帮不了你
Look, I can't help you.

536
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,820
我只负责交易钻石
I move diamonds. That's all I do.

537
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,990
有人没得到好处　有人被杀
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped,

538
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,080
这不能怪我　喂　喂

- Dave Hall. - Dave Hall! Dave Hall.

542
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,630
被杀的不是别人
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.

543
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,300
是我多年的朋友大卫・霍尔
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.

544
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,640
喂　我能帮你找到文斯

545
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,180
- 是吗　- 是的　不是很容易
- Yeah? - Yeah, it won't be easy.

546
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,220

He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.

Now when you see him you to give him a message.

549
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,490
就说他高中时的老同学在找他
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.

550
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,290
不会吧　不会吧
Oh, you're kidding me. You're kidding me, right?

551
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,420
还用搜身?
Really?

552
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,000
- 放下胳膊吧　过来　- 真是的
- Put your arms down. Come around here. - Unbelievable.

553
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,250
你打算怎么对付他
So what are you gonna do about this guy?

554
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,380
也不先打个招呼?　太没礼貌了
What, no hello? That's fucking rude.

555
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,390
对不起　你好
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello.

556
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,930
那么你打算怎么对付他
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?

557
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,470
他昨晚都到我家了　文斯
He came to my house last night, Vince.

558
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,230
我家
My house.

559
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,100
是你搞砸了　这是你的责任
This is your fuck up. This was your end of the deal.

560
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,940
- 我的责任?　- 是的
- My end? - Yes.

561
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,820
你要解决
Now take care of it.

562
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,740
你对他说了什么
What did you tell him?

563
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,950
你什么意思
What do you mean?

564
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,950
我的意思是　你对他说了什么
I mean what did you tell him?

565
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,530
当然什么也没说　你怎么这么问
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing? What are you talking about?

566
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,290
我知道你是软骨头　告诉我你对他说了什么
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.

567
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,330
我…我什么都没说
I didn't-- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.

568
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,130
你没死
You're still alive.

569
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,130
那你肯定告诉他了什么
That means you told him something.

570
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,460
我想知道到底是什么
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.

571
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,010
好的　你说得对
Okay, you know what? Yes.

572
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,220
我从一开始就告诉你
I told you from the beginning

573
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,600
不能出任何差错
there could be no loose ends, Vince.

574
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,020
你需要钱　我告诉你怎么搞钱
You needed money. I told you how to get it.

575
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,310
但在过程中　你搞砸了
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.

576
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,650
他们是你的朋友　你应该摆平
These were your friends. You should have handled it.

577
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,080
把他弄走　马库斯
Get that shit out of here, Markus.

578
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,830
真不敢相信我和你是亲戚
I-I can't believe we're related.

579
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,670
为了促成这件事　我陪他睡了几个月的觉
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.

580
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,630
我原本就不喜欢你陪他睡觉这个主意
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.

581
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,640
你知道那是必须的
You know what we had to do, Vince.

582
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,260
桑尼怎么办
Now what about Sonny?

583
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,720
我会处理
I'm gonna handle it.

584
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,390
他什么表情
How did he look?

585
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,350
这还用问　他非常上火
How the fuck do you think he looked? He looked pissed off.

586
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,020
你最好心里有数　文斯
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.

587
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,290
- 老大　- 托尼
- Mr. B. - Yeah, Tony?

588
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,250
我最开心的时候
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life

589
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,130
就是吃早餐的时候　看着报纸体育版
is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.

590
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,220
我喜欢看看比赛数据
I like reading the box scores.

591
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,550
喜欢看看谁赢了　谁输了
I like seeing who wins, who loses.

592
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,060
让我消遣不是吗
It relaxes me. You know what I mean?

593
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,320
现在　据说
Now they say

594
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,990
将要不再出版报纸了
that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers

595
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,360
让人们在手机上
so people can read the stats and the box scores

596
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,360
看比赛数据
on their fucking cell phone.

597
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,080
谁喜欢在吃饭的时候看手机呢
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?

598
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,080
太荒唐了　我觉得这是
It's ridiculous. I'll tell you what it is--

599
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,750
不文明的
uncivilized.

600
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,250
世界变了
It's a different world.

601
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,380
Same world,

602
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,420
玩具变了
different toys.

603
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,180
佩蒂和那小子有消息了吗
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?

604
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,180
还没有
Nothing yet.

605
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,470
不过今早抓住一个俄国人
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.

606
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,850
萨尔正在审问他
Sal's softening him up right now.

607
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,440
好　去看看
All right. Go take a look.

608
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,270
我一会就去　好吗
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?

609
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
- 有情况就给我电话　- 好
- Give me a call if something changes. - All right.

610
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,860
我会的　老大
Will do, boss.

611
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,960
老大
Boss.

612
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,840
佩蒂妈妈怎么说的
What did Petey's mom say?

613
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,170
她没听到情况
She hasn't heard anything.

614
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,840
他的姐妹们也没看见他
And the sisters, no one's seen him.

615
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,800
这里来
This way.

616
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,310
谢谢
Thanks.

617
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,480
怎么样　萨尔　他交代了吗
How's it going, Sal? He tell you anything?

618
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,950
- 没说多少　- 喂　伊万
- Not much. - Hey, Ivan.

619
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,660
喂　兄弟
Oh. Hey, buddy.

620
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,450
喂　喂
Hey. Hey.

621
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,170
你还好吗
How you doing in there?

622
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,880
萨尔　这和审讯的目的背道而驰
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.

623
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,470
把人打死了　还能开口吗
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?

624
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,430
让我来却看见他已经死了?
You brought me all the way down here for this?

625
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,430
现在你要再抓个俄国人了　知道吗
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?

626
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,120
我正盼着你再来呢　孩子
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.

627
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,450
你可以在上帝的门口
You can leave the burden of life

628
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,210
卸下生活的重担
at the door of God's house.

629
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,710
你真的信这一套吗　神父?
You really believe all this shit, Father?

630
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,130
如果上帝制造好人　那他也制造坏人吧
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?

631
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,510
你相信自由意志吗
Do you believe in free will?

632
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,430
就是你可以自由的
The idea that you are free

633
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,770
做出自己的选择
to make your own choice in this world.

634
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,350
当然信
Of course.

635
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,150
如果上帝不造出两种极端的人
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong

636
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,900
你如何能在其中做出选择呢
if God did not offer the two extremes?

637
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,570
通往上帝的路　取决于人的能力
The path to God is based upon your ability

638
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,450
用人的理智和情感
as a thinking, feeling being

639
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,490
做出正确的选择
to make the correct decisions.

640
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,740
如果一切都是完美的　那你不是在世上
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.

641
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,910
你已经在天堂里了
You'd already be in heaven.

642
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,040
你不了解我的事　神父
You don't live in my world, Father.

643
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,750
上帝几乎能宽恕任何事　孩子
God can forgive almost anything, my son.

644
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,920
但你必须愿意接受上帝才行
But you must open your heart to Him.

645
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,050
天
Aw, Christ.

646
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,670
五分钟后回来　我要先打发这个混蛋
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.

647
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,300
嗨　约翰
Hey, Johnny.

648
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,640
欢迎回来　在拉斯维加斯过得如何
Welcome back. How was Vegas?

649
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,140
- 热　- 是吗
- Hot. - Yeah?

650
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,890
是的　你还想知道什么
Yeah, what else you want to know?

651
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,390
- 我要和你谈谈　- 听说你遇到了鬼
-I need to talk to you. - I heard you got a problem with ghosts.

652
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,150
- 鬼?　- 对
- Ghosts? - Yeah.

653
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,690
本该死的人却没有死
People that should be dead, but ain't.

654
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,150
我不是说过吗　要杀人的话
What the fuck did I tell you? If you're gonna whack someone,

655
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,440
就在头上打两枪　这样就不会复活了
you put two in the head. That way they can't come back for you.

656
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,320
- 我知道　- 你知道　但你没这么做
- Yeah, I know. - You know, but you didn't do that,

657
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,570
所以你现在有了麻烦
did you? Now you got problems.

658
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,740
希望你能帮我
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.

659
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,950
我已经帮你了　我摆平了警察
I already helped you out. I took care of the cops.

660
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,870
拜托　分给你钱了
Come on, man, you got a cut.

661
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,920
那是保护费　我可不愿为你送死
For protection. I ain't going to war for you, kid.

662
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,840
- 没让你为我…　- 给我闭嘴
- I'm not asking you to go to war for-- - You shut the fuck up.

663
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,090
听着　你的这个朋友　不知怎么把比格斯也牵涉进来
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.

664
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,880
这样情况就大不一样了
That changed everything.

665
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,930
比格斯可不是好惹的　他的残忍
This guy don't fuck around. He's the most ruthless,

666
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,180
是出了名的　上次招惹他的人
cold motherfucker you'll ever meet. You know what happened

667
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,600
- 你知道什么下场吗　- 不知道
-to the last guy who fucked with him? - No.

668
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,890
总之他的遗体惨不忍睹
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.

669
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,310
我帮不了你　你要靠自己了
I can't do anything on this. You're on your own.

670
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,820
好吧
All right.

671
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,030
我还要告诉你
And I'll tell you something else.

672
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,860
如果比格斯找到了我　我会把你交出去
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.

673
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,450
这么无情?
Just like that?

674
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,950
这是生意
It's business.

675
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,630
约翰
John.

676
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,050
该死
Fuck.

677
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,950
桑尼?
Sonny?

678
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,870
- 嗨　- 我很同情
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

679
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,480
他经常说
He always said that

680
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,400
只要你在身边　他就不会有事
he'd be okay as long as you were there.

681
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,660
我会补救的
I'll make it better.

682
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,480
好久不见了
Long time.

683
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,150
才13年
Only 13 years.

684
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,030
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

685
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,030
我不是来找你帮忙的
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.

686
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,700
那你何不进来呢
Well, then why don't you get to it?

687
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,160
只允许我离开牢房15分钟
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.

688
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,580
我是来问
I came to ask

689
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,120
在我杀了你儿子以前　你还有什么话
is there anything you want me to tell your son

690
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,790
要对他说吗
before I kill him?

691
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,380
如果没有玻璃　你对我这么说话
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck

692
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,260
我会扭断你的脖子
- for talking to me that way! - The glass is there.

693
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,840
喂喂
Hey. Hey!

694
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,640
- 行了　走　- 你听见了吗
- That's it, let's go. - You hear that?

695
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,350
行了　走　走
That's it, let's go. Let's go.

696
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,470
- 行了　- 你是疯了
- That's it. - This crazy motherfucker.

697
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,890
行了　行了
All right, all right.

698
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,860
- 他在吗　- 是的　可是他忙着
- Is he here? - Yeah, but he's busy right--

699
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,070
干什么　米亚
What the fuck? Mia.

700
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,070
你以后还会来吗
So you gonna be around later on?

701
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,490
- 喂　米亚　干什么　- 让她走
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck? - Get rid of her.

702
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,500
- 喂　- 什么
- Hey. - What?

703
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,790
穿上衣服走人
Get your shit and get going.

704
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,540
你先走吧
I guess just go.

705
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,590
你真是混蛋
You're a fucking asshole.

706
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,930
这正是我们遇到大麻烦的原因　文斯
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.

707
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,760
因为你总是胡闹
Because you're off fucking around

708
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,350
不干正事
instead of taking care of business.

709
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,510
你冷静　我正在解决这些麻烦
Calm down. I'm tying up the loose ends.

710
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,430
这些?　只有一个麻烦　就是桑尼
Loose ends? The only fucking loose end is Sonny.

711
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,230
文斯　你一定不要低估他
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.

712
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,110
我从小就认识桑尼　他做事鲁莽
I grew up with Sonny. He's a hothead.

713
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,190
总是走前门
He'll always come through the front door.

714
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,240
那我们就等着他来敲门吧
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?

715
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
米亚　够了
Mia, enough.

716
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,220
需要增开备用收银台
We need a backup register open, please.

717
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,680
备用收银台
Backup register open, please.

718
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,810
你要这个?
This what you want?

719
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,940
所有收银员到前面来
All cashiers please come to the front.

720
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,110
所有收银员到前面来
All cashiers to the front.

721
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,580
门开着　文斯
-- It's open, Vincent.

722
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,890
不再闲聊了
We're done with the small talk, hmm?

723
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,520
我的钻石呢
Where are my diamonds?

724
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,390
我卖了
I sold them.

725
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,020
回答错误
Wrong answer.

726
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,360
来
Oh, come on.

727
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,370
你觉得这样好玩吗
So this is fun for you? Huh?

728
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,130
想再来一次吗
Want to go again?

729
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,710
有很多好东西可以砸呢
You have a lot of nice things here.

730
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,560
值得你这么做吗
Is this all worth it?

731
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:57,150
是的
Yeah, it is.

732
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,730
好怕怕　都是血
Ooh, scary-- blood.

733
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,790
给我钻石就行了
Give me my diamonds and we're done.

734
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,210
去死吧
Fuck you!

735
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,780
天　我真饿
Fuck, man. I'm starving.

736
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,820
回去的路上买点吃的
We'll get something on the way back home.

737
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,860
你想吃什么
What you in the mood for?

738
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,030
沙拉
Shit, like a fucking salad.

739
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,910
什么
What the hell?

740
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,120
你怎么了
What's wrong with you, man?

741
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,540
喂　米亚
Yo, Mia.

742
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,760
米亚
Mia.

743
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,610
天
Fuck.

744
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,200
米亚
Mia?

745
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,670
该死
Fuck.

746
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,680
该死
Oh fuck.

747
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,480
我们必须离开这里　文斯
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.

748
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,350
我们必须走
We've got to go.

749
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
- 我们走　- 放开我
- Let's go. - Get off me!

750
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,030
对不起　我们必须离开这里
I'm sorry, man. We've got to get the fuck out of here.

751
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,110
闭嘴
Shut up.

752
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,500
对不起
I'm sorry, girl.

753
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,440
- 弗兰克　有什么情况　- 没什么　老大
- Frankie, how's it going? - Nothing, boss.

754
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,070
没人知道什么情况
No one's seen or heard anything.

755
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,980
肯定把他们两个都杀了
They must have whacked the both of them.

756
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,400
听着　你这愚蠢的俄国混蛋
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch,

757
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,740
如果你不想被淹死的话
if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,

758
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,870
我建议你把知道的都说出来
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.

759
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,990
黑人拿走了钱
Black man took the money.

760
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,620
我只看到这些　他拿走了钱
That's all I see. He took it.

761
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,170
我赌十块钱　把他拉起来的时候　他会喊上帝
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.

762
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,430
- 赌二十块　- 成交
- 20. - Bet.

763
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,390
拉他上来
Bring him up.

764
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,600
上帝啊
Oh, mother of God!

765
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,940
喂　潜水员
Hey, Aqualung.

766
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,110
我告诉你　上帝不在这里
Let me tell you something. God ain't here.

767
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,190
上帝已经离开了底特律
Okay? God has left Detroit.

768
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,450
我是今天唯一的上帝
I'm your only god today.

769
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,530
所以你最好告诉我佩蒂的下落
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey,

770
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,330
那个黑人的下落
what happened to the black man,

771
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,700
以及我的钱的下落
and what happened to my fucking money.

772
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,960
- 听见了吗　- 一个拿枪的拿走了你的钱
- You hear me? - Man with gun, he took your money.

773
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,670
他拿走了你的钱　我说的是实话　是实话
He took your money. I tell the truth. I tell the truth!

774
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,800
你真是嘴硬啊
You're a tough son of a bitch.

775
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,960
再泡泡　托尼
Back in the pool, Tony.

776
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,560
- 你看了昨晚的球赛了吗　- 看了
- You see that game last night? - Yeah.

777
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,140
那个球偏出了很远
It was a ball. Way outside.

778
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,940
绝对不是个好球
No fucking way that was a strike.

779
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,480
裁判走到本垒板上　什么也看不见
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.

780
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,270
- 应该用电脑的　- 对
- They should use that computer box. - Yeah.

781
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,150
- 偏的太多了　- 裁判就跟近视眼似的
- Way outside. - Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.

782
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,950
什么都看不见
He can't see anything.

783
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,740
我觉得他淹死了　老大
I think he's drowning, boss.

784
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,830
拉他上来
Pull him up.

785
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,670
我觉得他死了
--I think he's dead.

786
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,460
看来他说的是实话
I think he was telling the truth.

787
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,840
把这里收拾完了　就来找我
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.

788
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:38,090
- 我去按摩　- 好的　放他下来
- I'm gonna go get a massage. - Will do. Let's get him.

789
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:53,360
喂　我会到的　只是晚几分钟
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be there. I'm just running a few minutes late.

790
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,270
- 我不喜欢干等着　- 随便你
- I don't like to be kept waiting. - Whatever.

791
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,320
- 钱不够　- 都在里面了
- You're light. - it's all there.

792
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,530
不　钱不够
No it isn't. You're light.

793
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,360
你想说什么　桑德斯
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?

794
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:41,410
监狱长说涨价了
The warden said the price went up.

795
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,280
不　我们谈妥了价钱
No no no. We had a deal.

796
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:46,580
对　你只交了一年的保护费
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.

797
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,420
今年的价钱更高
And now you're gonna have to pay more.

798
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,170
要想让你父亲保护性监禁的话
You want the old man kept in protective custody?

799
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,420
就要交10万美元　预付款
You pay $100,000 upfront.

800
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,590
这是胡闹
This is bullshit.

801
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,430
把你父亲关在普通监狱
How long do you think that old man's

802
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,930
你觉得他能活几天
gonna stay in the general population?

803
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,470
不超过两天　那帮囚犯就会给他一刀
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.

804
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,810
你希望这样吗
You want that on your head?

805
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,150
我知道对家人好　那就做正确的事
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.

806
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,570
做个孝子
Be the good son.

807
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,870
开枪之前　你最好想清楚了
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.

808
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,790
你惹怒了我们
You fuck up with us

809
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,000
你父亲就是地上的一滩血
and your old man's a stain on the floor.

810
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,500
知道吗
Got it?

811
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,590
给你24小时
You got 24 hours.

812
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,920
否则我们就把他喂给野兽
Or we feed him to the animals.

813
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,220
下车
Get out.

814
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,300
米亚死了
Mia's dead.

815
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,350
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

816
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,520
随便说什么都行
Say fucking something. Anything.

817
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,810
没什么可说的
There's nothing to say.

818
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,650
也不问她怎么死的?
You don't even want to know how?

819
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,400
怎么死的无所谓
It doesn't fucking matter.

820
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,690
你犯了一个又一个的错误
You're out there making mistake after mistake.

821
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,360
却不明白她为何死了?
And you wonder why she's dead?

822
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:43,950
我哪有做错了?
What am I doing wrong?

823
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,450
桑尼就是一个
Well, Sonny for one.

824
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,330
你怎么知道桑尼的事
How do you know about Sonny?

825
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,200
他来找过我
He came to visit me.

826
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,120
他就坐在你坐的地方
He sat right where you're sitting right now

827
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:57,040
在玻璃的另一边　直视我的眼睛
on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.

828
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,710
你能行吗
Can you do the same?

829
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,340
我已经尽力了
I'm doing my best.

830
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,090
但还不够
Well, it's not good enough.

831
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,140
我还能怎么办
What am I supposed to do?

832
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,730
你真是没用　你知道吗
You really are a little shit. You know that?

833
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,100
我真不想说这句话
I never thought I'd have to say that.

834
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:21,190
大人物要有大动作　文斯
Big men make big moves, Vincent.

835
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,900
你是大人物吗
Are you a big man?

836
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,990
嗨
Hey.

837
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,780
我知道比格斯会到处找我
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.

838
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,150
拿走别人200万美元
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that

839
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,070
没有谁会算了的
and expect him to forget about it.

840
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,580
不　你再对我解释一遍
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.

841
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,790
对你开枪的人杀了佩蒂
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey,

842
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,840
拿走了我的钱　你希望我相信是这样?
took my money, and you want me to believe that?

843
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,710
是的
Yes.

844
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,170
我对你说过　你第一次抓到他的时候　我就在找他
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?

845
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,510
如果我拿了你的钱　我还会坐在这里吗
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?

846
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,970
我不是傻子
Shit, I ain't crazy.

847
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,810
怎么了
What?

848
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:09,280
- 我的钱呢　- 在文斯那里
- Where's my money? - Vincent has your money.

849
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,700
你的朋友文斯?
Your friend Vincent?

850
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,660
是的
Yes.

851
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,120
我知道文斯在哪里　知道钱在哪里
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.

852
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,200
但有个困难　他身边人很多
There's just one problem. He's got an army around him.

853
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,830
一群拿着手枪的少年犯?
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?

854
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,670
让你的人跟着我　我们去把钱要回来
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.

855
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,420
我有个别的办法　来
I have a different plan. Come on.

856
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,600
你没事吧
You all right?

857
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,230
没事
Yeah, I'm cool.

858
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,520
真不要紧?
You sure?

859
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,360
好
All right.

860
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,360
喝酒吗
You want a drink?

861
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,570
不用了
No thank you.

862
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,410
会有助于你放松
Might help you relax a little.

863
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,870
为什么有钱人总是让我放松
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?

864
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,840
因为你年轻　你是年轻人
'Cause you're young. You're a young man.

865
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,460
年轻人总希望事情
Young guys just want to run through their life

866
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,050
办的越快越好
as fast as they can.

867
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,550
干完一件再干一件
Set it up, knock it down. Set it up, knock it down.

868
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,430
年轻是很短暂的
It's short, real short.

869
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,350
到了我这个年龄　你就发现多么短暂了
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.

870
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,560
年龄越大　就离死亡越近
The older you get, the closer you get to your death,

871
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,570
要放松　慢慢来
you want to relax. You want to take your time.

872
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,820
不要着急　年轻人
There's no rush, kid.

873
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,780
你真不喝吗
You sure you don't want that drink?

874
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,830
我喝一点吧
Yeah, I'll take a drink.

875
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,660
- 波旁威士忌还是苏格兰威士忌-　 波旁威士忌
- Bourbon or Scotch? - Bourbon.

876
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,690
干
Crap.

877
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,530
你要知道　我讨厌这个叫约翰的
You should know I hate this John R prick.

878
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,820
到了之后　让我来说　好吗
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?

879
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,470
喂　你常去教堂吗
Hey, you go to church?

880
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,390
以前常去
I used to.

881
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,430
后来慢慢的　教堂的人不想再看见我了
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.

882
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,100
我还是经常为教堂捐款
I still help them out with donations.

883
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,150
我能看到台上的牧师出冷汗
I could see those priests up there sweating.

884
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,400
他们看到我紧张
I made them nervous.

885
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:59,860
那么你信仰上帝?
So you believe in God?

886
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,990
可能不是他们所说的上帝
I don't know if I believe in their God.

887
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,790
是的　我也祈祷
Yeah, I pray.

888
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,710
每晚都祈祷
I pray every night.

889
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:13,090
我需要特别能宽恕的上帝
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.

890
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,260
不过你不会有事的
You're gonna be all right though.

891
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,130
什么也不用担心
Don't worry about a thing.

892
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,470
怎么了　文斯　你的表情就像见鬼了
What's the matter, Vince? You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.

893
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,520
- 知道我们的来意吗　- 我知道
- You know why we're here, John? - Yeah, I know.

894
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,360
这就是你想见到的人
That's the kid you wanted to see.

895
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,940
给你送到了
Consider him delivered.

896
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,280
我的钱呢
Where's my money?

897
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,820
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

898
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,490
把他的钱给他　文斯
Give him his fucking money, Vince.

899
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,870
不知道他对你说了什么　但都是胡说
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.

900
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,500
最后一次机会
Last chance.

901
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,380
我尊敬你　知道你的能耐
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are

902
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,250
决不会拿你的钱
and I would never fucking steal--

903
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,750
真是的　冷静
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.

904
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,920
大家都别冲动　真是的
Everybody just take it easy. God damn it.

905
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,680
这是为佩蒂偿命
That's for Petey.

906
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,220
如果他的钱在你那里　你马上给他
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.

907
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,020
否则人人都可能会死　约翰
Or we could all die, John.

908
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,070
该死
Shit.

909
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,410
喂
Oh! Hey!

910
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,110
让开
- Move!

911
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,630
看着点
Watch out.

912
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,790
该死
Fuck!

913
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,480
桑德斯　不要转移我爸爸
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.

914
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,020
我拿到钱了　一小时后就到
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.

915
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,400
你要出门?
Going somewhere?

916
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:49,900
你是谁
Who the fuck are you?

917
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,530
我不想谈这个话题
That's not the topic.

918
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,320
那你想谈什么话题
All right, what is the topic?

919
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,700
钻石
Diamonds. Mm-hmm.

920
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:58,080
是的　坐下
That's right. Sit down.

921
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,460
坐下
Sit down!

922
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:07,300
在有的国家　小偷会被砍手
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.

923
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,510
你偷了我们的东西
And you stole from us.

924
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:12,720
因此在我看来　你有三个选择
So the way I see it, you have three choices:

925
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,220
你可以不承认
you can fuck around,

926
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,310
那我会杀了你
in which case I kill you;

927
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,980
你可以拿桌子上的枪
you can go for that gun on the desk

928
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,600
我也会杀了你
and I kill you;

929
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:27,520
或者你把钻石给我
or you can just give me the diamonds

930
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,030
我允许你远走高飞
and I'll let you disappear.

931
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,070
得了吧
Yeah right.

932
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,450
听着　我的朋友
Look, my friend,

933
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,910
你远远不如你的女友硬朗
you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.

934
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,410
而且到了最后
And at the end

935
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,290
她还是交代了
she talked.

936
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,750
那你如何选择呢
So what is it going to be?

937
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,840
她不是我的女友
She wasn't my girlfriend.

938
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,260
她是我的亲戚
She was my family.

939
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:59,850
便宜你了　混蛋
You got off easy, motherfucker.

940
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,000
快死的感觉不舒服吧
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?

941
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,130
开始挖
Start digging.

942
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,050
开什么玩笑
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

943
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,590
让我挖自己的坟墓吗
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?

944
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,260
别逼我再说一遍　我让你挖
Don't make me say it again. I said start digging.

945
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,430
而且挖深点　让你躺着舒服点
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.

946
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,980
你想要多少钱
How much do you want?

947
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,520
对你来说　我这条命值多少钱
Huh? How much is my life worth to you?

948
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:16,280
老鼠皮只对老鼠有价值
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.

949
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,530
别胡说了
Man, bullshit. Come on.

950
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,990
你凭什么看不起我
Who are you to judge me?

951
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,410
有没有想过　要不是我　你会是什么样?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?

952
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,750
我想过
Yeah, I thought about that

953
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,170
在我以为要死在你枪下的时候想过
when I thought I was taking my last breath.

954
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:35,880
是谁联系别人
Man, who was the one out there making contacts,

955
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,090
安排抢劫案　而你和大卫只是抽大麻?
setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?

956
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,800
是我
Huh? Me.

957
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,720
是谁带你干这一行
Who was the one who brought you in on shit,

958
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,550
让你挣钱　帮你养活你妈?
put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?

959
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,640
- 是我　- 这正是我不明白的
- Me! - That's what I don't understand, man.

960
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:49,310
这正是…
That's what--

961
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,980
我们就像一家人　就像兄弟
We were family, man. We were brothers.

962
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,480
- 你、我和大卫…　- 去大卫的吧
- You, me and Dave-- - Fuck Dave, dude.

963
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,570
那个口吃的混蛋
Come on. That stuttering little bitch.

964
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,360
关键是我们
This is about us, man.

965
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,450
他的口风那么不紧　早晚会害死我们的
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?

966
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,830
他忠诚
He was loyal.

967
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,210
他软弱
He was weak.

968
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,420
他是我的朋友
He was my friend.

969
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,010
就像你一样　文斯　记得吗
Just like you, Vince. Remember?

970
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,050
该死
Oh fuck.

971
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,760
作为你的朋友　我告诉你　桑尼
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.

972
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:30,930
你在世上得到的一切　都是因为我
Everything you got in this world is because of me.

973
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,020
你能有今天
Everything you fucking are in this world

974
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,610
都是多亏了我
is because of me.

975
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,690
你到底遇到了什么麻烦
What could you have gotten into

976
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,740
连我都不能告诉?
that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?

977
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,700
告诉我　我想知道
Huh? Tell me, I want to know.

978
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,830
我从小就护着你
I had your back since we were kids, man.

979
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,750
可你呢　你开枪打我　任由我去死
And what do you do? You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.

980
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:55,080
我没别的办法　我遇到大麻烦
I had no choice, man. I was in over my head.

981
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,670
我需要全部的钱
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.

982
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,050
他们会…他们会杀了我爸爸
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.

983
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,010
- 什么　- 他们会杀了我爸爸
- What? - They were gonna kill my dad.

984
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:08,180
桑尼　你说得对
Sonny, you're right, man.

985
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,850
对不起　我该找你帮忙的
And I'm sorry. I should have come to you.

986
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,270
你一定要告诉我　我现在该怎么办
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?

987
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,650
怎么补救　告诉我
How can I make this right, man? Tell me what to do.

988
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,690
现在已经太晚了
You should have thought about that before.

989
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,280
你找上帝原谅你吧　不要找我
You make peace with God, not me.

990
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,620
来吧
Do it.

991
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,540
来吧　桑尼　对我开枪
Fucking do it, Sonny. Shoot my ass.

992
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,580
要不是我　你什么都不是
'Cause you know what? You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.

993
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,580
打死我　我们就一样了
You shoot me and we're the same.

994
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,840
我们都会死了
We'll both be gone.

995
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,260
我们不一样
We're not the same.

996
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,680
你真可悲
You're fucking pathetic, man.

997
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,690
去你的
Man, fuck you!

998
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,690
Fuck you, man!

999
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,320
我不需要你　桑尼
I don't need you, Sonny.

1000
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,280
我不需要你　你需要我
I don't need you, man. You need me.

1001
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,610
你需要我
You need me!

1002
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,070
我会走出去的　你会看到
I'm gonna walk out of here. You'll see, man.

1003
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,870
听见了吗　听见了吗
You hear me? You hear me?!

1004
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,660
去你的
Fuck you!

1005
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,170
我会找到你的
I'll find your ass!

1006
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,040
去你的　桑尼
Fuck you, Sonny!

1007
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,970
喂　看　看
Yo, man, check it out. Check it out.

1008
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,230
很高兴认识你
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.

1009
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,350
分开　让开
Break it up! Make a hole!

1010
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,400
后退　后退
- Get back! Get back! - Back off!

1011
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,610
- 后退　- 马上派医生来
- Back off! -I need a medic in Red.

1012
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,650
- 后退　- 后退
- Back up. - Get back.

1013
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,280
Get back on the wall. Get back.

1014
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,200
我看看你们的手　把手伸出来
Let me see your hand. Get your hand out of there.

1015
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,330
- 你好　- 你好
- How are you doing? - Hi.

1016
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,460
请在这里签收
I need you to sign right here.

1017
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,820
（ 看里面　爱你的大卫 ）

1018
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,830
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1019
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,960
? For your honor ?

1020
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:47,340
? Or your pride? ?

1021
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:53,090
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1022
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,800
? For you body ?

1023
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:58,810
? Or your mind? ?

1024
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,520
有人说过　冤冤相报的话
A man once said an eye for an eye

1025
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,070
人人都会死
leaves everyone blind.

1026
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,070
就像我不是我兄弟的守护者一样
As I was not my brother's keeper,

1027
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,530
我也不是杀他的人
neither was I his killer.

1028
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,530
我能够接受文斯还活着的事实
I could live with the fact that Vincent was still alive.

1029
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,580
问题是　他能接受吗
The question was, could he?

1030
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,080
? Time is on my side ?

1031
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,210
? And still the world continues to turn ?

1032
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,670
? And as I think about the things that I've learned ?

1033
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
? I see that money's worth less ?

1034
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,550
? With every dollar I earned ?

1035
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,760
? And in the end I'd rather choose to fade than burn ?

1036
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,510
? Sometimes you pay the price ?

1037
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,140
? For flying close to the sun ?

1038
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,390
? But that's why youth is wasted on the young ?

1039
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,770
? I think of all the things that I've done?

1040
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,480
? All the ghosts in my past ?

1041
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,610
? Will my reputation live, will it crumble and crash? ?

1042
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,900
? As I dream I see a vision of an angel who asks ?

1043
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:54,070
? Why'd I die young and leave a pretty face in the casket? ?

1044
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,410
? Ain't no fashion here, we don't take plastic ?

1045
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,750
? We don't give a damn how many chips you cashed in ?

1046
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,460
? With ashes I'm waiting at the entrance to heaven ?

1047
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,790
? Without a legacy, why should they show me acceptance??

1048
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,170
? Though she doesn't speak ?

1049
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,000
? I hear the words of her lessons ?

1050
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,800
? And as she sings, she haunts me ?

1051
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,380
? With the simplest of questions, she says ?

1052
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:18,890
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1053
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,430
? For your anger ?

1054
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,850
? Or your love? ?

1055
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:31,780
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1056
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,950
? For your beauty ?

1057
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:38,200
? Or your blood? ?

1058
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,960
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1059
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,080
? For your actions ?

1060
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,920
? Or your words? ?

1061
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,300
? Too big a sacrifice ?

1062
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,550
? How do you want to be remembered? ?

1063
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,430
? For your silence ?

1064
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,770
? Or your voice? ?

1065
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,930
? Leave a legacy. ?

1066
