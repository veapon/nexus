1
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,451
派拉蒙影业巨献

2
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:30,471
赤色分子

3
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:33,444
导演:沃伦・比蒂

4
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,481
主演:黛安・基顿

5
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:40,486
爱德华・赫尔曼

6
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,491
杰兹・库辛斯基

7
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,496
杰克・尼科尔森

8
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,466
保罗・索尔维诺

9
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,504
莫林・斯特普尔顿

10
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:43,559
好像是1913还是1917年 记不太清楚了
Was that in 1913 or 17? I can't remember now.

11
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:49,608
我开始忘记所有过去认识的人
I'm beginning to forget all the people that I used to know, see?

12
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:57,147
你问我记得路易丝・拜伦吗？
Do I remember Louise Bryant?

13
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:02,114
当然记得，即便想忘也忘不了
Why, of course. I couldn't forget her if I tried.

14
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:08,967
我无法…
I can't...

15
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,404
我也许可以抹去我的记忆
I might sort of scratch my memory,

16
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,429
但那个时刻无法忘却
but not at the moment.

17
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:18,903
往事如烟，来了又去
You know, things go and come back again.

18
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:22,515
那是在克里斯托弗街
It was Christopher Street,

19
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,487
我当时在想…
and I was thinking about

20
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,781
另外一条街道
another street down there instead,

21
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,285
直到又回想起是克里斯托弗街
until it came back that it was Christopher Street.

22
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:35,328
有时我也会有失误
Sometimes I have lapses like that.

23
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,596
我已经把他们全忘记了
I'd forgotten all about them.

24
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,638
他们是社会主义者？
Were they socialists?

25
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,101
他们一定是
I guess they must've been,

26
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,341
但我想他们根本不重要
but I don't think they were of any importance.

27
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,178
我完全记不起他们了
I don't remember them at all.

28
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,443
我知道杰克和玛宝・道吉交往过
I know that Jack went around with Mabel Dodge,

29
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,980
后来他和另一个女孩交往
and then he went around with another gal,

30
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,687
接着就是和路易丝・拜伦
and then he went around with Louise Bryant.

31
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,287
来来回回换了好几轮
I know there were shifts back and forth,

32
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,825
但我从没发生过这种事
but it never occurred to me...

33
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,569
它侵犯不了我的个人生活
It never impinged on my own personal life.

34
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:09,971
我喜欢棒球
I like baseball.

35
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,965
我不知道外面世界的人 是如何看待他们的
I don't know what the outside world thought of them.

36
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,043
但他们曾经是夫妻
But they were a couple.

37
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:19,107
人们总会说起 路易丝拜伦和杰克・雷德
I mean, you always spoke of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

38
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:23,317
我记得他跟我说过他上大学时…
I recall his telling me that he had two ambitions

39
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:24,883
有两个远大理想
when he came to college.

40
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,953
其中一个就是当选班长
One was to be elected president of his class.

41
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,864
他并不认识班上的同学，也没人认识他
He didn't know anyone in the class. No one knew him.

42
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,233
另外一个就是在他25岁时…
The other was to make a million dollars

43
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:36,395
成为百万富翁
by the time he was 25.

44
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:41,266
我对于杰克・雷德的看法 可能不同于大多数人
Now, my idea about Jack Reed is probably different from most.

45
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:46,113
但我非常了解他 我知道他是个很有见地的人
But I knew him well. I knew he was a man of strong views.

46
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,176
我知道他非常的独立
I knew he was independent.

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,384
我有个看法，可能是错的…
And I have an idea, I may be wrong of this,

48
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,620
那就是他的妻子是个社会主义者
that his wife was a Communist

49
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,157
妻子影响了他，和任何人的妻子一样
and that his wife had influenced him, as any wife does,

50
00:03:58,268 --> 00:03:59,826
这点大家和我都知道
as you know and I know.

51
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:03,801
路易丝拜伦？
Louise Bryant?

52
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:07,730
我曾认为她是个裸露狂
Well, I thought she was something of an exhibitionist.

53
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,144
不，我不是说人闲话，不要自欺欺人
No, I'm not gonna talk about people. Don't fool yourself.

54
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,475
不，先生，我不是…
No, sir. I'm not... I'm not

55
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,281
那种喜欢说三道四的街坊
a purveyor of neighborhood gossip, or anything of the kind.

56
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,552
那不是我的工作
That's not my job.

57
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,460
他沉默寡言
He was quiet.

58
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:24,989
是个好人
He was a nice fellow.

59
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:29,863
如果我遇到他，我会说他是个好人
I would say, if I met him, I would say he was a nice fellow.

60
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:34,297
按照特定的标准…
He was, however, a fighting fellow

61
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:36,299
他是个好战的人
in regards to principles.

62
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:40,737
我说过，一个对世界状况…
I said, I think, that a guy who's always interested

63
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:43,686
感兴趣并想改变它的人…
in the condition of the world and changing it

64
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,951
自己对于拒绝或直面它…
either has no problems of his own

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,025
不会有任何问题
or refuses to face them.

66
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:51,453
杰克，我不认为他是个花花公子
Jack... Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy,

67
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:52,896
但有人这么认为
but some people did.

68
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,994
杰克・雷德的人生短暂
Jack Reed's life, short as it was,

69
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,503
如同昙花一现
happened at a time,

70
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,167
我们所有人都是那个时代的受害者
and all of us, after all, are the victims of our time and place,

71
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:07,140
作为一个记者 他本来有更好的机会…
when he had the opportunity, as a reporter,

72
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:10,649
去某个令人兴奋，景致怡人的地方
to be in some very exciting and dramatic places.

73
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,484
不是所有人都会埋在克里姆林宫
It isn't everybody can be buried in the Kremlin,

74
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,660
他是唯一一个埋在那里的美国人
and he's the only American.

75
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:20,255
出生在俄勒冈州的波特兰
Born in Portland, Oregon.

76
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:23,424
这是不是很特别？
Now, isn't that something?

77
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,963
[1915年，波特兰] -他在拥抱什么？ -一个雕像
- What's he hugging? - A statue.

78
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,803
我看得出来，但它是个什么雕像？
Well, I can see that. But what's it a statue of?

79
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,502
只是雕像，伍沃先生
It's just a statue, Mr. Woodward.

80
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,911
-多少钱？ -75美元
- How much is it? - It's $75.

81
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:34,903
-相片的价钱？ -没错，卢太太
- For a photograph? - That's right, Mrs. Rudisile.

82
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,576
这真有趣，楚太太
This is interesting, Mrs. Trullinger.

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,314
这不仅不怎么好，而且也算不上油画
Not that it isn't very nice, but it isn't a painting.

84
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,618
伍沃先生，请你看看这个
Mr. Woodward, I'd like you to look at this.

85
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,785
-我能看出作者的意图 -是的
- I think I see the intention here. - Yes.

86
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,692
黄昏俯瞰图
Eve dominates, you see?

87
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:47,754
梦想俯瞰梦想家
The dream dominates the dreamer.

88
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,295
这个…
It's...

89
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,102
我感觉比较模糊
It looks blurry to me.

90
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,435
另一个看起来也有点模糊
The other one looked blurry, too.

91
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:59,910
这是摄影师的意图，伍沃先生
I think that's the intention of the photographer, Mr. Woodward.

92
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,346
什么？故意整模糊？
What? To be blurry?

93
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,543
如果你用另一种观点去看…
But perhaps if you looked at it from a different point of view...

94
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:04,812
路易丝
Louise!

95
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:07,283
这是你吗？
This is you?

96
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,162
体形真好
Lovely figure.

97
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,136
路易丝，你是不是疯了？
Louise, have you taken leave of your senses?

98
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,907
别傻了，保罗
Don't be a fool, Paul.

99
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,945
反对自己妻子在半数熟人面前裸体…
You think I'm a fool because I object to my wife

100
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,143
你竟认为我傻？
being displayed naked in front of half the people I know...

101
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:34,118
是的，它不过是画廊的一幅艺术品
Yes. My God, it's a work of art in a gallery.

102
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:35,247
你是怎么啦？
What's the matter with you?

103
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,586
你常把波特兰看成是个 死气沉沉的地方
You used to call Portland a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.

104
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:38,682
它可能乏味，可能偏狭
It may be stuffy and provincial,

105
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,820
但也是我赖以生计的地方
but it also happens to be a coffin where I earn a living.

106
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,455
既然你可以在此谋生…
You can take your living and fill up teeth with it,

107
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:43,998
我也可以
because I can earn my own living.

108
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,090
我有自己的工作
I have my work.

109
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,660
你把发表《政府公报》上的 几篇文章当作你的工作？
You consider a few articles in The Oregonian and The Gazette work?

110
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,264
不，我告诉你什么才是工作，路易丝
No, I'll tell you what your work is, Louise.

111
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,366
成为公众的焦点才是你的工作
It's making yourself the center of attention.

112
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:55,640
它会让路易丝・楚林杰成为 波特兰的自由女性
It's shocking Louise Trullinger, emancipated woman of Portland.

113
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,172
现在我们去向这些人道晚安 然后回家
Now, we're gonna say good night to these people and go home.

114
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,583
-我要去自由主义俱乐部 -你不能去
- I'm going to the Liberal Club. - You're not going to the Liberal Club.

115
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,382
-我要去，保罗 -不能去…
- I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul. - No, you're not...

116
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:06,847
全都很漂亮，楚太太
It's very nice, Mrs. Trullinger. All of it.

117
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,788
这些话让你心满意足了吧，路易丝？
It's very gratifying to hear, isn't it, Louise?

118
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,332
是不是，路易丝？
Isn't it, Louise?

119
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,836
不用说也知道 谁要去自由主义俱乐部
Of course, you know who is going to be at the Liberal Club.

120
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:20,636
美国爱国者信仰自由
Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.

121
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,542
若我们不愿拿起武器维护这个传统…
And unless we are willing to take arms to defend our heritage,

122
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,983
我们就无法自称为美国爱国者
we cannot call ourselves patriotic Americans!

123
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,354
我为自由自豪
I'm proud to be free.

124
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,456
我为自己是美国人自豪
I'm proud to be an American.

125
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:36,358
若我们选举出来的总统…
And if the man we elected President decides

126
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,294
时刻为我们的自由而担忧…
that our freedoms are being threatened

127
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,358
那世界将因民主而变得安全祥和…
and that the world must be made safe for democracy,

128
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:45,959
由此也让我知道 在爱国的行列中我并不孤单！
then I know I won't be alone in heeding the call of patriotism!

129
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,302
这是场什么战争？
What is this war about?

130
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,045
每个人都会有自己的答案
Each man will have his own answer.

131
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:54,805
我也有，我等待着祖国的召唤！
I have mine. I'm ready to be called!

132
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,257
今晚，我们请到了…
Now, tonight we have with us

133
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:09,358
玛格丽特和已故的波特兰 C.J.雷德先生之子
the son of Margaret and the late C.J. Reed of Portland,

134
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,302
他亲眼目睹了这场战争
who has witnessed this war first-hand.

135
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,764
我认为自由主义俱乐部的全体成员…
And I, for one, see no reason why we here at the Liberal Club

136
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:18,642
都应该听听杰克・雷德的现身说法
shouldn't listen to what Jack Reed has to say.

137
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:27,945
你认为这场战争 是关于什么的，杰克・雷德？
What would you say this war is about, Jack Reed?

138
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:39,432
利润
Profits.

139
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:42,472
他说什么？
What did he say?

140
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,040
雷德先生 你好，我是路易丝拜伦
Excuse me, Mr. Reed. Hello, my name is Louise Bryant

141
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:51,107
我是个记者
and I am a journalist.

142
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:53,485
可否花点时间接受我的采访
And I was wondering if you might have time to give me an interview.

143
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,784
抱歉，不行，我不接受采访的
I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.

144
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:57,314
前不久我曾在《冲击波》上发表过文章
I had a piece in the Blast not long ago.

145
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,194
-伯克曼的《冲击波》？ -是的
- Berkman's Blast? Really? - That's right.

146
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,295
你什么时候想采访？
Well, when did you want to do this interview?

147
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:07,395
现在
Now.

148
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,633
我并不住这里
I don't live here.

149
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:10,732
-住在河边的一所屋子里 -是嘛？
- I live in a house by the river. - Oh, really.

150
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,608
天哪，狡兔三窟啊
My, my, my. Two places.

151
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,473
是的，这里是工作室
Yeah, I use this place as a studio.

152
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,515
喜欢白色百合吗？
Do you like white lilies?

153
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,021
那是我最喜欢的花
They're my favorite flowers.

154
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,121
-你还没结婚吧？ -没有，我不相信婚姻
- You're not married, are you? - No, I don't think I believe in marriage.

155
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:29,221
-你结婚了吗？ -婚姻？
- Are you married? - Marriage?

156
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,823
怎么会有人相信婚姻？
How could anyone believe in marriage?

157
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:34,200
想必你母亲看到你回波特兰一定很开心
I bet your mother's glad to see you back in Portland.

158
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,762
只有我不坐牢时她才开心 这是你吗？
Just glad when I'm not in jail. Is this you?

159
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,671
是的，喜欢吗？
Yes. Do you like it?

160
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,844
喜欢，我觉得它们…
Yeah. I think they're...

161
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:46,473
-有点模糊，不过这张很好 -是的
- A little blurry, but this one's very nice. - Yes.

162
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,713
是的，现在…
It is. Now...

163
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,980
世界经济的牟利动机…
Granted, the profit motive in the world economy

164
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,048
是导致战争的根源
is a basic root cause for the war.

165
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:56,459
你认为那些赞成战争 把动机归咎于爱国心的美国人…
Do you feel that those Americans who are pro-war

166
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,191
是不是出于愤世嫉俗或者天真？
and who ascribe their motives to patriotism are cynical or naive?

167
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,688
如果他们愤世嫉俗 那些玩世不恭的爱国者…
And, if they're cynical, is it the cynicism of patriots

168
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,458
认为如果没有牟利动机…
who feel that without a profit motive,

169
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,299
这个国家的领导层就不会涉足战争
the power structure elite of this country will not enter the war,

170
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,804
即便他们认为…
even though they feel that the containment

171
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,932
德国军国主义的牵制政策也许有必要…
of German militarism may be necessary for...

172
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,439
好吧，拜伦小姐 你想采访吗？写下来
All right, Miss Bryant, do you want an interview? Write this down.

173
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,499
你有没天真地想过…
Are you naive enough to think

174
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,943
德国的军国主义和这场战争有关？
containing German militarism has anything to do with this war?

175
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,470
你难道不明白英法两国占有世界经济…
Don't you understand that England and France own the world economy

176
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,947
而德国人想从中分一杯羹？
and Germany just wants a piece of it?

177
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,072
继续写，拜伦小姐
Keep writing, Miss Bryant.

178
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:24,413
拜伦小姐，你难道不明白JP摩根…
Miss Bryant, can't you grasp that J.P. Morgan

179
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,578
向英法贷款10亿美元的含义？
has loaned England and France a billion dollars?

180
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:28,677
如果德国人获胜，他就收不回钱
And if Germany wins, he won't get it back.

181
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,450
还有咖啡吗？到时美国就会介入…
More coffee? America would be entering the war

182
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,751
以维护摩根的金钱
to protect J.P. Morgan's money.

183
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,051
如果他失败了，我们就会消沉
If he loses it, we'll have a depression.

184
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,284
因此，真正的问题是…
So, the real question is,

185
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,452
我们为何有这样一种经济 穷人出钱…
why do we have an economy where the poor have to pay

186
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:37,858
以确保富人不会失去钱？
so the rich won't lose money?

187
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:39,361
我们还有什么没谈及？
All right, now, what haven't we covered?

188
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,023
对女性的经济自由意味着性自由
Economic freedom for women means sexual freedom,

189
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,963
性自由意味着节育…
and sexual freedom means birth control...

190
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,762
反对！《大众》持反对意见
Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.

191
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,131
我们有中上阶级的…
...we have a predominantly

192
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,397
读者群优势
upper-middle class readership.

193
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,099
我们必须在全国奔走呼告 为本杂志集资
So, we have to run around the country raising money for the magazine

194
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:52,538
不择手段地…
any way we...

195
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:57,771
怎么啦？
What?

196
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,479
我在想…
Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...

197
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,876
我应该给你提供多点咖啡
That I ought to offer you more coffee.

198
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,714
我没留意到时间，但是…
I hadn't realized the hour, but

199
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:09,577
我似乎占用了你很多时间
I seem to have taken up a lot of your time.

200
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,484
没关系
Well, that's okay by me.

201
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:15,914
这种事常发生吗？
Does this happen to you often?

202
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:18,426
不经常
Not often enough.

203
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:20,922
那么…
Well?

204
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,828
我们进展迅速
We certainly have come a long way fast.

205
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:25,924
是的
Yeah.

206
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,368
你想更进一步吗？
Do you want to take it a step further?

207
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:31,297
好的
Yeah.

208
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,272
如果我要你做件听似有点自私的事…
What would you think if I asked you to do something

209
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,436
你会怎么想？
that might seem a little selfish?

210
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,769
我觉得你大可说出来
Well, I... I think you should.

211
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:42,406
好的，我想让你看看我的作品
Good. Good, because I'd like you to take a look at my work

212
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:43,949
发表一下你的看法
and tell me what you think.

213
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,383
我真的很尊重你的观点
You see, I really respect your opinion so much.

214
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,115
真是凑巧，我正想问你…
Well, it's odd, because I was just gonna ask you

215
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,246
有什么东西给我看的
if you had anything I could take a look at.

216
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,689
这有点强人所难 但我真的感激你能过目
I know it's an imposition but I'd be very grateful and you see,

217
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,783
你所写的文章我都看过
I've read everything that you've ever written.

218
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,690
我很乐意这么做…
Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...

219
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,160
谢谢你
Well, thank you.

220
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,362
那我去给你拿外套
Well, then I... I'll get your coat.

221
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,257
希望你不会太客气
Oh, and I hope you won't be gentle with me.

222
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:05,958
-客气？ -我是个严肃的作家
- Gentle? - I'm a serious writer.

223
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:07,025
你大可以尖锐点
You can really be tough.

224
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:08,865
我会的…
No, I will be. No, I will be.

225
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,496
-谢谢 -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

226
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,670
-你想要我离开？ -不是的，只是我要迟到了
- Do you want me to leave? - Not really, but I'm late.

227

-清早6点迟到？ -是的，我有个约会
- Late at 6:00 in the morning? - Yes. I have an appointment.

228
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,942
明晚我可以见你吗？
Well, could I see you tomorrow night?

229
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,242
我明晚很忙
I'm busy tomorrow night.

230
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,714
-第二天我就要出城了 -真是遗憾
- Because I'm leaving town the next day. - Gee, I'm sorry.

231
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,375
你若有时间的话，请告知我你的看法
So, if you have time, let me know what you think,

232
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,750
我会把采访的副本给你
and I'll send you a copy of the interview.

233
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,610
采访？
Some interview, huh?

234
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,614
有时间看看
Take a look sometime.

235
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:36,215
好的，我明白
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.

236
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,556
-拜 -拜
- Bye. - Bye.

237
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,433
杰克，你还记得哈迪森先生吗？
Jack, dear, do you remember Mr. Hardison?

238
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,429
曾在山上的第一长老教堂待过
Used to be at the First Presbyterian Church, up the hill.

00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:55,669
他现在在西雅图的普利茅斯大教堂
He's in Seattle now at the big Plymouth church.

240
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:02,772
是什么风把你吹来的，杰克？
What brings you out here, Jack?

241
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:05,282
只是回来看你母亲吗？
Just come out to see your mother?

242
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,781

00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,591
杰克，你还记得珀森先生的妹妹吗？
Jack, do you remember Mr. Potterson's sister?

250
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,034
一条胳膊残废了的那个？
The one with the bad arm?

251
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,594
-是宗教方面的吗？ -不是的，先生

254
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,567
有点宗教味道
Sounds religious.

255

记得那个向她求爱的家伙吗？
You remember the fellow that was courting her?

- What was his name, Jack? - I don't think I remember the name.

259
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,977
我不了解你们这些人 但我真的饿了
Well, I don't know about you people, but I'm starved.

260
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:50,588
帕洛太太，我…
I don't know, Mrs. Partlow. I...

261
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:52,989
杰克，听说昨晚在自由主义俱乐部…
Jack, I heard you made a few people a little unhappy

262
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,390
你让一些人感到不悦了
down at the Liberal Club last night.

263
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,587
卡尔，我们是来这里开心的

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,024
欢迎，真开心
Welcome. So happy...

268
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,762
-你好，杰克 -你好
- Hello, Jack. - Hello.

269
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,599
你气色真好
Oh, you look wonderful.

270
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,641
阿尔玛，这是路易丝・楚林杰
Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.

271
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,600
阿尔玛・波尔 这位尼德・波尔和杰克・雷德
Alma Boyle. This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.

272
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:21,239
杰克，路易丝是个女权改革派
Jack, Louise is quite a progressive in her own right.

273
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:22,373
帕洛先生
Mr. Partlow.

274
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,282
-你好，雷德先生 -你好
- How do you do, Mr. Reed? - How do you do?

275
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,985
帕洛先生，帕洛太太 这是路易丝・楚林杰
Oh, Mr. Partlow, Mrs. Partlow, this is Louise Trullinger.

276
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,819
-幸会 -幸会
- Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you.

277
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,154
你是保罗・楚林杰的妻子？
Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?

278
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,024
是的
Yes. Yes, I am.

279
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,995
够了不起的
Well, isn't that something?

280
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,985
弗罗兹大桥就是他设计的
He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.

281
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,728
楚太太，你丈夫是全波特兰最好的牙医
Oh, Mrs. Trullinger, your husband's the finest dentist in all of Portland.

282
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,895
-过奖了 -是嘛？
- Thank you very much. - Really?

283
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,164
他还给葛洛夫叔叔做了个盘子
And I think he did a plate for Uncle Grover.

284
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,604
不等哈瑞和玛莎了，我快饿扁了
Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha. I could eat a horse.

285
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:51,730
好，我们就座吧
All right, let's go in.

286
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,366
保罗没来真是可惜
What a shame Paul couldn't come tonight.

287
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:54,671
-有急事？ -是的…
- An emergency? - Yes...

288
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:55,767
希望不是因为要做盘子
Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.

289
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:58,508
不是，那个盘子还很新
- No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new. - Oh, well...

290
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,040
格林威治村开始自由恋爱了？
Did free love start in Greenwich Village?

291
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,808
上等的红酒，卡尔
Very good wine, Carl.

292
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:08,742
-还要吗，杰克？ -不了，谢谢
- More, Jack? - No, no. No, thank you.

293
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,514
真的很美味
It's just delicious, really.

294
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:13,788
你不觉得吗，楚太太？
Don't you think so, Mrs. Trullinger?

295
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,926
是的，很美味
Yes, it's just delicious.

296
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,191
谢谢你，路易丝
Thank you, Louise.

297
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,323
-杜邦，我想是 -杜邦
- Dupont, I think. - Dupont.

298
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:21,865
是杜邦对吗，哈瑞？
It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?

299
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,268
母亲不想你让杰克开谈婚姻的话题
Mother doesn't want you to get Jack started on the subject of marriage.

300
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:27,669
你有孩子吗，楚太太？
You got any children, Mrs. Trullinger?

301
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,468
暂时没，雷德先生
Not yet, Mr. Reed.

302
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,372
-叫我杰克 -我已经结婚14年了
- Call me Jack. - I've been married 14 years now.

303
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:34,139
别把我牵扯进自由恋爱的争论
Don't get me in any arguments about free love.

304
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,474
外面正在变冷
It's getting cold outside.

305
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,104
我叫你路易丝
I'll just call you Louise.

306
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,911
乔治・沃杜，没错 是乔治・沃杜！
George Waldorf. That's it! George Waldorf!

307
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,417
过去是卖线轴的
Used to sell spool thread.

308
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,852
-乔治・沃杜的情况呢？ -他死了
- What about George Waldorf? - Well, he died.

309
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,222
我无法相信 竟然没人陪你出来散步，路易丝
I couldn't think of letting you walk unescorted, Louise.

310
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,417
跟我说说…
Tell me something.

311
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:53,052
楚先生介意你花这么多时间 在工作室吗？
Does Dr. Trullinger mind your spending so much time at your studio?

312
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,858
大家都要给对方一点自由空间
People have to give each other a little freedom.

313
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,961
自由吗，楚太太？
Freedom, Mrs. Trullinger?

314
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,760
我很想知道你对自由的看法
I'd like to know what your idea of freedom is.

315
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:03,325
拥有自己的工作室？散步在…
Having your own studio? Walk...

316
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,941
我很想看看你脱掉裤子的样子 雷德先生
I'd like to see you with your pants off, Mr. Reed.

317
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:39,932
勇往直前
Marching and shuffling along

318
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,072
我没注意到时间
I didn't realize the time.

319
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,209
如果你不介意，那里有李子蜜饯
So, if you like, there's some very nice damson preserves.

320
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,707
可以用来做烤面包
And you can make toast out of that, if you want.

321
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,015
那么，再见
So, bye.

322
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,248
你去哪？
Where you going?

323
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,652
你去哪？
Where you going?

324
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,420
如果你要赶2:45的车 那就得赶紧的了
If you're catching the 2:45, I mean, you don't really have that much time.

325
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,894
-你要收拾的话… -路易丝，现在才8:45
- I'm sure you're gonna want to pack... - Louise, it's 8:45, only.

326
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,054
才8:45
It's 8:45.

327
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,994
我知道你在纽约非常忙
Listen, I realize that you're very busy in New York,

328
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,555
但如果你花点时间写点 对我作品的评价
but I'd be grateful if you could take the time

329
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:19,294
我会感激不尽
to write a few words to me about my work.

330
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:20,561
好的…
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

331
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,160
如果要把我的文件包送回来 可以邮寄这个地址
If you'll just send my portfolio back. You can mail it to this address...

332
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,900
等等，路易丝 为什么要走得这么急？
Louise, wait a minute. What are you just walking out like that for?

333
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,430
请上楼来和我谈谈好吗？
Will you come upstairs, please, and just talk to me for a minute?

334
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:32,439
谢谢
Thank you.

335
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:34,944
-听着… -什么事？
- Listen... - What is it?

336
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:38,675
你不来吗？
Why don't you come?

337
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,182
-什么？ -来纽约
- What? - Come to New York.

338
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,947
你不是想写作吗？ 那就来作家云集的地方
You wanna write? Come where the writers are.

339
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,443
如果你有自由 那就去拥有自由的地方
If you wanna have freedom you gotta go where the freedom is, don't you?

340
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:46,422
你去波特兰是种浪费，来纽约吧
You're gonna go to waste in Portland. Come to New York.

341
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,389
-你应该待在纽约 -多谢了
- You ought to be in New York. - Thank you very much.

342
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:49,517
我会记得的
I'll remember that.

343
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:51,686
-什么？ -我会记得你的建议
- What? - I'll remember your advice.

344
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:54,825
请和我一起去
Please come with me.

345
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,827
好吧，等等 我就直接说吧
All right, wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

346
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:59,027
你想我和你一起去纽约
You want me to come with you to New York.

347
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:00,397
是的
Yeah.

348
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:02,368
以什么身份？
What as? What as?

349
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:04,030
-什么意思… -以什么身份？
- What do you mean, what... - What as?

350
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,597
-你的女友？ -什么意思？
- Your girlfriend? - What does that mean?

351
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:07,970
以什么身份？你的女友…
What as? Your girlfriend,

352
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,101
情人，情妇，还是姘妇？
your mistress, your paramour, your concubine?

353
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,970
为什么一定要以某种身份？
Why does it have to be as anything?

354
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,842
因为我不想卷进那种…
Because I don't wanna get into some kind

355
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,282
情感的漩涡中，我无法…
of emotional possessive involvement where I'm not able to...

356
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,617
我想知道是什么身份
I want to know what as.

357
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,054
感恩节快到了 就以火鸡的身份如何？
Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving. Why don't you come as a turkey?

358
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:31,119
我一直以为她是那种 非常认真的女孩
I always thought she was a very earnest girl who went away.

359
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:35,619
可能那个牙医除了牙齿外 对别的都一无所知
Probably the dentist knew nothing except about teeth,

360
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,866
有趣的是…
and was mainly interested...

361
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,166
那个时候她遇到这个能干的…
And then she had this wonderful journalist

362
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,569
可以与她海阔天空的记者
who could talk about all sorts of things.

363
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,733
我从德国带了件大衣
I had a coat I brought from Germany.

364
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,140
她想要那件大衣
And she wanted that coat

365
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,238
并游说了我良久
and made me all kinds of propositions.

366
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,142
但我也想要它
But I wanted it, too.

367
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,975
不过最后我还是让给了她
But finally I gave in and gave it to her.

368
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,375
我还有其他大衣
I had other coats.

369
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:08,682
这就是她的处世方式
So that's how she operated.

370
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:14,991
她跟随他去了，她得到了他
She went after him. As I say, she got him.

371
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,426
她一点都不笨
So she wasn't any dummy.

372
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,998
但这件事在过去的波特兰 引起了不小轰动
But it was something to happen in little old Portland.

373
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,094
那时你听不到性这个词
You didn't hear the word "sex."

374
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,073
听不到女同性恋这个词
You didn't hear the word "lesbian."

375
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,440
听不到男同性恋这个词
You didn't hear the word "homosexual."

376
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,502
也听不到流产这个词
You didn't hear the word "abortion."

377
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,945
那些东西你都听不到
You didn't hear those things.

378
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,748
男人尊重女人
Men respected women.

379
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,116
男人帮助女人穿外套，为女人开门
They helped them on with their coats, they opened the doors for them.

380
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,518
男人和女人相互求爱
And the man and woman who courted each other,

381
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:42,953
两厢情愿
they married each other.

382
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,184
我最大的感触就是…
You know something that I think,

383
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,188
那时和现在简直可以说是判若两样
that there was just as much fucking going on then as now.

384
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,454
只有现在，才会产生不正当的品质
Only now, it has a more perverted quality.

385
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:58,291
现在不会再有什么爱了
Now there's no love whatever included.

386
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:01,234
在那时，人间处处都有温情在
Then, there was your heart, a bit of heart in it.

387
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,330
那就是格林威治村
Greenwich Village was there,

388
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,436
被纽约城包围着
and New York was around it.

389
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:09,433
纽约其他地方和格林威治村完全不同
And the rest of New York did not act the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.

390
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,940
村子是异议的中心…
It was sort of a center of dissent

391
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:16,205
在美国人的生活中生活了很久
and had been for a long time in American life.

392
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,842
全国各地的人来到这里
People from all over the country came there.

393
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:23,609
他们被当作是吉普赛人 他们的生活方式没有规律
They were regarded as bohemian. Their ways of life were irregular.

394
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,885
他们的穿着…
The way they dressed

395
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,650
还有他们的思维方式
and certainly the way they thought

396
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,559
与美国的主流生活格格不入
was outside the mainstream of American life.

397
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,221
根据我的回忆…
And as I recollect it,

398
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,220
婚姻在格林威治村并不重要
marriage was not important in Greenwich Village.

399
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,825
我记得杰克对别人说过一句话
I remember hearing a line Jack said to somebody

400
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,893
他想引诱女人上床
he was trying to lure into bed.

401
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:45,296
女人非常卖弄风情 然后他说“你难道不够异教吗？”
She was being very coy, and he said, "Aren't you pagan enough?"

402
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,507
哈罗？
Hello?

403
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,654
哈罗，杰克？
Hello, Jack?

404
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,726
《大众》

405
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,730
“大工会联盟”

406
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,705
“周五乘列车在6号站台到达”

407
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,744
“我自己能找到路，路易丝”

408
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,695
如果散发节育小册子是违法的…
If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets on birth control,

409
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,134
那我也为罪犯而骄傲
I'm proud to be a criminal.

410
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:48,401
没人跟你争执坐牢权利的问题，埃玛
No one is arguing with your inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.

411
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,635
我只是说因为节育而坐牢…
All I'm saying is that this is not the right time

412
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,108
在时间上不合时宜
to go to jail for birth control.

413
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,133
因节育而坐牢有合适的时间吗？
Oh, there's a right time to go to jail for birth control?

414
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,374
《大众》现在管制起道德良心来了？
The Masses is governing conscience now?

415
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,679
很快你就无法区别出《纽约时报》了
Soon you'll be indistinguishable from The New York Times.

416
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:01,379
埃玛，我只是说反战运动…
Emma, all I'm saying is that you are too valuable

417
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,113
-对你来说代价太高 -你错了
- to the anti-war movement. - You're wrong.

418
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,783
-不，他说得没错，如果卷入战争… -你也错了
- No, he's right. If we get into this war... - And you're wrong.

419
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,952
-你让我说完好吗？ -没必要说完
- Will you let me finish my sentence? - Your sentence is not worth finishing.

420
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,758
成千上万的美国妇女过度操劳，营养不良
Thousands of American women, overworked, underfed,

421
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,926
产下的贫血孩子连一年都活不了
are dying, giving birth to anemic children who can't last out a year.

422
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,834
她们的生命难道就没美国男人重要？
Are their lives any less valuable than thousands of American boys'?

423
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,601
-星期二我要收回 -我不是说，你认为…？
- I want those back Tuesday. - I'm not saying... Do you think?

424
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,740
-该死 -完全正确
- Oh, shit. - Exactly.

425
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,004
晚安
Good night.

426
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,034
-要咖啡吗？ -“蔡斯桑博牌”的？
- You want some coffee? - Chase and Sanborn?

427
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,772
-我没咖啡了 -又没了？我走了
- I'm out of coffee. - Again? I'm leaving.

428
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,448
不，谈话结束了 你是个记者，杰克
No, the conversation is over. You're a journalist, Jack.

429
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,681
等你成为革命者时 我们再考虑优先问题
When you're a revolutionary, we'll discuss priorities.

430
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,052
希望咖啡真的没了
Hopefully over coffee.

431
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,423
-很晚了，我送你回家吧 -为什么？我不会伤害任何人
- It's late, I'll walk you home. - Why? I won't hurt anybody.

432
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,429
对了…
Well...

433
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:53,997
没错
Yeah.

434
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,167
今晚是周五晚
It's Friday night.

435
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,933
很高兴见到你
I'm so glad to see you.

436
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,239
真的，见到你很高兴
Really, I'm so glad to see you.

437
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,581
我看完你的文章了，写得非常好
I finished your articles. They're very good.

438
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:08,985
铁路文章，我认为还需要推敲润色
The railroad piece, I think, is... Needs polishing.

439
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,314
-内容有重复，但是… -但是经过深思熟虑
- It's repetitious, but... - But that's deliberate.

440
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,891
我是通过重复发表观点
I'm using repetition to make a point.

441
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,324
我不希望它润色过度
I don't want it to seem too polished.

442
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,466
Oh.

443
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,624
我认为你会喜欢纽约的
Well, I think you're gonna love New York.

444
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,428
埃玛…
Emma, Emma, Emma.

445
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,594
全名应该是埃玛・高柏
I think it was Emma Goldberg.

446
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:24,693
我觉得是
I think so.

447
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,466
我从未忘记埃玛・高曼
I never forgot Emma Goldman.

448
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,428
她启发我达到很深的思想深度
She inspired me to the very depths.

449
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,465
麦斯・伊斯曼是大家都喜欢的人
And Max Eastman was a beloved man.

450
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:35,501
思想激进，崇尚自由灵魂
The real radical, a free spirit.

451
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:39,311
他和埃玛・高曼是一个组的
He was in that same group with that Emma Goldman.

452
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,752
她应该姓高曼，不是高柏
That was her name. Goldman, not Goldberg.

453
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,551
弗洛伊德・戴尔是其中一员
Floyd Dell was one of them.

454
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,818
他写过小说，很优秀的小说
He wrote novels, beautiful novels.

455
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:50,657
激进分子包括世界产业工人组织
The radicals included people like the IWWs

456
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,288
还有比尔・海沃
and Bill Haywood.

457
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,594
还有沃特・李普曼
And there were Walter Lippmann,

458
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,568
林肯・史蒂芬和伊莎多拉・邓肯
and Lincoln Steffens and Isadora Duncan

459
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,559
以及埃娜・圣文森特・米莱
and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

460
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:01,368
埃弗德・史蒂里茨
Alfred Stieglitz...

461
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,100
玛格丽特・桑格
Oh, and Margaret Sanger.

462
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,508
天哪，我保护过她
My Lord, I picketed for her.

463
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,137
当然，伟大的作家尤金・奥尼尔…
And, of course, the great writer Eugene O'Neill

464
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:09,443
也是出自那里的
came from down there.

465
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,178
至今我仍认为 没有人可以企及奥尼尔
I don't think there's anybody who can touch O'Neill today.

466
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,684
我认为，要成为艺术家 必须具有一点叛逆精神
You have to be a bit of a rebel to be an artist of any kind, I believe.

467
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,250
格林威治村民都有点叛逆
And everybody in Greenwich Village was a bit of a rebel.

468
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,700
-你是做什么的，路易丝？ -写文章
- What do you do, Louise? - I write.

469
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,069
很好嘛，可以把面包递给我吗？
Good for you. Could you pass the bread, please?

470
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,368
-谢谢 -对中产阶级的美国人而言…
- Thanks. - Because to the middle-class American,

471
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,670
左派的人都是一样的 无政府主义者，社会主义者…
everyone on the left is the same. An anarchist, a socialist...

472
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,811
把面包递给我好吗？
Would you pass the bread, please?

473
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,318
-你是做什么的，路易丝？ -写文章
- What do you do, Louise? - I write.

474
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,482
不错，舒曼・汉克夫人…
Good. Madame Schumann-Heink...

475
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,959
杰克说你是写文章的，拜伦小姐 你写的是哪类文章？
Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant. What do you write about?

476
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,458
什么都写
Everything.

477
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,864
什么都写？
You write about everything?

478
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,933
是的，什么都写，无所不写
Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...

479
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,301
只是…
Just...

480
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,335
我明白了
I see.

481
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,275
戴维斯和斯隆，他们辞职了？
Now, about Davis and Sloan, have they quit?

482
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,338
还没，不过他们…
Not yet, but they...

483
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,248
我认为他们不该这样坐在这里 这样太残酷
I don't think they should sit here like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.

484
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,489
-只是… -组织，对吧？
- It's just... - Organization, right?

485
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,552
资本家是做什么的？
Look, what does a capitalist do?

486
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,656
请允许我问你这个问题，麦克？ 告诉我
Let me ask you that, Mike. Huh? Tell me.

487
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,291
他们除了赚钱之外还干什么？
I mean, what does he make, besides money?

488
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,996
我不知道 所有工作都是工人做的，不是吗？
I don't know what he makes. The workers do all the work, don't they?

489
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,538
如果工人都被组织起来呢？
Well, what if they got organized?

490
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,470
我是说所有的工人 不仅仅是水管工人…
I mean, all the workers. Not just the plumbers,

491
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:43,634
还有木匠，雪茄师傅
and the carpenters and the goddamn cigar makers.

492
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,109
世界上所有的工人
But all of them, all over the world?

493
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,737
不仅仅是一个国家的 给他瓶啤酒好吗？
Not in just one country. Give him a beer, will you?

494
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,281
如果他们都被组织起来呢？
What if they all got organized?

495
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,806
难道你不认为他们可以… 可以改变社会秩序
Don't you think they could... They could change society overnight.

496
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,078
他们可以把社会 变成他们喜欢的模式
They can make it into anything they wanted.

497
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:55,609
杰克，可否给我5块钱？我没钱了
Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.

498
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:59,088
别跟这个自命不凡的家伙要钱
Well, don't ask this pretentious son of a bitch for money.

499
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,920
如果你需要5块钱，我可以给你
If you need $5, I'll give it to you.

500
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,891
给我4块5好吗？
Let me have $4.50, will you?

501
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,763
-公平是什么？ -明白我的意思吗？
- What isn't fair? - You see what I'm saying?

502
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,599
如果全世界所有工人 都属于一个大公会
If all the workers in the world belonged to one big union,

503
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:12,730
-那就不会有战争了，是吗？ -你在听我说吗？
- there wouldn't be a war, would there? - Are you listening to me?

504
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,205
拜伦小姐
Miss Bryant.

505
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,174
你守着那瓶啤酒已经一个小时了
You've been nursing that beer for an hour.

506
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,870
要不要给你来杯红酒？
Can I get you a glass of wine or something?

507
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,971
不用了，谢谢，我没事
No, thank you. I'm fine. Thank you, anyway.

508
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:23,710
-啤酒就好 -你是个亲切的人
- Beer's fine. - You are an amiable person.

509
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,612
听说也是个好画家
And a very good painter, I hear.

510
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,948
我是作家
I write.

511
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,555
看过杨
Read Jung!

512
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,267
看过弗洛伊德，看过杨 看过恩格斯，麦斯
"Read Freud, read Jung." Read Engels, read Marx!

513
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,362
天哪，你不能把弗洛伊德 加入到经济范筹
My God, you can't interpret Freud in an economic context.

514
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,304
你知道出租车在等你吗？
You know you got a taxi waiting?

515
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,638
索斯玛代表了宗教堕落
Zosima represents the corruption of religion.

516
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:50,699
你这观点是错的
I tell you you're wrong.

517
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:53,940
-杨是个神秘的… -但你真的认为…
- And Jung is a mystic... - But do you seriously believe...

518
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,675
-他们要赖多久才走？ -不知道，应该快走了
- How long are they going to stay? - I don't know. They'll get out in a while.

519
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,813
-我只离开一天而已 -你可刚从波士顿回来
- I'll only be gone for a day. - You just got back from Boston.

520
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,356
你何不和我一起去巴尔的摩？
Hey, why don't you come with me to Baltimore?

521
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,620
真的？我应该以什么身份去？
Really? What am I supposed to come to Baltimore as?

522
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:08,058
什么身份？
What as?

523
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:10,494
杰克，出租车在等你呢
Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.

524
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,155
出租车在等呢，杰克
Taxi's waiting, Jack.

525
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:15,532
明天见
See you tomorrow.

526
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:25,700
我们努力了两年
We've been trying for two years.

527
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:29,112
资本家们可随时根据 自己的意愿让国家卷入战火
Capitalists can take this country into war any time they damn well please.

528
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,310
你唯一能施加影响的地方就是街道
The only impact you can make is in the streets.

529
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:32,443
当然，可是…
Of course, but...

530
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:34,509
可是，埃玛，你难道不认为…
But don't you think, Emma,

531
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,352
如果戴布斯获得很多选票 这会否强化这种印象？
that if Debs gets a lot of votes, it'll strengthen that image?

532
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:41,291
不，不会的，我认为选举 是这个国家的鸦片
No, I don't. I think voting is the opium of the masses in this country.

533
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:43,260
每4年就要遭受这样的痛苦
Every four years, you deaden the pain.

534
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:44,524
是的，但是…
Yeah, but...

535
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,493
你不认为…
Don't you think...

536
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:50,560
我已经很清楚地 表达了自己的想法，拜伦小姐
I just made it very clear what I think, Miss Bryant.

537
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:52,866
别这样，埃玛，不要这么独断
Come on, E.G. Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.

538
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,932
-路易丝有她自己的看法 -我突然变得独断了？
- Louise has a point. She says... - Suddenly I'm dogmatic.

539
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:58,932
为何我每次身份改变 你就会带一个新的女人来，杰克？
Why does my status change every time you get a new woman, Jack?

540
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:02,243
伯尼，可以给我来点红酒吗？ 路易丝，你要吗？
Bernie, could I have the red wine? Louise, would you like a glass?

541
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,307
她有点…她有点烦我
She's just... She's upset with me.

542
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:07,216
这跟你没关系，和你无关
It's got nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with you.

543
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,983
谢谢，这话很舒心
Thank you. It's a great comfort.

544
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:12,882
你离开后屋子里都挤满了人
The house is completely filled with people when you're gone.

545
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,858
他们简直把它当会议室了
They use it as if it was a meeting hall or something.

546
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:17,157
-我根本没法工作 -那就赶他们走
- I can't get any work done. - Just throw them out.

547
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:18,926
-怎么赶？ -直接赶走
- How am I supposed to throw them out? - Just kick them out.

548
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,091
叫他们离开
Tell them to leave.

549
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,634
我不会叫麦斯・伊斯曼离开
I'm not going to say to Max Eastman, "Leave."

550
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,169
-只管赶他们走 -杰克？
- Just throw them out. - Jack?

551
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,035
杰克，是你吗？ 见到你太高兴了
Jack, is that you? Jack, it's very good to see you.

552
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,597
-贺瑞斯，近来好吗？ -很高兴见到你
- Hello, Horace. How are you? - Very good to see you.

553
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,672
-认识路易丝・拜伦吧？ -你好
- You know Louise Bryant? - Yes, hello. How are you?

554
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,805
-很高兴见到你 -你好
- Very nice to see you. - How do you do?

555
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:35,974
幸会
Great pleasure.

556
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,006
-嗨，麦斯，你好吗？ -你好，贺瑞斯
- Hi, Max. How are you? - Divine, Horace.

557
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,950
-幸会，弗洛伊德 -你好，贺瑞斯
- And Floyd, good to see you. - Hello, Horace.

558
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:42,043
牢狱之灾还是不断吗，杰克？
Still getting arrested, Jack?

559
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,282
试试吧
I try.

560
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:46,517
你呢，拜伦小姐？
How about you, Miss Bryant?

561
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:48,617
你也想尝试被捕吗？
Are you trying to get arrested, too?

562
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,219
不，不想
No, not really.

563
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:55,294
-你是做什么的，拜伦小姐？ -写文章
- What do you do, Miss Bryant? - I write.

564
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,897
写文章？可否说一下都写些什么吗？
You write? Now, may I ask, what are you working on?

565
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:04,004
无法形容
It's impossible to describe.

566
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,510
无法形容？
It's impossible to describe?

567
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:06,637
她刚刚写了篇文章
She just did a hell of a piece

568
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,977
在纽约军械库展上反响很大 你应该读读
on the influence of the Armory Show and you ought to read it.

569
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,245
那我真的要读一读了
Well, you know, I very much would like to read that.

570
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:14,209
何不打电话到《大都会》找我？
Why don't you give me a call at The Metropolitan?

571
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,253
或是周二我们出来喝两杯如何？
In fact, even better, why don't we have a drink on Thursday?

572
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:20,019
-好吧 -我们可以聊聊纽约军械库展
- Fine. - We can talk about the Armory Show.

573
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:21,389

576
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,726
别再被逮进去了，好吗？
Now, you stay out of the slammer, now, okay?

577
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:34,701
再见，见到你很高兴
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's nice to see you.

578
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:38,575
-杰克，不要这样做 -什么？
- Jack, please don't do that. - What?

579
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,806
他是《大都会》的编辑 我认识他好几年了
He's the editor of Metropolitan. I've known him for years.

580
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:43,941
-杰克，我可以为自己辩护 -你的文章也可以
- Jack, I can speak for myself. - So can your work.

581
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,451
-我不想你这样做… -出租车在等着了，杰克
- I don't want you to do that... - Taxi's waiting, Jack.

582
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,475
出租车在等着了，杰克
Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.

583
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:53,319
杰克
Jack...

584
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,052
周末见，好吗？
I'll see you at the end of the week, okay?

585
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,657
-好吗？ -等等

586

“依次地，这些国境…”
"And in turn, these frontiers..."

596
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,058
哦，天哪
Oh, God.

597
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,658
这是重复
It is repetitious.

598
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:41,466
我们不是人，我们是商品
We're not human beings, we're a commodity.

How many times have they slammed the door on your face

604
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:55,210
让你们吃闭门羹？
because the labor you do is called unskilled?

605
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:56,414
没事的，比尔
That's right, Bill.

606
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:58,889
世界产业工人组织 不会因你们技术不熟练…
Well, the IWW's not gonna turn you down

-所有工人都属于… -都看看，这很重要

I'm looking for a lathe worker named Pasquale Alberti.

因此，我们需要权力
And for that, we need power.

619
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:32,916
只有一种方式才能获得权力

620
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:34,522
组织起来

你们会一无所有
You'll never get anything or anywhere,

627
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:54,065
除非整个工人阶级属于一个大…
until the whole working class belongs to one big...

628
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:56,377
好了，先生们
All right, gentlemen,

629
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,339
你们有20秒的时间离开
you've got 20 seconds to vacate the premises.

630
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,687
你们有何授权？
May I ask on what authority?

631
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,353
我的授权
On my authority.

632
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,486
这是非法集会
This is an illegal assembly.

633
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,091
对不起，警官 这些人都是合法集会的
Excuse me, Officer. These men have the legal right to assemble.

634
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,396
这就是他们正在做的事情
That's all they're doing.

635
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:18,165
我们知道他们做什么
We know what the hell they doing.

636
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,160
-你在这里做什么？ -我？
- What the hell you doing? - Me?

637
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,332
就是你
You.

00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,898
-我写作 -写作？
- I write. - You write?

639
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:25,036
你错了
You wrong.

640
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,372
把他带走！
Get him out of here!

641
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,754
就是它们哪
Here they are.

642
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,051
对开的纸，全部作品
The folio. The oeuvre.

643
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:42,816
Well...

644
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,060
杰克还好吗？
How is Jack?

645
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:48,590
希望他最近写作最好能小心谨慎点
I do hope he's being more careful about what he's writing these days.

646
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,693
我不想看到他的作品无法出版
I'd hate to see him not able to get into print.

647
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:52,568
他能应付得来的
Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.

648
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:57,435
你告诉他我们在哪里喝酒了吗？
Did you tell him where we were having drinks?

649
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:59,442
没有，我会的，他出城了
No, I will. He's out of town.

650
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,937
威汉先生，对不起 纽约军械库展的文章在最上面
Mr. Whigham, excuse me, but the Armory Show piece is on the top.

651
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:04,939
这是军械…
Oh, this is the Armory...

652
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:08,010

我还需要点时间来拜读
I really ought to spend more time on this.

655
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,833
当然可以

656
00:33:21,202 --> 00:33:22,533

658
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:29,929
-他为什么要介意？ -当然，我们都是成年人了
- Why would he mind? - Well, we're all grownups, of course,

659
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,909
不过杰克非常的…
but Jack's rather...

660
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,377
他是个非常古怪的家伙
He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?

661
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,710
我一直不知道…
And I've never really known how...

662
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,045
威汉先生，你是说…
Mr. Whigham, are you saying you need

663
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:39,415
和我约会要获得杰克的许可？
Jack's permission to make a pass at me?

664
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,548
不要为此烦恼
Don't get so upset about it.

665
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,420
老天，我作了两个小小变动
For Christ's sake, I made two little tiny changes...

666
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,015
不要修改我写的，彼得
Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.

667
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:49,152
你到底是怎么了，杰克？
What the hell's the matter with you, Jack?

668
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,389
世界产业工人组织是赤色份子
The IWW's a bunch of Reds.

669
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,557
拜托
Come on.

670
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,165
世界产业工人组织有赤色份子 村子里有赤色份子
We got Reds in the IWW, got Reds in the Village.

671
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,998
除了赤色份子这里什么都没有
We've got nothing but Reds around here.

672
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:59,993
老天，你是这里最好的作家
For Christ's sake, you're the best goddamn writer around.

673
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,734
你何必浪费时间和精力…
Now, what the hell you wanna waste your time

674
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,969
来写那些别人不会出版的赤色文章？
with a lot of Red propaganda nobody's ever gonna print?

675
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,000
这是真理，这理由够充分吗？
It's the truth. Does that mean anything around here?

676
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:07,637
谁说那些东西是真理的？
Well, who the hell's to say what the truth is?

677
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:09,613
世界产业工人组织的那帮赤色份子？
A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?

678
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,605
你对左派那些人并不公平
You're not being fair to the AF of L.

679
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,517
-快把那篇文章给我 -你要修改我的文章？
- Now, give me the goddamn article... - You're gonna rewrite what I write.

680
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,715
我拿给愿意出版的杂志社
I'm just gonna take it to a magazine that won't.

681
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:18,449
好吧，拿去给《大众》
Well, fine. Take it to The Masses.

682
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:19,889
-他们是帮赤色份子 -谢谢
- They're a bunch of Reds. - Thank you.

683
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:22,053
-谁来支付你的租金？ -这你不用担心，彼得
- Who's gonna pay your rent? - Rent's easy, Pete.

684
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:25,051
你不要修改我的文章就行，明白吗？
You just don't rewrite what I write. You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.

685
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:28,259
你这倔驴子，谁来支付你的租金？
You stubborn son of a bitch. Who's gonna pay your rent?

686
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,443
路易丝？
Louise?

687
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,401
我把店里的都买来了
I got every one in the shop.

688
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:08,029
我们虽然窘迫，但我还是都买下了
We're broke, but we've got them all.

689
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:13,270
谢谢
Thanks.

690
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,272
-怎么了？ -没什么
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

691
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:22,116
-怎么了？ -没事，旅途如何？
- What is it? - It's nothing. How'd it go?

692
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,016
比预期的要好多了
A lot better than we thought it would.

693
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:26,991
-你见到威汉了？ -昨天见了
- You see Whigham? - Yesterday.

694
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:30,018
-怎么样？ -我们主要还是谈你的事
- How was that? - We mostly talked about you, of course.

695
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,586
他给你提供工作了？
Did he offer you work?

696
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,428
没有，不过他向我大说特说…
No, but he made a big point of telling me

697
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:36,128
你和他这么多年的友情有多伟大
what wonderful friends you and he have become over the years.

698
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,124
这是次美好会面
It was a fascinating meeting.

699
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:41,564
你是在生威汉的气还是生我的气？
Are you angry at Whigham or me?

700
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,270
怎么啦？
What is it?

701
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,467
没什么，你说过周二就回的
It's nothing. You said you'd be back Tuesday

702
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:48,809
今天都周六了
and it's Saturday.

703
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,812
我不是说周末回家吗？
Didn't I say I'd back at the end of the week?

704
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:53,216
-周末是星期五 -周末是星期五？
- The end of the week is Friday. - The end of the week is Friday?

705
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,753
星期六不是周末了？
Saturday's not the end of the week anymore, huh?

706
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:56,253
杰克，你说过周二就回的！
Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!

707
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,412
这有什么区别？
What difference does it make?

708
00:35:57,557 --> 00:35:58,614
你认为我一直在做什么？
What do you think I've been doing?

709
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,622
到处跑去听自己夸夸其谈吗？
Running around listening to the sound of my own voice?

710
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,682
我怎么知道你去听谁夸夸其谈？
How do I know whose voice you've been listening to?

711
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:05,285
显然你喜欢它更胜过我！
Obviously you like it a lot better than mine!

712
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,869
天哪，看看我
Look at me. Oh, God!

713
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,276
我就像一个妻子
I'm like a wife.

714
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:26,973
我就像一个烦人的 粘人的，痛苦的小妻子
I'm like a boring, clinging, miserable little wife.

715
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,711
-谁会想回家看我？ -我！
- Who'd wanna come home to me? - Me!

716
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,120
我受不了了，我再也不能这样做了！
Well, I can't do this! I can't do this anymore!

717
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:34,681
你不能做什么？
You can't do what?

718
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:37,450
我就像是生活在你的边缘上
I'm just living in your margins.

719
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:40,156
我不知道自己在这干嘛 我不知道自己的目标是什么
I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what my purpose is.

720
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:43,462
-告诉我你想做什么 -我不想再需要你！
- Well, tell me what you want. - I want to stop needing you!

721
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:44,557
还有一件事
I want you to know something.

722
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:47,093
我问威汉是否可以派我去法国
I asked Whigham if he'd send me to France.

723
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,032
-这就是你想要的？ -没错
- Is that what you want? - That's what I want.

724
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,576
-你要做什么，路易丝？ -我不能在你身边工作
- What are you doing, Louise? - I can't work around you.

725
00:36:58,685 --> 00:36:59,673
你为什么要这样做？
Will you tell me why you're doing this?

726
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:01,514
你在我身边时，我没法严肃起来
I'm not taken seriously when you're around.

727
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,917
我在你身边你没法严肃起来？
When I'm around you're not taken seriously?

728
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,181
天哪，简直糟透了
Oh, God, this is not good.

729
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:05,721
你认为我需要更加严肃？
You mean you think I'm taken more seriously?

730
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:06,779
你是想这样说吗？
Is that what you're talking about?

731
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,484
你难道不认为吗？杰克
Do you mean you're not? Come on, Jack.

732
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,720
你明白我在说什么，你对我一直不坦白
You know what I'm saying. You're not being honest with me.

733
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,818
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're saying.

734
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:14,523
你对我一直不够坦白 请对我坦白点吧
You're not being honest with me. Please, be honest with me.

735
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:15,622
我对你非常的坦白
I am so being honest with you.

736
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:18,498
如果你让自己严肃一点 对方也会这样的
Maybe if you took yourself a little more seriously, other people would, too.

737
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,161
我告诉过你我对军械展文章的看法
I told you what I thought about the Armory piece.

738
00:37:20,273 --> 00:37:21,261
我对此已经很坦白
I was honest about that.

739
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,864
我认为那篇文章很好 但我并没严肃对待它
I think it's very nice, but no, I don't take it very seriously.

740
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:25,033
-谢谢 -如果你的文章不严肃…
- Thank you. - Why do you even expect

741
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:28,203
你为什么又期望 别人会严肃对待它们？
to be taken seriously if you're not writing about serious things?

742
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,508
我不明白
I don't understand that.

743
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,741
我给自己找了间公寓，我要自己找一个
I found myself an apartment. I'm looking for one.

744
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,909
我甚至不知道 你所谓的严肃事情是什么
I'm not even sure I know what things you're serious about.

745
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,281
你先是写关于铁路的文章
One day you're writing about the railroads,

746
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,580
但却一直没写完
and you don't even finish the piece.

747
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,644
然后你又要写一篇发生在3年前的…
The next day you're doing a piece on an art exhibition

748
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,190
有关艺术展的文章
that happened three years ago.

749
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:42,055
为何你什么都要给我看？
Look, why do you give me anything to read, anyway?

750
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,583
如果我提出异议 你就说你喜欢这样写
If I criticize it at all, you tell me you like it the way it is.

751
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,095
当我们和其他人一起出去…
And when we're out with other people,

752
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,961
如果有人没直接问你问题…
if somebody doesn't ask you a direct question,

753
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,397
你就会说你觉得受到了忽视
you tell me you feel ignored.

754
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,526
但是，这样的事情每天都在发生
But with everything that's happening in the world today,

755
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,263
你决定坐下来写文章…
you decide to sit down and write a piece

756
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:57,102
写有关1913年纽约军械库展的影响
on the influence of the goddamned Armory Show of 1913!

757
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,870
人们应该严肃对待它吗？
Are people supposed to take that seriously?

758
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:00,205
我真的不在乎！
Well, I don't really care!

759
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:01,677
-你在乎！ -我真的不在乎！
- You care! - I'm not really... I don't care!

760
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,338
-你在乎 -我不在乎！
- You care! - I don't care!

761
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:06,475
你那些愚蠢朋友严不严肃对待我…
And I'm not interested in whether your stupid friends

762
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:08,746
-我并不感兴趣 -他们不会严肃对待
- take me seriously or not! - Well, they don't take it seriously.

763
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,047
这是因为他们并不严肃对待它
That's why they don't take it seriously.

764
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:12,247
我在休斯顿大街找了一间公寓 我要搬进去
I found an apartment on Houston Street, and I'm moving in.

765
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,881
我再告诉你，杰克・雷德
And I'll tell you something else, Jack Reed.

766
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,358
我认为我们是志不同不相为谋
I don't think we like the same people or the same kind of life.

767
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,418
-我要过自己的生活 -你只管走！
- And I wanna be on my own. - Go ahead, be on your own!

768
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,122
我不在乎，你去过你自己的吧
I don't give a damn! You're on your own anyway.

769
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,825
我知道你不在乎！
Oh! I know you don't give a damn!

770
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,561
你告诉我，我为什么要在乎？
Well, will you tell me why the hell I should give a damn?

771
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,931
你不该在乎！那就不要在乎！
You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!

772
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,562
-我也不在乎 -没错，我不在乎
- I don't give a damn, either! - That's right! I don't give a damn!

773
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,005
-我要离开这里 -好啊，我也离开
- I'm getting out of here! - Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!

774
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,719
亲爱的，我们可否离开纽约？
Honey, can we just get out of New York?

775
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,156
我们去别的地方，写我们想写的东西
Let's go somewhere and just write what we wanna write.

776
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:05,090
普罗旺斯是个小渔村
Provincetown was just a tiny little fishing village.

777
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:09,097
那里非常的保守
And it was very, very conservative.

778
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,100
我们每逢夏天 都乘坐蒸汽船去富尔河
We'd take the Fall River steamer up there, I remember, every summer.

779
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,770
为节省费用，都是睡在隔层硬铺
We used to save fares by sleeping in tiers.

780
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,734
我们经常受到臭虫的骚扰
And we always got bedbugs.

781
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,804
在那里喜欢做什么就做什么
You did whatever you pleased up there.

782
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:23,375
我们还表演一些非常有趣的话剧
And we put on some very interesting plays, experimental plays

783
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,943
那种正规剧院不会严处的话剧
that a commercial theater couldn't possibly do.

784
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,889
苏珊・格拉斯佩的《琐事》
Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.

785
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,516
整个话剧…
There's a whole play

786
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:34,051
没有主角，甚至没有舞台
without the protagonist even appearing on the stage.

787
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,587
他们还举行了三场独幕戏
And they gave three one-act plays.

788
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,790
其中一个话剧是由…
One of them was a play by...

789
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:42,430
我一直认为是 约翰・雷德和路易丝・拜伦扮演的
I always thought it was by John Reed and Louise Bryant.

790
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,401
应该就是由她演的
But I see it's by her.

791
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,532
他们都在剧中
They were in it.

792
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,441
那出话剧很糟糕 而他们表现得更糟糕
The play was terrible, and they were worse.

793
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,971
当然，尤金・奥尼尔是以诗歌着称的
And of course, Gene O'Neill was known as the poet,

794
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,272
不过我喜欢他的话剧 胜过他的诗歌
but I liked his plays better than his poetry.

795
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,011
你怎样才能明白？
Will you never understand?

796
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,714
你是不是愚笨到不明白我的意思？
Are you so stupid that you do not know what I mean?

797
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,485
我把自己献给你
I am offering myself to you.

798
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,548
我跪在你的面前
I am kneeling before you.

799
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,888
我承诺过把身体献给你
I have promised you my body,

800
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,227
男人们都为之迷倒的身体
my body that men have found so beautiful.

801
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:12,099
我承诺过要爱你，黑人水手
I have promised to love you, a negro sailor!

802
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,264
告诉他们，不要站在月亮后面
Tell them not to stand behind the moon.

803
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,468
不要站在月亮后面
Don't stand behind the moon.

804
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,438
-后面？ -你能退后一点吗？
- Back? - Can you step back a little bit?

805
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,172
因为月亮
'Cause of the moon.

806
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,805
这是月亮
This is the moon here.

807
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,311
-这边？ -是的
- This way? - Yes.

808
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,539
从“我讨厌大海”那段开始
Take it from "I hate the sea."

809
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,811
你怎样才能明白？
Will you never understand?

810
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,945
你是不是愚笨到不明白我的意思？
Are you so stupid that you don't know what I mean?

811
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,784
我把自己献给你
I'm offering myself to you.

812
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,222
我跪在你的面前
I'm kneeling before you.

813
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,160
有多少男人曾经拜倒在我的面前
I... I, who have had so many men kneel before me,

814
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,128
我把我的身体献给你
I'm offering you my body,

815
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,120
男人们都为之迷倒的身体
my body that men have found so beautiful.

816
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,827
我承诺过要爱你
I have promised to love you.

817
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,825
黑人水手
You, a negro sailor.

818
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,431
你让我等待 这难道不是奇耻大辱吗？
Is that not humiliation enough that you must keep me waiting so?

819
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,701
回答我，请回答我！
Answer me, please! Answer me.

820
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,733
请把水给我好吗？
Will you give me that water?

821
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,047
我没有水
I have no water.

822
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,647
老泰迪想打这场战争，对吗？
Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?

823
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,313
不知道人们要多久才会 明白他是个疯子
I wonder how long it'll take the public to find out he's a maniac.

824
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:07,050
泰迪・罗斯福有狂犬病 全体军事训练
Teddy Roosevelt has rabies. Universal military training.

825
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,784
杰克，你的二次演讲完了
Jack, your second speech is out.

826
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,657
其中最讽刺的就是穷人们都爱戴他
And the ironic part of it is that poor people, they love him.

827
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,618
他们当然爱 他们会再次把他拥上圣胡安山
Sure, they do. They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.

828
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,564
你不能碰那个兔装，那是租来的
You can't touch the bunny suit. It's rented.

829
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:17,965
你有看过大会上那篇文章吗？
Did you read the piece on the convention?

830
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,435
如果左派不防卫威尔逊 休斯总统就遭殃了
If the left doesn't defend Wilson, we're gonna get President Hughes.

831
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,664
我们应该去圣路易斯吗？
Think we ought to go to St. Louis?

832
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,536
我不去圣路易斯保护威尔逊
I am not going to St. Louis to defend Wilson.

833
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,597
-我认为我们应该去 -为什么？这样做有什么好处吗？
- I think we should. - Why? What good would it do?

834
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,575
我不知道 如果你认为休斯不会在几个月内…
I don't know, if you don't think Hughes would have us

835
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,738
让我们卷入战火，那就没任何好处
in a war in a few months, it wouldn't do any good at all.

836
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,441
威尔逊把我们远远地排斥在外
Wilson's kept us out so far.

837
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:33,846
雷德认为自己是个好诗人
Reed thought that he was a good poet.

838
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,783
他是个糟糕的诗人
He was a terrible poet.

839
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,217
他认为自己可以写出优秀的小说
He thought that he could write good novels.

840
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,516
短篇小说
Short stories.

841
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,391
当然，他是个诗人
Of course, he was a poet.

842
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:44,951
但不是个伟大的诗人
And not a great poet,

843
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,820
有些诗还是不错的
but some of it was very fine.

844
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,056
但作为一个记者 杰克・雷德远远胜过他们
But, as a journalist, Jack Reed topped them all.

845
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,629
-把这个往上拉 -杰克
- Look. Pull this up. - Hey, Jack.

846
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,502
瞧见没？不错吧
See? That's good.

847
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,400
杰克，你的车来了
Jack, your ride's here.

848
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,973
-对不起，我在外面等 -好的
- Excuse me. I'll wait outside. - Okay. Okay.

849
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:06,541
-明白我的意思吗？如果… -杰克，出租车在等着呢
- Do you see what I mean? If one... - Jack, the taxi's waiting.

850
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,021
好吧，我该走了
Yeah, I got to run.

851
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,416
再见，亲爱的
Bye, honey.

852
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,594
杰克・雷德想挑起矛盾
Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble,

853
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,002
他想给资产阶级带来麻烦
he wanted to stir up trouble for the capitalists.

854
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,463
他也想唤醒工人大众…
And he also wanted to arouse the working masses

855
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,168
联合起来争取一些实效
to the necessity of some kind of effective united action.

856
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:41,205
换句话说，我当他是个爱管闲事的人
In other words, I am accusing him of either being a busybody

857
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:45,241
或者说是一个胆小鬼
or of being a fraidy-cat,

858
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,620
不想面对自己的未来
not wanting to face things of his own nature.

859
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,454
亲爱的路易丝 圣路易斯现在很热，到处是民主党员
Dear Louise, St. Louis is very hot and very crowded with Democrats,

860
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:58,422
大家都很开心，戴着纸帽
all having a wonderful time and wearing little paper hats

861
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,367
和预料中威尔逊的任命一样
in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.

862
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,632
我希望这是因为…
I'd like to think it's because

863
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,661
他不想让美国卷入战争
he doesn't want the United States to go into the war,

864
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,606
但谁知道民主党人在想什么呢？
but who knows the mind of a Democrat?

865
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,599
对了，我已经决定摒弃那首百合诗
By the way, I've decided to throw out the poem on white lilies.

866
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,136
诗中的压韵错误了
The rhyming scheme was wrong.

867
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,341
等我回来再重写
Maybe when I get back I can start it again.

868
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,975
政治严重影响了诗歌创作
Politics sure plays hell with your poetry.

869
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,850
我一直都很想见到你，这是最迫切的
I keep thinking I see you. It's the damnedest thing.

870
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,446
我想你，亲爱的 想念一起在沙滩上漫步
I miss you, honey. I miss walking on the beach.

871
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,062
-你好 -威士忌在哪？
- Hello. - Where's the whiskey?

872
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,073
要杯子吗？
Would you like a glass?

873
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,715
别想了
Don't try and decide.

874
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:30,858
我给你拿
I'll get you one.

875
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,825
我喜欢你的戏
I like your play.

876
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,666
我好想演法官的角色
I only hope I can do the part justice.

877
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,864
我觉得你设计的台词太精彩了 我很喜欢…
I think your dialogue is beautiful. I really do, I love it...

878
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,136
那你为何不站在台上好好演…
Then why the hell don't you just stand still and say it

879
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,337
为何在舞台上梦游？
instead of wandering all over the stage?

880
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,744
你应该寻找你的灵魂 而不是找烟灰缸
You're supposed to be looking for your soul, not an ashtray.

881
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,112
你不希望我在彩排时抽烟吗？
Would you rather I didn't smoke during rehearsals?

882
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,811
我宁愿看到你引火烧身…
I'd rather you went up in flames than put out your cigarette

883
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,807
而不是独角戏演到一半时去抽烟
in the middle of a monologue about birth.

884
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:57,910
对不起，你批评得对
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.

885
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,819
你这样做让我想取消整个制作
It makes me wanna cancel the whole production.

886
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,620
我不会再犯错误了，对不起
I won't do it again. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

887
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,926
杯子你留着，我拿酒瓶喝
You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.

888
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,998
你要走了吗？
Are you leaving?

889
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,098
给我杯子
Give me your glass.

890
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:31,819
你紧张了？
Are you nervous?

891
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:36,157
-还是手颤？ -你为何不和杰克去芝加哥？
- Or is that a tremor? - Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?

892
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:38,991
为什么要去？ 他有他的事，我有我的事
Why should I be? He has his things, I have mine.

893
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,268
-什么事？ -什么？
- What are they? - What?

894
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:00,509
你有什么事？
The things that you have that are yours.

895
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,146
到底什么事？
What are they?

896
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,880
我的工作
My work, for one.

897
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,551
他是个工作狂，是不是？
He's a real mean son of a bitch, isn't he?

898
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,592
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

899
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,994
把你留下来做自己的事
Leaving you alone with your work.

900
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,463
-你以为我介意吗？ -你应该介意
- You think I mind? - You should.

901
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,802
有一件事不能留下单独做
It's the one thing we mustn't be left alone with.

902
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,396
-你也许会这样认为，但我不会 -好
- You may feel that way, I don't. - Good.

903
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,467
别让那些乡村激进分子 影响了你的角色
Don't let those village radicals keep you from being what you should be.

904
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,900
什么角色？
What do you think I should be?

905
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,539
众人关注的焦点
The center of attention.

906
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,143
我想你身边一定不少女强人吧
Well, you must have been with some very competitive women.

907
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,683
是占有欲强的女人
Let's just say possessive.

908
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,518
占有欲强？那就另当别论了
Possessive? That's something else.

909
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,282
这是浪费光阴
It's a waste of time.

910
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,222
我不是
I'm not.

911
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,390
杰克也不是
Neither is Jack, for that matter.

912
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,023
我知道，你和杰克各有所爱
Oh, yes. I know. You and Jack have your own things.

913
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,060
他有自由做自己想做的事 我也是一样
He has the freedom to do the things that he wants to and so do I.

914
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:57,129
如果有谁害怕那种自由…
And I think anyone who's afraid of that kind of freedom

915
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,300
其实他害怕的是空虚
is really only afraid of his own emptiness.

916
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,743
原来你一直在给我下套
Are you making this up as you go along?

917
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,310
请你走吧
I'd like you to go.

918
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,910
为什么？
Why?

919
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,418
因为我不想屈尊就俯
Because I don't want to be patronized.

920
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,547
如果你不相信相互独立性 博爱和尊重…
I'm sorry if you don't believe in mutual independence

921
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,988
那么对不起了
and free love and respect.

922
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:18,950
别对我鼓吹乡村激进分子的 社会主义理论
Don't give me a lot of parlor socialism that you learned in the Village.

923
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:24,123
如果你是我的，我不会让别人分享你
If you were mine, I wouldn't share you with anybody or anything.

924
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,463
只有你和我，你会是中心所在
It'd be just you and me. You'd be at the center of it all.

925
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,135
撇下你让你独自工作…
You know, it would feel lot more like love

926
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,543
这不叫爱情
than being left alone with your work.

927
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:51,420
-希望我没有触怒你 -没有，我感谢都来不及
- I hope I haven't upset you. - Not at all. I'm grateful.

928
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,453
但是好像你要找的东西…
But you seem to be looking for something much more serious

929
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,522
比我所想的要严肃多了
than what I had in mind.

930
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:59,229
-比你想的严肃多了？ -是的
- Than what you had in mind? - Yes.

931
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:03,663
杰克和我都能够…
You see, Jack and I are both perfectly capable

932
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,835
坚持自己的信念
of living with our beliefs.

933
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:10,168
但我认为像你这样浪漫的人 会被他们的信仰摧毁
But I think someone as romantic as you would be destroyed by them.

934
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:14,905
我可不想看到这种事发生 杰克会很担心的
And I don't want that to happen. It would upset Jack too much.

935
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:39,832
“你不能来我的院子玩耍”
You can't come and play in my yard

936
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:43,537
“我再也不爱你了”
I don't love you anymore

937
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:47,012
“你看到我会难过的”
You'll be sorry when you see me

938
00:49:47,953 --> 00:49:50,342
“关闭我的地窖门”
Sliding down my cellar door

939
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,684
“你不能对着我的雨水桶发牢骚”
You can't holler down my rain barrel

940
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:58,119
“你不能爬我的苹果树”
You can't climb my apple tree

941
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:02,790
“我不想在你的院子里玩耍”
I don't want to play in your yard

942
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:06,263
“因为你对我不好”
If you can't be good to me

943
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:42,705
“我不想在你的院子里玩耍”
I don't want to play in your yard

944
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:45,402
“我再也不喜欢你了”
I don't like you anymore

945
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,308
“你看到我会难过的”
You'll be sorry when you see me

946
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:51,313
“关闭我的地窖门”
Sliding down our cellar door

947
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:55,112
“你不能对着我的雨水桶发牢骚”
You can't holler down our rain barrel

948
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:59,034
“你不能爬我的苹果树”
You can't climb our apple tree

949
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,256
“我不想在你的院子里玩耍”
I don't want to play in your yard

950
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:05,421
“因为你对我不好”
If you won't be good to me

951
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:10,174
太美妙了！
Wonderful!

952
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:28,943
弗洛伊德，我期待已久了
Floyd, I've been waiting for this for weeks.

953
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:53,571
拿出点感觉来
Tap your sensuality.

954
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:11,519
-美妙的谢幕 -太棒了
- Wonderful close. - Extraordinary.

955
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,524
非常好，太棒了
Very good. Excellent.

956
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,790
-弗洛伊德，你没听过这首歌吧？ -麦斯，你呢？
- Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it? - Max, what about you?

957
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:19,887
-好了，下一个到谁？ -我刚朗诵完
- Okay. Who's next? - I just recited

958
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:21,271
我新作的三分之二
two-thirds of my new play.

959
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:23,601
你们都说它写得很离奇
You said it was a work of uncanny perception.

960
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,332
是吗？我们忘得真快
Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.

961
00:52:43,722 --> 00:52:45,747
-嗨 -杰克，快进来
- Well! - Jack. Come in.

962
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:47,976
前锋标兵回来了
News from the front.

963
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:49,102
-你好，杰克 -你好，杰克
- Hello, Jack. - Hello, Jack.

964
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:50,693
-嗨，杰克 -旅途如何？
- Hi, Jack. - How was the trip?

965
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:54,430
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

966
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:56,196
-下一个到谁？ -没人了
- Who's next? - Nobody's next.

967
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:58,837
让尤金跳舞吧
Let's have a dance out of Gene.

968
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:01,750
杰克，回来得正好 能看到奥尼尔跳舞
Jack, you're just in time to see O'Neill dance.

969
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,858
给我们跳段爱尔兰舞吧，尤金
Okay. Do something Irish. Come on, Gene.

970
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,567
来一段，尤金
Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.

971
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,010
-跳啊，尤金 -再朗诵你的新作
- Yeah. Go ahead Gene. - Recite something from your new play.

972
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:10,444
哈奇说新作很棒
Hutch says it's wonderful.

973
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:13,073
说说大会的情况吧，杰克 威尔逊的演讲怎样？
Tell us about the convention, Jack. How was Wilson's speech?

974
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:15,977
别提演讲了，说说他的打扮吧
Never mind the speech. What was he wearing?

975
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,901
-威尔逊怎样了？ -对，他怎样？
- What about Wilson? - Yeah. What about Wilson?

976
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:26,091
我不觉得有何理由相信 他会采取什么措施
Oh, I don't think there's any reason to believe that Wilson's gonna do anything

977
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:30,018
他只会为维护统治阶级的利益而战
other than support the interest of the ruling class and take us into the war.

978
00:53:30,135 --> 00:53:33,446
但只要他反战，我们就该支持他
But as long as he says he's against it, then I think we have to support him.

979
00:53:33,551 --> 00:53:36,690
至少这几个月内 他不会违背竞选承诺…
Because he'll have to make good on that campaign promise

980
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:38,800
那样一来我们就有时间…
for at least a few months and that might give us time

981
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:40,432
巩固反战联盟
to strengthen the anti-war coalition.

982
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:43,498
但是街上的战前气氛越来越浓了
But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in the streets now than there was before...

983
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:01,798
还要喝酒吗，尤金？
You want another drink, Gene?

984
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:07,967
不喝了
I guess not.

985
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:25,874
-晚安 -晚安
- Good night. - Night.

986
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:29,203
晚安
Good night.

987
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:40,490
要不要来杯冰柠檬茶？
Would you like some cold tea with lemon?

988
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:41,914
不了，谢谢
No, thanks.

989
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:44,815
不喝我喝
Well, I'll have some, anyway.

990
00:54:57,971 --> 00:55:00,254
-这是什么？ -一首诗
- What's this? - A poem.

991
00:55:01,676 --> 00:55:02,996
可以看看吗？
May I read it?

992
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,359
我还没写完
I didn't finish it.

993
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:26,747
写完它
Finish it.

994
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:34,354
写完它？
Finish it?

995
00:55:38,263 --> 00:55:41,754
如果我是个诗人，你会开心吗？
Would that make you happy? If I were a poet?

996
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:45,839
开心
I'm happy.

997
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,753
-杰克 -快去睡觉吧
- Jack. - Why don't you get some sleep?

998
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,162
杰克
Jack.

999
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:05,903
有些事我得告诉你
There's something that I have to tell you.

1000
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,021
-你不用说了 -不用？
- You don't have to tell me anything. - No?

1001
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:11,072
不用
No.

1002
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:22,567
你想结婚吗？
You want to get married?

1003
00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:56,053
好了，进来，我看看…
Okay. There we go. I'll see...

1004
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:03,986
-当心点 -还有两个呢
- Oh, careful there. Careful. - There's two more to come.

1005
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,672
两个？不，应该有三个
Two? No, there should be three.

1006
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:11,165
1916年，克洛顿哈森

1007
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:14,086
对不起，我真不该唠叨个不停
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry to hover like this.

1008
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:15,668
我不是否定你们的工作
It's not that you're not doing a wonderful job.

1009
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:18,886
只是我非常关心那只箱子
It's just that I'm very concerned about this one particular box.

1010
00:57:21,262 --> 00:57:23,319
-这里，不对 -我来拿
- Here. No. No. - I'll take it.

1011
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,426
威士忌在哪？
Where's the whiskey?

1012
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:51,257
-夫人，这个放哪？ -放那边吧
- Lady, where do you want this? - Oh, just put it over there.

1013
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,095
可以了，谢谢
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1014
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:56,691
对
Yeah.

1015
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:01,005
-这里有喝的吗？ -喝的？
- Anything to drink in there? - Drink?

1016
00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:04,082
给你们，谢谢，非常感谢…
Oh, here. Thanks. Thank you very much. I...

1017
00:58:04,153 --> 00:58:06,283
-谢谢 -谢谢
- Thank you. Good. - Thank you.

1018
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:18,887
我找找看，找到了
Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.

1019
00:58:21,805 --> 00:58:24,608
-尤金？ -没有杯子吗？
- Gene? - No glass?

1020
00:58:24,746 --> 00:58:26,579
我找找看
Oh. Let's see.

1021
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:31,193
我真应该给东西贴上标签
Well, I guess I should have labeled these, shouldn't I have?

1022
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,034
不，不是这个
No. No, that isn't the right one.

1023
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,181
试试这个
Try this one.

1024
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,715
你现在在忙什么，尤金？
Well, what are you working on, Gene?

1025
00:58:41,228 --> 00:58:43,096
暂时在拍苏格兰舞剧
At the moment, Scotch.

1026
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,933
我找到个茶杯，茶杯可以吗？
I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?

1027
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,538
-酒杯好点 -酒杯
- I'd prefer a glass. - A glass.

1028
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:54,672
你竟然不辞而别
You know, you left without saying goodbye.

1029
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,956
这可不像你的作风 一点不像我心目中的你
That's not like you, not that I have slightest idea what you're like.

1030
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,953
找到了，来
Success at last. See, a... Here we go.

1031
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:16,209
你倒酒的水平看来下降了
Your skill as a bartender seems to have deteriorated.

1032
00:59:16,314 --> 00:59:19,305
-你紧张了？ -不，只是…
- Are you nervous? - Yes. No. I'm...

1033
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,440
为什么紧张呢？ 上帝，这里闻起来像个酒吧
Why should I be nervous? My God, it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.

1034
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:40,722
-这是什么？ -一首倾诉我爱你的诗
- What is it? - It's a poem telling you that I love you.

1035
00:59:41,738 --> 00:59:44,968
倾诉我不会霸占和嫉妒你的诗
And that I won't be possessive and I won't be jealous.

1036
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:49,000
你想和谁上床就上床 和谁过就和谁过
And you can sleep with whoever you want, live with whoever you want.

1037
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:53,372
我会照你说的做 我真想杀了你，但我办不到
I'll do anything that you say. I'd like to kill you, but I can't.

1038
00:59:55,253 --> 00:59:57,675
你可以为所欲为…
So you can do whatever you want to,

1039
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,573
就是不能见我
except not see me.

1040
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,573
或者在演独角戏期间抽烟
Or smoke during the monologue.

1041
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:12,939
尤金，杰克和我都没对外宣布…
Gene, Jack and I, we haven't told anyone yet

1042
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:15,418
我们觉得太尴尬了
because we were too embarrassed.

1043
01:00:16,454 --> 01:00:17,614
可是…
But

1044
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:20,911
我们结婚了
we're married.

1045
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:23,292
杰克和我结婚了
Jack and I got married.

1046
01:00:26,974 --> 01:00:30,498
-真是尴尬 -是的
- That is embarrassing. - Yes. Isn't it?

1047
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:33,133
虽然感觉很蠢，但是我们想结婚
We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.

1048
01:00:33,245 --> 01:00:35,438
一切都会好的，我们会齐心协力
And it's gonna be good. We're gonna work together.

1049
01:00:35,547 --> 01:00:37,274
一起渡过我们的时光
We're gonna spend all our time together.

1050
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:39,038
所以我们租下了这所房子
That's why we took a lease on this place,

1051
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:40,738
这样我们就不用回城里住了
so we wouldn't have to go back to the city.

1052
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:42,212
这是否意味着我们要欺骗感情？
Does this mean that we have to cheat?

1053
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:44,270
或者是自由和独立的婚姻？
Or is this a free and independent marriage?

1054
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:46,714
-尤金 -你这个波特兰臭婊子
- Gene. - You're a lying Irish whore from Portland

1055
01:00:46,819 --> 01:00:49,547
竟然利用我，让杰克娶你
and you used me to get Jack Reed to marry you.

1056
01:00:49,986 --> 01:00:51,418
不，我没有
No, I didn't.

1057
01:00:52,155 --> 01:00:54,246
我只想和你做普通朋友，尤金
I just want us to be friends, Gene.

1058
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:57,083
真是高尚，这种角色适合你，对吗？
Oh, how genteel. That would be a good role for you, wouldn't it?

1059
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:59,680
“路易丝与杰克和尤金”
"There's Louise with Jack and Gene.

1060
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:02,750
“尤金为她而疯狂，但杰克不知道”
"He's crazy about her, but Jack doesn't know.

1061
01:01:02,861 --> 01:01:07,487
“可怜的杰克和可怜的尤金为她心碎”
"Poor Jack. Poor Gene. What a heartbreaker she is."

1062
01:01:12,765 --> 01:01:15,220
你真是会伤男人的心，路易丝
What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.

1063
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:18,259
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm...

1064
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:22,171
他在哪？
Where is he?

1065
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,042
华盛顿
Washington.

1066
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:27,806
雷德太太
Well, Mrs. Reed,

1067
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:32,680
我还是照你说的做，你想让我干什么？
I'll do whatever you say. What do you want me to do?

1068
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,357
祝福我们
Wish us well?

1069
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,866
我祝福…
I wish you well.

1070
01:01:52,014 --> 01:01:53,447
你和杰克
You and Jack.

1071
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:24,179
《草叶集》

1072
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:32,491
杰克！
Jack!

1073
01:02:34,403 --> 01:02:35,563
上帝
Oh, God.

1074
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:41,338
这段时期，我不知道她是否…
I'm not sure whether she had an affair

1075
01:02:41,981 --> 01:02:44,643
和尤金・奥尼尔有私情
with Eugene O'Neill or not during this time.

1076
01:02:45,218 --> 01:02:47,516
没有人知道
And nobody seemed to know. Or...

1077
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:50,583
反正这是他们自己的事
It was nobody's business, anyway, so...

1078
01:02:51,492 --> 01:02:53,949
我不清楚当时的情况是怎样
I don't know what that situation was.

1079
01:02:54,164 --> 01:02:57,622
据说她与雷德和奥尼尔…
The report was that she and Reed and O'Neill

1080
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,928
是三角恋
had a mnage ?trois.

1081
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:06,269
杰克，这是…
Jack, what... What is...

1082
01:03:21,399 --> 01:03:23,094
天哪！
Oh, God! I swear...

1083
01:03:23,535 --> 01:03:26,424
我们热爱美国！
...that we love America!

1084
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:30,062
热爱她的大山和森林…
We love her mountains, her forests...

1085
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:32,441
法国军队发生了叛乱
There were mutinies in the French army,

1086
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:35,435
前线也发生多起叛变
there were mutinies in various parts of the front.

1087
01:03:35,518 --> 01:03:39,579
然后在1917年，装备简陋的军队
And then, in 1917, the troops, poorly armed,

1088
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:43,253
缺衣少食地回到了俄国…
poorly equipped, poorly clothed, went back to Russia

1089
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:44,758
想与沙皇谈判
to talk it out with the czar.

1090
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,524
当他们回到俄国时，沙皇下台了
And when they got through, there wasn't any czar.

1091
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:48,530
俄国大革命
Revolution in Russia.

1092
01:03:48,835 --> 01:03:51,724
那是1917年的春天
This was the spring of 1917.

1093
01:03:52,641 --> 01:03:54,506
我好兴奋
And I became so excited

1094
01:03:54,977 --> 01:03:58,469
在长凳上欢呼雀跃
that I zigzag-jumped the benches

1095
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:01,310
还冲出了公园
as we walked out of the park.

1096
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,215
年轻的我当时高兴极了
Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.

1097
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:06,689
人民取得了革命胜利
Revolution, the people take over,

1098
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,891
推翻了沙皇！
down with the czar!

1099
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:11,991
我自然感到高兴
Naturally, I was happy.

1100
01:04:55,323 --> 01:04:58,315
你是不是把政治模糊化了？
Well, haven't you made the politics a little nebulous here?

1101
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,350
-模糊化？ -就是不清晰
- What do you mean "nebulous"? - Unclear...

1102
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,318
-怎样才叫清晰？ -我觉得不清晰
- How can you say they're unclear? - Well, they're unclear to me. I...

1103
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:04,695
为何我一定要…
Why am I necessarily attempting

1104
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:06,997
尝试去定义特定人群的政见呢？
to define the politics of a specific group of people?

1105
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:10,529
这又不是我说的，这太过度单纯化了
It isn't what I said. I think it's a vast oversimplification.

1106
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:14,602
个人观点而已
Oh, it's just an opinion.

1107
01:05:18,187 --> 01:05:20,644
要是你复印下来…
You know, if you made carbons of these,

1108
01:05:20,757 --> 01:05:22,884
我就把它们带上火车
I could take them on the train with me.

1109
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:25,784
1916年，威尔逊因反战…
Wilson, of course, was elected on the platform of

1110
01:05:25,898 --> 01:05:28,526
而获得当选
"Keep us out of war" in 1916.

1111
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:32,858
但是1917年，威尔逊竟出尔反尔
But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself

1112
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,471
对德宣战
and declared war against Germany.

1113
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:39,978
当时他的使命是保全世界民主
The mission at that time was to make the world safe for democracy.

1114
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:42,013
雷德说过…
Reed said,

1115
01:05:43,588 --> 01:05:48,287
这是为民主而战吗？那么民主何在？
"This is a war for democracy? Where is the goddamn democracy?"

1116
01:05:48,895 --> 01:05:53,650
要是人类真的不想战争 战争早就停止了
If men really disapproved of war, dear, we'd have stopped wars years ago.

1117
01:05:55,102 --> 01:05:57,263
人类喜欢战争，一向如此
Men like wars. Always have.

1118
01:05:58,806 --> 01:06:01,866
于是人们穿上军装奔赴战场
So they all went and got little uniforms, went to war.

1119
01:06:02,344 --> 01:06:04,835
-祖国参战了！ -是的
- My country is at war! - Yes.

1120
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:08,938
所以今天，我也参战了！
And so today, I, too, am at war!

1121
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,818
我叫杰克・雷德，来自纽约
My name is Jack Reed, I'm from New York.

1122
01:06:14,225 --> 01:06:17,149
这不是我想要的战争 我才不会参战！
This is not my war, and I'm not gonna have anything to do with it!

1123
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,793
好了…
All right. All right.

1124
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:20,321
好了，大家
All right, folks.

1125
01:06:20,465 --> 01:06:22,922
当然当时很多人都有反战情绪
There was a lot of anti-war feeling, of course.

1126
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:26,459
但我们没有一个反对战争 没有一个是真心反战的
We had no one against the war. There wasn't a soul against the war.

1127
01:06:27,173 --> 01:06:31,098
我并非说我们要批评工人的不觉悟
Well, I'm not talking about saying it to the workers any other way.

1128
01:06:31,678 --> 01:06:34,238
而是我们要怎样打动他们？
How do we move them?

1129
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:36,270
对，我们如何组织他们？
Right. How do we organize them?

1130
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:38,579
社会党…
The Socialist Party...

1131
01:06:42,157 --> 01:06:44,387
美国社会党不值得一屑
The Socialist Party of America is nothing to sneeze at.

1132
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:47,223
你们以为社会党会当政吗？
You think the Socialist Party is going to take a position?

1133
01:06:47,364 --> 01:06:48,820
你们是赤色分子吧？
You boys are Reds, aren't you?

1134
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:52,628
社会党没有用的，杰克，对吗？
The Socialist Party is useless. Jack, is that right?

1135
01:06:52,836 --> 01:06:54,963
这是事实…杰克？
Now, that's the truth. Jack?

1136
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:56,397
美国参战了
The United States is at war.

1137
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:58,270
你的朋友在跟你说呢
Your friends are talking to you.

1138
01:06:58,376 --> 01:07:01,766
如果全世界的工人联合起来 他们就可以阻止战争…
If the workers of the world act together, they can stop the war. And I'm not...

1139
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,609
这家伙连撒出来的尿都是红的
This one even pisses red.

1140
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:08,179
你满世界乱跑，肾脏不病发才怪
You ran around saving the world until your kidney acted up again.

1141
01:07:08,288 --> 01:07:09,482
真是“聪明”
Very intelligent.

1142
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:11,511
四处跑去演讲…
And you're gonna keep running around making speeches

1143
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,354
最后却回到了医院里
until you wind up in the hospital. Brilliant.

1144
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,257
再下去你就会失去肾脏 那就彻底完了
And then, you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.

1145
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:17,660
哈瑞，政府给你多少好处 让你叫我闭嘴？
Harry, how much is the government paying you to keep me quiet?

1146
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:18,993
随你怎么说
- Very funny. Keep laughing. - Yeah.

1147
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:21,295
很疼，是吧？
That hurt, didn't it?

1148
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,496
我老实告诉你吧…
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.

1149
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,336
你不能再这样继续下去了
You're not gonna be able to keep doing what you've been doing.

1150
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,365
你的病情非常严重，会性命不保的
This is a serious condition. It could kill you.

1151
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:32,779
哈瑞，我想知道…
Harry, look, I want to know if...

1152
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:36,382
这会影响我要孩子吗？
Could this thing interfere with having children?

1153
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:40,378
-当然会，你死了还怎么做爱？ -严肃点，哈瑞
- Yes. You cannot have sex if you die. - No, come on, Harry. Seriously.

1154
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,222
你现在想要孩子？
Are you thinking about having children?

1155
01:07:44,964 --> 01:07:47,956
现在不要，但是我想知道…
Not at the moment, but I want to be able to...

1156
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:52,161
路易丝谈起要孩子的事了？
Is Louise talking about it?

1157
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,362
没有
No.

1158
01:07:54,775 --> 01:07:56,640
她嘴上不说…
Well, just because she isn't talking about it

1159
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,268
并不代表她心里不想
it doesn't mean she isn't thinking about it.

1160
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:00,677
别担心，要孩子和肾脏无关
Don't worry. You don't make babies with your kidneys.

1161
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:02,545
我要你回家养病
Look, I'm gonna send you home to Louise.

1162
01:08:02,618 --> 01:08:04,279
躺在床上，让她照顾你
Tell her to keep you there, put you in bed,

1163
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:06,810
给你吃药，我会给你药方的
give you lots of liquids. I'm gonna write it all down.

1164
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:10,316
路易丝并不知道我的病情 我不想让她担心
Look, Louise doesn't know about this. And I don't want her to, okay?

1165
01:08:10,428 --> 01:08:12,123
-好 -你能给我帐单吗？
- Fine. - So, can you give me my bill here?

1166
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:15,028
-我不想把帐单寄回家 -你有钱吗？
- I don't want it sent to the house. - Do you have any money?

1167
01:08:18,904 --> 01:08:19,928
现在没有
Not at the moment.

1168
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:22,495
那你怎么买单？回家吧
Then why the hell should I give you a bill? Go home.

1169
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:26,370
我坚信社会主义与和平是分不开的
It is my belief that socialism and peace are inseparable.

1170
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:30,436
我再次重申，社会党坚决反对…
And I reiterate that the Socialist Party will stand firmly behind

1171
01:08:30,551 --> 01:08:33,816
美国参与这场战争！
its resolution to oppose American involvement in this war!

1172
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:36,288
主席先生，我是波士顿的代表 路易斯・佛拉纳
Mr. Chairman, Louis Fraina, Local Boston.

1173
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:38,918
主席团承认波士顿的代表
The chair recognizes the delegate from Boston.

1174
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:40,053
我还是想知道…
And I still want to know

1175
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,961
我们会采取什么具体的行动反战
what specific action we are going to take against the war.

1176
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:44,590
您的解决方法固然好
Your resolution is all very nice,

1177
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:47,535
但是它能救命吗？我认为不能
but will it stop even one boy from being killed? I don't think so.

1178
01:08:47,638 --> 01:08:49,902
…被污蔑为不爱国的表现
...stigmatized as unpatriotic.

1179
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:52,268
摆在我们面前的任务非常艰巨
The task that confronts us is difficult.

1180
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:54,140
希望我们可以正确对待
Let us hope that we can handle it properly.

1181
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,372
什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

1182
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,640
愚蠢！
Stupid!

1183
01:08:57,116 --> 01:09:01,007
我想知道社会党是否会招兵买马
I'd like to know if the Socialist Party is gonna fight conscription or not.

1184
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,975
-我也想知道 -请这位代表自报家门
- That's what I'd like to know. - Will the delegate identify himself?

1185
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:06,548
我不是代表，主席先生 我叫约翰・雷德
I am not a delegate, Mr. Chairman. My name is John Reed,

1186
01:09:06,694 --> 01:09:08,127
是《大众》杂志的记者
I write for the magazine The Masses,

1187
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:11,255
我想知道社会党是否会 组织示威游行…
and I want to know if the Socialist Party is gonna organize demonstrations...

1188
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:13,391
抱歉，雷德先生 您在这里没有发言权
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed. You have no credentials here.

1189
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:16,562
这里只有代表能发言，记者不能
Now, this floor is reserved for delegates, not journalists.

1190
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:18,401
主席先生，社会党是否已准备好…
Mr. Chairman, is the Socialist Party prepared

1191
01:09:18,507 --> 01:09:20,168
-上台当政？ -闭嘴！
- to take a position on the draft or not? - Hey, shut up!

1192
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:22,575
抱歉，雷德先生，您没有发言权
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed. You have no credentials.

1193
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:23,805
让他说完
Let him speak, will you?

1194
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:26,337
雷德先生，你想参与政党事务是吗？
Mr. Reed, you're getting into party politics, eh?

1195
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,749
我只是想当好一名记者 主席先生…
I'm just trying to be a journalist. Mr. Chairman...

1196
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:32,016
托洛茨基也是这样 看看俄国发生的大事吧
So is Trotsky. Let us see what happens in Russia.

1197
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:35,820
你为何不加入社会党？ 我们需要像你这样的英才
Why don't you join the Socialist Party? We need good people like you.

1198
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:37,917
俄国发生了翻天覆地的变化
Big things are happening in Russia.

1199
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:41,522
骇人听闻的是 社会党却支持血雨腥风
As appalling as it may seem to see socialists supporting bloodshed,

1200
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:44,159
对于战争期间支持政府…
I can understand the necessity of supporting one's government

1201
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,535
我能理解其必要性
during times of war.

1202
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:48,403
我们所面临的任务异常艰巨！
The task that confronts us is a giant!

1203
01:09:48,844 --> 01:09:51,904
我们必须继续反战！
In that, we must continue our opposition!

1204
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:09,253
-我们得给狗起个名字 -它有名字
- We have to give this dog a name. - Well, she has a name.

1205
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:11,997
它的名字怎么了？
What's the matter with her name?

1206
01:10:12,468 --> 01:10:15,664
-家里的东西我都找不到 -我可不想一直叫狗狗
- I can't find anything in this house. - I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."

1207
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:18,001
要是它是小孩，你总不能叫它“人”吧？
I suppose if she were a baby, you'd wanna call her "Person."

1208
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:19,970
不是，那就叫它杰克吧
Not really. I think I might wanna call her "Jack."

1209
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:21,473
不好
No. No. Bad.

1210
01:10:21,576 --> 01:10:23,167
我老是找不到东西
See, now this is why I can't find anything.

1211
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,336
你把东西到处乱放
You put things anywhere.

1212
01:10:24,446 --> 01:10:25,844
狗狗！
Dog! Dog!

1213
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,877
它还没有被驯化
She's still not housebroken.

1214
01:10:27,983 --> 01:10:30,371
要是它趴下，你得把它拉开
You got to grab her when she squats like that,

1215
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:33,111
把它拉出去，没错
and then take her outside. That's right.

1216
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,983
等它出去之后，你得给它奖品
And then when she goes, you've got to give her a reward.

1217
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:37,984
好吧，坐好，狗狗
All right. Now, stay, Dog.

1218
01:10:38,124 --> 01:10:40,079
晚餐吃大蒜吗，亲爱的？
Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?

1219
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,214
不…
No, no, no.

1220
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,193
怎么了？我放的大蒜太多了吗？
Why? Why, do you think I'm using too much garlic?

1221
01:10:52,904 --> 01:10:55,292
我觉得沙司里边应该放一点
I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.

1222
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:57,360
我对大蒜并不反感
Garlic doesn't bother me.

1223
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:12,943
-那是尤金的信 -对不起，我不是有意的
- That's from Gene. - Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.

1224
01:11:13,887 --> 01:11:15,649
我都没反应过来是什么
I didn't realize what it was.

1225
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:26,125
他去年10月给的我 之后就没见面了
He gave it to me in October. I haven't seen him since.

1226
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:27,959
-你不用解释 -我不是解释
- You don't have to explain. - I'm not explaining.

1227
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:30,454
-我只是想告诉你这已经结束了 -路易丝
- I'm just telling you it's over. - Louise, look.

1228
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:32,262
我不指望你什么事都告诉我
I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.

1229
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:34,359
如果要跟我说，就请你说实话
What about if you tell me something, just tell me the truth?

1230
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:36,267
-杰克，我已经不和他见面了 -别这样，路易丝
- Jack, I haven't seen him. - Don't do that, Louise.

1231
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:39,295
别跟我说尤金六七个月前给了你 一封情书之后…
Don't tell me that Gene gave you a love poem six or seven months ago,

1232
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:41,399
你就一直没有和他见面
but you put it in a book and you haven't seen him since.

1233
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,033
我不在乎你见没见他
I don't care whether you've seen him or not.

1234
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,634
-我在乎的是不坦诚 -我明白了
- I just care about dishonesty. - Oh, I see.

1235
01:11:44,746 --> 01:11:46,667
你不在乎我和别的男人有私情
You don't care that I had an affair with another man,

1236
01:11:46,782 --> 01:11:49,170
你只在乎不坦诚？现在是谁不坦诚
you just care about dishonesty? Look who's being dishonest.

1237
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:50,943
你在乎，太在乎了 甚至都不屑一顾
You care. You care so much, you won't even talk about it.

1238
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:52,780
-你甚至都不提… -想理论吗？我来跟你理论
- You won't even mention... - Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.

1239
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:53,944
你想开诚布公吗？
You want to be honest about it?

1240
01:11:54,054 --> 01:11:55,247
要是我不想坦诚的话…
If I didn't wanna be honest about it,

1241
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:57,050
我会愚蠢到把他给我的情书…
do you think I'd be silly enough to leave a poem he gave me

1242
01:11:57,157 --> 01:11:59,147
藏在沃尔特・惠特曼的书里吗？
lying around in the house in a book of Walt Whitman?

1243
01:11:59,258 --> 01:12:00,315
为什么不行呢？
Why not Whitman?

1244
01:12:00,426 --> 01:12:03,155
相信尤金一定会心安理得的
I'm sure Gene would feel right at home in that company.

1245
01:12:03,262 --> 01:12:04,387
不，你一点都不在乎
Oh, no. You don't care.

1246
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:06,793
我为什么要在乎你和谁上床？
Why the hell should I care that you slept with somebody else?

1247
01:12:06,898 --> 01:12:07,921
你以为我不在乎？
Do you think I haven't?

1248
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,623
我不赞成每次和别人上床…
I don't think we have to report to each other

1249
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:12,531
我们都要互相通报，那毫无意义
every time we go to bed with somebody. It doesn't mean anything.

1250
01:12:12,636 --> 01:12:13,932
那不意味着我对你的爱就少一点
It doesn't mean that I love you any less.

1251
01:12:14,037 --> 01:12:16,368
和尤金上床会让你对我的爱少一点吗？
Do you love me any less 'cause you went to bed with Gene?

1252
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:22,367
这有什么区别？
What difference does it make?

1253
01:12:22,511 --> 01:12:25,070
我不赞成撒谎，仅此而已
I just don't think we should lie about it. That's all.

1254
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:28,135
-谁？ -什么谁？
- Who? - What do you mean, "Who?"

1255
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,014
-是谁？ -什么是谁？
- Who was it? - Who was what?

1256
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:32,716
那个人是谁？
Who was it?

1257
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:35,345
你想要名单吗？这毫无意义
What do you want, a list? It doesn't mean anything.

1258
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:47,590
路易丝
Louise.

1259
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,859
路易丝
Louise.

1260
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,295
-你干什么？ -不知道
- What are you doing? - I'm not sure.

1261
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,866
-我想知道你要去哪 -不想说
- I wanna know where you're going. - I don't want to talk about it.

1262
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,342
-那我想说 -那你就说个够吧
- Well, I wanna talk about it. - You said it all, Jack.

1263
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,267
什么？难道我们还没说上百次吗？
What? What did I say now that we both haven't said 100 times?

1264
01:13:07,415 --> 01:13:08,847
请把我的来信转到约翰・惠勒…
Please forward my mail to John K. Wheeler,

1265
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,007
惠勒贝尔集团那里
Wheeler Bell Syndicate.

1266
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,506
早上我会叫人来搬我剩下的东西
I'll have someone pick up the rest of my things in the morning.

1267
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:14,609
难道两个人一起生活…
Didn't we say that people had to give each other freedom

1268
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:16,813
-不是彼此都有自由吗？ -我们说的东西多了
- if they were gonna live together? - We said a lot of things.

1269
01:13:16,923 --> 01:13:18,446
我还以为我们没有那么霸道
I thought we weren't going to be possessive.

1270
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:20,319
-我还以为你爱我！ -谁说我不爱你了？
- I thought you loved me! - Who says I don't?

1271
01:13:20,426 --> 01:13:22,381
你只爱你自己！根本不爱我！
You love yourself! Me, you fuck!

1272
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:25,355
你只有不出轨时才会爱我
When you're not fucking other people, that is!

1273
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:29,284
自由？你的意思是 要我和你一样毫不在乎尤金
Freedom? You mean I should just be like you and not give a damn, is that...

1274
01:13:30,768 --> 01:13:33,463
你和尤金上床有没想过我们？
Is that what fucking Gene means? You don't give a damn about us?

1275
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,766
我不会收拾行李的，我想知道你去哪
I'm not packing my bag. I wanna know where you're going.

1276
01:13:36,839 --> 01:13:38,726
-走开… -你上哪？
- Get out of my... - Where you going?

1277
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,728
-走开… -你不能…
- Get out of my... - You're not going...

1278
01:13:42,978 --> 01:13:45,901
走开！滚开！
Get away! Get out of my way.

1279
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:12,528
-到底有多少个？ -得了吧，路易丝
- How many were there? - Come on, Louise.

1280
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:18,234
你根本就不知道如何一起生活
You don't know the first thing about what living together means.

1281
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,212
走吧，我知道你去哪
Go ahead. I know where you're going.

1282
01:14:27,315 --> 01:14:30,203
原以为你需要人一起生活 但是我错了
I thought you needed someone to share your life with. But I was wrong.

1283
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:31,977
你只想每天成为人们关注的焦点
As long as you get your two shots of limelight every day.

1284
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,608
你什么都不缺
You don't need a thing.

1285
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,222
下地狱吧！你们俩都下地狱去吧！
You go to hell! Both of you!

1286
01:15:10,217 --> 01:15:14,710
当时和路易丝・拜伦有私情…
It could possibly have been a matter of prestige, you know,

1287
01:15:15,288 --> 01:15:18,142
是一件相当有面子的事
to say that you had an affair with Louise Bryant.

1288
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:20,687
我一直都不奢望…
I haven't been spared

1289
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:25,091
有哪个男人和我有私情
the legends about men that are supposed to have had affairs with me,

1290
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,622
因为我名如其人啊
because I was known by name.

1291
01:15:29,033 --> 01:15:31,523
根本就不可能有什么私情
Affairs which never occurred at all.

1292
01:15:31,935 --> 01:15:34,596
这很难说得清楚
It's very difficult to tell, you know.

1293
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:37,592
最让人头疼的是…
Do you know there is nothing more bewildering

1294
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,572
你收到一个疯子的情书，上面写着…
than when you get a letter from a loony who says,

1295
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:43,006
“我们在威尼斯渡过了美妙的一周”
"That marvelous week we spent in Venice."

1296
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:46,671
-对 -每两年都会发生这种事
- Yeah. - And it happens about every two years.

1297
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,668
-是的 -非常特别
- Yes. - It's most extraordinary.

1298
01:15:52,185 --> 01:15:56,814
一天，我和我的姨妈在波特兰散步
One day, I was out walking with my aunt in Portland.

1299
01:15:57,656 --> 01:16:00,783
她很漂亮，身材很高挑
And she was quite something. She was six feet tall.

1300
01:16:01,427 --> 01:16:03,986
我问她…
And I said to her,

1301
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:07,618
“路易丝的传闻是怎么回事？”
"What is all this ado about Louise?

1302
01:16:07,932 --> 01:16:09,887
“你觉得她怎样，贝丽姨妈？”
"What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"

1303
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,557
她说…
She said,

1304
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:15,056
[1917年，巴黎] “她这人很有吸引力”
"Well, she had something that just appeals."

1305
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:20,197
那就是我的故事
That's my story.

1306
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,731
-感觉怎样？ -好多了
- How you feeling? - Oh, better.

1307
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,539
-给你 -谢谢，哈瑞
- Here you are. - Oh. Thanks, Harry.

1308
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,273
谢谢
Thanks.

1309
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:28,568
幸好摘除得及时
Well, we got it out just in time.

1310
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:31,876
但不知道另外一个肾的情况怎样了
But since God only knows what condition the one you've got left is in,

1311
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,042
你最好善待它
you better treat it well.

1312
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:36,376
你得告诉伊斯曼你午夜前必须休息
That means, tell that goddamn Eastman you got to be in bed by midnight.

1313
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:39,787
要是被感染的话，到时就真的没救了！
If you get an infection now, that's it! Absolutely no salt!

1314
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:41,915
“亲爱的杰克 知道你好点了我深感欣慰”
"Dear Jack, I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.

1315
01:16:42,027 --> 01:16:43,584
“我问过巴黎的专家了”
"I talked to a specialist here in Paris.

1316
01:16:43,695 --> 01:16:46,026
“他说你可以过正常人的生活”
"And he said you can lead a perfectly normal life.

1317
01:16:46,163 --> 01:16:47,720
“希望你不要停止写作”
"I hope you're not neglecting your writing.

1318
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:48,819
“请不要浪费精力…”
"Please don't spend your energy

1319
01:16:48,966 --> 01:16:50,489
“去捕风捉影”
"getting caught up in things you can't afford."

1320
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:52,089
“亲爱的杰克，随附上我的作品”
"Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece I've written

1321
01:16:52,235 --> 01:16:53,360
“是描述一个志愿救护车司机的”
"on a volunteer ambulance driver

1322
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,925
“他来自纽约警局”
"from the New York City Police Department.

1323
01:16:55,038 --> 01:16:57,665
“还有，请不要再问我是否可以过来找我”
"Also, please don't keep asking me if you can come over here.

1324
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:59,103
“那样会让我认为你没有…”
"It just makes me think you have no..."

1325
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:01,266
“亲爱的杰克，惠勒对我的作品很满意”
"Dear Jack, yes, Wheeler's very happy with my work.

1326
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:04,105
“这里的生活如火如荼，我没有时间…”
"Life here is so hectic and exhilarating that I don't have a minute..."

1327
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:05,872
“亲爱的杰克，请不要担心，我很好”
"Dear Jack, don't worry, I'm well.

1328
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,210
“只是要不停满足惠勒的创作要求”
"My only problem is keeping up with Wheeler's demands for more stories."

1329
01:17:09,316 --> 01:17:11,647
“写一系列的头条时事通讯《法国来信》”
"...serial newsletter under the heading, 'Letters from France.'

1330
01:17:11,751 --> 01:17:12,978
“请不要向任何人提起”
"Please don't mention this to anyone.

1331
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:14,518
“我答应过惠勒，我不会告诉你任何事”
"I promised Wheeler I wouldn't say anything to you."

1332
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:17,346
“亲爱的杰克，我想我的作品 通过了惠勒的审核”
"Dear Jack, I feel I've really grown through my work for Wheeler,

1333
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,411
“所以没有理由为我本人担忧”
"and there's no reason to worry about my being here alone."

1334
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:21,651
布尔什维克，桑迪，布尔什维克人！
Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!

1335
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:23,917
天哪，要是布尔什维克介入，桑迪
Jesus Christ, if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy,

1336
01:17:24,062 --> 01:17:26,859
你大可亲吻自己的屁股拜拜了
you can just bend right over and kiss your ass goodbye.

1337
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:28,988
因为他们会让俄国退出战争
Because they'll pull Russia right out of the war.

1338
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:31,362
撤出东线战场，他们会退出
Right off the Eastern Front. They quit, that's all.

1339
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:33,231
彼得，布尔什维克不成气候的
Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.

1340
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:35,166
俄国不会袖手旁观的
Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.

1341
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:37,659
你想看到香谢丽舍大道上的 凯旋门那里…
You want to walk down the Champs-Elys闲s someday

1342
01:17:37,773 --> 01:17:40,900
出现五十万德国大军吗？
and see 500,000 Krauts come barreling out of Fouquet's?

1343
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:43,932
你最好希望布尔什维克成气候吧
You better hope that the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.

1344
01:17:44,045 --> 01:17:46,774
再来一杯，侍应！
Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!

1345
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:49,171
侍应，每人再来一杯酒
Waiter, another round here.

1346
01:17:49,283 --> 01:17:51,409
天哪，是小爱玛！
Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr!

1347
01:17:51,551 --> 01:17:53,142
快过来
Hey, come over here!

1348
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:55,742
说大声点，彼得 隔壁的人听不到
Speak up, Pete, speak up. They can't hear you in the next room.

1349
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:57,485
-你好啊，杰克 -见到你很高兴
- How are you, Jack? - Good to see you.

1350
01:17:57,656 --> 01:18:00,351
老天，摘除肾脏后你瘦了起码二十磅
God. You look 20 pounds lighter since you lost that kidney.

1351
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,517
-是吗？ -我打赌你只摘除了一个吧
- Oh, yeah? - I bet you only piss about half as much.

1352
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,719
是的，通常都是两个的 来杯汽水
Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.

1353
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:07,352
杰克，布尔什维克能打倒克伦斯基吗？ (俄国社会革命领袖)
Jack, can the Bolsheviks overthrow Kerensky?

1354
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:10,160
你还是去找个公正的观察员问问吧
Okay. Why don't you ask an impartial observer?

1355
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:14,226
杰克，你到底为什么反对战争呢？
Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell you got against this war anyway?

1356
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:17,566
该死，你为何不把威尔逊 连同斧头一起埋了呢？
Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet with Wilson?

1357
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:21,335
重新回到报社吧，我们想看你的大作
Get back into print so we can all read some decent writing, you know.

1358
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:24,568
-为大作干杯 -你为什么都能干杯
- I'll drink to that. - You'll drink to anything.

1359
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:28,135
没错，见到你很高兴
Well, that's right, too. It's good to see you.

1360
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:31,671
真是太高兴了，路易丝怎样？
Jesus Christ. It's good to see you. Goddamn, how's Louise?

1361
01:18:32,051 --> 01:18:33,574
不大好吧？
Not so good.

1362
01:18:33,786 --> 01:18:35,616
-她很好 -把我的话转告她…
- She's good. - Tell her from me that I said

1363
01:18:35,688 --> 01:18:39,179
约翰・惠勒根本就不会欣赏她的作品
that John Wheeler wouldn't know a story if it fell right on top of him.

1364
01:18:39,324 --> 01:18:41,621
杰克，你到底在干嘛？
I'll tell you. Hey, Jack, what are you doing?

1365
01:18:41,726 --> 01:18:43,852
到底在干嘛？你让他们抓狂
What the hell are you doing? You're driving them crazy.

1366
01:18:43,961 --> 01:18:45,257
你意识到了吗？
You realize that?

1367
01:18:45,396 --> 01:18:47,488
他们还以为你是德国佬呢！
They think you're some kind of goddamn German!

1368
01:18:47,898 --> 01:18:50,092
我喜欢！喜欢死了！
I love it! Goddamn, I love it!

1369
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,757
对他们口诛笔伐，杰克
Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.

1370
01:18:51,868 --> 01:18:54,028
-是要加冰的汽水吗？ -是的，谢谢
- Is that a sarsaparilla with ice? - Yeah, thanks.

1371
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,999
没错，就是加冰的汽水
You bet your sweet patoosie, that's sarsaparilla with ice.

1372
01:18:57,105 --> 01:19:00,164
约翰・惠勒为什么不会欣赏？
Why wouldn't John Wheeler know a story if it fell on him?

1373
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:02,765
因为约翰・惠勒是个傻子
John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.

1374
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,167
他人是很厉害
No, he's all right.

1375
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:06,734
我只是不想看到路易丝受伤而已
I just hate to see Louise get hurt. That's all.

1376
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:09,239
这话什么意思？
What are you talking about?

1377
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:13,584
老天
Jesus Christ.

1378
01:19:14,853 --> 01:19:16,649
别告诉她是我说的，好吗？
Don't tell her that I told you. All right?

1379
01:19:17,923 --> 01:19:19,378
告诉我什么？
Told me what?

1380
01:19:20,124 --> 01:19:22,978
本・帕森斯告诉我 惠勒不得不让她走人
Well, Ben Parsons told me that Wheeler had to let her go

1381
01:19:23,094 --> 01:19:26,881
因为她的作品惠勒根本不用
because she hadn't turned anything in that he could use,

1382
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,621
除了那个关于…
other than some story about a cop

1383
01:19:28,732 --> 01:19:32,428
警察志愿者司机的作品之外
that went over there to drive a police department ambulance.

1384
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:35,860
-他让她走人？ -炒了她
- He let her go? - Fired her.

1385
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,464
-你何时听说的？ -几个星期前
- When did you hear that? - A couple of weeks ago.

1386
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,672
不是，一个月前 一个半月前
No, it was a month. More than a month and a half ago.

1387
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:49,210
杰克，惠勒就是个混蛋
Oh, look, Jack, Wheeler's a goddamn moron.

1388
01:19:49,316 --> 01:19:51,476
叫她不必为解雇的事感到惭愧
Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed about being fired.

1389
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:53,642
-回头见 -怎么了，杰克？
- I'm gonna see you later, huh? - Jack, what's the matter?

1390
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:56,346
我也被解雇了，大家都被解雇了
Hell, we've all been fired. I've been fired.

1391
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:57,409
为解雇干杯
Hell, I'll drink to it.

1392
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:00,412
想象一下，6千5百万大军…
Imagine, 65 million

1393
01:20:01,326 --> 01:20:03,089
去打仗
go to war. Right?

1394
01:20:03,395 --> 01:20:05,488
一千万人阵亡
10 million die.

1395
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,887
一千万人成为孤儿
10 million become orphans.

1396
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,466
2千万人伤残
20 million become maimed, crippled, or wounded.

1397
01:20:13,372 --> 01:20:16,500
欧洲大灾难肆虐
You had catastrophe in Europe.

1398
01:20:16,908 --> 01:20:19,502
欧洲大屠杀肆虐
You had a holocaust in Europe.

1399
01:20:20,145 --> 01:20:22,272
你有转变的雄心壮志
You had a desire for change.

1400
01:20:23,015 --> 01:20:24,141
在当时革命情绪…
Who can stop them

1401
01:20:24,249 --> 01:20:27,605
异常高涨的时候，谁能阻止战争？
when there was such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?

1402
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:29,013
谁来阻止？
Who could stop them?

1403
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:42,460
看来我要买一台新的打字机了…
You know, I think I'm gonna have to get a new typewriter...

1404
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,435
-你怎么… -怎么了？
- What are you... - What?

1405
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:52,440
你气色不错，完全康复了吗？
You look fine. Are you all right now?

1406
01:20:52,544 --> 01:20:55,604
人不需要两个肾的
Oh, God, yes. Nobody needs two kidneys.

1407
01:20:56,081 --> 01:20:58,276
第二个只是摆设
The second one's just for show.

1408
01:20:59,885 --> 01:21:01,944
对不起，你来得不大是时候
Sorry, this isn't a very good time.

1409
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:09,389
他们要把我转移到 另一个通讯中心
They're moving me to another communications center.

1410
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:12,855
现在我没时间和你叙旧了
So, I'm just not going to be able to talk to you right now, Jack.

1411
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:15,387
能出去谈一会儿吗？就一会儿
Could we just go out here a second? Just for a second?

1412
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:19,064
-我要去俄国了 -是嘛？你应征了吗？
- Look, I'm on my way to Russia. - Oh, really? Have you enlisted?

1413
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:20,195
开玩笑
Very funny.

1414
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:21,795
我知道你在这里干得很出色
I know you're doing work here that's good,

1415
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:24,205
我也看了你的救护车作品，写得很棒
'cause I read the ambulance piece and I thought that was good.

1416
01:21:24,276 --> 01:21:25,641
-谢谢 -我知道你在写书
- Thank you. - And I know you're working on your book

1417
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:27,109
我知道它对你很重要
and I know how important that is to you.

1418
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:28,406
要是你想在适当时候…
But you got to have enough sense

1419
01:21:28,513 --> 01:21:30,378
在适当地点成为一名优秀记者…
if you're trying to build up your reputation as a journalist,

1420
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:32,006
你就得增强你的使命感
to be in the right place at the right time.

1421
01:21:32,117 --> 01:21:34,574
-谢谢你的建议 -这个适当的地点就是俄国
- I appreciate your advice. - Well, the place to be now is Russia.

1422
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,746
-谢谢，我会记住的 -现在是乱世，他们坚持不了多久
- Thank you. I'll remember that. - Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.

1423
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:40,120
6个月内已经上台三个临时政府了
They're in their third provisional government in six months.

1424
01:21:40,225 --> 01:21:43,058
知道意味着什么吗？ 意味着另一场革命即将爆发
You know what that means? It means there might be another revolution.

1425
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:46,619
工人阶级放弃工厂，士兵放弃前线
The workers are deserting the factories, the army's deserting the battlefronts.

1426
01:21:46,732 --> 01:21:50,395
流放的人都回来了 犹太人，无政府主义者，社会党
The exiles are all coming back. The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.

1427
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:52,264
所有的人都回来了
All of them are going back, only this time

1428
01:21:52,437 --> 01:21:53,529
这次才可能会成大气候
it might be the real thing.

1429
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,799
如果俄国爆发真正的工人革命
And if they have a real workers' revolution in Russia,

1430
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:58,172
德国就会相继爆发，一旦德国爆发…
they'd have one in Germany, and if they had one in Germany,

1431
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:00,733
-全世界都会爆发 -有火柴吗？
- it could happen all over the world. - Got a match?

1432
01:22:00,846 --> 01:22:02,734
路易丝，然后就是战争结束
Louise, that'd be the end of the war.

1433
01:22:02,848 --> 01:22:04,543
你不必跟我说俄国发生的事
You don't have to tell me what's happening in Russia.

1434
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:06,344
-我看过报纸了 -跟我走吧
- I read the papers. - Well, come with me.

1435
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:08,442
作我的同志，不是别的身份
As a colleague, I'm not talking about anything else.

1436
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:10,817
我们一起前往彼得格勒
Come with me as a colleague. You ought to be in Petrograd.

1437
01:22:10,922 --> 01:22:12,878
是吗？你在纽约也是这么说的！
Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said about New York!

1438
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:14,879
-我那时是对的 -不，这里有我的事业
- I was right about New York. - No, I have work I'm doing here.

1439
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,017
我的事业也是…
And I happen to think my work is...

1440
01:22:16,128 --> 01:22:18,790
是很重要，但没有俄国的事业重要
It is important. But it's not important as what you could be doing in Russia.

1441
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,921
我想跟你作搭档，一起奋斗
I wanna work together. As partners.

1442
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,728
我不要搭档，我想去俄国就一个人去
I don't want a partner. And if I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.

1443
01:22:23,869 --> 01:22:25,666
-我不会让你带我去 -路易丝
- I wouldn't need you to take me. - Louise.

1444
01:22:25,771 --> 01:22:28,695
你一个柔弱女子 不适宜单独前往俄国这种乱世
Russia is not the safest place in the world for a woman to be alone.

1445
01:22:28,774 --> 01:22:31,663
你能成为一名出色记者 但那并不意味着…
You may be a hell of a journalist. But that doesn't mean...

1446
01:22:35,847 --> 01:22:38,042
路易丝，我们要走了
Louise, we'd better hurry along.

1447
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,315
要转移了？
So, moving you out of here, huh?

1448
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:44,844
是的，我要去采访普拉默将军
Yes. I've been promised an interview with General Plumer.

1449
01:22:44,956 --> 01:22:47,151
我也得走了
Well, I've got to run along myself.

1450
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:51,124
-对不起，我时间匆忙 -不，我不想留下你
- Sorry I don't have any time. - No. I don't want to keep you.

1451
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:53,424
只是想…座位已经预约了
I just... Look, the seat's already reserved.

1452
01:22:53,632 --> 01:22:55,793
你这是浪费钱财，杰克，我不要
You've wasted your money, Jack. I don't want it.

1453
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:59,358
你可以改日期自己去 什么时候去都行
Change the date. Go by yourself. You can use it whenever you want to.

1454
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:01,395
坚持自己的创作
Keep up the good work.

1455
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,335
杰克
Jack.

1456
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:07,475
祝好运
Good luck.

1457
01:23:07,579 --> 01:23:08,671
你也是
Yeah, you, too.

1458
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,685
出租车在等我
I got a taxi waiting.

1459
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:44,609
杰克！杰克・雷德！
Jack! Jack Reed!

1460
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:47,239
-我是乔・沃斯基 -你好吗？
- Joe, Joe Volski. - How are you?

1461
01:23:47,352 --> 01:23:50,446
很好，你也去彼得格勒？
Oh, fine, fine. Are you going to Petrograd, too?

1462
01:23:50,755 --> 01:23:53,178
-是的 -太好了！
- Yes. Yeah. - Fine. Wonderful!

1463
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:56,920
形势真是风云变幻，你一个人吗？
Great things are happening. Are you traveling by yourself?

1464
01:23:58,697 --> 01:24:01,586
-应该是吧 -那我搬过去坐
- I think I am. - Well, then I'll switch.

1465
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:23,714
我们在芝加哥见面过
We met in Chicago.

1466
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,852
你真是个大演讲家！
Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!

1467
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:31,252
不记得我了吗？
You don't remember me, eh?

1468
01:24:32,931 --> 01:24:34,694
不是的
Well, it's not that.

1469
01:24:36,234 --> 01:24:38,759
-可能是因为帽子 -我的帽子？
- Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat. - My hat?

1470
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:41,634
对，你戴上这顶别致的帽子 我认不出了
Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognize you in this particular hat.

1471
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,335
我现在是化妆成老百姓的革命者
Oh, then I'm a revolutionary returning in disguise.

1472
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:48,675
等到革命胜利，我给你买顶新帽子
Well, comes the revolution, I'll buy you a new hat.

1473
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:51,772

- I see you're studying Russian. - Yeah. I'm trying to.

1475
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,812
-什么？ -我是说…
- What? - I mean,

1476
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:59,254
你可以问我这个俄国通

1477
01:24:59,357 --> 01:25:01,518
谢谢，我会记住的
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

1478
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,725
我看看…
Let's see...

1479
01:25:03,962 --> 01:25:06,487
抱歉，打搅了，我有话要说
Excuse me. Excuse me, now here's the thing.

1480
01:25:06,631 --> 01:25:09,964
我不接受你提议的话就太愚蠢了 但我有条件
I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you up on this offer. So, here's what I want.

1481
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:11,763
我要在我自己的报道上签我的名字

1482

1483
01:25:13,538 --> 01:25:16,393
我要自行安排自己的时间和活动
I want to be responsible for my own time and my own actions.

1484
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:18,897
我要别人称呼我拜伦小姐 而非雷德夫人
I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant, and not as Mrs. Reed,

1485
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,966
我要记下我们所有的花费…
and I want to keep an account of every cent we spend

1486
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:22,205
以便我还给你
so that I can pay you back.

1487
01:25:22,314 --> 01:25:24,544
还有，我不会再跟你上床
Now, I assume you know that I'm not going to sleep with you,

1488
01:25:24,649 --> 01:25:27,345
所以，你不要对我有非分之想
so just don't confuse the issue by bringing it up.

1489
01:25:27,452 --> 01:25:28,544
完了
That's it.

1490
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:31,087
-好 -好
- Fine. - Good.

1491
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:32,685
喜欢意大利香肠吗？
You like salami?

1492
01:25:36,628 --> 01:25:38,858
有个人说“等一下，我得回去”

After the revolution, you'll buy me a new hat.

1497

非常感谢，我会记住的
Thank you very much. I'll keep you by your word.

1498
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,554

By the way, did you hear this one? A man...

I says, "I want to remember what I ate yesterday."

1501
01:26:40,725 --> 01:26:44,058
这个比较难念，意思是“我不抽烟”
This is a hard word, but it means "I don't smoke."

1502
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:45,220
好
Okay.

1503
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:51,129

There's a foreman of a logging camp, he's trying to hire a crew.

1505
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:02,874
许多人在排队，都是牛高马大的汉子
You know, and he goes down a long line of very big men

1506
01:27:02,981 --> 01:27:04,073
他抓住了一个小个子
and he gets to a little man in the back

1507
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:06,104
他问到 “你是什么人？到这来干什么？”
and he says, "Who the hell are you? What're you doing here?

"Don't you know that I need men who can chop down dozens of trees a day?

1509
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:10,745
“你以前在哪干过活？”
"Where the hell have you ever worked before?"

1510
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:13,187
小个子说 “我以前在撒哈拉森林干活”
And the little man says, "Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."

1511
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,986

我没说过这故事吗？
I didn't tell you that?

1515
01:27:24,602 --> 01:27:28,891
一名女子说“我丈夫刚去世 我想卖掉他的夹克”

他已经打仗了三个月
He's already fighting for three months.

Now he joined the Bolsheviks and he's not going to fight anymore.

1522
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:31,421

I don't think he's afraid. There are many Bolsheviks in the army.

1523
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:33,663
布尔什维克人会阻止战争
And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.

1524
01:28:36,975 --> 01:28:38,636
他今年才14岁
He's 14 years old.

1525
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:13,938
显然共产党人想要和平
The Communists obviously wanted peace. Rightly so.

1526
01:29:14,546 --> 01:29:17,709
因为俄国正处于风雨飘摇的局势…
Because the country was completely unable to sustain a war.

1527

到处是叛变和腐败

一切都是有目共睹

操纵战争的

许多人都认为乌托邦的理念正在成熟
A lot of people had an idea that Utopia was growing up.

1543
01:30:05,062 --> 01:30:08,121

I could not blame them for being pro-Bolshevik,

1544
01:30:08,265 --> 01:30:09,697
但是我没有
but I wasn't.

1545
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,393
完全忽略俄国的人是…
The one person who was awfully ignorant about Russia

1546
01:30:12,535 --> 01:30:14,456
-碧翠丝・韦伯 -对，就是她

她真是无知
She didn't know a thing.

1548

01:36:35,277 --> 01:36:36,905
他们会罢工吗？

1673
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:42,484
-纽约人？ -是的

1678
01:36:51,834 --> 01:36:53,721
能告诉我他说什么吗？
Can you tell me what he's saying?

1679
01:36:53,836 --> 01:36:56,224
他说不罢工，罢工不对…
He says don't strike. He says it's not right

1680
01:36:56,306 --> 01:36:58,865
那样会让我们士兵 手无寸铁地在前线挣扎
to leave our Russian soldiers at Front without guns.

1681
01:37:01,411 --> 01:37:03,776
纽约到这里可是千里迢迢啊

1684
01:37:27,237 --> 01:37:29,295
所以他们才会撤离前线
That is why they're leaving the Front.

1685
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:42,638
说什么？
What's that?

1686
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:44,672
他说英法美三国的工人…
He said that the workers of England, France and America

1687
01:37:44,787 --> 01:37:46,651
将会独自打击德国

1688
01:37:46,755 --> 01:37:47,948
告诉他，他根本不知道…
Tell him he doesn't know how many workers

1689
01:37:48,058 --> 01:37:50,048
有多少英法美的工人反对战争
in England, France and America are against the war.

1690
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,648
你在纽约住过，告诉他
You lived in New York. Tell him that.

1691
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:53,284
你说得对，美国人

说说你们美国工人

不，我不能讲话 我没有发言权
No, I can't speak here, I don't have any credentials to speak here.

1696
01:38:11,246 --> 01:38:13,634
-我是美国人… -发言权？什么发言权？
- I'm an American... - Credentials? What credentials?

1697

这里每个人都有发言权

1699
01:38:19,088 --> 01:38:20,850
你说，我翻译

1700
01:38:44,681 --> 01:38:46,598
我只想说，如果你们罢工…
I only want to say that if you strike,

1701
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:49,299
美国工人就不会感到被出卖
the American workers will not feel betrayed.

1702
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:57,789
他们在等待你们作出榜样
They're waiting for your example.

1703
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:01,119
他们在等待你们作出领导
They're waiting for your leadership.

1704
01:39:01,264 --> 01:39:04,096
如果你们拒绝 为资本主义战争机器工作…
If you refuse to support the capitalist war machine,

1705
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,689
他们将会跟随你们
they will follow your example.

1706
01:39:05,835 --> 01:39:07,699
如果全世界的工人阶级联合起来…

1707
01:39:07,804 --> 01:39:09,573
战争将会被阻止

1710

1711

司法部长下的令
The authority of the Attorney General.

1724

这样才能生活下去
so we can have something to live on.

1736
01:45:10,187 --> 01:45:12,138
不管我到哪宣传他都要写

女性解放运动的文章
on women in the Revolution,

1740
01:45:17,015 --> 01:45:18,671
就是说我们会互相帮助编辑
and then we're gonna help edit each other's books.

1741
01:45:18,747 --> 01:45:21,164
不再分开，麦斯 我们真的互相发誓了
No more separations. We've really promised each other, Max.

1742
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:23,639
我们真的要过一辈子
We're really going to get down to living our own lives.

1743
01:45:24,143 --> 01:45:27,026
那里真是感人，麦斯 你应该去一趟
It's so moving. God, Max, you should've been there!

1744
01:45:27,441 --> 01:45:31,131
他们拿走了我的笔记 都是我写书用的
Well, they took my notes. Every goddamn note I have for my book.

1745
01:45:31,238 --> 01:45:32,690
他们能这么做吗？
Can they do that?

1746
01:45:32,803 --> 01:45:35,493
欢迎回家，走吧

I understand you and Louise have decided to be happy?

1751
01:45:44,649 --> 01:45:46,820
对于在一个正在战争中的国家而言…
It's a very difficult situation

1752
01:45:46,929 --> 01:45:50,209
这是一个很艰难的处境
for a country who is conducting a war,

1753
01:45:50,484 --> 01:45:53,295
当其中一个同盟爆发革命…
when one of its allies has a revolution

1754
01:45:53,402 --> 01:45:55,710
政府换届
and the government is changed.

1755
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:59,634
最典型的就是俄国人退出
The thing that made the furor was that the Russians withdrew,

1756
01:45:59,741 --> 01:46:01,671
我们少了一个同盟
and we lost an ally.

1757
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,763
我们以为俄国人会支持我们

1762
01:46:15,385 --> 01:46:18,405
国家机器的权力…

1763
01:46:18,683 --> 01:46:20,135
为工人与农民所掌握

你认识
You know that one.

1779
01:46:56,924 --> 01:47:00,307
另一个是《庄严旧旗帜》之后
But the other one after Grand Old Flag,

1780
01:47:00,656 --> 01:47:03,846
也许是之前的，“我是一个北方小混混”

1781
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,473

I am the Yankee Doodle boy

1789
01:47:25,805 --> 01:47:27,496
非常流行
That was a big hit.

1790
01:47:28,671 --> 01:47:32,163
-你相信上帝吗？ -什么？
- Do you believe in God? - I beg your pardon?

1791

It's a simple question, Miss Bryant. Now do you want me to repeat it?

1792
01:47:36,316 --> 01:47:37,509
对不起，至少这时候是
I'm sorry, for a moment I thought

1793
01:47:37,652 --> 01:47:39,107
你问我是否相信上帝
you asked me if I believed there's a God.

1794
01:47:39,253 --> 01:47:41,380
我问得很简单
That is precisely what I asked you.

1795
01:47:41,758 --> 01:47:44,647
我一点都不知道
I see. Well, I have no way of knowing.

拜伦小姐，告诉我
Miss Bryant, tell me,

布尔什维克人中，是否没有正统 不畏惧上帝的基督徒？
are there no decent, God-fearing Christians among the Bolsheviks?

1803
01:48:06,495 --> 01:48:09,259
谁有必要做一个畏惧上帝 又是正统的基督徒？
Does one have to be God-fearing and Christian to be decent?

1804
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,823
参议员，布尔什维克相信 这是种宗教，尤其是基督教
Senator, the Bolsheviks believe that it's religion, particularly Christianity,

1805
01:48:12,938 --> 01:48:15,702
这让俄国人民倒退了好几个世纪
that's kept the Russian people back for so many centuries.

1806
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:17,265
-拜伦小姐 -如果你们谁去过俄国
- Miss Bryant... - lf any of you'd ever been to Russia

1807
01:48:17,412 --> 01:48:19,642
见到了农民，也许你们会赞同这一点
and seen the peasants, you might think they had a point.

1808
01:48:19,749 --> 01:48:21,740
参议员，就正统这点来说
On the subject of decency, Senator,

1809
01:48:21,852 --> 01:48:24,241
布尔什维克用一个口号取得了 政权战争的结束
the Bolsheviks took power with the slogan, "An end to the war."

1810
01:48:24,356 --> 01:48:27,519
6个月内，他们对俄国人民满口承诺
Within six months, they made good their promise to the Russian people.

1811
01:48:27,729 --> 01:48:29,955
1916年，美国总统去了俄国
Now, the present President of the United States of America

1812
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:33,389
立场是无战争
went to this country in 1916, on a "no war" ticket.

1813
01:48:33,495 --> 01:48:35,380
6个月内，他就让我们卷入了战争
Within six months, he'd taken us into the war,

1814
01:48:35,495 --> 01:48:38,551
11.5万美国年轻人命丧他乡
and 115,000 young Americans didn't come back.

1815
01:48:38,862 --> 01:48:40,815
如果这是正统，畏惧上帝的基督徒行为
If that's how decent, God-fearing Christians behave,

1816
01:48:40,929 --> 01:48:42,917
那么我随时可能会做无神论者
give me atheists anytime.

1817
01:48:45,062 --> 01:48:47,913
参议员，在俄国，女人有投票权
By the way, Senator Overman, in Russia, women have the vote,

1818
01:48:48,029 --> 01:48:49,755
这个国家远远超乎你的想像
which is more than you can say for this country.

1819
01:48:49,862 --> 01:48:51,122
拜伦小姐
Miss Bryant,

1820
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:54,524
你是否建议我们国家 也建立苏维埃政府？
do you advocate a Soviet government for this country?

1821
01:48:54,929 --> 01:48:57,087
不，我认为在这个国家行不通
No. In this country I don't think it would work.

1822
01:48:57,197 --> 01:48:58,560
赤色份子害怕吗？
In other words, you mean the Red scare?

1823
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:01,027
是他们害怕，还是我们害怕？
They got scared, or we got scared?

1824
01:49:01,797 --> 01:49:03,230
不，我们不怕
No, we didn't get scared.

1825
01:49:03,567 --> 01:49:07,731
他们害怕工人会强大起来
They were afraid that the unions would grow in strength.

1826
01:49:07,905 --> 01:49:11,693
他们害怕美国激进分子的运动
A radical movement in America. They were scared.

1827
01:49:11,776 --> 01:49:12,936
是的
Oh, sure.

1828
01:49:13,044 --> 01:49:16,741
美国佬会怕得要死
The Americans, they were frightened to death by it, you know.

1829
01:49:16,882 --> 01:49:18,577
担心他们国家也会如此
That it could occur here.

1830
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:21,948
当然，大家都怕得要命
Sure. Everybody was in mortal dread

1831
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:24,318
怕政府抛弃他们
of the government descending on them.

1832
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:27,222
那些FBI密探，等等群体
The FBI or whatever it was, don't you know.

1833
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:29,056
我们必须揭露他们
We had to expose them.

1834
01:49:29,163 --> 01:49:32,155
一旦他们告诉了 美国人民什么是共产主义
And once they told American people what Communism was...

1835
01:49:32,501 --> 01:49:35,026
那么现在人们不可能跟 共产主义毫无关系
People won't have nothing to do with Communism now.

1836
01:49:35,137 --> 01:49:36,331
他们知道那是什么
They know what it is.

1837
01:49:36,438 --> 01:49:39,066
不过在当时，他们不知道 那是新事物
But then, they didn't know. It was a new thing.

1838
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:42,837
公开的观念已经深入人心
Public opinion was solidly against anyone

1839
01:49:43,146 --> 01:49:46,172
他们对俄国革命一片好评
who had a good word for the Russian Revolution.

1840
01:49:46,617 --> 01:49:51,543
但路易丝是从自己的体会来谈的
But Louise was always communicating what she had experienced.

1841
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,855
我带了毛毯来
I brought blankets, here,

1842
01:49:55,561 --> 01:49:57,892
还有厚外套
and a heavy coat, here.

1843
01:49:59,497 --> 01:50:01,157
还有咖啡
Chase and Sanborn.

1844
01:50:01,633 --> 01:50:02,621
手套
Gloves.

1845
01:50:02,734 --> 01:50:05,793
谢谢，杰克 其他人都只给我带了帽子
Thank you, Jack. Everyone else brought me hats.

1846
01:50:05,903 --> 01:50:09,929
路易丝捎来了她最好的，还有这个
And Louise sends you her best and this.

1847
01:50:11,742 --> 01:50:14,801
围巾，太好了
A scarf. Very kind.

1848
01:50:15,278 --> 01:50:17,268
时间到了
I'm afraid your time is up.

1849
01:50:16,895 --> 01:50:18,063
Well,

1850
01:50:20,116 --> 01:50:22,504
我们要继续战斗下去
we're going to keep fighting this.

1851
01:50:22,852 --> 01:50:25,945
你可否告诉麦斯 我想在杂志里刊登自己的照片？
Will you tell Max I'd like a picture of myself in the magazine?

1852
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:30,113
我希望在照片下面写上“1919年受驱逐”
And under it, I would like the words, "Deported in 1919.

1853
01:50:30,258 --> 01:50:32,054
“这个世上最为强大国家的政府…”
"The government of the most powerful country in the world

1854
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,114
“竟害怕这个女人”
"is afraid of this woman."

1855
01:50:34,095 --> 01:50:36,358
我们会救你出来的，埃玛
We're going to get you back, E.G.

1856
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,894
革命需要你，我们会救你出去的
The revolution needs you. We're gonna get you back.

1857
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,729
同志，我不会离开革命
Comrade, I'm not leaving the revolution.

1858
01:50:42,937 --> 01:50:45,097
要是在俄国，我也会加入革命
In Russia, I'll be joining it.

1859
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:49,297
我迫切要求驱逐…
I urged the deportation of all

1860
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:54,409
外来共产党员 所有的外来共产党员
alien Communists. All alien Communists.

1861
01:50:54,546 --> 01:50:57,309
有本国共产党员已经够受的了
It's bad enough having a Communist with us,

1862
01:50:57,482 --> 01:51:00,279
再加上外来共产党员就更要命了
but to have alien Communists who are not citizens,

1863
01:51:00,452 --> 01:51:03,147
他们宣布我们的政府形式 和共和制是无能的
denouncing our form of government and our republic

1864
01:51:03,255 --> 01:51:05,586
他们应该被驱逐
and everything else, they should be deported.

1865
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:08,952
长久以来，我领导着一场大战
And I led a big fight on that for a long while.

1866
01:51:09,126 --> 01:51:11,787
当时的气氛不是很健康
It wasn't a very healthy atmosphere.

1867
01:51:12,396 --> 01:51:14,625
[路易丝生日快乐] 所以当约翰・雷德来的时候
So when John Reed came along,

1868
01:51:14,731 --> 01:51:17,255
他的发言我很喜欢
well, he was a voice of what I love.

1869
01:51:17,367 --> 01:51:21,928
他能够进入最有争议的话题
He was able to go into the most controversial subject of all,

1870
01:51:22,038 --> 01:51:23,561
共产主义，布尔什维克主义
Communism, Bolshevism.

1871
01:51:23,639 --> 01:51:27,665
他是公认的唯一能够做这类事的人
He was considered one of the rare persons who could do a thing like that.

1872
01:51:27,776 --> 01:51:30,767
他知道他站在了历史的新开端
He knew he was on the threshold of history,

1873
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,471
他是这么写的
and he wrote it that way.

1874
01:51:39,387 --> 01:51:42,310
-这样翻… -杰克，我回来了
- A touch of this... - Jack, I'm back!

1875
01:51:42,422 --> 01:51:44,013
我在这里，亲爱的
I'm in here, honey.

1876
01:51:44,124 --> 01:51:46,512
今天我在李莱特家跟埃蒙和埃弗德谈过了
I talked to Edmund and Alfred today at Liveright's.

1877
01:51:46,627 --> 01:51:49,618
-今天真是收获不小 -别进来，亲爱的
- What a day it's turned out to be. - Stay out, honey! Stay out, stay out.

1878
01:51:49,997 --> 01:51:53,295
你在干什么？没事吧？
What are you doing in there? Is everything okay?

1879
01:51:53,733 --> 01:51:55,359
-要帮忙吗？ -不
- Can't I help? - No, no, no, no!

1880
01:51:55,468 --> 01:51:57,332
闻起来不错，是什么？
Sure smells good. What is it?

1881
01:51:57,403 --> 01:51:58,699
别进来，亲爱的 埃蒙说了什么？
Stay out, honey. What did Edmund have to say?

1882
01:51:58,738 --> 01:51:59,396
出去，亲爱的，埃蒙说了什么？
Stay out, honey. What did Edmund have to say?

1883
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:02,632
他说几个星期之后钢铁工人就要罢工
He said in a few weeks the steelworkers will strike.

1884
01:52:03,408 --> 01:52:07,366
他说至少有20万人，也许有30万
He thinks at least 200,000 of them, and maybe as many as 300,000.

1885
01:52:08,747 --> 01:52:11,203
他认为这次阻止不了他们了
But he doesn't think there's any stopping them this time.

1886
01:52:11,316 --> 01:52:12,339
是吗？太好了
Yeah? That's good.

1887
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:14,336
你考虑要发表什么评论吗？
You still thinking about doing a piece on it? I am.

1888
01:52:14,451 --> 01:52:17,647
现在不好说，他说下一步要怎么办？
Well, I can't really talk now, but what does he say the next step is?

1889
01:52:17,755 --> 01:52:20,848
显然联邦政府会说 组织者一定是赤色分子
Evidently the federal government's saying the steel organizers are Reds.

1890
01:52:20,959 --> 01:52:23,483
所以，他们会成立一个调查局
So what they're doing is forming a bureau of investigation

1891
01:52:23,594 --> 01:52:25,515
调查破坏活动
just to look into subversive activity.

1892
01:52:25,664 --> 01:52:28,393
以及调查那些工会联盟领导人…
And you know, with all this talk about the leadership of the AF of L

1893
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,160
与钢铁托拉斯的密谋
being in cahoots with the Steel Trust,

1894
01:52:30,236 --> 01:52:33,693
埃弗德问我是否会报道 世界产业工人组织
Alfred asked me if I was still gonna do the piece on the IWW.

1895
01:52:33,805 --> 01:52:36,398
我对埃弗德说，目前我不想再进一步
So I said, "Alfred, for the moment I don't want to go any further away

1896
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:38,372
-我宁愿待在新泽西 -是嘛？
- "than New Jersey." - Really?

1897
01:52:38,511 --> 01:52:40,398
很好
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1898
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,537
-只是… -很好
- Just... - Yeah, it is good.

1899
01:52:42,715 --> 01:52:45,603
你先坐，我马上来
Sit down. I'll just be a minute.

1900
01:52:47,387 --> 01:52:48,876
杰克，你在干什么？
Jack, what are you doing?

1901
01:52:48,989 --> 01:52:52,651
-你怎么把稿件交给了埃蒙？ -他会刊登的
- How did you leave it with Edmund? - He's gonna read the piece on Debs.

1902
01:52:53,193 --> 01:52:54,989
第一道菜
Okay, the first course.

1903
01:52:55,228 --> 01:52:56,455
-是吗？ -坐下
- Yeah? - Sit down.

1904
01:52:57,632 --> 01:53:00,589
坐下，闭上眼睛，坐下
Sit down and close your eyes. Sit down.

1905
01:53:08,042 --> 01:53:09,065
好了
Okay.

1906
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:15,137
天哪
Oh, my.

1907
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:17,274
天…
My...

1908
01:53:18,587 --> 01:53:20,383
吃吧
- Go ahead. - Oh.

1909
01:53:27,897 --> 01:53:29,488
怎么样？
What do you think?

1910
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,788
真的？真好吃？
Really? You serious?

1911
01:53:34,971 --> 01:53:38,827
真的？感谢上帝 我刚才还打算烧烤呢
Really? Thank God. I was gonna flamb?them out here,

1912
01:53:39,042 --> 01:53:42,272
没想到肉自己在锅里烧着了
but the goddamn things flamb闲d themselves in the pan.

1913
01:53:42,579 --> 01:53:45,638
在革命运动发展的过程中…
He was certainly the main inspiration

1914
01:53:45,916 --> 01:53:48,907
他受到了很大启发
in the development of a revolutionary movement

1915
01:53:49,053 --> 01:53:50,485
他将自已经历的历史事件
through his history

1916
01:53:50,588 --> 01:53:53,181
写就了《震撼世界的十天》
of Ten Days That Shook The World.

1917
01:53:53,357 --> 01:53:56,621
《震撼世界的十天》当然是他的杰作
Ten Days That Shook The World was, of course, his masterpiece.

1918
01:53:56,728 --> 01:53:59,616
布尔什维克革命的时候他在场
He was there when the Bolshevik Revolution took place.

1919
01:54:00,165 --> 01:54:02,325
他是最佳报道者
And his was the best report of it.

1920
01:54:02,534 --> 01:54:05,331
麦斯・伊斯曼说约翰・雷德当时…
Max Eastman had this story that John Reed came down,

1921
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:09,461
头发蓬松，在全书关注写着一本书
tousled hair all, you know... And said he was writing a book

1922
01:54:09,574 --> 01:54:11,996
十天之内没有人打扰他
and not to disturb him for ten days.

1923
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:14,875
那本书就是《震撼世界的十天》
And that became Ten Days That Shook The World.

1924
01:54:16,082 --> 01:54:17,275
估计是这样
Supposedly.

1925
01:54:17,784 --> 01:54:20,672
他获得了巨大的成功
He was an enormous, enormous success,

1926
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,608
这次成功改变了他的一生
and this success largely changed his whole life, I think,

1927
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:28,722
因为他发现有些东西他能做好
'cause he found out there was something that he could do well,

1928
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:30,750
比任何人都做得好
do practically better than anyone else.

1929
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:34,224
同志们，捕捉社会主义党革命者的计划
"Comrades, we have made a great stride forward in our program

1930
01:54:34,335 --> 01:54:36,996
取得了重大的进展
"to capture the Socialist Party for Revolution.

1931
01:54:37,104 --> 01:54:40,095
右翼党派的统治已经结束
"The time of right-wing domination of the party has ended.

1932
01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:43,734
他们还没来得及 像俄国革命那样炫耀
"They have fallen before the shining example of revolutionary Russia

1933
01:54:43,845 --> 01:54:45,903
就像保龄球瓶一样倒下了
"like so many bowling pins!

1934
01:54:48,383 --> 01:54:51,374
同志们，我们比预想的还要做得好
"Comrades, we have done better than we could have dreamed.

1935
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,010
在社会党执行委员会中
"The left wing has won 12 of the 15 seats

1936
01:54:54,156 --> 01:54:56,077
左翼取得15票中的12票胜出
"on the Socialist Party Executive,

1937
01:54:56,193 --> 01:55:00,084
包括我自己 埃蒙・麦阿派尼和杰克・雷德
"including myself, Edmund MacAlpine and Jack Reed."

1938
01:55:08,408 --> 01:55:11,502
他从此平步青云
He took a tremendous jump forward from there on.

1939
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:15,037
他成了工人阶级革命者
He became a revolutionist on the workers' side,

1940
01:55:15,483 --> 01:55:18,281
对威尔逊这样的人 已经不再抱有任何幻想
and he had no more illusions about people like Wilson.

1941
01:55:18,421 --> 01:55:19,580
我们都有问题
We all have problems.

1942
01:55:19,688 --> 01:55:22,611
你不能逃避问题，是不是？
You can't escape having problems, don't you know?

1943
01:55:22,757 --> 01:55:25,782
但要从人性角度考虑这个问题
But to take on the problem of all humanity,

1944
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,015
来挽救人性
to save all humanity,

1945
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:31,257
老天，对耶稣而言，那也是天大的事
my God, that was too big even for Jesus Christ.

1946
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:33,457
耶稣就是这样被钉死在十字架上
Don't you know he got himself crucified?

1947
01:55:33,969 --> 01:55:36,857
我们要怎么才能做到这些事情？
How the hell do we expect to do those things?

1948
01:55:42,765 --> 01:55:44,100
Oh.

1949
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:50,444
路易丝，是你吗？
Louise. Is that you?

1950
01:55:51,052 --> 01:55:52,484
你好，哈瑞
Hello, Harry.

1951
01:55:53,454 --> 01:55:56,650
最近去哪了？好久不见
Well, where have you been lately? I haven't seen you in a long time.

1952
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,814
是的，会议要开一整天吗？
That's right. Is this thing gonna last all day?

1953
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,620
可能吧，我们已经被排挤出来了
It might. We've been kicked out.

1954
01:56:00,762 --> 01:56:03,218
-被排挤出哪？ -社会党
- Kicked out of what? - The Socialist Party.

1955
01:56:03,364 --> 01:56:05,786
-等等，是谁干的？ -那屋子里的每一个人
- Wait, wait. Who got kicked out? - Everybody in that room.

1956
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:07,628
执行委员会把我们赶了出来
The Executive Committee kicked us all out.

1957
01:56:07,735 --> 01:56:11,397
-整个左翼？ -对，他们宣布投票无效
- The whole left wing? - That's right. They nullified the election.

1958
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:13,435
-他们能这样做吗？ -已经做了
- Can they do that? - They've done it.

1959
01:56:13,541 --> 01:56:14,871
我们占多数，我们有投票权
We're the majority. We have the votes.

1960
01:56:14,975 --> 01:56:16,373
但我们却被同僚排挤了出来
We weren't expelled by the membership.

1961
01:56:16,477 --> 01:56:17,966
被执行委员踢了出来
We were expelled by the executives.

1962
01:56:18,078 --> 01:56:19,738
而你还口口声声叫我们
And you're talking about doing exactly

1963
01:56:19,847 --> 01:56:21,677
按照执行委员会的话去做
what the Executive Committee wants us to do.

1964
01:56:21,782 --> 01:56:23,578
将党拱手相让！
Give the party back to them without a fight!

1965
01:56:23,684 --> 01:56:25,947
对，我们自己组织政党
Yes! And organize our own party!

1966
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:28,874
去你的，路易 社会党本来就是我们自己的党
Goddamn it, Louis, the Socialist Party is our own party!

1967
01:56:28,988 --> 01:56:31,217
我们是通过党员投票当权
We were voted into power by its membership

1968
01:56:31,358 --> 01:56:33,313
绝不能被执行委员赶走
and we can't be expelled by the executives.

1969
01:56:33,427 --> 01:56:36,850
这是非法的举动 如果我们据理而争，我们会赢
It's an illegal act, and if we fight it at the convention, we'll win.

1970
01:56:36,963 --> 01:56:38,088
为什么一定要争？
Why do we have to fight?

1971
01:56:38,198 --> 01:56:39,425
你这么说什么意思？
What do you mean, "Why do we have to fight?"

1972
01:56:39,532 --> 01:56:41,055
大家都是为党尽忠…
For what do we stay in a party

1973
01:56:41,168 --> 01:56:44,796
为什么非要争个你死我活？
in which we must win control from the minority, not once, but twice?

1974
01:56:44,904 --> 01:56:47,394
什么意思，路易？ 如果有些东西要争取才能得来…
Well, what is it, Louis? You mean, if we must fight for what we deserve,

1975
01:56:47,507 --> 01:56:50,304
那就不要争取是吗？ 这就是你的革命思想？
then to hell with it? Is that your idea of revolution?

1976
01:56:50,411 --> 01:56:53,106
路易，我想再听听你其他的革命理念
I'd like to hear more about your revolutionary concept, Louis.

1977
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:56,341
我的革命思想 不是我们政党的革命思想
My idea of revolution is not a revolution in my own party!

1978
01:56:56,449 --> 01:57:00,441
我们的社会党不是唇枪舌剑的政党
And my idea of a socialist party is not a debating society!

1979
01:57:00,521 --> 01:57:02,078
是一个行动的政党！
It is a party of action!

1980
01:57:02,188 --> 01:57:04,314
好…
Fine! Fine.

1981
01:57:05,058 --> 01:57:08,015
我们能给的最好例子就是召开大会…
The best example we can give them is go to that convention

1982
01:57:08,127 --> 01:57:09,491
控制好这个党
and take control of the party!

1983
01:57:09,596 --> 01:57:11,551
不，我们自己组织党
No! We form our own party!

1984
01:57:11,664 --> 01:57:14,996
我希望相信布尔什维克的在座各位…
And I hope that everybody here who believe in Bolshevism

1985
01:57:15,101 --> 01:57:18,365
当晚能来帮助组织一个党
will be there that night to help found that party!

1986
01:57:22,976 --> 01:57:24,863
但是你错了
All right, but I say you're wrong,

1987
01:57:24,978 --> 01:57:28,242
我会支持社会党的惯例…
and I say that I'm gonna be there at that Socialist Party convention

1988
01:57:28,347 --> 01:57:31,736
争取属于自己的席位 我也敦促在座的各位
to take the seat that belongs to me, and I urge everyone here today

1989
01:57:31,818 --> 01:57:34,513
不要放弃属于自己的席位
to be there to take the seats that belong to you!

1990
01:57:35,955 --> 01:57:38,218
他们好像想脱离群众意义
It's almost like they want to be separated from the masses.

1991
01:57:38,357 --> 01:57:40,688
他们想脱离群众，就是这样
They do want to be separated from the masses. That's the point.

1992
01:57:41,126 --> 01:57:42,251
我们走
Let's go.

1993
01:57:43,963 --> 01:57:46,089
我一直都是少数派
I've been in a minority before.

1994
01:57:47,332 --> 01:57:48,457
嗨
Hello.

1995
01:57:54,973 --> 01:57:56,496
他之所以喜欢草稿宣言…
While he liked the draft manifesto,

1996
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,438
是因为他有点害怕社会爱国者条款
he's a bit nervous about the social-patriot clause.

1997
01:57:58,543 --> 01:58:00,271
-打断一下 -按道理说，他要遇到麻烦了
- Excuse me. - Tactically, he's gonna be trouble.

1998
01:58:00,379 --> 01:58:02,175
他是要求他的人服从惯例 还是不服从？
Is he gonna bring his people to the convention or not?

1999
01:58:02,282 --> 01:58:03,680
这人可以跟你谈上一年的理论
The man will talk theory with you all year.

2000
01:58:03,782 --> 01:58:05,544
我不这么想，他会支持佛莱纳
Well, I don't think so. He'll go with Fraina.

2001
01:58:05,617 --> 01:58:08,449
不是很好吗？ 他喜欢那宣言，卡诺夫斯基怎么样？
Isn't that nice? He likes the manifesto. How about Carnofsky?

2002
01:58:08,587 --> 01:58:10,781
杰克，我们可能得不到 预想的那么多支持
I don't think we're gonna have as much support as we thought, Jack.

2003
01:58:10,922 --> 01:58:12,786
我们单刀直入，卡诺夫斯基会怎么说？
We're gonna get in. What did Carnofsky say?

2004
01:58:12,891 --> 01:58:14,687
-他持反对意见 -我告诉你，杰克
- Carnofsky said no. - I'm telling you, Jack...

2005
01:58:14,793 --> 01:58:16,987
-了解自己的… -一半的佛莱纳支持者会来…
- Just knowing on our own... - Half of Fraina's people would come...

2006
01:58:17,095 --> 01:58:20,086
进来！路易丝，你让它安静点行不行？
Come in! Louise, please keep her quiet, will you?

2007
01:58:20,264 --> 01:58:21,423
-嗨，埃迪 -怎么…
- Hi, Eddie. - How can...

2008
01:58:21,532 --> 01:58:24,193
-嗨，埃迪 -嗨，路易丝，本
- Hello, Eddie. - Hello, Louise, Ben.

2009
01:58:24,303 --> 01:58:25,257
嗨
Hey.

2010
01:58:26,471 --> 01:58:27,903
埃迪，列文怎么样？
Eddie, what about Levine?

2011
01:58:30,308 --> 01:58:32,400
埃迪？
- Eddie? - Yeah.

2012
01:58:33,110 --> 01:58:36,203
-列文说了什么？ -他没出现，他…
- What did Levine say? - He never showed. He...

2013
01:58:36,682 --> 01:58:38,239
我等了一个多小时
I waited over an hour.

2014
01:58:38,316 --> 01:58:40,647
-列文没有露面 -这可不像他的风格
- Levine didn't show. - That doesn't sound like Levine.

2015
01:58:40,751 --> 01:58:42,581
对，你们在哪里见面？
Sure it does. Where were you meeting?

2016
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,743
在凯西家
In Casey's.

2017
01:58:43,889 --> 01:58:46,812
惊讶，真是惊讶
Now, that surprises me. That really surprises me.

2018
01:58:47,224 --> 01:58:49,088
我可能没碰着他
I could have missed him.

2019
01:58:50,428 --> 01:58:51,724
那边真的很忙
It was really busy in there.

2020
01:58:51,829 --> 01:58:53,591
-没碰着他？ -什么意思？
- You could have missed him? - What's that supposed to mean?

2021
01:58:54,865 --> 01:58:56,058
我迟到了
I was late.

2022
01:58:57,735 --> 01:58:58,962
迟了多久？
How late?

2023
01:59:01,972 --> 01:59:03,962
40到45分钟
Forty, forty-five minutes.

2024
01:59:04,975 --> 01:59:07,829
诺拉今天早上又开始吐血
Nora started spitting up blood again this morning.

2025
01:59:10,548 --> 01:59:11,809
我必须带她去诊所
I had to take her to the clinic,

2026
01:59:11,915 --> 01:59:15,441
我还要等我妈妈来接我的孩子
and I had to wait for my mother to come and pick up the kid.

2027
01:59:15,853 --> 01:59:17,774
你迟到了45分钟
So you were 45 minutes late.

2028
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:21,883
我以为我能赶到，真的
Yeah. I thought I could make it. I really did.

2029
01:59:22,025 --> 01:59:24,151
好吧，我们要联系这人 怎么联系？
All right, we gotta get in touch with the guy. How do we do it?

2030
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:25,749
他现在正在去芝加哥的路上
He's on his way to Chicago.

2031
01:59:25,896 --> 01:59:28,159
所以我当时还以为他还在那里
That's one of the reasons I thought he would still be there.

2032
01:59:28,265 --> 01:59:29,822
等一下，你以为他还在那里？
Wait a minute, you thought he'd still be there?

2033
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,593
-是的 -埃迪，是谁要求见面的？
- Yeah. - Who asked for the meeting, Eddie?

2034
01:59:34,204 --> 01:59:36,159
-谁要求见面？ -谁要求见的面？
- Who asked for the meeting? - Who asked for the meeting?

2035
01:59:36,273 --> 01:59:38,570
-列文要见面？ -是的，我以为他想见面
- Did Levine want the meeting? - Yeah, I thought he wanted it.

2036
01:59:38,708 --> 01:59:40,197
他给我们打过电话吗？
Did he call us?

2037
01:59:40,877 --> 01:59:41,865
不，我们给他打的电话
No. We called him.

2038
01:59:41,978 --> 01:59:44,673
那他为什么还会等？ 是我们想见面
Then why would he wait? We wanted the meeting.

2039
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,845
对不起
I'm sorry.

2040
01:59:51,988 --> 01:59:54,547
为何不叫我们当中一个人代替你去？
Well, why didn't you call one of us and get somebody to take your place?

2041
01:59:55,992 --> 01:59:57,913
因为我以为我能赶到
Because I thought I could make it.

2042
01:59:58,027 --> 01:59:59,516
我以为他会在那里等
I mean, I thought the man would still be there.

2043
01:59:59,662 --> 02:00:03,358
你以为…不要自以为是，埃迪
You thought, you thought, you thought. Try not to think too much, Eddie.

2044
02:00:03,466 --> 02:00:06,299
同志们指靠你的时候，不要总自以为是
Not when your comrades are depending on you.

2045
02:00:07,371 --> 02:00:08,565
要确定
Be sure.

2046
02:00:13,944 --> 02:00:15,070
好吧
All right, look.

2047
02:00:15,179 --> 02:00:17,977
我们有没办法联系到芝加哥的列文？
Do we have a contact for Levine in Chicago?

2048
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:19,412
给辛格打电话
Let's call Singer.

2049
02:00:19,518 --> 02:00:22,043
-你有他的号码？ -可能有
- Do you have a number for him? - Yeah. Well, I've probably got it.

2050
02:00:25,323 --> 02:00:26,585
给
Here.

2051
02:00:27,894 --> 02:00:29,088
谢谢
Thanks.

2052
02:00:30,363 --> 02:00:31,523
别光是喝咖啡…
You know, they might work better

2053
02:00:31,631 --> 02:00:34,725
吃点别的东西对你的胃更好
if you put something in your stomach besides coffee.

2054
02:00:35,535 --> 02:00:38,424
现在这种情况 你对埃迪是不是太刻薄了？
You're a little hard on Eddie, aren't you, under the circumstances?

2055
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:40,461
你认为我的同情能够帮到 埃迪的妻子？
You think my sympathies can help Eddie's wife?

2056
02:00:40,574 --> 02:00:42,132
也许能帮到埃迪
Might help Eddie.

2057
02:00:42,242 --> 02:00:45,234
听我说，组建一个政党才能帮助埃迪
Listen to me. Building a party will help Eddie.

2058
02:00:52,921 --> 02:00:54,684
4，8，12…
Four, eight, twelve...

2059
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:04,929
我们都有相同的信仰
You know, I think we all believe in the same things.

2060
02:01:07,603 --> 02:01:09,002
我们之间
But with us,

2061
02:01:10,807 --> 02:01:13,173
或多或少都存在好的意图
it's more or less our good intentions.

2062
02:01:15,545 --> 02:01:17,740
和杰克，那是宗教信仰
And with Jack, it's a religion.

2063
02:01:27,091 --> 02:01:29,946
我们的老朋友杰克对我们太认真了
Our old friend Jack's getting serious on us.

2064
02:01:32,498 --> 02:01:34,955
[1919年，芝加哥]

2065
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,592
你好，弗兰克
Okay. Hey, Frank, how are you?

2066
02:01:36,735 --> 02:01:38,032
你好
How are you?

2067
02:01:41,474 --> 02:01:43,430
请问发生什么事了？
Excuse me. What's happening here?

2068
02:01:43,543 --> 02:01:46,376
执行委员会有令，没有红本本不准入内
No one's admitted without a red card. That's the order of the Executive.

2069
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:48,777
我也是执行委员，他也是，他也是…
Well, I'm on the Executive, so is he, so is he...

2070
02:01:48,882 --> 02:01:51,373
-没有红本本不准入内 -哪里能弄到红本本？
- No one's admitted without a red card. - Where do we get the red cards?

2071
02:01:51,484 --> 02:01:53,349
找资格审查委员会
You'll have to take that up with the Credentials Committee.

2072
02:01:53,454 --> 02:01:54,682
资格审查委员会在哪？
And where's the Credentials Committee?

2073
02:01:54,722 --> 02:01:55,051
资格审查委员会在哪？
And where's the Credentials Committee?

2074
02:01:55,155 --> 02:01:56,588
不知道
I don't know.

2075
02:01:57,091 --> 02:01:59,116
我看他不希望我们进去
I don't think he wants us to go in there.

2076
02:01:59,193 --> 02:02:01,081
与高层人谈话就是难
Well, the way to take the hall is to take the hall.

2077
02:02:01,195 --> 02:02:02,492
埃蒙！
Edmund!

2078
02:02:02,597 --> 02:02:04,030
埃蒙！杰克！
Edmund! Jack!

2079
02:02:04,766 --> 02:02:08,156
好了，我们走，快来，这边
Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, this way!

2080
02:02:11,706 --> 02:02:14,903
在提出议程之前，我先宣布…
To propose the agenda, I would like to read a message

2081
02:02:15,011 --> 02:02:18,640
资格审查委员会致台下各位的通告
from the Credentials Committee to the floor.

2082
02:02:18,781 --> 02:02:21,841
请后边肃静一下好吗？
May we please have order back there?

2083
02:02:22,552 --> 02:02:24,645
大厅后边的先生们，请…
In the back of the hall, could we have...

2084
02:02:24,755 --> 02:02:28,247
警官，请过去后面看看发生什么事
Sergeant-at-arms, would you see what's going on back there?

2085
02:02:28,692 --> 02:02:32,150
女士们先生们，看来有一群擅闯者…
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems we have a group of intruders

2086
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:34,595
试图接管此次会议
who are trying to take over this conference.

2087
02:02:34,832 --> 02:02:36,823
我们不会让他们得逞
We're not going to let them.

2088
02:02:36,935 --> 02:02:40,701
请坐下，清理通道
Now, please, please sit down. I need these aisles clear.

2089
02:02:40,805 --> 02:02:43,968
警官，清理通道
Sergeant-at-arms, I must have these aisles clear!

2090
02:02:44,075 --> 02:02:45,940
各位请坐下
Please, everyone, sit down.

2091
02:02:46,178 --> 02:02:49,033
这些布尔什维克支持者…
Now, these are Bolshevik sympathizers

2092
02:02:49,148 --> 02:02:53,244
试图篡夺党政，我们绝对不容许
who are trying to take over this party, and we're not going to let them.

2093
02:02:53,452 --> 02:02:55,283
警察马上就到
The police are coming.

2094
02:02:56,222 --> 02:03:01,046
那些人不是社会主义者，而是暴徒
These people aren't socialists. These people are just thugs!

2095
02:03:01,428 --> 02:03:03,760
看到了吗？这就是布尔什维克的勾当！
Now you see? That is Bolshevik tactics!

2096
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,821
代表们，这些人是冒名顶替者
Come on, delegates. These people are imposters!

2097
02:03:05,933 --> 02:03:08,060
他们并不是我们选举出来的领导人
They were not elected to the leadership of this party.

2098
02:03:08,169 --> 02:03:10,262
女士们先生们，警察来了
Ladies and gentlemen, the police are coming!

2099
02:03:11,706 --> 02:03:14,038
-看到了吗，警官？ -怎么回事？
- You see? The police. - What the hell is this?

2100
02:03:14,141 --> 02:03:17,099
执行委员会能够当权的唯一伎俩…
That's the only way the Executive Committee can stay in power,

2101
02:03:17,245 --> 02:03:18,974
就是利用资本主义警察
is by the use of the capitalist police.

2102
02:03:19,081 --> 02:03:20,309
把红本本拿出来
Flash your red cards!

2103
02:03:20,415 --> 02:03:22,838
他们不择手段让工人阶级…
They'll resort to any tactics to keep the working class

2104
02:03:22,951 --> 02:03:26,307
远离真正的领导人，因为他们害怕革命
away from its true leadership because they're afraid of revolution!

2105
02:03:26,421 --> 02:03:30,710
警官，没有红本本的人不是这里的人
Officers, whoever has no red card does not belong in this room.

2106
02:03:30,827 --> 02:03:31,919
举起红本本
Hold up your red cards.

2107
02:03:32,028 --> 02:03:34,656
好吧，我们走，不用你们赶
It's all right. We're going. You don't have to throw us out.

2108
02:03:34,764 --> 02:03:36,459
如果你们想知道
If you want to know where the true leadership

2109
02:03:36,566 --> 02:03:38,193
美国社会党真正领袖在哪里
of the Socialist Party of America is,

2110
02:03:38,268 --> 02:03:41,157
五分钟之后在大楼地下室见
it'll be in the basement of this building in five minutes...

2111
02:03:41,271 --> 02:03:44,035
-出示红本本 -欢迎你们加入
- Red cards, everybody! ...and you're welcome to join us.

2112
02:03:44,174 --> 02:03:47,962
没有红本本的人通通出去
I want anybody who does not have a red card to be out of this hall.

2113
02:04:35,531 --> 02:04:38,625
主席同志，我提议 我们该马上组建一个…
Comrade Chairman, I move that we immediately constitute ourselves

2114
02:04:38,734 --> 02:04:40,395
真正的共产党
as the bona fide Communist party,

2115
02:04:40,503 --> 02:04:42,767
名字叫美国共产主义劳工党
and that we call ourselves the Communist Labor Party of America.

2116
02:04:42,872 --> 02:04:43,861
赞成！
I second that motion!

2117
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:46,067
如果我们要组建一个真正的革命党
Well, look, if we're gonna have a really revolutionary party,

2118
02:04:46,176 --> 02:04:48,838
那么我们应该向美国工人征求意见
I think what we have to do is to find out from the American worker

2119
02:04:48,945 --> 02:04:51,675
然后我们再把信息反馈给他们
what he wants the most and then we have to translate it back to him

2120
02:04:51,816 --> 02:04:53,681
通过劳工运动的方式
in terms of the labor movement as a whole.

2121
02:04:53,784 --> 02:04:55,308
我们要做的就是让工人想了解更多
What we have to do is make him want more.

2122
02:04:55,453 --> 02:04:58,183
让他们迫切要求一场全面革命
We have to make him want the whole goddamn revolution.

2123
02:04:58,289 --> 02:05:00,814
楼上的那些人认为卡尔・马克思 只是一个…
Those people upstairs think that Karl Marx was somebody

2124
02:05:00,925 --> 02:05:02,552
擅长编写反托拉斯法案的人
who wrote a good antitrust law.

2125
02:05:02,661 --> 02:05:04,822
不管我们自己的党叫社会主义劳工党
And whether we call our party the Socialist Labor Party

2126
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:07,160
还是真正社会主义党，不管叫什么
or the Real Socialist Communist... Whatever we call the party,

2127
02:05:07,265 --> 02:05:09,460
都不重要，因为…
it doesn't matter because it...

2128
02:05:10,502 --> 02:05:12,231
路易，你迷路了吗？
Hello, Lou, are you lost?

2129
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:15,296
没有，我是来告诉朋友们
No. I'm not lost. I'm here to tell my friends

2130
02:05:15,408 --> 02:05:17,968
这个新组建的美国共产党
that the newly-formed Communist Party of America

2131
02:05:18,044 --> 02:05:21,275
将要在蓝岛大街会见苏联代表
is meeting at the Russian Federation on Blue Island Avenue.

2132
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,473
欢迎大家报名参加
We welcome your applications.

2133
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:26,141
新党员将会基于个人成份来判定
They will be judged on an individual basis.

2134
02:05:26,286 --> 02:05:27,913
你要判定我们的申请人？
You're gonna judge our applications?

2135
02:05:28,055 --> 02:05:29,977
我们要向你申请党员资格？
We're gonna apply to you for membership?

2136
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:32,479
主席同志，我要重申这个问题
Comrade Chairman, I'd like to call that question, please.

2137
02:05:32,626 --> 02:05:34,321
前面的提议已经得到通过
The motion has been made and seconded that

2138
02:05:34,429 --> 02:05:37,887
我们要立即组建一个真正的共产党
we immediately constitute ourselves as the bona fide Communist party

2139
02:05:37,999 --> 02:05:41,025
称之为美国共产主义劳工党
and that we call ourselves the Communist Labor Party of America.

2140
02:05:41,136 --> 02:05:43,525
赞成的人请表个态
All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.

2141
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:44,663
赞成！
Aye!

2142
02:05:44,774 --> 02:05:46,662
有无人反对？提议通过
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2143
02:05:48,277 --> 02:05:49,904
同志们…
Comrades! Comrades!

2144
02:05:50,012 --> 02:05:53,778
同志们，内部斗争是个错误
Comrades, this is the wrong time to be fighting against one another.

2145
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:56,875
我们应该联合起来对付资本主义
We should be united in our struggle against the capitalists.

2146
02:05:57,019 --> 02:05:59,043
路易，我们6周前就已经考虑过
You should have thought of that six weeks ago, Louis.

2147
02:05:59,188 --> 02:06:01,678
如果你的人支持我们，我们早已占大多数
If your people had stayed with us, we'd have had a majority,

2148
02:06:01,823 --> 02:06:03,585
我们早就当政
and we'd be in control of that convention upstairs.

2149
02:06:03,691 --> 02:06:05,385
我们的成员是你的五倍
We have five times your membership!

2150
02:06:05,492 --> 02:06:07,982
路易，你的算法跟你的政策一样愚蠢
Louis, your arithmetic's something like your politics.

2151
02:06:08,095 --> 02:06:11,655
我们要去蓝岛大街会见苏联代表
We will be at the Russian Federation on Blue Island Avenue.

2152
02:06:11,798 --> 02:06:13,458
希望到时能见到你们
I hope to see some of you there.

2153
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:15,988
主席同志 我建议马上派出代表去莫斯科
Comrade Chairman, I move we immediately send a delegate to Moscow

2154
02:06:16,102 --> 02:06:17,625
为美国共产主义劳工党…
to gain recognition by the Comintern

2155
02:06:17,736 --> 02:06:19,293
争取国际共产主义的承认
for the Communist Labor Party of America,

2156
02:06:19,404 --> 02:06:22,031
-这个代表就是杰克・雷德 -赞同！
- and that delegate be Jack Reed. - Second the motion!

2157
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:24,164
提议通过，同意派遣杰克・雷德…
The motion has been made and seconded to send Jack Reed

2158
02:06:24,241 --> 02:06:26,231
作为国际共产主义代表前往莫斯科
to Moscow immediately as the international delegate

2159
02:06:26,343 --> 02:06:28,298
为美国共产主义劳工党…
to obtain recognition of the Comintern

2160
02:06:28,411 --> 02:06:30,605
争取国际共产主义的承认
for the Communist Labor Party of America.

2161
02:06:30,747 --> 02:06:32,737
赞同的请表态
All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.

2162
02:06:32,882 --> 02:06:33,836
赞成
Aye!

2163
02:06:33,983 --> 02:06:36,007
有无人反对？提议通过
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2164
02:06:37,252 --> 02:06:39,845
既然第一条提议…
Since the first question I'm going to be asked...

2165
02:06:39,954 --> 02:06:41,181
好了，谢谢
All right, thank you.

2166
02:06:41,289 --> 02:06:43,711
同志们 既然共产国际对我的第一个要求…
All right, comrades, since the first question I'm gonna be asked

2167
02:06:43,825 --> 02:06:46,588
是关于党员的适合性
by the Comintern is gonna be about membership eligibility,

2168
02:06:46,693 --> 02:06:49,388
那么我会很清楚我们的地位…
I think I'm gonna have to be very clear what our position is

2169
02:06:49,496 --> 02:06:51,417
与国外语言联盟有重要关系
in relation to the Foreign Language Federation.

2170
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:53,759
我要准确说出我们的要求就是…
I'm gonna have to say exactly what our requirements are

2171
02:06:53,866 --> 02:06:55,127
反对任何其他的群体
as opposed to any other group,

2172
02:06:55,234 --> 02:06:57,895
我想在我们的党章中 应该明确规定…
and I think we'll have to make it clear on our Platform Committee

2173
02:06:57,969 --> 02:06:59,333
在宣言里要说明
and be very clear in the manifesto.

2174
02:06:59,437 --> 02:07:00,664
-杰克，祝你莫斯科好运 -好，哈瑞
- Good luck in Moscow, Jack! - Okay, Harry.

2175
02:07:00,772 --> 02:07:03,535
你的人认为没有我你同样可以运作报社
Well, I guess you boys think you can run a newspaper without me.

2176
02:07:17,519 --> 02:07:18,974
嗨，杰茜
Hello, Jessie.

2177
02:07:22,022 --> 02:07:23,045
乖孩子
Good girl.

2178
02:07:25,693 --> 02:07:27,387
-嗨 -嗨
- Hello. - Hello.

2179
02:08:04,424 --> 02:08:07,881
我跟你直说吧，杰克 我不会跟你去的
Let me make it easy for you, Jack. I'm not going with you.

2180
02:08:14,799 --> 02:08:17,824
如果你要去 我不知道我会不会等你回来
And if you go, I'm not sure I'll be here when you get back.

2181
02:08:19,203 --> 02:08:23,992
路易丝，共产国际并不认识 埃蒙或者埃弗德…
Louise, you know, the Comintern doesn't know Edmund or Alfred

2182
02:08:24,107 --> 02:08:26,097
这些纽约来的北方佬 他们只认识我
from the New York Yankees. They know me.

2183
02:08:26,209 --> 02:08:28,733
要去那里的人一定要有背景
Somebody's got to go over there who's got a background.

2184
02:08:32,547 --> 02:08:34,502
我们圣诞节就回来
We'd be back by Christmas.

2185
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,185
我们不能跟佛莱纳合并
We can't merge with Fraina.

2186
02:08:40,288 --> 02:08:42,152
不可能在成员适应性 跟他取得共识
We can't deal with him on membership eligibility.

2187
02:08:42,255 --> 02:08:44,347
他不会接受我们一半的党员
He wouldn't accept half of our people.

2188
02:08:44,491 --> 02:08:46,720
这人不会干别的事 只会让自己远离那些…
The man is gonna do nothing but alienate himself

2189
02:08:46,859 --> 02:08:49,315
潜在的广阔的支援基础
from any potential broad base of support.

2190
02:08:49,428 --> 02:08:50,883
他是个社会独立份子
He's sociologically isolated,

2191
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:52,519
从程序上说，他根本处理不了…
programmatically he's impossible to deal with...

2192
02:08:52,664 --> 02:08:54,619
你是说他是外国人？
You mean he's a foreigner?

2193
02:08:54,966 --> 02:08:56,364
别这样，路易丝
Don't do that, Louise.

2194
02:08:56,467 --> 02:08:57,831
六个月前，你们还是朋友
Six months ago, you were friends.

2195
02:08:57,936 --> 02:08:59,392
这些人根本就不会说英语
These people can barely speak English.

2196
02:08:59,504 --> 02:09:01,961
他们甚至不想融入美国生活
They don't even want to be integrated into American life.

2197
02:09:02,373 --> 02:09:04,568
外语联盟也不会在 美国创造布尔什维克语
The Foreign Language Federations aren't gonna create Bolshevism

2198
02:09:04,676 --> 02:09:07,338
只不过是照搬俄国人的规矩
in America any more than eating borscht will.

2199
02:09:07,445 --> 02:09:09,003
做俄国人，不一定要革命
Being Russian doesn't make a revolution.

2200
02:09:09,113 --> 02:09:10,239
你以为美国工人…
Do you think the American workers

2201
02:09:10,315 --> 02:09:11,873
会被苏联同盟所领导？
are gonna be led by the Russian federations?

2202
02:09:11,983 --> 02:09:14,008
或者像佛莱纳那样的意大利人？
Or an insular Italian like Louis Fraina?

2203
02:09:14,118 --> 02:09:16,575
他也不可能在这个国家领导革命
He has no possibility of leading a revolution in this country.

2204
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:17,847
你会有所不同吗？
Unlike you?

2205
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:19,752
我只是说这个国家的革命…
I'm just saying that the revolution in this country

2206
02:09:19,891 --> 02:09:21,188
不会被移民者所领导
is not gonna be led by immigrants.

2207
02:09:21,292 --> 02:09:25,786
革命？在这个国家？ 什么时候？圣诞之后吗？
Revolution? In this country? When, Jack? Just after Christmas?

2208
02:09:26,097 --> 02:09:28,019
就算我们准备好了，你以为我们这次…
Well, what do you think we could've done with the steel strike

2209
02:09:28,132 --> 02:09:29,156
钢铁罢工就能成功？
if we'd been ready?

2210
02:09:29,267 --> 02:09:32,657
区区3万用理论武装头脑的党员
30,000 party members all armed with a unified theory and program

2211
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:35,102
就能领导36.5万的钢铁工人罢工？
leading 365,000 steelworkers?

2212
02:09:35,206 --> 02:09:36,969
关键在于领导
What it takes is leadership.

2213
02:09:37,075 --> 02:09:39,407
我们要获得莫斯科那边的认可
And we gotta get it by getting recognition from Moscow.

2214
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:40,943
-我一定要去 -你不一定要去
- I have to go. - You don't have to go.

2215
02:09:41,045 --> 02:09:43,809
是你想要去，你想要征服整个世界…
You want to go. You want to go running all over the world ranting and raving

2216
02:09:43,881 --> 02:09:46,247
组织高加索人领导革命
and making resolutions and organizing caucuses.

2217
02:09:46,351 --> 02:09:48,148
共产党与共产主义劳工党…
What's the difference between the Communist Party

2218
02:09:48,252 --> 02:09:49,549
有何区别？
and the Communist Labor Party

2219
02:09:49,687 --> 02:09:51,882
除了你跟他各自为政之外 还有区别吗？
except that you're running one and he's running the other?

2220
02:09:52,023 --> 02:09:54,150
-我已经答应了 -答应什么？
- I've made a commitment. - To what?

2221
02:09:55,193 --> 02:09:57,889
找到四分之一左翼 与二分之一左翼的区别
To the fine distinction between which half of the left of the left

2222
02:09:57,996 --> 02:10:01,295
就能让莫斯科认可真正的 美国共产主义劳工党？
is recognized by Moscow as the real Communist Party in America?

2223
02:10:01,399 --> 02:10:04,596
无耻的政治家与卑鄙的政治家争论不休
To petty political squabbling between humorless and hack politicians

2224
02:10:04,702 --> 02:10:06,863
只是在左翼教条上浪费时间吗？
just wasting their time on left-wing dogma?

2225
02:10:07,638 --> 02:10:09,697
获得苏联那边的认可…
To getting the endorsement of a committee in Russia

2226
02:10:09,807 --> 02:10:10,933
就能说明共产国际承认下的…
you call the International

2227
02:10:11,042 --> 02:10:13,567
你和地下室那14个朋友…
for your group of 14 intellectual friends in the basement

2228
02:10:13,678 --> 02:10:15,976
就能让工人对这个国家提出要求？
who are supposed to tell the workers of this country what they want,

2229
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,604
就能说明他们要否执政？
whether they want it or not?

2230
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:26,755
写作吧，杰克
Write, Jack.

2231
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:31,119
你不是政治家，你是作家
You're not a politician, you're a writer.

2232
02:10:31,262 --> 02:10:32,991
你的写作成就已经超过…
And your writing has done more for the revolution

2233
02:10:33,097 --> 02:10:35,827
20年混战的成就，你知道的
than 20 years of this infighting can do, and you know it.

2234
02:10:36,901 --> 02:10:38,766
杰克，你是文学家
You're an artist, Jack.

2235
02:11:01,292 --> 02:11:02,486
别去
Don't go.

2236
02:11:03,661 --> 02:11:06,391
别放弃你的长处
Don't run away from what you do the best.

2237
02:11:09,934 --> 02:11:10,992
杰克
Jack.

2238
02:11:20,712 --> 02:11:22,373
我会在圣诞节前回来
I'll be back by Christmas.

2239
02:11:48,376 --> 02:11:51,106
我要去市里，你什么时候走？
I'm going into the city. When do you leave?

2240
02:11:51,214 --> 02:11:52,442
明天
Tomorrow.

2241
02:11:53,116 --> 02:11:55,505
-知道了 -我会在圣诞节前回来
- I see. - I'll be back by Christmas.

2242
02:11:56,486 --> 02:11:58,078
你会在家吗？
Will you be here?

2243
02:12:00,991 --> 02:12:03,824
不知道，见面的时候自然能见到你
I don't know. I'll see you when I see you.

2244
02:12:20,412 --> 02:12:24,234
你的护照和证件，你叫詹姆斯・格雷
Here. Your passport and papers. Your name's James Gormley.

2245
02:12:26,019 --> 02:12:27,179
快去吧
Go now!

2246
02:13:11,536 --> 02:13:15,165
雷德太太，请坐
Well, Mrs. Reed. Sit down.

2247
02:13:16,074 --> 02:13:17,803
有什么事吗？
What can I do for you?

2248
02:13:17,909 --> 02:13:20,901
你好吗，尤金？
Hello, Gene. How are you?

2249
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:24,937
我很好，你呢？
Fine. And you?

2250
02:13:25,785 --> 02:13:27,013
我很好
I'm fine.

2251
02:13:39,934 --> 02:13:41,162
坐
Sit down.

2252
02:13:47,176 --> 02:13:50,566
-杰克怎么样？ -他很好，他去了俄国
- How's Jack? - He's fine. He's in Russia.

2253
02:13:50,679 --> 02:13:51,805
-是吗？ -是的
- Is he? - Yes.

2254
02:13:51,914 --> 02:13:53,677
他要为共产主义劳工党…
He's trying to get recognition from the Comintern

2255
02:13:53,782 --> 02:13:55,909
争取共产国际的认可
for the Communist Labor Party.

2256
02:13:56,019 --> 02:13:58,874
他们的政党已经一分为二
You see, they've split into two different factions.

2257
02:13:59,155 --> 02:14:02,818
你呢？又是一个人孤单工作？
And you? Left alone with your work again?

2258
02:14:04,662 --> 02:14:05,651
不
No.

2259
02:14:06,063 --> 02:14:08,452
事实上是的，但我现在的工作不一样了
Well, actually, yes, but my work is different now.

2260
02:14:08,566 --> 02:14:11,364
我到处演讲我在俄国的经历
I do a lot of lecturing about what I saw in Russia.

2261
02:14:11,435 --> 02:14:12,993
哦，俄国
Ah, yes, Russia.

2262
02:14:14,106 --> 02:14:16,563
俄国对你跟杰克都很好
Russia's been good for you and Jack.

2263
02:14:16,875 --> 02:14:20,800
给你理由去约会，给他理由离开家
Given you a way to meet people, given him a reason to leave home.

2264
02:14:22,649 --> 02:14:23,775
俄国
Russia.

2265
02:14:25,084 --> 02:14:26,210
俄国
Russia.

2266
02:14:26,319 --> 02:14:29,015
你是偏激还是在生我气？
Are you really that cynical, or are you angry with me?

2267
02:14:29,122 --> 02:14:31,852
我真的很偏激，我干嘛要生你的气？
I'm really that cynical. Why would I be angry with you?

2268
02:14:31,959 --> 02:14:33,392
尤金，如果你去过俄国…
Gene, if you'd been to Russia,

2269
02:14:33,494 --> 02:14:35,519
那么你对任何事情都不会再偏激
you'd never be cynical about anything again.

2270
02:14:35,629 --> 02:14:38,427
你会看到寻常百姓都在转变
You would have seen people transformed. Ordinary people.

2271
02:14:38,532 --> 02:14:43,128
路易丝，当一个美国人的智慧双眼 闪闪发亮时我会很紧张
Louise, something in me tightens when an American intellectual's eyes shine

2272
02:14:43,405 --> 02:14:46,465
尤其是他们吹捧俄国人的时候
and they start to talk to me about the Russian people.

2273
02:14:46,608 --> 02:14:48,473
-等等… -我会说留意了
- Wait... - Something in me says, "Watch it.

2274
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:52,637
一个新版的爱尔兰天主教 已经提供给你新的信仰
"A new version of Irish Catholicism is being offered for your faith."

2275
02:14:52,815 --> 02:14:54,339
-不是的 -我就是不清楚…
- It's not like that. - And I wonder why

2276
02:14:54,483 --> 02:14:59,079
为什么见惯世面的路易丝・雷德…
a lovely wife like Louise Reed who's just seen the brave new world

2277
02:14:59,189 --> 02:15:01,555
会和我这么一个偏激狂坐在一起
is sitting around with a cynical bastard like me

2278
02:15:01,658 --> 02:15:05,583
而不是跟随理想主义的老公 在俄国驰骋疆场？
instead of trotting all over Russia with her idealistic husband.

2279
02:15:06,196 --> 02:15:09,825
这样的转变是值得的
It's almost worth being converted.

2280
02:15:13,071 --> 02:15:14,959
我来错地方了
Well, I was wrong to come.

2281
02:15:15,773 --> 02:15:19,698
你和杰克因为激进而拥有许多 中产阶级的梦想
You and Jack have a lot of middle-class dreams for two radicals.

2282
02:15:20,579 --> 02:15:23,969
杰克的梦想是能够领导美国工人
Jack dreams that he can hustle the American working man,

2283
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:26,846
而工人的梦想是不劳而获，坐享其成
whose one dream is to be rich enough not to have to work,

2284
02:15:26,986 --> 02:15:29,443
所以才加入了他所领导的政党
into a revolution led by his party.

2285
02:15:29,656 --> 02:15:32,489
你的梦想就是 在你跟某个男人上床之前…
And you dream that if you discuss the revolution with a man

2286
02:15:32,592 --> 02:15:34,287
如果你跟他讨论革命
before you go to bed with him,

2287
02:15:34,394 --> 02:15:36,726
那么你是在传教而非在做爱
it'll be missionary work rather than sex.

2288
02:15:37,398 --> 02:15:40,788
看到你跟你杰克这么认真对待 你的运动我深感难过
I'm sorry to see you and Jack so serious about your sports.

2289
02:15:40,901 --> 02:15:43,358
也对你感到失望，路易丝
It's particularly disappointing in you, Louise.

2290
02:15:43,471 --> 02:15:47,134
一享受到自由恋爱时，你就欲火焚身
You had a lighter touch when you were touting free love.

2291
02:15:49,711 --> 02:15:52,509
看不出来你已经成评论家了，尤金
Boy, you've become quite the critic, haven't you, Gene?

2292
02:15:52,615 --> 02:15:55,175
背靠椅子就能分析透彻我们
Just leaned back and analyzed us all.

2293
02:15:55,485 --> 02:15:58,113
被灌输自由恋爱思想的女人结了婚
Duplicitous women who tout free love and then get married,

2294
02:15:58,254 --> 02:16:00,449
盲从的记者加入了革命…
power-mad journalists who join the revolution

2295
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:01,818
而不是袖手旁观
instead of observing it,

2296
02:16:01,958 --> 02:16:04,051
中产阶级激进分子来寻欢作乐…
middle-class radicals who come looking for sex

2297
02:16:04,193 --> 02:16:05,649
顺便谈谈俄国革命
and then talk about Russia.

2298
02:16:05,762 --> 02:16:07,923
你这样的人真可悲
It must seem so contemptible to a man like you

2299
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:10,954
竟然还有勇气端坐在这里…
who has the courage to sit on his ass and observe human inadequacy

2300
02:16:11,067 --> 02:16:12,762
坐视人性的缺陷
from the inside of a bottle.

2301
02:16:12,869 --> 02:16:15,064
但我从未见你帮过任何人
Well, I've never seen you do anything for anyone.

2302
02:16:15,171 --> 02:16:16,627
也从未见你给别人任何东西
I've never seen you give anything to anyone,

2303
02:16:16,739 --> 02:16:20,129
所以我能理解你会怀疑 别人动机不良
so I can understand why you might suspect the motives of those who have.

2304
02:16:20,243 --> 02:16:22,609
不管杰克的动机是什么…
But whatever Jack's motives are, how...

2305
02:16:24,247 --> 02:16:26,442
我似乎触及到了你的伤口
I seem to have touched a wound.

2306
02:16:28,951 --> 02:16:30,350
你是个受伤的王八蛋
You're a wounding son of a bitch,

2307
02:16:30,486 --> 02:16:33,819
不管我给你带来什么伤害 你已经让我付出了代价
and whatever I've done to you, you've made me pay for it.

2308
02:16:35,658 --> 02:16:36,920
路易丝
Louise.

2309
02:17:06,055 --> 02:17:07,181
杰茜！
Jessie!

2310
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:10,782
嗨，杰茜，快回来
Hey, Jess, come on! Come here, Jess.

2311
02:17:11,194 --> 02:17:12,752
杰茜，回来
Jessie, come here.

2312
02:17:18,301 --> 02:17:19,461
杰茜
Jessie.

2313
02:17:56,472 --> 02:17:57,632
杰茜？
Jessie?

2314
02:18:15,591 --> 02:18:16,546
杰茜？
Jessie?

2315
02:18:16,692 --> 02:18:18,148
晚上好
- Oh! - Good evening.

2316
02:18:18,294 --> 02:18:20,421
经美国司法部长授权…
By the order of the Attorney General of the United States,

2317
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:22,225
米切尔・帕默探长奉命前来搜查
A. Mitchell Palmer, I have a warrant here

2318
02:18:22,331 --> 02:18:24,060
并逮捕约翰・雷德
for the arrest of one John Silas Reed.

2319
02:18:24,166 --> 02:18:25,929
弗兰克，上楼看看
Look upstairs, Frank.

2320
02:18:32,975 --> 02:18:35,102
-以什么罪名逮捕？ -煽动暴乱
- Arrest for what? - Sedition.

2321
02:18:35,845 --> 02:18:37,938
-他在哪里？ -什么煽动暴乱？
- Where is he? - What do you mean by sedition?

2322
02:18:38,014 --> 02:18:40,312
女士，别问我，问伍德洛・威尔逊
Lady, don't ask me. Ask Woodrow Wilson.

2323
02:18:40,416 --> 02:18:42,145
告诉我他在哪里
Just tell me where he is.

2324
02:18:47,657 --> 02:18:48,817
我看你不像是什么…
I don't suppose there's a chance

2325
02:18:48,958 --> 02:18:51,415
布尔什维克煽动家，是不是？
of you being a Bolshevik agitator, is there?

2326
02:18:52,228 --> 02:18:55,425
你干嘛不找找看 有什么煽动你的东西？
Why don't you just look around, and see how agitated you get?

2327
02:18:55,865 --> 02:18:57,821
在1919年
In 1919,

2328
02:18:58,401 --> 02:19:00,460
只有不到…
there were no more

2329
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:04,097
四五个美国人…
than four or five Americans

2330
02:19:04,373 --> 02:19:06,238
进入到苏联
who got into Russia

2331
02:19:06,442 --> 02:19:11,300
因为整个国家周边都被包围着
because the country was surrounded on all sides.

2332
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:15,572
当时有禁令，所以我们只能非法偷渡
You were actually forbidden to go, and you could only go illegally.

2333
02:19:15,785 --> 02:19:18,640
穿过芬兰是非常危险的
It was very dangerous to go through Finland.

2334
02:19:19,021 --> 02:19:21,478
因为芬兰是白色政权统治
Because the Finns were a White government,

2335
02:19:21,624 --> 02:19:24,548
那里反对红色政权
and they were bitterly opposed to the Reds.

2336
02:19:24,927 --> 02:19:26,724
他们决定将…
They decided to strangle

2337
02:19:26,829 --> 02:19:30,185
布尔什维克扼杀在摇篮之中
the revolutionary Bolshevik infant in its cradle.

2338
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:34,429
16支部队从东西两路进逼苏联…
And 16 armies went into Russia from the east and from the west,

2339
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:36,934
为了消灭布尔什维克势力…
for the purpose of wiping out the Bolsheviks

2340
02:19:37,039 --> 02:19:38,927
以及镇压革命
and wiping out the revolution

2341
02:19:39,041 --> 02:19:43,364
让基督教文明恢复到公正的地位
and restoring Christian civilization to its rightful place.

2342
02:20:09,138 --> 02:20:10,469
说英语吧
Speak English.

2343
02:20:10,573 --> 02:20:12,803
吃柠檬吧，很难吃得到的
Have a lemon. You won't see one for a long time.

2344
02:20:12,908 --> 02:20:16,332
谢谢，我只想知道你是否觉得…
Thank you. I just want to know if you think that I was clear

2345
02:20:16,445 --> 02:20:18,640
-我刚才说的已然清楚… -非常清楚
- in what I said about... - Eminently clear.

2346
02:20:18,714 --> 02:20:19,772
加盐吗？
Salt?

2347
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:23,213
-加盐？ -用来配柠檬
- Salt? - For the lemon.

2348
02:20:23,819 --> 02:20:25,116
谢谢
Thank you.

2349
02:20:27,223 --> 02:20:29,748
我看见你吃柠檬皮
I see you eat the peel with the lemon.

2350
02:20:30,059 --> 02:20:33,017
抵抗坏血病，洋葱也行
Fights the scurvy. So does the onion.

2351
02:20:33,829 --> 02:20:36,161
一起吃抵抗力更强
Together, they fight better.

2352
02:20:38,367 --> 02:20:40,892
我真正想知道的是…
You see, what I really wanted to do

2353
02:20:41,003 --> 02:20:43,563
您能不能坦率地回答…
was ask your frank opinion whether we...

2354
02:20:43,673 --> 02:20:46,767
我们党是否会得到委员会的认可
You think we'll get the endorsement from the committee.

2355
02:20:46,909 --> 02:20:49,833
-当然是非正式的问 -非正式？
- I ask unofficially, of course. - Unofficially?

2356
02:20:53,115 --> 02:20:55,106
非正式地，我不知道
Unofficially, I don't know.

2357
02:20:56,252 --> 02:20:58,584
这是一个…
Yeah, well, it's such a...

2358
02:20:58,888 --> 02:21:02,051
美国式的问题，我…
It's a peculiarly American problem and I...

2359
02:21:02,525 --> 02:21:05,187
-我说得够清楚吗？ -非常清楚
- You do think I was clear? - Quite clear.

2360
02:21:05,461 --> 02:21:09,488
但你的提议不一定能保证得到认可
In this case, however, clarity does not necessarily guarantee endorsement.

2361
02:21:09,699 --> 02:21:12,691
我不知道，也许会如此
Well, I don't know. In this case, I think perhaps it might.

2362
02:21:12,802 --> 02:21:16,568
实际上，我不…
You know, in fact, I don't...

2363
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:19,561
我其实是想做一个详细的报告
What I really want to do is to make a detailed report

2364
02:21:19,675 --> 02:21:22,508
让执行委员会了解美国的情况
for the Executive Committee to read on conditions in America.

2365
02:21:22,611 --> 02:21:25,671
我想把美国劳工联合会的整个历史…
You see, I'd like to deal in that report with the entire history

2366
02:21:25,748 --> 02:21:27,375
写在报告里面
of the American Federation of Labor.

2367
02:21:27,483 --> 02:21:29,644
我想写明它支持革命战争的立场
I'd like to deal with its support of the war, you see.

2368
02:21:29,752 --> 02:21:33,017
我要检举世界产业工人组织的迫害
And I'm gonna talk about the persecution of the IWW,

2369
02:21:33,155 --> 02:21:35,646
还要反映爱国社团的崛起
I'm gonna deal with the rise of the patrioteering societies,

2370
02:21:35,791 --> 02:21:37,656
以及举报社会党领导人的叛变
and the capitulation of leading socialists.

2371
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,251
-我要…我说得太快了吗？ -不，继续说
- I'm gonna... Am I speaking too quickly? - No, no. Go on.

2372
02:21:40,463 --> 02:21:45,162
我要反映美国劳工崛起的战斗性
And so I will deal with the rising militancy of American labor.

2373
02:21:45,334 --> 02:21:49,065
还有西雅图和温尼伯湖的罢工
I'll talk about the general strikes in Seattle and Winnipeg,

2374
02:21:49,171 --> 02:21:50,536
以及波士顿警察罢工
the Boston police strike.

2375
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:53,699
我要讨论普拉姆计划 以及左派的特殊态度和政策
I'm gonna discuss the Plumb Plan, and particularly the attitude

2376
02:21:53,809 --> 02:21:56,573
世界产业工人组织对他们的影响
and the policies of the AF of L and IWW toward them.

2377
02:21:56,679 --> 02:21:58,670
之后，我想重要的是…
Now, after that, I think it's important...

2378
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:08,478
雷德同志，共产国际执行委员会…
Comrade Reed, the Executive Committee of the Comintern

2379
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:11,922
决定对共产主义工党和美国共产党…
has decided against endorsing either the Communist Labor Party

2380
02:22:12,027 --> 02:22:13,983
不予承认
or the Communist Party of America,

2381
02:22:14,096 --> 02:22:17,020
随即命令两个政党马上合并
and instructs the two parties to merge forthwith.

2382
02:22:22,505 --> 02:22:23,733
这里坐，雷德同志
Sit here, Comrade Reed.

2383
02:22:23,839 --> 02:22:25,795
你的座位之所以被占用…
This time, your usual chair, as you can see,

2384
02:22:25,908 --> 02:22:28,866
是因为我们现在要详细研究美国的形势
is now occupied by your detailed report on American conditions.

2385
02:22:28,978 --> 02:22:31,469
一个非常深入的研究，非常清晰
A most penetrating study. Very, very clear.

2386
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:32,774
谢谢
Thank you.

2387
02:22:33,315 --> 02:22:35,476
显然，还不够清楚
Obviously, it wasn't clear enough.

2388
02:22:36,485 --> 02:22:37,611
拉德克同志
Comrade Radek,

2389
02:22:37,753 --> 02:22:40,244
我想，你们肯定搞错了…
I think there must have been some mistake

2390
02:22:40,389 --> 02:22:43,449
我回美国的旅程安排
about my travel arrangements about my return to the United States.

2391
02:22:44,393 --> 02:22:48,750
我好像还要去宣传部那里报到
Well, it seems as if I've been asked to report to the Propaganda Bureau.

2392
02:22:48,864 --> 02:22:49,990
没错
That is right.

2393
02:22:50,099 --> 02:22:53,455
雷德同志，执行委员会决定…
Comrade Reed, the Executive Committee has decided

2394
02:22:53,569 --> 02:22:56,163
宣传部非常需要你
you are very much needed at the Propaganda Bureau.

2395
02:22:56,272 --> 02:22:58,934
我们要你留在苏联工作，直到7月
We plan for you to remain in Soviet Russia until July.

2396
02:22:59,041 --> 02:23:01,100
宣传部非常欢迎你的到来
You're very welcome to the Bureau of Propaganda.

2397
02:23:01,210 --> 02:23:02,507
非常感谢
Well, thank you very much,

2398
02:23:02,611 --> 02:23:05,341
可是我的旅程已经安排好了
but I thought that these travel arrangements had been made.

2399
02:23:05,414 --> 02:23:07,712
我要去拉脱维亚或者芬兰边境
I have to get to the Latvian or the Finnish border.

2400
02:23:07,817 --> 02:23:09,978
你建议去哪个边境，雷德同志？
And to which border would you suggest, Comrade Reed?

2401
02:23:10,119 --> 02:23:12,576
我明白火车旅行此刻很危险
Well, I understand that train travel is very dangerous at the moment...

2402
02:23:12,721 --> 02:23:14,279
他为何要坐火车？
Why does he need a train?

2403
02:23:15,391 --> 02:23:18,690
因为我有很紧急的私人事项…
Because I have urgent personal considerations and responsibilities

2404
02:23:18,794 --> 02:23:20,955
-要回美国… -什么事项呢？
- in the United States and I... - Of what nature?

2405
02:23:21,864 --> 02:23:23,786
-你说什么？ -什么要事呢？
- Excuse me? - Of what nature?

2406
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:30,698
-我有家庭 -我们大家都有家庭
- I have a family. - We all have families.

2407
02:23:32,208 --> 02:23:36,599
我只能代表我自己说话 我要见我的妻子
Well, I can speak only for myself and I must see my wife.

2408
02:23:36,712 --> 02:23:38,145
这非常紧急
It's very urgent,

2409
02:23:39,348 --> 02:23:43,239
我只需要火车上一个座位
and I ask only for a single place on a train.

2410
02:23:43,352 --> 02:23:44,717
可你已经有座位了
But you have a place on the train!

2411
02:23:44,854 --> 02:23:46,845
你在这革命的火车上有座位了
You have a place on the train of this revolution.

2412
02:23:46,989 --> 02:23:49,321
你和其他革命者一样，都是最优秀的
You have been like so many others, the best revolutionaries.

2413
02:23:49,425 --> 02:23:51,757
你是这火车机车上的一个工程师
One of the engineers on the locomotive of this train

2414
02:23:51,861 --> 02:23:55,683
要让革命在党的领导下 顺着历史的轨迹…
that pulls this revolution on the tracks of historical necessity

2415
02:23:55,798 --> 02:23:57,390
全速前进
laid out for it by the party.

2416
02:23:57,499 --> 02:23:59,330
你现在不能离开，我们找不到人替代你
You can't leave us now. We can't replace you.

2417
02:23:59,435 --> 02:24:01,130
-你有什么权利离开… -我不确定
- What right do you have you to leave... - I'm not sure.

2418
02:24:01,237 --> 02:24:03,262
做什么？去见你的妻子？
To do what? To see your wife?

2419
02:24:03,372 --> 02:24:04,999
去年在国际议会上…
Last year at the International Congress

2420
02:24:05,107 --> 02:24:06,734
我得知我的儿子得了斑疹伤寒症…
I learned that my son was very ill of typhus.

2421
02:24:06,842 --> 02:24:08,366
我都没去看我的儿子
I didn't go to see my son

2422
02:24:08,477 --> 02:24:11,571
因为我知道政党需要我
because I knew I was needed where I was placed by the party.

2423
02:24:11,647 --> 02:24:12,636
你不明白的是…
What you don't understand is...

2424
02:24:12,748 --> 02:24:15,239
你想放弃这个重要时刻吗？
Would you like to abandon this moment in your life?

2425
02:24:15,351 --> 02:24:16,716
你还会得到这个时刻吗？
Would you ever get this moment again?

2426
02:24:16,819 --> 02:24:19,913
-我不会放弃革命！ -雷德同志，你是一名作家
- I am not abandoning the revolution! - Comrade Reed, you're a writer.

2427
02:24:20,055 --> 02:24:21,511
人们知道和尊重你的工作
People know and respect your work.

2428
02:24:21,624 --> 02:24:24,855
-你说话很有权威 -兹诺维耶同志
- You speak with authority of feeling. - Comrade Zinoviev,

2429
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:26,325
在过去的八个星期…
for the past eight weeks,

2430
02:24:26,428 --> 02:24:29,420
我完全不能和我妻子取得联系
I've been completely unable to communicate with my wife

2431
02:24:29,531 --> 02:24:32,022
或者和我在美国的朋友联系
or with my comrades in the United States.

2432
02:24:32,134 --> 02:24:33,897
我要回去，我想要你的帮助
I need to go back. I would like your help.

2433
02:24:34,003 --> 02:24:37,769
雷德同志，你可以回去做你的私事
Comrade Reed, you can always go back to your private responsibilities,

2434
02:24:37,873 --> 02:24:38,862
我也可以
so can I.

2435
02:24:38,974 --> 02:24:43,729
但你永远不会有这次历史性的机会了
You can never, never come back to this moment in history.

2436
02:24:44,446 --> 02:24:45,401
对不起
I'm sorry.

2437
02:24:45,514 --> 02:24:47,641
我无权牵扯到你的私生活
I have no right to tell you about your own life.

2438
02:24:47,750 --> 02:24:49,775
你比我更清楚
You know it better than I do.

2439
02:25:12,574 --> 02:25:14,769
逃离苏联可以说是难上加难
Maybe it was impossible to get out of Russia.

2440
02:25:14,877 --> 02:25:17,175
到处都是白军
There was White armies all around,

2441
02:25:17,246 --> 02:25:19,941
要成功逃亡简直就像做梦
so escape was not dreamt of.

2442
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:19,432
我们接到杰克的消息
We had a communication from Jack.

2443
02:26:19,536 --> 02:26:23,062
他在芬兰的监狱里，不能自由通话
He was in prison in Finland where he couldn't communicate freely.

2444
02:26:23,172 --> 02:26:25,560
但他传话给我…
But he got word out to me

2445
02:26:25,908 --> 02:26:28,364
让我捎口信给路易丝
to take a message to Louise.

2446
02:26:28,478 --> 02:26:31,503
我记得去到路易丝家，她就住在我附近
And I remember walking over to Louise, she lived right near me.

2447
02:26:31,814 --> 02:26:34,976
我去到路易丝在帕特森的公寓
I walked over to Louise's apartment on Patson Place,

2448
02:26:35,351 --> 02:26:38,308
跟她谈了一个晚上杰克的事
and spent an evening with her talking about Jack,

2449
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:42,480
她对杰克被困的消息非常激动
and she talked very earnestly about Jack's plight.

2450
02:26:54,368 --> 02:26:56,790
雷德夫人，美国政府无权干涉…
Mrs. Reed, the United States cannot involve itself

2451
02:26:56,904 --> 02:26:58,336
芬兰的内部事务
in the internal affairs of Finland.

2452
02:26:58,406 --> 02:27:00,134
难道美国领事…
Are you trying to tell me the American Consul

2453
02:27:00,241 --> 02:27:02,834
-不能给出任何消息？ -恐怕不能
- can't give you any information? - I'm afraid that there's nothing

2454
02:27:02,942 --> 02:27:05,398
-国务院对此无能为力 -别跟我说废话
- that the State Department can do. - Don't give me that garbage.

2455
02:27:05,512 --> 02:27:07,877
如果他的名字是洛克菲勒 那情况就会大不相同
If his name were Rockefeller, there'd be something you could do.

2456
02:27:07,981 --> 02:27:10,369
雷德夫人 如果你丈夫的名字是洛克菲勒
Mrs. Reed, if your husband's name were Rockefeller,

2457
02:27:10,483 --> 02:27:12,245
那他都不会背负上…
I think he would hardly be under indictment

2458
02:27:12,352 --> 02:27:14,876
阴谋推翻美国政府的罪名
for a conspiracy to overthrow the United States Government.

2459
02:27:14,988 --> 02:27:17,820
他只有一个肾脏，他会病重的
He has only one kidney. He could be dangerously ill.

2460
02:27:17,923 --> 02:27:20,447
那是你丈夫自己冒的险，雷德夫人
That is a chance that your husband took, Mrs. Reed,

2461
02:27:20,559 --> 02:27:24,756
他离开美国时，都没有签证或者护照
when he left the United States without an exit visa or a passport.

2462
02:27:24,863 --> 02:27:26,887
再见，雷德夫人
Good day, Mrs. Reed.

2463
02:27:27,833 --> 02:27:30,494
美国和联盟国都参加了…
The United States participated with the Allies

2464
02:27:30,568 --> 02:27:33,559
反对苏联的军事行动
in military expeditions against the Soviet Union

2465
02:27:33,671 --> 02:27:37,026
试图战胜他们，侵略他们
in an attempt to overcome them, invade them,

2466
02:27:38,009 --> 02:27:40,568
建立另一个政府
and set up another government. Oh, yes. Yes.

2467
02:27:40,711 --> 02:27:42,234
有这么一个陷阱…
There was a noose

2468
02:27:42,712 --> 02:27:45,976
设在苏联周围
to be pulled around Russia

2469
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:51,042
让你知道整个国家…
which gave you an idea of how a whole country

2470
02:27:51,154 --> 02:27:55,647
会陷入四面楚歌的境地
can be surrounded east, west, south, and north.

2471
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:06,927
你的名字，以及芬兰联络员的名字
Your name, and the name of your contact in Finland.

2472
02:28:24,918 --> 02:28:27,579
你的名字，以及芬兰联络员的名字
Your name, and the name of your contact in Finland.

2473
02:28:27,955 --> 02:28:29,285
我不知道是什么颜色
I don't know what color...

2474
02:28:30,257 --> 02:28:31,587
我自己拿吧
I'll just get it myself.

2475
02:28:31,692 --> 02:28:34,148
-你会得到… -你要我们现在做吗？
- Would you get some... - Would you like us to do it now?

2476
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:35,624
-好 -好的
- Okay. - Oh, okay.

2477
02:28:35,862 --> 02:28:36,816
-好了 -我明白
- All right. - I understand.

2478
02:28:37,396 --> 02:28:38,350
从上面？
From the top?

2479
02:28:39,198 --> 02:28:41,461
知道，然后他们画了一幅地图
Oh, I see. Then they made a map.

2480
02:28:42,902 --> 02:28:44,061
泰瑞跟我谈过了
Terry spoke to me.

2481
02:28:44,203 --> 02:28:47,365
路易丝，你根本不知道这次旅行 对一个女人来说有多困难
Louise, I don't think you realize how difficult this trip to be for a woman.

2482
02:28:47,506 --> 02:28:48,494
你必须偷渡出去
You'd have to stow away.

2483
02:28:48,707 --> 02:28:51,266
就算你到了那里，也需要六个月…
If you got there at all, it would take you six months to...

2484
02:28:51,409 --> 02:28:53,672
泰瑞说你能给我安排一条货船
Terry said that he thought that you could arrange a freighter for me

2485
02:28:53,778 --> 02:28:55,438
-一直到挪威 -不知道你为什么这样说
- as far as Norway. - Don't know why you're saying it.

2486
02:28:55,547 --> 02:28:57,241
你知道我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

2487
02:28:57,649 --> 02:28:58,876
坐下
Sit down.

2488
02:29:00,818 --> 02:29:03,377
我想跟你谈一些事
I want to talk to you about something.

2489
02:29:04,722 --> 02:29:05,676
…说明地图
...indicates the map.

2490
02:29:05,823 --> 02:29:07,346
我可以去
I could go.

2491
02:29:07,458 --> 02:29:10,813
我能以海员的身份去，不需要审查
I can sign on as a seaman. There'd be no questions asked.

2492
02:29:10,895 --> 02:29:12,919
在这种情况下…
I think under the circumstances...

2493
02:29:16,633 --> 02:29:19,965
别这样看我 杰克・雷德也算是我的朋友
Don't look at me like that. Jack Reed's a friend of mine.

2494
02:29:20,103 --> 02:29:22,900
我不会让那王八蛋死在监狱里的
I'm not gonna let the son of a bitch rot in jail.

2495
02:29:23,006 --> 02:29:24,836
只是好像我没兴趣…
Just seemed to me that I'm not as interested...

2496
02:29:29,745 --> 02:29:31,541
这样的话…
...and at this point...

2497
02:29:32,447 --> 02:29:33,743
好了
Okay.

2498
02:29:33,849 --> 02:29:36,214
他不是要来找我谈这事吗？
Wasn't he supposed to come over to me on this?

2499
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:38,683
我明早就跟泰瑞谈
I'll talk to Terry in the morning.

2500
02:29:38,787 --> 02:29:40,913
在那里放个十字架
Where the cross is made...

2501
02:29:41,022 --> 02:29:43,285
希望那些王八蛋能合作
I wish these son-of-a-bitches could act.

2502
02:29:51,199 --> 02:29:53,154
约翰雷德:正尝试所有解决办法

2503
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,192

你的血压非常高
Your blood pressure is very high.

2505
02:30:31,994 --> 02:30:34,738
他们只给我吃咸鱼
They only give me some kind of salted fish.

2506
02:30:34,844 --> 02:30:37,848
你嘴巴里的血是从牙龈里出来的
The blood in your mouth is from the gums.

2507
02:30:38,026 --> 02:30:39,572
你得了坏血症
You have scurvy.

2508
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,813
深刻的红印，同志
An impressive shade of red, comrade.

2509
02:30:50,056 --> 02:30:51,339
可以帮我发电报给我妻子吗？
Could you send a cable to my wife?

2510
02:31:52,759 --> 02:31:55,763
雷德先生，我有东西给你

2511
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:02,397
-有电报吗？ -还没有
- Is there a cable? - There's nothing yet.

2512
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:06,865

You should take one of these powders in a glass of water, once a day.

2513
02:32:07,104 --> 02:32:10,012
她有消息捎给我吗？
Has she sent word to me here?

2514
02:32:10,125 --> 02:32:13,663
他们不会说的 我们的人什么都找不到
They won't say. Our people can find out nothing.

2515
02:32:38,858 --> 02:32:40,438
你被释放了
You are being released.

2516
02:32:44,459 --> 02:32:49,317

Why is this city freezing?

2576
02:36:10,119 --> 02:36:11,517
我问了兹诺维耶
I asked Zinoviev.

2577
02:36:11,621 --> 02:36:14,111
他说敌人破坏了所有运输通道
He said our enemies have destroyed all the means of transportation

2578
02:36:14,223 --> 02:36:15,814
杀光了我们的马，还有我们的人
and killed off our horses as well as our men.

2579
02:36:15,925 --> 02:36:16,913
我们怎么运输？
How would we get at it?

2580
02:36:17,026 --> 02:36:18,481
我说，彼得格勒的人呢？
I said, "What about the people of Petrograd?

2581
02:36:18,594 --> 02:36:21,220
他们可以一起走路去 用绳子把木头拖回来
"They could go there together on foot and haul the wood back with ropes."

2582
02:36:21,329 --> 02:36:22,852
他说“是的，那会让人更暖和”
He said, "Oh, yes, it would make the people warmer,

2583
02:36:22,964 --> 02:36:25,659
“但会耽误政策的施行”
"but it would interfere with the carrying out of the main political policy."

2584
02:36:25,734 --> 02:36:28,463
-你收到美国埃玛的来信？ -是的
- You get letters from America, E. G? - Oh, yes.

2585
02:36:28,602 --> 02:36:32,196
全都被司法局拆开 希望他们喜欢看，我可不喜欢
All opened by the Justice Department. I hope they enjoy what they read. I don't.

2586
02:36:32,339 --> 02:36:34,704
所以我问他“政策是什么？”
So I asked him, "What are the main political policies?"

2587
02:36:34,808 --> 02:36:37,469
他说“集中无产阶级先锋派…”
He said, "Concentration of all power in the hands

2588
02:36:37,578 --> 02:36:39,101
“手中的所有权力”
"of the proletarian avant-garde.

2589
02:36:39,212 --> 02:36:43,237
“革命先锋派是共产党”
"The avant-garde of the revolution, which is the Communist Party."

2590
02:36:43,683 --> 02:36:46,242
有人提到路易丝吗？
Anybody mention Louise?

2591
02:36:46,352 --> 02:36:49,240
没有，你没有她的消息吗？
I don't think so. You haven't heard from her?

2592
02:36:49,755 --> 02:36:52,609
我给她发了电报，但没有回复
I've sent her cables, but I don't get any answer.

2593
02:36:52,724 --> 02:36:55,180
-多久了？ -很久了
- For how long? - A long time.

2594
02:36:56,194 --> 02:36:57,387
等等
Wait.

2595
02:36:57,462 --> 02:37:00,294
莱斯・威廉姆斯在信中提到她
Rhys Williams mentioned her in his letter.

2596
02:37:00,399 --> 02:37:02,730
他也没收到她的消息
He hasn't heard from her, either.

2597
02:37:02,868 --> 02:37:03,992
他怎么说的？
What'd he say?

2598
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:08,634
他说他想联系她
I think he said that he'd tried to reach her

2599
02:37:08,740 --> 02:37:11,867
在圣诞节后，但她离开纽约了
sometime after Christmas, but she'd left New York.

2600
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:17,638
多久前的事？
How long ago was that?

2601
02:37:17,748 --> 02:37:20,170
信怎么也要花两个月才到这里
Well, you know how these letters take a couple of months to get here.

2602
02:37:20,283 --> 02:37:25,105
等到我看到时 寄信的人要么坐牢，要么被驱逐
By the time I get them, whoever sent it is either in jail or deported.

2603
02:37:25,221 --> 02:37:26,915
-就是那样 -是哪封？
- That's it. - Which?

2604
02:37:27,023 --> 02:37:28,421
-那封 -莱斯・威廉姆斯
- There. - Rhys Williams.

2605
02:37:28,568 --> 02:37:29,527
Oh.

2606
02:37:31,226 --> 02:37:33,887
-要三思而后行 -是的
- First the eyes go, then the legs. - Yeah.

2607
02:37:34,663 --> 02:37:37,324
我也不清楚燃料的情况
Yeah, I don't understand the fuel situation, either.

2608
02:37:39,001 --> 02:37:41,025
我不知道…
I don't know...

2609
02:37:45,106 --> 02:37:47,562
他说她离开了城市
He says she seems to be out of town.

2610
02:37:47,675 --> 02:37:49,005
他只那样说？
That's all he said?

2611
02:37:50,477 --> 02:37:51,534
是的
Yeah.

2612
02:37:52,146 --> 02:37:54,170
他说了奥尼尔什么？
What did he say about O'Neill?

2613
02:37:54,281 --> 02:37:55,872
奥尼尔？没说什么
O'Neill? Nothing.

2614
02:37:56,383 --> 02:37:58,111
拜托，他说了什么？
Come on, what did he say?

2615
02:37:59,319 --> 02:38:00,615
没什么
Nothing.

2616
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,152
可以看看吗？
Can I see it?

2617
02:38:08,328 --> 02:38:09,589
对不起
I'm sorry.

2618
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:20,030
我只是不知道她去了哪…
I just don't know where...

2619
02:38:23,808 --> 02:38:25,968
杰克，坐吧
Jack, sit down.

2620
02:38:37,621 --> 02:38:39,450
如果路易丝来这里
If Louise were to come here,

2621
02:38:39,555 --> 02:38:41,977
她就要非法偷渡出国
she'd have to leave the United States illegally,

2622
02:38:42,125 --> 02:38:44,353
然后和你过流亡的生活 再也回不了家
then live in exile with you, and never go home again.

2623
02:38:45,428 --> 02:38:48,725
这一切都是为了不属于她的革命
All for the sake of a revolution she was never any part of.

2624
02:38:48,831 --> 02:38:50,627
她为什么要那样做？
Why should she?

2625
02:38:51,266 --> 02:38:53,722
是你选择了革命的生活道路
You chose the life of a revolutionary.

2626
02:38:53,835 --> 02:38:55,165
她没有
She didn't.

2627
02:38:56,038 --> 02:39:00,633
你的电报只会让司法部监视她
Your cables only focus the Justice Department's attention on her,

2628
02:39:00,742 --> 02:39:03,301
对她最不利的就是…
and the most seditious thing they can accuse her of

2629
02:39:03,412 --> 02:39:05,106
她是你的妻子
is being your wife.

2630
02:39:06,114 --> 02:39:08,240
放过她吧
Leave her alone.

2631
02:39:08,350 --> 02:39:10,146
让她选择自己的未来
Let her choose her own future.

2632
02:39:11,318 --> 02:39:13,410
但她为什么不回电报？
Why hasn't she answered me?

2633
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:15,349
我想这也算是一种回复
I think she has answered you.

2634
02:41:31,714 --> 02:41:34,952
他被释放了，没说他在哪里
He's been released. They won't tell me where he is.

2635
02:41:57,240 --> 02:42:00,537
你知道，她很讨厌…
Do you know, she was much hated

2636
02:42:00,643 --> 02:42:02,768
衣服的奢华
for her extravagance in clothes.

2637
02:42:02,912 --> 02:42:07,267
很久以前，有人跟我说…
Well, a long time ago, somebody said to me,

2638
02:42:08,717 --> 02:42:09,704
那些…
"People who...

2639
02:42:09,852 --> 02:42:12,739
那些处于危险中的女人
"Women whose lives have been in danger

2640
02:42:13,122 --> 02:42:16,578
在很长时期都总是很奢侈
"over a long period are always the most extravagant."

2641
02:42:17,092 --> 02:42:19,820
同志们，和许多被误导的政策一样
Comrades, as wrong-headed as many of its policies are,

2642
02:42:19,929 --> 02:42:22,316
世界产业工人组织是革命的联盟
the IWW is a revolutionary union

2643
02:42:22,431 --> 02:42:24,454
而美国劳工联合会不是
and the American Federation of Labor is not.

2644
02:42:24,566 --> 02:42:27,590
想打入美国劳工联合会内部…
To think we can infiltrate the American Federation of Labor

2645
02:42:27,703 --> 02:42:29,931
将它转变成革命联合是没有希望的
and convert it to revolutionary policies is hopeless.

2646
02:42:30,039 --> 02:42:31,163
翻译
Translation.

2647
02:42:34,076 --> 02:42:36,634
同志们，错误翻译
Comrades, that's the wrong translation.

2648
02:42:44,386 --> 02:42:46,147
他不是那样说的
That's not what he said.

2649
02:42:46,789 --> 02:42:47,879
他在说什么？
What's he saying?

2650
02:42:48,424 --> 02:42:50,481
为了能和大会与会者达成一致
For us to make a point on the floor of the Congress,

2651
02:42:50,592 --> 02:42:52,148
我们必须…
we have to go

2652
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:54,989
从英语转译为德语
from our own English language into the official German language

2653
02:42:55,097 --> 02:42:57,689
再到意大利语 或者西班牙语，或者法语
to the Italian, or Spanish, or French language.

2654
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:01,564
-当反应… -你有什么问题？
- And then, when the response from... - What is your question, please?

2655
02:43:01,670 --> 02:43:04,057
为了工会的事宜…
Simply for the labor union issue,

2656
02:43:04,139 --> 02:43:06,560
我们能让英语成为大会的…
could we have the English language as an official language

2657
02:43:06,675 --> 02:43:08,595
官方语言吗？
on the floor of the Congress?

2658
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:14,206
雷德同志，你已经第三次提这个建议了
Comrade Reed, this is the third time you have raised this proposal!

2659
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:15,474
这个问题早已有了结果
The issue has been decided.

2660
02:43:15,617 --> 02:43:17,947
我们必须推进到国家和殖民的事宜
We must move on to the national and colonial issues!

2661
02:43:22,658 --> 02:43:25,352
美国真正的工人革命者
Real revolutionary workers in the United States

2662
02:43:25,461 --> 02:43:28,587
很久前就放弃了工会联盟…
quit the AF of L a long time ago

2663
02:43:28,697 --> 02:43:30,720
然后加入了世界产业工人组织
and joined the IWW.

2664
02:43:30,833 --> 02:43:33,061
我们要让苏联人明白这一点
We have to make the Russians understand this,

2665
02:43:33,168 --> 02:43:35,896
所以我们需要你们的支持
and that's why we want your support

2666
02:43:36,005 --> 02:43:40,861
延长会议，让辩论公开化
to extend the session of congress and to keep the debate open.

2667
02:43:52,054 --> 02:43:53,485
杰克，你没事吧？
Jack, are you okay?

2668
02:43:53,589 --> 02:43:55,350
-你跟萨多谈过吗？ -谈过
- Did you talk to Sadoul? - Yes, I did.

2669
02:43:55,457 --> 02:43:58,788
同志们，我仍然反对结束讨论
Comrades, I'm still opposed to closing the discussion here.

2670
02:43:58,894 --> 02:44:01,315
我想之所以讨论结束…
I think that this discussion is being closed

2671
02:44:01,430 --> 02:44:04,659
是为了避免听到美英代表团的心声
to avoid hearing the American and the British delegations.

2672
02:44:04,767 --> 02:44:07,029
如果不是出于这个原因的话
And if for no other reason than that,

2673
02:44:07,136 --> 02:44:09,090
那么讨论就应该继续
it shows that discussion should continue.

2674
02:44:09,204 --> 02:44:11,466
拉德克同志用这个评论…
Comrade Radek uses this sort of remark

2675
02:44:11,540 --> 02:44:14,530
代替争论，结果他想不了了之
in place of an argument and as a result, he doesn't want to talk about it.

2676
02:44:14,676 --> 02:44:19,270
雷德是不怕区别歪曲的事实的
What Reed says is not distinguished by excessive fear of distorting the truth.

2677
02:44:19,415 --> 02:44:21,802
他日夜都在努力，声称…
He goes on day and night and has the cheek to claim

2678
02:44:21,917 --> 02:44:23,644
讨论被人为中断
that the discussion is being broken off

2679
02:44:23,752 --> 02:44:26,207
因为有些人害怕伟大的约翰・雷德
because of fear of the great might of John Reed.

2680
02:44:43,038 --> 02:44:46,096
雷德同志 你这样谈到明天早上都完不了
Comrade Reed, you may have time to discuss it until tomorrow morning.

2681
02:44:46,175 --> 02:44:47,538
别人没有这个时间
Other people do not have the time.

2682
02:44:47,643 --> 02:44:51,338
拉德克同志，没时间讨论这事的人
Comrade Radek, other people that don't have the time for this discussion

2683
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:54,538
是世界产业工人组织的101个领导
are 101 leaders of the IWW

2684
02:44:54,683 --> 02:44:56,546
而今他们正在美国的监狱坐牢
who are in jail today in the United States

2685
02:44:56,652 --> 02:44:58,447
仅仅因为他们持有革命观点
because of their revolutionary views.

2686
02:44:58,554 --> 02:45:01,476
如果我们出卖这些同志…
And if we turn our back on these comrades

2687
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:05,285
不能带领激进的美国劳工联合会…
out of some pipe dream to radicalize the American Federation of Labor

2688
02:45:05,394 --> 02:45:06,552
忘记这个白日梦，那就是羞耻
which cannot be done, it is a disgrace.

2689
02:45:06,662 --> 02:45:09,254
我们在本届六次会议上 讨论过这个问题
We've discussed this during six sessions of this commission.

2690
02:45:09,364 --> 02:45:10,989
今天一天都在讨论这个问题
We spent whole day today discussing it,

2691
02:45:11,100 --> 02:45:13,293
而你竟然说是我们 想停止讨论这个问题？
and you insinuate we are trying to dismiss the issue?

2692
02:45:18,974 --> 02:45:20,735
我们还没讨论充分
We haven't had enough discussion...

2693
02:45:20,843 --> 02:45:23,230
我们没有为我的朋友讨论充分
We haven't had enough discussion for my friend here

2694
02:45:23,378 --> 02:45:26,868
路易斯・佛莱纳和我在这个问题上 想法一致
to realize that Louis Fraina and I think alike on this problem.

2695
02:45:27,015 --> 02:45:28,708
我们代表团的每个美国人
Every American on our delegation,

2696
02:45:28,817 --> 02:45:31,409
-英国代表团的每个人… -你是这个委员会的一员
- every man on the English delegation... - You are a member of this committee.

2697
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:33,042
你不是独立的政党代表
You are not an independent political party.

2698
02:45:33,155 --> 02:45:36,452
兹诺维耶同志 我不会被这个委员会所压制
Comrade Zinoviev, I will not be steamrollered by this committee

2699
02:45:36,558 --> 02:45:39,389
在这个问题上 我们还没有一个正确的认识
that has not had a proper education on this problem.

2700
02:45:39,495 --> 02:45:41,017
实际上…
On the fact...

2701
02:45:48,871 --> 02:45:50,200
讨论结束了
The discussion is closed.

2702
02:45:50,272 --> 02:45:52,966
如果雷德同志希望作陈述
However, if Comrade Reed wishes to make a statement,

2703
02:45:53,075 --> 02:45:55,405
他有两分钟的时间
he will have two minutes to do so.

2704
02:45:56,043 --> 02:45:59,465
我谨代表美国代表团在此声明…
I would merely want to say that on behalf of the American delegates,

2705
02:45:59,614 --> 02:46:02,001
我方拒绝在此事上投票
that we will refuse to vote on these theses,

2706
02:46:02,116 --> 02:46:05,743
我本人辞去在委员会的职位
and that I myself will resign my seat on this committee.

2707
02:47:11,312 --> 02:47:13,232
杰克，我想我们必须面对…
Jack, I think we have to face it.

2708
02:47:13,347 --> 02:47:16,439
我们的梦在苏联破灭了
The dream that we had is dying in Russia.

2709
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:19,005
如果布尔什维克意味着 农民占领土地
If Bolshevism means the peasants taking the land,

2710
02:47:19,119 --> 02:47:20,550
工人占领工厂
the workers taking the factories,

2711
02:47:20,654 --> 02:47:24,008
那苏联就不是布尔什维克的天下了
Russia's one place where there's no Bolshevism.

2712
02:47:24,123 --> 02:47:27,648
我可以和警察争，可以和将军打
You know, I can argue with cops, I can fight with generals.

2713
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,714
就是不能和官僚主义者斗
I can't deal with a bureaucrat.

2714
02:47:29,829 --> 02:47:32,455
你觉得兹诺维耶 不比官僚主义者坏吗？
You think Zinoviev is nothing worse than a bureaucrat?

2715
02:47:32,931 --> 02:47:34,988
苏联人不再有地方自治权了
The Soviets have no more local autonomy.

2716
02:47:35,133 --> 02:47:36,758
都成了中央集权
The central state has all the power.

2717
02:47:36,902 --> 02:47:38,595
所有的权利掌握在少数人手里
All the power is in the hands of a few men

2718
02:47:38,737 --> 02:47:40,362
他们在破坏革命
and they are destroying the revolution.

2719
02:47:40,505 --> 02:47:43,768
他们在破坏苏联共产主义的希望
They are destroying any hope of real Communism in Russia.

2720
02:47:43,874 --> 02:47:46,432
他们在把像我这样的人关进监狱
They're putting people like me in jail.

2721
02:47:46,544 --> 02:47:48,601
我对革命的理解是…
My understanding of revolution

2722
02:47:48,713 --> 02:47:51,805
它不是对政治异己的连续消灭
is not a continual extermination of political dissenters,

2723
02:47:51,916 --> 02:47:53,870
我不想参与其中
and I want no part of it.

2724
02:47:54,585 --> 02:47:56,744
每个报社要么关门大吉
Every single newspaper's been shut down

2725
02:47:56,853 --> 02:47:58,216
要么被政党控制
or taken over by the party.

2726
02:47:58,321 --> 02:48:01,345
任何一个被怀疑是反革命的人…
Anyone even vaguely suspected of being a counter-revolutionary

2727
02:48:01,458 --> 02:48:04,914
都有可能被就地正法 这何时才是个头？
can be taken out and shot without a trial. Where does that end?

2728
02:48:04,995 --> 02:48:07,325
以防御为名义
Is any nightmare justifiable

2729
02:48:07,429 --> 02:48:10,282
就有理由掀起反对反革命的恶梦？
in the name of defense against counter-revolution?

2730
02:48:10,432 --> 02:48:12,352
梦会在苏联破灭，但我不会
The dream may be dying in Russia, but I'm not.

2731
02:48:12,468 --> 02:48:15,026
或许过一段时间，我要逃离这里
It may take some time. I'm getting out.

2732
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:17,966
好像你对运动中的革命感到很迷惑
You sound like you're a little confused by the revolution in action, E.G.

2733
02:48:18,072 --> 02:48:20,368
直到现在，你只在理论上说
Up to now, you've only dealt with it in theory.

2734
02:48:20,475 --> 02:48:21,735
你觉得事情会怎样？
What did you think this thing was gonna be?

2735
02:48:21,843 --> 02:48:23,297
难道是舆论的革命
A revolution by consensus

2736
02:48:23,411 --> 02:48:25,832
大家围坐一起 喝着咖啡侃侃而谈吗？
where we all sat down and agreed over a cup of coffee?

2737
02:48:25,947 --> 02:48:28,106
什么都没用
Nothing works.

2738
02:48:28,215 --> 02:48:30,238
去年死了四百万人
Four million people died last year.

2739
02:48:30,350 --> 02:48:31,508
不是死于打仗
Not from fighting a war,

2740
02:48:31,618 --> 02:48:34,471
而是死于饥荒和斑疹伤寒症 军国极权的国家…
they died from starvation and typhus in a militaristic police state

2741
02:48:34,588 --> 02:48:36,110
镇压了自由和人权
that suppresses freedom and human rights

2742
02:48:36,223 --> 02:48:37,347
什么都没用
where nothing works.

2743
02:48:37,424 --> 02:48:39,947
死人是因为法国，英国和美国的封锁
They died because of a French, British and American blockade

2744
02:48:40,059 --> 02:48:42,423
所有食物和药物的供应被切断
that cut off all food and medical supplies

2745
02:48:42,561 --> 02:48:44,618
因为反革命分子破坏工厂
and because counter-revolutionaries have sabotaged the factories

2746
02:48:44,764 --> 02:48:47,720
铁路和电话，因为那些…
and the railroads and the telephones, and because the people,

2747
02:48:47,833 --> 02:48:50,527
贫穷无知迷信文盲的人
the poor, ignorant, superstitious, illiterate people,

2748
02:48:50,635 --> 02:48:53,898
想自己做主主持大局，就像你说的那样做
are trying to run things themselves, just as you always said that they should,

2749
02:48:54,005 --> 02:48:55,095
但他们不知道怎么主持大局
but they don't know how to run them yet.

2750
02:48:55,206 --> 02:48:57,297
你真的觉得日子会立刻好起来吗？
Did you really think things would work right away?

2751
02:48:57,442 --> 02:48:59,499
你真的期望社会改革…
Did you really expect social transformation

2752
02:48:59,611 --> 02:49:01,770
和谋杀过程一样快速吗？
to be anything other than a murderous process?

2753
02:49:01,879 --> 02:49:04,801
这是战争，埃玛 我们必须把它看作战争去打
It's a war, E.G., and we gotta fight it like we fight a war,

2754
02:49:04,915 --> 02:49:06,972
有纪律，有恐惧，有战火
with discipline, with terror, with firing squads,

2755
02:49:07,084 --> 02:49:09,073
否则我们就放弃算了
or we just give it up.

2756
02:49:09,186 --> 02:49:11,550
四百万人不是死于战争
Those four million people didn't die fighting a war.

2757
02:49:11,622 --> 02:49:14,316
他们死于一个无法起效的制度！
They died from a system that cannot work!

2758
02:49:23,399 --> 02:49:25,353
这才刚开始，埃玛
It's just the beginning, E.G.

2759
02:49:26,134 --> 02:49:28,794
不会跟我们想象的那样可怕
It's not happening the way we thought it would.

2760
02:49:28,904 --> 02:49:30,597
不会跟我们想象的那样发生
It's not happening the way we wanted it to,

2761
02:49:30,706 --> 02:49:32,160
但肯定会发生
but it's happening.

2762
02:49:36,777 --> 02:49:38,697
如果你现在放弃…
If you walk out on it now,

2763
02:49:39,113 --> 02:49:41,272
那么你的生命还有什么意义？
what's your whole life meant?

2764
02:49:45,785 --> 02:49:48,581
我的辞职申请书批了吗？
Could you tell me if my resignation is ready for signature yet?

2765
02:49:48,722 --> 02:49:49,914
-批了 -很好
- It is. - Good.

2766
02:49:50,056 --> 02:49:51,612
可以看看吗？
May I see it?

2767
02:49:52,792 --> 02:49:54,087
谢谢
Thank you.

2768
02:50:00,499 --> 02:50:03,125
-谢谢，雷德同志 -欢迎回来，雷德同志
- Thank you, Comrade Reed. - Welcome back, Comrade Reed.

2769
02:50:03,235 --> 02:50:05,623
现在你可以代表美国工人…
Now you'll be able to represent the American workers

2770
02:50:05,738 --> 02:50:07,102
在即将举行的巴库会议上
at the forthcoming congress at Baku

2771
02:50:07,206 --> 02:50:10,766
鼓励中东人发起革命
to inspire revolution among the peoples of the Middle East.

2772
02:50:10,875 --> 02:50:11,863
准备迎接艰难的旅行吧
Prepare for a difficult trip.

2773
02:50:11,976 --> 02:50:14,000
我们唯一的路线是 穿越分隔的领土
Our only route is through divided territory.

2774
02:50:54,851 --> 02:50:58,411
一些知识分子散布谣言…
Some of these intellectuals spread rumors

2775
02:50:58,555 --> 02:51:01,216
说他改变了主意
that he changed his mind afterwards,

2776
02:51:01,358 --> 02:51:03,188
企图改变主意…
trying to, you know,

2777
02:51:06,462 --> 02:51:09,589
证明他醒悟了
show that he came to his senses.

2778
02:51:10,934 --> 02:51:13,197
那是荒谬的
It's preposterous.

2779
02:51:13,603 --> 02:51:17,629
这些人，我都不记得了
These men, well, I don't even remember them.

2780
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:20,269
我也不想记住他们
I don't want to remember them.

2781
02:54:17,281 --> 02:54:20,044
所有通往巴库的列车都已取消
All trains to Baku canceled because of attacks

2782
02:54:20,184 --> 02:54:21,445
因为受到了反革命分子的袭击
by counter-revolutionaries.

2783
02:54:21,552 --> 02:54:22,813
肯定有去巴库的列车
There must be some train to Baku.

2784
02:54:24,887 --> 02:54:26,342
所有通往巴库的列车取消
All trains to Baku canceled

2785
02:54:26,490 --> 02:54:28,821
因为受到反革命分子的袭击

2786
02:54:29,827 --> 02:54:32,681
肯定有去巴库的车
There has to be something to Baku.

2787
02:54:34,497 --> 02:54:35,758
路易丝？
Louise?

2788
02:54:39,369 --> 02:54:40,528
埃玛？
Emma?

2789
02:54:40,970 --> 02:54:42,027
埃玛
Emma.

2790
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:44,197
埃玛
Emma.

2791
02:54:46,442 --> 02:54:49,774
你是怎么到苏联的？
How in the name of God did you get into Russia?

2792
02:54:51,914 --> 02:54:54,768
-我不知道要多久 -你要等一会儿
- I had no idea how long it would take. - So, you'll wait for a while.

2793
02:54:55,918 --> 02:54:59,341
没准你刚到那里，他就已经回来了
By the time you got there, he'd be back here anyway.

2794
02:54:59,455 --> 02:55:00,910
进来，快请进
Go on in. Go on in.

2795
02:55:01,024 --> 02:55:02,684
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

2796
02:55:02,792 --> 02:55:05,351
没事的，没事
It's all right. It's all right.

2797
02:55:10,333 --> 02:55:13,529
来，路易丝，坐吧

我想告诉你事情
I want to tell you something.

2799
02:55:27,751 --> 02:55:29,342
这或许有点晚了
It's late, I know.

2800
02:55:34,025 --> 02:55:35,889
谢谢你送的围巾
I want to thank you for that scarf.

2801
02:55:37,027 --> 02:55:38,254
是的
Oh, yes.

2802
02:55:39,496 --> 02:55:41,326
我错看你了
I was wrong about you.

2803
02:55:42,132 --> 02:55:43,359
我也是
So was I.

2804
02:55:45,836 --> 02:55:48,395
美国石油公司想建立…

1898年，菲律宾人民推翻 西班牙殖民政府的残酷统治
In 1898, the Filipinos rebelled against the cruel colonial government of Spain.

2807
02:56:01,119 --> 02:56:03,609
西班牙人被驱逐后

美国人承认了菲律宾的独立

很快宣布菲律宾共和国的成立

2810
02:56:33,719 --> 02:56:37,210
美国政府随即派军队去那里驻扎
The government of United States sent soldiers and sailors there...

2811
02:56:40,227 --> 02:56:44,117
比英国暴君还专权
...under a dictatorship worse than the British tyrants.

2812
02:56:52,639 --> 02:56:54,037
他们这是干嘛？
What's that for?

2813
02:56:54,141 --> 02:56:56,631
他们支持你，因为你发起圣战
They are supporting you for your call for a holy war

2814
02:56:56,744 --> 02:56:59,507
伊斯兰人民反对西方非信教徒的圣战
of Islamic people against the western infidels.

2815
02:57:20,668 --> 02:57:22,123
打搅了，雷德同志
Excuse me, Comrade Reed.

2816
02:57:22,270 --> 02:57:24,965
他们说你不满意你演讲的翻译稿
They said you are not happy with the translations of your speech.

2817
02:57:25,072 --> 02:57:26,504
我把德语翻成了土耳其语
I did the German into Turkic

2818
02:57:26,607 --> 02:57:28,836
奥辛斯基同志把俄语翻译成德语
and Comrade Ossinsky did the Russian into German.

2819
02:57:28,944 --> 02:57:31,468
俄语？
Russian?

2820
02:57:31,547 --> 02:57:33,173
谁一开始就翻译成了俄语？
Who turned it into Russian in the first place?

2821
02:57:33,282 --> 02:57:34,714
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

2822
02:57:34,817 --> 02:57:36,545
从兹诺维耶同志办公室拿到的演讲稿…
They were already in Russian when we got them

2823
02:57:36,685 --> 02:57:38,208
就是俄语的
from the office of Comrade Zinoviev.

2824
02:57:40,555 --> 02:57:42,510
-很抱歉我英语不好 -你的英语不错，同志
- I'm sorry for my English. - Your English is fine, comrade.

2825
02:57:49,932 --> 02:57:53,355
兹诺维耶，是你翻译了我的演讲稿吗？
Zinoviev, did you do the translations of my speech?

2826
02:57:54,069 --> 02:57:55,729
在我的监督下翻译的
I supervised it. Yes.

2827
02:57:55,871 --> 02:57:58,634
我没说圣战，我说的是阶级战争
I didn't say "holy war." I said "class war."

2828
02:57:58,740 --> 02:58:01,071
我冒昧修改了一两个短语
I took a liberty of altering a phrase or two.

2829
02:58:01,544 --> 02:58:04,706
我不允许别人冒昧修改我的作品
Yes, well, I don't allow people to take those liberties with what I write.

2830
02:58:05,315 --> 02:58:08,340
你不知道如何宣传才能感动人吗？
Aren't you propagandist enough to utilize what moves people most?

2831
02:58:08,451 --> 02:58:10,907
我要用真相来宣传
I'm propagandist enough to utilize the truth.

2832
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:14,580
谁定义真相？是你还是党？
And who defines this truth? You or the party?

2833
02:58:14,724 --> 02:58:16,054
你只需要致力于演讲…
Is your life dedicated to speaking for...

2834
02:58:16,159 --> 02:58:18,285
不用你说我要致力于什么！
You don't talk about what my life is dedicated to!

2835
02:58:18,395 --> 02:58:20,954
你连这辈子致力于什么事业都还没决定
Your life? You haven't resolved what your life is dedicated to.

2836
02:58:21,064 --> 02:58:23,987
你把自己看作艺术家，同时也是革命家
You see yourself as an artist and at the same time as a revolutionary.

2837
02:58:24,133 --> 02:58:26,862
看作是你妻子的爱人 也是代表美国阶级的发言人
As a lover to your wife, but also as a spokesman for the American classes.

2838
02:58:26,970 --> 02:58:28,800
兹诺维耶，你根本不知道一个人…
Zinoviev, you don't think a man can be an individual

2839
02:58:28,905 --> 02:58:30,394
是可以对集体忠诚的
and be true to the collective,

2840
02:58:30,506 --> 02:58:33,861
可同时代表自己国家和共产国际说话
or speak for his own country and the International at the same time,

2841
02:58:33,978 --> 02:58:37,037
既忠于妻子，依然对革命忠诚
or love his wife and still be faithful to the revolution,

2842
02:58:37,114 --> 02:58:38,239
而你根本就没有什么可以奉献！
you don't have a self to give!

2843
02:58:38,349 --> 02:58:40,213
你愿意把自己献身给革命吗？
Would you ever be willing to give yourself to this revolution?

2844
02:58:40,317 --> 02:58:42,113
当你把一个人和他最爱的东西分开时
When you separate a man from what he loves the most,

2845
02:58:42,253 --> 02:58:44,709
你要做的就是净化他的心灵
what you do is purge what's unique in him.

2846
02:58:44,822 --> 02:58:46,846
当你净化了他的心灵
And when you purge what's unique in him,

2847
02:58:46,991 --> 02:58:48,912
-你就消除了异议 -雷德同志
- you purge dissent. - Comrade Reed.

2848
02:58:49,026 --> 02:58:51,448
当你消除了异议，你就扼杀了革命
And when you purge dissent, you kill the revolution!

2849
02:58:51,563 --> 02:58:52,995
革命就是异议！
Revolution is dissent!

2850
02:58:53,098 --> 02:58:55,088
-雷德同志 -你别重写我写的东西
- Comrade Reed. - You don't rewrite what I write!

2851
02:59:02,806 --> 02:59:05,296
是反革命份子
Comrade Reed, counter-revolutionaries!

2852
02:59:05,844 --> 02:59:08,504
是反革命份子
Counter-revolutionaries, Comrade Reed!

2853
03:01:42,357 --> 03:01:43,584
爸爸
Papa!

2854
03:01:46,394 --> 03:01:47,792
爸爸！
Papa!

2855
03:03:59,327 --> 03:04:00,816
别离开我
Don't leave me.

2856
03:04:03,698 --> 03:04:05,096
请别离开我
Please don't leave me.

2857
03:04:20,381 --> 03:04:24,373
同志，医生现在想见你
Comrade, the doctor would like to see you now.

2858
03:04:39,167 --> 03:04:42,124
医生觉得还需要进一步分析
The doctor thinks that we must do more analysis.

2859
03:04:42,237 --> 03:04:45,262
几天后他的情况会更明朗
And a picture of his illness will be clearer in a few days.

2860
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:46,601
他想要你知道
And he wants you to know

2861
03:04:46,708 --> 03:04:49,403
我们会给雷德同志最好的医治
that we shall do the best conditions for Comrade Reed

2862
03:04:49,544 --> 03:04:51,932
以防高血压…
to prevent possibility of high blood pressure

2863
03:04:52,046 --> 03:04:53,000
引起中风
to cause a stroke.

2864
03:05:08,162 --> 03:05:11,289
我真的…我知道…
I really... I know...

2865
03:05:12,634 --> 03:05:13,691
什么？
What?

2866
03:05:15,103 --> 03:05:16,501
你好吗？
How are you?

2867
03:05:20,809 --> 03:05:21,763
不
No.

2868
03:05:22,378 --> 03:05:23,435
杰克？
Jack?

2869
03:05:47,402 --> 03:05:51,258
我没有…
You know, I don't... I don't...

2870
03:06:00,382 --> 03:06:01,746
你听见吗？
You hear it?

2871
03:06:02,584 --> 03:06:04,312
什么？
- Huh? - What was that?

2872
03:06:05,087 --> 03:06:07,213
水在叮咚响
The water plays little songs.

2873
03:06:24,305 --> 03:06:27,569
现在不是12月吗？
It's not December, is it?

2874
03:06:45,693 --> 03:06:47,284
天哪
My, my, my, my.

2875
03:06:59,474 --> 03:07:02,328
天哪，几点了？
God. What a time it was, huh?

2876
03:07:18,494 --> 03:07:20,791
-想跟我去纽约吗？ -纽约？
- Want to come to New York with me? - New York?

2877
03:07:21,163 --> 03:07:22,390
有出租车在等我
I got a taxi waiting.

2878
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:27,528
我不介意
I wouldn't mind.

2879
03:07:30,037 --> 03:07:31,594
以什么身份？
What as?

2880
03:07:32,673 --> 03:07:33,866
什么身份？
What as?

2881
03:07:35,843 --> 03:07:37,002
什么身份？
What as?

2882
03:07:39,514 --> 03:07:41,140
不知道
Gee, I don't know.

2883
03:07:49,490 --> 03:07:50,615
同志身份？
Comrades?

2884
03:07:56,964 --> 03:07:58,191
同志
Comrades.

2885
03:08:03,738 --> 03:08:05,602
我想回家
Well, I want to go home.

2886
03:08:11,312 --> 03:08:12,335
是的
Yeah.

2887
03:08:51,586 --> 03:08:53,075
我去给你倒水
I'll get you some water.

2888
03:10:36,691 --> 03:10:38,715
天哪
Oh, God.

2889
03:12:04,376 --> 03:12:06,105
那是在下午
It was in the afternoon,

2890
03:12:06,245 --> 03:12:09,305
好像是在秋天的时候
sometime in the fall, I think.

2891
03:12:09,715 --> 03:12:11,273
好像是10月
October, I think.

2892
03:12:12,151 --> 03:12:14,073
有人来告诉我
Somebody came to tell me

2893
03:12:14,753 --> 03:12:16,482
杰克・雷德死了
that Jack Reed died.

2894
03:12:16,955 --> 03:12:19,913
可以想象…
You can imagine how...

2895
03:12:23,162 --> 03:12:24,857
我当时的感受
How I felt.

2896
03:12:28,434 --> 03:12:30,493
我把他们全都忘了
I'd forgotten all about them.

2897
03:12:30,636 --> 03:12:32,399
他们是社会主义者吗？
Were they socialists?

2898
03:12:34,406 --> 03:12:36,772
他们很多人都是理想主义者
Many of them were idealists.

2899
03:12:38,244 --> 03:12:41,805
你知道，事情去了又来
You know, things go and come back again.

2900
03:12:43,717 --> 03:12:46,982
我不知道外界怎么看他们
I don't know what the outside world thought of them,

2901
03:12:47,220 --> 03:12:49,484
但他们是一对夫妇
but they were a couple.

2902
03:12:49,589 --> 03:12:53,252
人们总是提起 路易丝・拜伦和杰克・雷德
I mean, you always spoke of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

2903
03:12:55,628 --> 03:12:58,552
他只是一个普通的年轻人
He was just a man in the prime of life.

2904
03:12:59,666 --> 03:13:02,726
我都不知道他们有没有孩子
I don't even know. Did they ever have any children?

2905
03:13:03,903 --> 03:13:06,292
可能没有
They probably didn't have any children,

2906
03:13:06,639 --> 03:13:08,095
他和路易丝
he and Louise.

2907
03:13:10,810 --> 03:13:13,768
有孩子的时候…
Again, you can't tell, when you have children,

2908
03:13:14,748 --> 03:13:18,570
他们可能就不会从事革命了
whether they will carry on your revolutionary tradition or not.

2909
03:13:22,021 --> 03:13:23,909
他为什么那样做？
Why did he do it?

2910
03:13:24,257 --> 03:13:27,181
这就好像在问爱迪生为什么发明…
Well, it's impossible to say

2911
03:13:27,327 --> 03:13:28,760
或是高利科奇为何唱歌…
why Edison invented,

2912
03:13:28,862 --> 03:13:32,559
永远不会有答案
or why Galli-Curci sang...

2913
03:13:33,099 --> 03:13:36,921
他是个热血男儿
He was definitely a stirrer-up of people.

2914
03:13:37,772 --> 03:13:39,467
那是他的天地
That was his field.

2915
03:13:40,674 --> 03:13:43,268
那就是他要从事的事业
That's what he came to do, apparently.

2916
03:13:44,578 --> 03:13:49,504
他出名，但不是很出名
He's well-known amongst a few, but not everybody.

2917
03:13:49,817 --> 03:13:52,342
很多人不知道他是谁
They don't know who in heck he is.

2918
03:13:53,888 --> 03:13:57,551
我期待自己某天死去
I look for myself to die any day.

2919
03:14:02,163 --> 03:14:04,529
列宁问他是不是美国人
He was asked by Lenin, "Are you an American?"

2920
03:14:05,499 --> 03:14:06,454
他说是
He said, "Yes."

2921
03:14:06,567 --> 03:14:09,263
列宁问是美国人中的美国人吗？
And Lenin said, "An American American?"

2922
03:14:10,337 --> 03:14:11,827
雷德说是
And Reed said, "Yes."

2923
03:14:14,642 --> 03:14:19,033
当然，没有人想死
Of course, nobody goes with the idea of dying.

2924
03:14:19,146 --> 03:14:22,104
每个人都想活着
Everybody wants to live.

2925
03:14:24,151 --> 03:14:27,575
我不记得他确切的话语了
I don't remember his exact words,

2926
03:14:27,688 --> 03:14:29,553
大意是…
but the meaning was

2927
03:14:30,691 --> 03:14:34,582
大事业在前方…
that grand things are ahead,

2928
03:14:36,998 --> 03:14:41,196
值得为之生为之死
worth living and worth dying for.

2929
03:14:41,770 --> 03:14:44,364
他自己那样说的
He himself said that.
