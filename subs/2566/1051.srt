片名：《保鏢》
Kaavalan [The Bodyguard]

22
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,660
我的人生在一列火車上發生了轉折
My life changed only in a rail journey

23
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,410
雖然我只是在中途登上了這列火車
Even if I have got in the middle..

24
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,910
故事從Mettu patti（印度南部一小鎮）開始
..this story begins in Mettu patti

25
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,330
陸軍少校Partha Sarathy的妻子Kanthimathi
The army major Partha Sarathy's wife Kanthimathi..

26
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,250
已經懷胎十月
..is pregnant for 10th month

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,170
Mettupatti附近就是我們的村莊Semmanoor
Mettupatti's neighborhood is our village called Semmanoor

28
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,340
Muthu Ramalingam控制著這個村莊
Muthu Ramalingam dominates the village!

29
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,430
是我 Mari 我是你的人
I am Mari speaking! I am your man.

30
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,430
他已經知道了 他會殺了我的
He has come to know it.. He would kill me

31
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,400
- 救救我 - 你在哪里打電話
-Save me. -Where are you talking from?

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
我在Mettupatti koil大街
..from Mettupatti, Murugan koil street.

33
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,610
老大 別殺我
Sir! Don't kill me

34
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,360
如果是可以信賴的敵人 也許我會饒了他
I can forgive my enemy if he can be trusted.

35
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,200
但如果是個叛徒 就算是我的兄弟 我也不會放過他
I can't forgive a betrayer even if he is my brother.

36
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,450
老大
Sir..

37
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Muthu Ramalingam來到Mettu patti是為了取人性命
Muthu Ramalingam came to the village to take a life!

38
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,300
可是兩條性命因他而得救 這并非出于偶然
But it is not a coincidence that 2 souls were saved because of him

39
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,210
而是神的安排
That was god's calculation

40
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,880
誰給嬰兒取名 嬰兒就會繼承誰的品行
The infant will inherit the behavior of the one who names the infant.

41
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,010
我不希望他像我一樣殘忍兇暴
So I expect him not to be brutal & vicious like me.

42
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,180
他要做個心靜如水的人
He should be a serene and calm soul!

43
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,220
就像孕育了一切的大地
..like the earth which bears everything.

44
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,600
我就以此為他取名
I will name him that.

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,850
Bhoominathan（在泰米爾語中是大地的意思）
Bhoominathan.

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
Ammukutty（女孩名）和Bhoomi Nathan
Ammukutty & Bhoomi Nathan!

47
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,860
為什么你要把名字擦掉
Why do you erase it off?

48
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,030
因為有個女孩的名字和我的名字寫在一起
Because a girl's name is written along with mine.

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,450
也許是因為她喜歡你呢
She might have liked you. That's why.

50
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,250
那這是你寫的哦 你就是Ammukutty
So, is it your work? Are you the Ammukutty?

51
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,800
你在哪個班
Which class are you studying?

52
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,300
從小他就是這個樣子
He is like this since the childhood.

53
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
喜歡他的女孩子都對他敬而遠之
The girls admire him keeping a distance.

54
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,810
大家都說長大以后想當醫生 工程師或律師 你卻說什么
All want to become a doctor, engineer, or a lawyer. What did you say?

55
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,390
- 你說你想做Shemmanoor Muthu Ramalingam那樣的人 - 是的 老師
-Do you want to become like Shemmanoor Muthu Ramalingam? -Yes sir

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,890
他給嬰兒取這名字是希望他心懷寧靜
He named the child so that he should be serene looking!

57
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,480
可是Bhoominathan卻
..but Bhoominathan

58
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Bhoomi歡迎儀式還行吧
Bhoomi! How's the reception?

59
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,330
- 歡迎誰 - 當然是你嘍
-For whom? -lt's for you!

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,300
還不錯 有個家伙和我名字一樣
Not bad. There is a guy in my name!

61
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,970
不是別人 叫的就是你
It is not somebody. lt is only you

62
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,470
去打倒他 把他塞進去
Go and get him. Send him in

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,560
- 你 - 快上
-You! -Go I say

64
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,230
他怎么倒了
How did he fall?

65
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,150
- 我們賺了150萬盧比 - 我什么都沒做啊
-15 lakhs are ours! -l didn't do anything.

66
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,370
他有超能力不
Is he get any supernatural power?

67
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,670
好像背扭傷了
It seems there is a sprain in the back

68
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,960
是我贏了
It is me

69
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,130
還有個人
There is another man.

70
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,150
怎么了
What happened?

71
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,360
我以為只是玩玩 沒想到他真打啊
I thought it is a game only. But he is really hitting me!

72
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,240
那你也真打 別浪費時間
You too go. Don't waste any time.

73
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,970
瞧瞧 我拿一成半 剩下的都歸你
Look! 15 percent is mine as commission! The rest is yours.

74
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,510
拿去給你姐姐辦嫁妝吧
Use it for your sister's marriage!

75
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,060
以后別叫我做這種事了
Don't call me for such things any more!

76
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,730
嗎
Mom!

77
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,450
老媽
Mother..

78
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,360
你回來了啊
Have you come?

79
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,370
你這些天都跑哪去了啊
Where were you all this time?

80
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,740
我說過我去了
I told you before I went..

81
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,910
我去參加朋友Shiva他姐姐的婚禮了
..that I am going to my friend Shiva's sister's marriage!

82
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
婚禮在Kumbakonam 你跑到曼谷去做什么
Marriage is in Kumbakonam! Why did you go to Bangkok before that?

83
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,540
你兒子一直是本地的小混混
Your son were being a rogue locally!

84
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,090
- 現在開始混到國外去了 - 我
Now he has started to go abroad! I am..

85
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,550
- 舅舅 - 你干嘛老是要我操心啊
-Uncle! -Why are you bothering me?

86
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,760
- 他說的都是真的 - 是真的 老媽
-ls it true what he says? -Yes mom!

87
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,470
干得好
Well done

88
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,760
你去賽拳就是為了錢
He was in the competition to earn money.

89
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,010
總有一天他會為了錢去殺人
He would become a killer just for money.

90
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,680
這就是我的命
It is my fate.

91
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,480
我早就知道 
I thought when he named the child..

92
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,560
讓Muthu Ramalingam給孩子取名 孩子一定會繼承他的惡性
I was sure he would inherit the qualities of Muthu Ramalingam.

93
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,440
他已經不做違法勾當了
He has stopped the criminal activities.

94
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,740
他現在是村莊的保護傘
..and has become the Godman of his village.

95
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,530
他必須要讓這個孩子轉性
He has to make this guy good.

96
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,240
我一直在這么想
That's what I was thinking about.

97
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,530
以后再也不能讓他做違法的事了
No criminal activities from him, are allowed in future here.

98
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,000
帶著這條笨狗 我到現在都沒找到家
I couldn't find this address yet..

99
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
他必須要讓這個孩子轉性 
..when I am searching with this dog.

100
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,540
再這樣下去 我都要累成狗樣了
If I go like this, I'll be exhausted like this dog.

101
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,460
我覺得這里就是了
I think that it is the one.

102
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,550
- 這里就是Bhoomi - 叫他Bhoomi老大
-This is Bhoomi.. -Call him Bhoomi sir.

103
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,430
誰要是再敢直呼他的英名
If anyone calls him only his name hereafter..

104
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,550
就要承擔一切惡果
..he will face the consequences.

105
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,100
這不是間房子 這是間寺廟
This is not a house but a temple.

106
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,390
他不是Bhoomi 他是我的大神
He is not Bhoomi but my Samy(God).

107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,110
Bhoomi出來吧
Bhoomi! Come out.

108
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,700
那是誰 老爸 是你朋友嗎
Who is it dad? Is he your friend?

109
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,910
我是你的助手
I am your Assistant!

110
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
讓我留下來做你的助手吧 你的生命會因此而閃耀
Keep me as your assistant! Your life will be bright.

111
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,710
- 你是誰 - 噢 天哪
-Who are you? -Oh god!

112
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,710
我跪著 你卻站在邊上看
You are watching while I am bowing down.

113
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,750
你和我一起跪 這樣才會答應我們留下來
You too have to bow down. Only then we both can be with him!

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,380
- 老大 狗狗的埔士不錯吧 - 站起來
-Boss! How is my dog's pose? -Get up!

115
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,630
我不起來 你得接受我
I won't. You have to commit me

116
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,640
- 接受我 - 那是誰啊
-Commit -Who is that?

117
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,760
為什么一大清早就堵在我們家門口
He has come and blocked the way in the early morning!

118
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,640
- 我有么 - 給我起來
-Am l like that? -Hey, get up man

119
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,640
我有問過你要助手嗎
Did I ask you for an assistant?

120
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,270
難道人們為Muruga神削發也要征得同意
（Muruga：印度教戰神 也被稱為泰米爾人之神）
Does one tonsure his head for Lord Murugan?

121
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,350
難道出席葬禮穿喪服也要遺體同意
Does one wear dress seeing the body?

122
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,480
同樣我不需要你的同意就能做你的保鏢
Like wise I have joined as a bodyguard for you without your permission

123
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
告訴我 你要我去砍誰
Tell me now. You show me him now

124
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,480
我立馬就去把他剁了
I will chop him off then and there.

125
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,030
他問你呢 告訴他
He is asking you. Tell him.

126
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,860
- 鼓起勇氣來 - 讓他砍我吧
-Take courage! -Let him chop me away.

127
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,860
砍他
Is it him?

128
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,570
你還嫌這里不夠亂啊 走開
He is adding more problems! Go

129
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,790
我能把包和狗留下嗎
Can l leave the bag and dog here?

130
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,500
它看著就像條流浪狗
He looks like a street dog!

131
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,670
嗨 你可以侮辱我 但你不能侮辱我兄弟
Look! You can abuse me, but not my brother

132
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,580
它不是你說的流浪狗
He is not a street dog as you say.

133
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,210
你瞧著 我來證明它是頭雄獅
You can watch it. I will prove that he is a lion!

134
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,800
這是個球兄弟
This is a ball. Brother.

135
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,810
好了 真不錯
That's it. Fine!

136
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,310
瞧見了嗎 老大
Have you seen it boss?

137
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,600
它把球撿回來了

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,630
作哦一名保鏢 你應該帶著勇氣而來
As a bodyguard, you should've come with energy (Thembu).

271
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,050
而不是帶著箭（泰米爾語中勇氣是Thembu 箭是Ambu 讀音近似）
..not with an arrow (ambu)

272
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,130

278
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,000

-Why? -We haven't seen a bodyguard as a whole.

280
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,920
你在開玩笑吧 我看著像個小丑嗎
Are you teasing? Do I look like a buffoon?

None is allowed to come unnecessarily to this compound.

282

We will come at times! Who are you to tell that?

283
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,600

Who is this smarty? Is it the union leader?

284
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,470
在廠里隨你怎么玩 在這里不行
You can have this nonsense in your factory. Not here.

285
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,310
啊 我的頭要炸了
Whoa! My head has exploded!

286
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,270
他們打中我了 把我打死了

293
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,000
我們必須要保證安全 對嗎
We have to provide security for them, right?

294
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,010
那沒錯 可現在又沒下雨

308
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,170
靠 我讓你掰下來 你開什么槍啊
Damn it. You are shooting instead of snatch it.

309
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
天哪 別開槍
Oh god! Don't shoot

310
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,180
把槍口朝天上

他在哪里 怎么沒見到人

320
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,150
你看不見 他在后面

321
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,530
我不是問Karthi
I didn't ask for Karthi!

322
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,160
- 我是問那個保鏢 - 誰 - 那個保鏢

326
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,880
真的 你的保鏢來了
Really your bodyguard has come.

327
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,290
- 保鏢 - 是的

328
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
我為什么要保鏢
Why do I need a bodyguard?

329
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,880
爸爸 你有生命危險

332
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,050
你們不長腦子的嗎
Don't you have sense?

333
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,060
陌生人說什么就是什么
You believe strangers what they say!

334
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,600
他們要什么就給什么嗎
..and provide what they ask for, right?

335
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,730
主人 我在 有何吩咐

336
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,730
我不需要什么保鏢

我會和爸爸說的 好嗎
I'll talk to dad, ok?

341
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
父親要他走 女兒不要他走
Dad wants him to go back and daughter is against him!

342
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,710
這種情況下 我怎么還睡得著
How can I have my sleep in this situation?

343
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,430
工會主席 你在這里做什么
You union leader! What are you doing here?

344
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,930
下班后你該回自己的家
You have to go back to your home after the work!

345
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,060
我回去了 女主人要我來了
I went. Madam asked me to come!

346
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,730
所以我就來了
That's why I came here.

347
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,570
女主人要你來 那你該去那個房間
You go to that room if mom asked to come..

348
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,400
你去少爺房間干什么
Why do you go to his room?

349
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,150
- 因為 - 別是出軌的事吧
-That is.. -Are you acting big?

350
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,240
都是因為惹上了女人的事 他才離開這里的
He went out of town in the ladies weakness!

351
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,280
現在才剛回來
..and he has come only now!

352
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,830
你還想惹新的麻煩嗎
Do you want to create problem again?

353
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,410
你說什么 什么女人的事
What did you say? Ladies weakness?

354
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,910
是啊 大學里
Yes, In college..

355
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,500
到這邊說
Come here.

356
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,170
大學里的時候 他和一個女生扯上了關系
When he was in the college, he got linked up with a girl..

357
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,420
惹出了大麻煩
..and created a big problem!

358
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,510
那女孩的父親把他抓去 逼他和自己的女兒成親
Her dad took him and was about to forcibly marry him to his daughter!

359
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,640
我們的主人想辦法把他救出來了 送去迪拜
Our sir managed to save him from that and sent him to Dubai!

360
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,760
一個保鏢怎么會知道這些事
How do the bodyguard know all this?

361
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,930
你覺得保鏢就該一無所知嗎
Do you think that a bodyguard is nothing?

362
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
我知道保鏢的全部歷史
I know the complete history of the bodyguard..

363
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,350
還有敵人會怎樣找上門來
.. and how the enemies could come!

364
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,270
我用拳腳就能打退他門
I could get rid of them by force only then!

365
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
要是對方也很歷害呢
What if he too is strong?

366
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,650
那 我們就要更歷害 把他消滅
Then.. we have to use more strength and destroy him!

367
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,530
你反問我做什么 
Why do you ask cross questions?

368
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,950
只有動物才用暴力制服其他動物
Only animals use their power to rule over other animals!

369
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,420
- 什么 - 我們要用愛而不是用武力來改變別人
-What? -We have to use love not strength to correct man!

370
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,090
好 我同意 這么晚了
Ok! I agree. You need not have to rule others..

371
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,720
你不需要用愛來制服誰 走吧 
..in this night with love! Go..

372
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,020
Meera 進來

373
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,770
你曾經愛過一個女孩 后來背叛了她
You have loved & betrayed a girl before.

374
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,480
所以爸爸才送你去迪拜
That's why you were sent to Dubai.

375
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,240
- 誰和你說的 - 那個女孩
-Who told you all this? -lt was that girl!

她打電話給我了 電話里都告訴我了
She called me over phone and told this!

377
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,490

他是 他是我的未婚夫
He is.. he is my fiance!

539
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,600
他向我求婚 然后我把他介紹給了主人
After the proposal I took him to sir and introduced him!

540
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,810
主人讓他做家里的司機
He offered him the driver's job.

541
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,980
- 消失吧 - 消失 你丟了什么
-lt is gone. -Gone? What did you lose?

542
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,900
你給我消失吧 閉嘴

543
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,770
保鏢 主人叫你去

544
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,530
- 主人 你叫我 - 是的
-Sir! Did you call me? -Yes.

545

把你大學時的詳細信息和證書交給Karthi
Give your details & certificates of your college to Karthi!

00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,870
我已經安排你和Meera進同一所大學
I have arranged for admission for you in the college where Meera is studying!

547
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,330
你要我進大學讀書嗎 不行啊 主人
Do you want to admit me in the college? No sir.

548
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,920
我不讀書已經很多年了
It is long time since I stopped my studies.

549
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,500
我不想讀書了
I don't want to study anymore!

550
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,210
誰管你讀不讀書
Who is bothered about your studies?

551
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
你是去保護Meera的
You will be the bodyguard for Meera.

552
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
保護Meera
..as Meera's bodyguard?

553
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,510
沒錯 Meera和我女兒Madhu假期后
Yes! Meera and my daughter Madhu are going to college...

554
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,050
要去讀大學了
..after the vacation!

555
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,970
主人決定讓你作為保鏢陪她們去
Sir has decided that you have to go with them as their bodyguard!

556
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,190
主人 恕我直言 我的責任是保護你
Sir! Don't mistake me. It is my duty to be your bodyguard.

557
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,360
可是要我去保護一個女孩子
But for a girl.....!

558
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,030
Bhoomi 難道那天你沒聽見Devarajan說的話
Bhoomi! Didn't you hear what Devarajan told the other day?

559
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,950
好吧 主人 我會去的
Ok,sir. I will go.

560
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:23,370
Chakra別睡了 給他們安排去吧
Chakra! Don't sleep. Make arrangements for them to go.

561
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,040
是 主人 明天你就和她們一起走吧
Ok, Sir. Tomorrow you are going with them.

562
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,300
還有你的未婚夫也要一起去
Along with them your future husband...

563
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,760
瞧瞧他擺的姿勢 他叫什么名字
Look how he gives his pose. What is his name?

564
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,600
-Amavasai - Amavasai和你一起去
-Amavasai! -Amavasai and you are going with them.

565
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,390
- 為什么要他一起去 - 讓你有個伴
-Why do we want him? -Just to accompany you.

566
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,270
你們不住大學宿舍
You are not going to the college hostel.

567
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,560
你們住主人的別墅
But in the guest house of sir.

568
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,740
等一下 Meera已經訂婚了
Wait. Meera's is engaged already.

569
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,070
一定要記住
Keep that in mind always.

570
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,490
- Chakra兄弟 - 啊 沒錯
-Then Chakra brother! -Correct!

571
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,910
他不能像個學校里的學生
He shouldn't behave like a student in the college.

572
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,920
- 他要看上去像個保鏢 - 不用擔心 太太
-He should be a bodyguard! -Don't worry madam.

573
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,540
無論Meera去哪里 我都形影不離
I'll be a shadow for Meera wherever she go.

574
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,380
這才是稱職的保鏢
..like a perfect bodyguard.

575
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,100
第一天報到的新生們
Students who have come for the 1st day of the college..

576
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,350
作為這所學校最勇敢的人 號稱校之雄獅的本人
This university's courageous guy lion of the college.

577
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,900
代表所有人歡迎新生代表
I welcome the leader on behalf of all!

578
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,320
- 嗨 小家伙 -滾
-Hai, buddy. -Get away.

579
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,080
這是個花環嗎 我還以為是個拱門呢
Is it a garland? I thought it was an Arch.

580
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,370
靠
Oops!

581
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,040
你給了我這么重一束花
You give me a heavy one.

582
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,130
你沒腦子嗎
Don't you have sense?

583
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,220
一朵玫瑰花才比較適合我
A rose flower is apt for me.

584
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,390
快點拿給我 有人會拌跤摔死的 拿給我
Take it fast. Someone will against it and die. Take it.

585
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,390
像小山一樣重
It seems like a hill.

586
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,990
- 那是誰 - 等等 我讓你們下車你們再下
-Who is that? -Wait! Get down only after I tell you.

587
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,380
哦 天哪
Oh God!

588
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,310
她穿得可真傻
His outfit looks silly.

589
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,140
大家都在望著我們 
All are looking at us.

590
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,810
盡管讓他們看 要讓所有人都知道我是你們的保鏢
Let them watch us. Let them know that l'm your bodyguard.

591
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,270
所以我才穿套制服來的
This uniform is for that only.

592
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,530
你是穿保鏢的衣服跟她們去學校的嗎
Have you gone with them in the bodyguard's attire?

593
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,030
還記得我交待你的話嗎
Do you remember what l told you?

594
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,580
你們現在在哪里 到學校了嗎
Where are you now? Have you reached the college?

595
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,290
是 太太 Meera和Madhu正在去教室的路上
Yes madam! Meera and Madhu are going to their classes!

596
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,750
我正跟隨著她們 
I'm going behind them!

597
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,220
你是蠢還是笨啊
Is your duty in the ladies toilet?

598
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,760
先生 那是個
Sir! That is...

599
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,560
不要說了 我不想聽解釋 你隨隨便便就闖了進去
You went there wantonly.

600
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,020
在你以前的學校你就是個不良分子
You were a rowdy in the college you studied.

601
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,020
很多人都和我這樣說了
Many people told me that.

602
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,150
但我還是接受了你入學
But you were given admission in this college.

603
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,400
你知道為什么嗎 因為我看過你的成績單
Do you know why? After seeing your mark sheet only.

604
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,400
你本可以拿第2名的
You could be No.2 in the university..

605
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,490
只要你別混日子 而是好好讀書的話
..if you hadn't been a rowdy in the college and if you studied well.

606
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,120
不過現在在這里 你還是有機會榜上有名的
You have chances to become a rank holder even now.

607
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,660
他在說廢話
He is doing unnecessary talk

608
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,460
只是因為這個原因 我才原諒你這一次
You have been pardoned off for this only reason..

609
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,830
而不是開除你 明白嗎
..without dismissing you! Understand?

610
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,710
要是你再以保鏢的名義進入女廁所
If you go to the ladies toilet again in the pretext of your duty...

611
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,010
沒有你的命令我不會再進去了
I won't go unless you tell me.

612
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,720
- 好 去吧 - 去女廁所嗎
-Ok go. -To the ladies toilet?

613
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,840
去教室
Go to your class.

614
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,640
他總是給我惹麻煩 瞧瞧他
He is bothering me too much. See him!

615
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
坐在地板上
Sit down on the floor.

616
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,770
要是桌子斷了 他們會怪我的
If the desk breaks off.. they will blame me.

617
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,800
大家早上好 請坐 請坐
What is this? Go and sit there.

618
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,010
快找位置坐下
The one with a smiling mouth has come.

619
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
坐 請坐下
Go and sit.

620
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,610
我讓你坐下
I told you to sit.

621
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,280
為什么 有問題嗎
Why? ls there any problem?

622
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,870
我不應該坐下來 我是一名保鏢
Bodyguards won't sit.

623
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,590
保鏢從來不坐
Bodyguard! What for?

624
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,430
保鏢 保護誰 你叫什么？
What's your name sir?

625
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
啊
Whoa!

626
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,280
當心點
Careful..

627
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:48,780
挪過去點
Move a little.

628
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,060
是 上課時要集中注意力
That is.. You should concentrate in the class!

629
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,770
要是你老是東張西望的 你怎么可能學明白
If you look here and there, you won't be able to understand.

630
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,690
你是來學校讀書的還是來走時裝秀的
Are you coming to the college to study or for the fashion parade?

631
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,790
我沒問你 你是Meera嗎
I didn't ask you! Are you Meera?

632
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,290
- 不管是誰回答 反正你要的就是個答案 - 你閉嘴給我出去
Whoever it is, all you want is the answer!

633
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,980
他是來保護Meera的
He is there for giving protection for Meera.

634
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,150
那誰來保護我
Who will give protection for me?

635
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,690
所以我對你說 要對Bhoomi好一點
That's why I told you to be friendly with Bhoomi!

636
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,980
完全不是那回事
Not at all.

637
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,360
要想讓他融入我們 
If he has to be brought in our way as you think..

638
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,080
只有你們女孩子才能辦到
..it could be possible only with you girls.

639
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,710
- 不防試試 - 你不讓我們活了啊
-Just have a try. -Don't you like us being alive?

640
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,630
我沒讓你們去和他當面說
I didn't ask you to go to him and tell.

641
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,710
我是說通過電話
I mean over the phone!

642
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,880
你們知道月多少女孩子在電話里愛上了我嗎
Do you know how many girls love me over the phone?

643
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,010
她們沒一個知道我是誰
None of them know who I am.

644
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,640
這就是電話情緣的優勢
That's the advantage of the love in phone!

645
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,220
安靜 沒人說要通過電話來改變他
Be quiet. None has to change him over the phone.

646
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,020
能讓他不穿制服就足夠了
Tell an idea how to change his uniform. That's enough.

647
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,810
每次看到你的制服我都嫉妒
I feel jealousy when l see your uniform.

648
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,440
你總不給我機會穿一次
You haven't given me a chance to wear this.

649
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,980
- 那至少給我個機會讓我燙一次吧 - 不行
-Give me the chance to press it at least. -No.

650
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,610
你去洗個澡吃點東西
You go and have bath and have food.

651
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,780
我來燙衣服
I will do the ironing work.

652
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,700
- 管好你自己的事就行了 - 我就是在找事情做啊
-Go and mind your work. -l am asking the work only.

653
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,620
那就去睡覺
Go and sleep.

654
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,000
那你可沒這運氣了 瞧瞧他在做什么
You are not lucky enough. See what he is doing!

655
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,830
像是送外賣出身的
He seems to have worked in the tiffin shop before.

656
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,210
啊 媽呀
Ouch! Mom!

657
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,750
他亂七八糟的動作可真多
He has enough monkey acts it looks!

658
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,840
我睡覺時可得警覺些
I should be alert while go for sleeping!

659
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,110
什么怪味
What is that strange smell?

660
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,650
他不會干了什么吧
Has anything happened to him?

661
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,830
靠 這是誰干的
Oops! Who might have done it?

662
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,670
神啊 告訴我這是誰干的
God! Show me the one who has done it.

663
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,510
出什么事了 誰在大喊大叫
What happened? Who is yelling?

664
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,060
我要你以后再也礙不了我的事
I will bring an end to your nuisance!

665
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,060
你為什么要那樣做
Why did you do that?

666
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:11,650
救救我 他要殺了我 救命啊
Save me! He is killing me. Save me.

667
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,990
放開他 我讓你住手
Leave him. I tell you to stop it.

668
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,200
現在是吵架的時候嗎
Is it the time to quarrel?

669
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,410
我沒和他吵架
I didn't quarrel with him.

670
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,330
是他用熱熨斗燙我
He pressed me with the hot iron!

671
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,830
看看他都做了什么
Look where he has done it!

672
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
看看 大家都看看
Look madam! All see it.

673
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,210
他燙錯地方了
He has pressed it in the wrong place.

674
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,130
下流 那種地方你怎么敢給大家看
Nasty. How dare you show the place?

675
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,590
我只是給大家看你燙過的褲子
I showed my trouser where you have pressed.

676
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,930
我什么都沒干 我那時就是睡覺來著
I didn't do anything! I was sleeping!

677
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,930
是他用熨斗燙我屁股
It was him who has pressed the iron on me.

678
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,140
- 難道你什么都沒干 - 什么都沒干
-Didn't you do anything? -Yes!

679
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,680
- 我讓你什么都別干 - 沒錯
-l told you not to do anything! -Yes!

680
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,140
- 那你為什么做這個 - 我到底做什么了
-Why did you do this then? -What did I do then?

681
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,270
瞧瞧他做的好事
Look, what has he done.

682
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,900
他還不如把褲子偷了還好些
He could've stolen it instead!

683
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,110
他把褲子燙了兩個大洞 這下褲子徹底廢了
He made holes in it and made it useless.

684
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,570
對 白癡
Yes! Idiot!

685
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,990
到底是哪個白癡把褲子燙穿的 
Who is the idiot who has put holes in it?

686
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,320
我現在就要知道
I want to know it now.

687
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,820
- 就是你 - 我嗎
-lt's you. -Me?

688
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,910
我那時在睡覺 怎么可能是我
How could I do that when I was sleeping?

689
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,910
因為你夢游
Somnambulism!

690
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,960
私底下你盡管罵我
Take me to a lone place and scold me

691
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
我能接受
I will accept that.

692
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,380
要是你在女孩子面前讓我難堪 我從此和你一刀兩斷
If you disgrace me before the girls our friendship will get cut.

693
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,680
夢游是說人睡著了還會起來走動
Somnambulism is a disease which the patient walks in sleep.

694
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,220
- 我 - 夠了
-Me? -Enough!

695
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,350
- 我 - 夠了
-Me? -Enough, sir!

696
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,020
不就是條褲子嗎 吵什么吵
It is after all pants! Why all this chaos?

697
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,930
好我明天去學校穿什么
What will I wear in the college tomorrow?

698
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,100
你就沒有其他衣服褲子了嗎
Don't you have any pants and shirts with you?

699
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,350
這是我的制服
This is my uniform!

700
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,520
你又不是讀幼兒園的小孩 穿什么制服
Are you an LKG student to wear the uniform?

701
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,230
就是啊 你幼兒園沒讀好啊
That's it. What's the use studying big LKG studies?

702
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,450
神創造了我們 就是讓你用熨斗燙別人屁股的嗎
Has God created us to rub the iron in one's back?

703
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,780
- 別說了 - 關燈睡覺吧
-Leave it -Switch off the light and sleep.

704
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,250
今天開始制服問題算是
From today on wards, the uniform matter..

705
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,970
- 你找什么呢 - 還有個熨斗去哪里了呢
-What are you searching? -Where is the other iron box?

706
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,220
還有一個熨斗嗎
Another iron box!

707
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,100
你瞧 這里有兩個洞 可是只找到一個熨斗啊
Look! There are two holes! But the iron box is only one.

708
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,060
還有一個去哪里了
Where is the other one?

709
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,230
看看床下有沒有
Look under the bed.

710
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,030
這算什么 啊 
What is it? Whoe!

711
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,610
等等 等等
Wait.

712
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,620
燙傷可以治愈 被言語傷害可治不了
A fire burn can be cured but not the verbal abuse

713
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,870
詩人Kannadasan曾經這么說
Poet Kannadasan has told it once!

714
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,960
是Kannadasan還是Yesudas（歌手名）
Is it Kannadasan or Yesudas (singer)?

715
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,040
可憐的人 他被我搞糊涂了
Poor guy! He has got confused.

716
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,470
你不讓我睡個好覺 她也不讓我睡個好覺
Either he or she won't allow me to sleep.

717
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,180
我不娶她了
Let the marriage be over.

718
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,220
Meera Madhu 開門
Meera! Madhu! Open the door.

719
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,730
怎么了 叫什么了
What happened to you? Why do you yell up?

720
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:55,270
- 快過來 - 出什么事了 - 看那里
-Come fast. -What happened to her? -Look there.

721
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,400
昏昏沉沉時量的尺寸難道不對嗎
Hasn't the size taken correct in sleepy mood?

722
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,900
好像有點大了
It is little over size!

723
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,410
裁縫也是這么說的
The tailor has told the same.

724
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,280
我可不管你是我老大還是個神經病
Whether you are my boss or a lunatic!

725
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,210

Stop there. Will you go after him if he calls you?

735

I am telling now. Go this way and hurry up. Go.

736

Madhu! You go home with them

801
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,250
不關我的事
Don't do anything to me.

802
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,080
是Devaraj要我們干的
Devaraj is the reason for everything.

803
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,850
- Devaraj那混蛋在哪 - 不關我們的事啊
-Where is Devaraj? -Don't do anything to us.

804
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,850
我說實話 他去美國了
To tell the truth, he has gone to US.

805
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,810
- 他去美國了 這樣沒人會懷疑到他
-Has he gone to US? -That nobody should suspect him..

806
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,140
他做好了所有安排然后逃跑了
He did all arrangements and has escaped.

807
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,650
他不會回來了
He wouldn't come back.

808
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,860
只要他不回來 他就能免于一死
He will be alive till he is there.

809
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,860
告訴他
Tell him.

810
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,420
- 爸 - 你沒事吧
-Dad! -Nothing has happened to you, right?

811
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,290
沒事 老媽你不用擔心
No mom. You need not worry, mom.

812
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,920
Bhoomi當時和我們在一起
Bhoomi was there with us.

813
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:57,140
我們信任你所以把女孩們交給你保護
We sent our girl to you believing you!

814
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,440
就好比你的父母信任你 所以把你派到我身邊
It is like your parents has sent you to me believing you.

815
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,190
你不應該訴諸暴力
You should not go for any violence.

816
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,110
但這次都是因為我
But I myself have sent you for that.

817
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,900
下次再有事你盡管打電話給我
You can call me up whatever it is.

818
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,530
- 我會負責搞定的 - 是
-l'll take care of it. -Ok

819
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,660
你不能再使用暴力了
You should not go for any violence.

820
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,910
你要專心學習
You've to concentrate on your studies.

821
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,120
不光是你自己 你還要教好兩個女孩子
Not only you. You have to teach these girls too well.

822
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,750
- 從此以后這就是你的職責了 - 是
-lt is your duty hereafter. -OK!

823
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,520
我實在太困了
I feel sleepy.

824
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,150
明天再寫作業吧
I'll write the rest tomorrow.

825
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,610
- 行 去睡吧 晚安 - 天哪 終于可以去睡了
God! You all can go and sleep.

826
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,700
但是你們兩個明天早上4點必須在這里
You both have to be here tomorrow morning at 4.

827
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,790
完了 坐下吧 我們結婚后再睡吧
Good! Sit down! Let's have it after our marriage.

828
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,790
- 怎么了 - 我們現在就寫完作業
-What happened? -We will finish writing now itself.

829
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:01,710
讀吧
Tell us.

830
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,330
你沒聽見我的話嗎
Didn't you hear me?

831
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,420
你們寫筆記的時候都昏昏欲睡了
You fell drowsy when taking down the notes.

832
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,340
你看什么 去睡覺
Why do you look there? Go and sleep.

833
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,710
明早再繼續 走
We shall continue in the morning. Go.

834
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,720
終于結束了 我們也去睡覺吧
They have finished it at last. Let us go and sleep.

835
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,890
- 明早再繼續 - 走
-We shall continue in the morning. -Go.

836
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,180
我們還沒睡呢
Haven't you slept yet?

837
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,720
你就知道教這些多才的女孩卻忽略了我
You are teaching those learned girls, ignoring me

838
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,520
兩扇門都關了
All the doors have closed.

839
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,600
老大 他肯定生氣了 門都忘記關了
Boss! He forgot to put the lock as he was annoyed.

840
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:26,900
瞧瞧 老爸都做了什么
See what my dad has done!

841
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,320
我想擺脫那家伙 他卻讓他做我們的老師
When l wanted to avoid the guy he was made him our master.

842
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,360
他不是老師 他簡直就是班主任
He is not a master, but the head master!

843
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,910
以前還挺可愛 挺關心人的
He was innocent and caring at first.

844
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:37,830
現在就像個軍訓教官
Now he acts as a military officer!

845
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,160
他至少能對我們笑笑吧
He could smile at us a bit at least.

846
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
這樣下去不行
Hey stop!

847
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,040
Madhu 我們必須要他按我們的想法做事
Madhu! We should bring Bhoomi in our way.

848
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,330
想個辦法吧
Find a way for that.

849
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,880
忘了這個蠢主意 去睡一會吧
Forget this foolish act and try to get some sleep.

850
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,420
我們明天4點就要起床的
You have to get up at 4 in the morning.

851
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,340
沒人能改變他
None can change him as you think.

852
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,350
Bonsai說過讓女孩們通過電話愛上Bhoomi
Bonsai told before all the girls to try to love Bhoomi in the phone!

853
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,430
有人試過嗎 忘了愛吧
Did anyone try it? Forget love.

854
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,520
沒有女孩敢站在他面前
No girls have the courage to stand before him.

855
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,190
如果是這樣 那我自己試試呢
If so, what if I tried myself?

856
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,980
你為什么要試 省點勁吧
Why should you try? Don't spoil your prestige.

857
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,610
他不會知道是我的
He wouldn't know it is me.

858
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,360
他怎么可能聽不出來是你
How will you talk if he doesn't know it is you?

859
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,990
這個手機有隱藏呼叫者號碼的功能
This mobile restricts the caller ID.

860
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,990
只要用這個手機打給他 他看不到來電號碼的
If you call in this phone, the phone number will not come.

861
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,450
只會顯示成隱藏號碼的
It will come as the private number.

862
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,910
他就不知道是我了 對吧
He can't find me out, right?

863
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
他能從聲音里聽出來的
He could find you from your voice.

864
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,000
我能改變語調啊
I'll change my tone when I talk.

865
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:30,300
改變語調 怎么改
Another tone? How is that?

866
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,890
我是你的粉絲 你現在有空嗎
I am your fan!

867
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,140
我用這個語調他還能聽出來嗎
Can he find out with this tone?

868
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:47,150
完全聽不出 你怎么做到的
No. Not at all! How did you do it?

869
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,610
那就行了
That's it!

870
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,940
Meera 別貪玩 會出事情的
Meera! Don't play. It will pose a problem.

871
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:53,940
不會的 
Nothing like that.

872
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,240
你也不要告訴別人
You shouldn't tell it to anyone.

873
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,080
隱藏號碼
What is this private number?

874
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,290
是誰啊
Who is it?

875
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,590
你聽不見我嗎
Can't you hear me talking?

876
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,990
是誰 我在問你 你怎么不說話啊
Who is it? I'm asking you. Won't you talk?

877
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,330
這個手機該仍掉了
The phone has to be in the dust bin.

878
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,880
- 誰 - Bhoominathan
-Who? -Bhoominathan!

879
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,210
- 哪個Bhoominathan - 保鏢Bhoominathan
-Which Bhoominathan? -The Bodyguard!

880
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,590
老大 我沒問你
I didn't ask you, boss!

881
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,970
我是問誰打來的電話 
I asked you who was talking to you in the phone.

882
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,880
我問了 可是沒人回答
I too asked that but no reply.

883
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,220
那你就打回去問問
You could as well dial the number and ask!

884
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,220
看不到來電號碼
No number has come!

885
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,220
手機顯示不出來電號碼 怎么可能
The phone comes without a number. Is it possible?

886
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,220
那就去睡覺吧
Go to sleep then.

887
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,520
只有顯示了號碼你才能通話
You can talk only when the number appears.

888
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,350
真惡作劇啊
How roguish?

889
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,230
老大 別接
Boss! Stop.

890
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,440
要是對方聽見了我們的聲音卻不吱聲
If the party keeps silent even after hears our voice..

891
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,440
那是我們的恥辱
..it will be a shame for us.

892
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,150
我來說話 他怎么敢這么惡作劇
Now I will talk. How dare he is?

893
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,580
老大 是個女孩
Boss! It is a girl!

894
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,040
女孩 哪個女孩
Girl? Which girl?

895
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,750
問她是哪個號碼打來的
Ask her from which number is she calling!

896
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,500
你從哪個號碼打來的
From which number are you calling?

897
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,210
你要找誰
Whom do you want?

898
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,220
我找Bhoominathan
I want to talk to Bhoominathan?

899
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,220
手機是他的 聲音是我的
The phone is his... but the tone is mine.

900
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,970
- 你是誰啊 親愛的 - 戀人
-Who are you dear? -Lover!

901
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:52,480
你的戀人為什么要打我的手機
Why should your lover call me in my number?

902
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,650
是你的戀人 老大
It is your lover boss!

903
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,570
只有你的戀人才會打你的手機
Only your lover would call in your phone!

904
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,110
你是誰 
Who are you?

905
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,400
你在耍我嗎
Are you playing with me?

906
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,110
我會揍你的 不要再打過來了
I'll whack you up. Keep it down.

907
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,030
這是椰子 這是手機啊
Is it a coconut? It is a cellular phone.

908
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,500
Abraham Lincoln辛辛苦苦才發明出來的
Abraham Lincoln would have toiled much to invent that!

909
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,660
到底是Abraham Lincoln還是Abdul Kalam
（印度某任總統 同是也是著名科學家）
Was it Abraham Lincoln or Abdul Kalam?

910
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,130
他又被搞糊涂了
He himself has got confused.

911
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:16,210
我們早上可以問問他
We will ask him in the morning!

912
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,670
這辦法肯定起作用了
The idea has been worked out!

913
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,210
今天足夠了
It's enough for him

914
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,510
明天再繼續
The rest can be tomorrow.

915
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,940
開開門
Open the door.

916
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,450
你們準備好下樓來
You both get ready and come downstairs.

917
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:54,580
- 起床了 - Meera起床了
-Get up! -Meera, get ready!

918
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,510
- 快點 - 見鬼了
-Fast. -Damn it.

919
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,690
Meera快點準備好下樓去
Meera! Get ready fast and come.

920
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,980
要不班主任又要上來了
Or the head master would come up.

921
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,130
接吧 你掛斷他還會再打來的
Attend it. If you cut it he would call you again!

922
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,590
像是打錯了 不用接
This look like a phony number. No need to attend it.

923
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,390
- 瞧瞧 - 你可以關機的
-See! -You could switch it off.

924
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,310
主人說過手機不能關機
Sir has told that the phone shouldn't be switched off.

925
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,610
- 別多嘴 - 掛掉了
-Keep quiet. -lt has got cut.

926
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,400
你干嘛老是說這一句啊
Why do you tell it again and again?

927
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,550
下課 我有重要的事情 你們快走
I have do urgent work. Go fast.

928
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,640
你
You...

929
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,190
你又掛了嗎
Have you disconnected it?

930
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,560
你掛了算你聰明
You are safe as you have cut it.

931
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:27,030
要是被我逮住了 我要殺了你
If you are caught I would kill you.

932
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,790
別說了 
Keep quiet.

933
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:39,040
終于可以睡個安穩覺了
I can sleep peacefully now.

934
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,300
Meera起來洗漱啦

（隱藏號碼的英文是Private Number 音似Parvathi Nambiyar）
It is not Parvathi Nambiyar. It is private number!

943
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,410
拼寫不是一樣的嗎

說什么喜歡我

958
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,800
難道你還指望我來追求你

你嘴里一顆牙都不會剩下
There won't be a tooth left in your mouth.

1018

那就不是一刻鐘的問題了

1033
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,110
你就叫我Ammukutty好了

1040
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:29,120
沙漠里也開始下小雨了
It has started to drizzle in the desert.

1041
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,700
慢慢地就會變成大雨

1042
01:18:51,180 --> 01:19:01,190
是誰啊 是誰啊

是誰折磨我的心靈

又是誰閉眼在盲行

1045
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:21,580
是誰啊 是誰啊

是誰和我若即又若離
The one who stayed close to me. The one who stayed away from me.

1047
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,800
問題就是答案 就像分居不可相見的情侶
The answer came as the question! As the separation who stayed away.

A tussle goes on in me in the morning and evening.

1071
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,440
噢 媽啊 
Oh mom!

1072
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:33,780
即使熟睡時 夢中也在上演古典舞劇
Kathakali (Classic dance) in my mind goes on when I sleep.

1073
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:43,330
無論清晨還是深夜 我的心中總充滿著爭斗
A tussle goes on in me in the morning and evening.

1074
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:48,340
即使熟睡時 夢中也在上演古典舞劇
Kathakali in my mind goes on when I sleep.

1075
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:53,340
她無時無刻不占據著我的頭腦
She is in me in the day, in the night and in my mind

1076
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:57,970
無論在夢中還是在現實 她就像影子緊緊追隨著我
She is in my dream and in reality like a shadow!

1077
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:02,230
我的心四處搜尋她
My heart searches for her everywhere.

1078
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:07,230
是誰啊 是誰啊
Who is it? Who is it?..

1079
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:47,980
她像龍 從天而降至我的頭上
She gets down on the top of my head like a dragon!

1080
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,820
然后開始折磨我
After getting down in me she starts torturing me.

1081
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:57,910
萬人之中難以尋覓她的蹤跡
She makes it impossible to find her out among others.

1082
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:02,450
卻唯有她的面容最有魅力
Her face is more attractive than others!

1083
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:06,960
她給我的愛無形無色
She makes love to me being invisible!

1084
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:16,590
是誰啊 是誰啊
Who is it? Who is it?..

1085
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:21,640
是誰折磨我的心靈
The one who tortures my mind.

1086
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:26,140
又是誰閉眼在盲行
The one who closes the eyes and going!

1087
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:37,240
是誰啊 是誰啊
Who is it? Who is it?..

1088
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:39,990
是誰和我若即
The one who stayed close to me.

1089
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,280
又是誰和我若離
The one who stayed away from me.

1090
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,950
問題就是答案
The answer came as the question!

1091
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,410
就像分居不可相見的情侶
As the separation..

1092
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,710
好吧 我找不到你
Ok, I couldn't find you out.

1093
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:59,890
行了告訴我吧 你的真名是什么
Ok tell me now. What is your original name?

1094
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,640
- Ammukutty - 你撒謊
-Ammukutty! -You are lying

1095
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,890
好吧 那告訴我你是哪個班的總行吧
Ok tell me in which class you are studying?

1096
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,310
至少告訴我 你是哪個專業的吧
At least you can tell me which department.

1097
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,440
為什么要告訴你 讓你找到我罵我一頓嗎
Why? To find me out and scold, right?

1098
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,150
不是 不是 我現在已經不生你的氣了
No, Now I am not angry with you

1099
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,860
那你是開始喜歡上我了
Then, have you started to love me?

1100
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,410
是這樣
It is..

1101
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,240
沒見過你怎么可能喜歡上你
How can I love without seeing you in person?

1102
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,160
你能見我但是有個條件
You can see

1103
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,370
你不能再總是跟著那女孩子了
You've to stop going behind that girl

1104
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,090
跟著那個女孩子 你是說
Behind the girl? What do you mean?

1105
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:35,170
跟著Meera
Behind Meera?

1106
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:39,510
我不喜歡看你整天像根尾巴一樣跟著她
I don't like you roaming behind her like a tail

1107
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,140
她覺得她自己是誰啊 
What is she thinking herself?

1108
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,260
世界小姐啊
Is she the Miss World?

1109
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:47,180
她為什么總是小題大作 你這么優秀 她卻讓你做她的跟班
Why does she overact making you being a gem of a person roaming behind her?

1110
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:48,350
住嘴
Stop it

1111
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,440
你有什么資格對Meera說三道四的
Who are you to talk nonsense about our Meera?

1112
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,860
夠了 我不想知道你的底細了
It's enough. I don't need to know your whereabouts and details

1113
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,240
不要再打電話給我了 消失吧
Don't call me again

1114
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,840
我說了不要再打過來了
I told you not to call me again.

1115
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,930
你怎么又打過來了
Then why did you call me?

1116
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:24,720
- 快掛掉 - 別掛掉
-Cut the call -Don't cut it.

1117
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:28,140
我以后再也不會說Meera的壞話了
Henceforth l won't talk anything wrong about Meera

1118
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,060
那是因為她沒有哪點不好的
You can't find anything wrong about her

1119
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:36,230
我想聽聽你說說Meera的事
When you talk about Meera I wish to know more about her.

1120
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,230
你能說給我聽嗎
Will you tell me?

1121
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:39,110
你知道了又怎么樣
What will you do by knowing that?

1122
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,450
因為那樣我就能向她學習了 你就會喜歡我了
If I behave like her, you will like me. That's why

1123
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,950
你怎才不說話
Why have you become silent?

1124
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,950
這不是后天能學來的
It is not money to earn

1125
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,370
那是她與生俱來的品質
It is character It should come by birth

1126
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,380
就說一點
Just know one thing

1127
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:01,760
你見過哪個老板的女兒
Have you ever seen a boss daughter..

1128
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,380
能和自己的服裝廠女工們打成一片的呢
..who mingle closely with their garments company workers?

1129
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:07,850
只有Semmanooru Muthuramaiah的女兒
It is Semmanooru Muthuramaiah's daughter..

1130
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,810
我們的Meera
..our Meera

1131
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,730
以前我們老板總是陷入麻煩
Once upon a time our sir always entered into troubles..

1132
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:20,480
是我們的Meera改變了他 讓他成了人人贊揚的人
..but our Meera changed him and made him to be praised by people

1133
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:27,200
以前我是個混混 只懂用暴力去獲得東西
Earlier I too have thought to attain anything by force and roamed as a rogue.

1134
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:30,200
是我們的Meera讓我明白了
But our Meera made me to understand that..

1135
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:33,620
靠暴力是統治不了國家的 暴力只能統治森林
..strength is not suitable to rule the nation and it is suitable to the forest

1136
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:37,540
我們要用愛去統治一切
..and you've to rule everything by the love

1137
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,550
保護Muthuramaiah是我的責任
It is my duty coming as escort for Muthuramaiah

1138
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:47,720
但保護Meera是我的榮耀
Now I feel as a honor to be a protector to Meera

1139
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:56,100
你說Meera的不是 我就不高興
I got angry when you told nonsense about Meera

1140
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,360
所以我才責怪你 我很抱歉 非常抱歉
That's why I scolded you

1141
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,280
你為什么說抱歉
Why do you say sorry?

1142
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,570
做錯了事的人是我
It is me who has done the mistake

1143
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,830
現大我徹底明白了
Now I've understood clearly

1144
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,250
不是明白她 而是明白你了 Bhoomi我愛你
Not about her ...about you

1145
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,860
Bhoomi你想親眼見見我嗎
Bhoomi! Do you want to see me in person?

1146
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:33,410
- 我當然想 - 那你出來吧
-Yes I want to -Then, come out

1147
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,750
我在花園里呢
I am in the garden

1148
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,870
- 往前走 - 你在哪呢
-Come forward -Where are you?

1149
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:41,880
就在這里
Here only

1150
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,170
我就站在樹下 你看到了嗎
Can't you see that I am standing under the tree?

1151
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,670
嗨 別動了 就站在那里
Hey, stop Stop there

1152
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,380
我過來找你
I'll come close to you

1153
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,050
閉上眼睛就站在那里
Close your eyes and stay there

1154
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,260
我讓你睜眼再睜眼
Open your eyes after I tell you

1155
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,520
- 那快過來吧 - 急什么啊
-Come fast -Why are you in hurry?

1156
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:00,100
我來了
I am coming close to you

1157
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,600
現在睜眼吧
Now open your eyes

1158
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,780
你毀了我的好夢
You've spoiled everything

1159
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,780
我有叫你端茶來嗎
Did I ask you for tea at this time?

1160
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,200
老大 那是Poongodi啊
That's Poongodi, boss

1161
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,110
她做事情盡心盡責
Because she did her duty correct..

1162
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,200
所以主人讓她懷孕了
..sir made her pregnant in that house

1163
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,160
什么 懷孕了
What? Pregnant?

1164
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,620
哎呀 不是懷孕 是永久留用
（懷孕pregnant和永久留用permanent讀音相似）
Oh God! It is not pregnant it is permanent

1165
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:24,290
- 懷孕是指有喜了 - 有喜了
-Pregnant means carrying -Carrying?

1166
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,540
好了 走吧
Ok, go

1167
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,050
我當著他的面說這個做什么
Why did you tell this before him?

1168
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:28,300
你可以回頭和我單獨說啊
You could have told it to me later

1169
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,090
- 我總是被英語羞辱 - 不提了
-Because of this English I have felt ashamed often -Leave it.

1170
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,050
- 嗨 Amavasai - 什么事 老大
-Hey Amavasai! -What boss?

1171
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,100
- 我剛才夢見她了 - 什么
-Today she came in my dream -What?

1172
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:37,680
你夢見我的Poongodi了
Did my Poongodi come in your dream?

1173
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,270
你都和我訂婚了 你還進別人的夢里
Having engagement with me, are you coming in others' dreams?

1174
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:44,190
不是她 我夢見的是Ammukutty
Not her. lt is Ammukutty!

1175
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,480
原來是Ammukutty 嚇死我了
Ammukutty! I felt scared

1176
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,860
那你見到Ammukutty了
Have you seen Ammukutty?

1177
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:51,860
你的Poongodi讓我連她的臉都沒見到
Your Poongodi didn't allow me to see her face

1178
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,990
她來的真是時候 把我吵醒了
She came at the right time and woke me up

1179
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,030
把你吵醒了 好你之前是在睡覺嘍
Did she wake you up? Then, were you in sleep?

1180
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,080
那我就不明白了 她進來的時候你怎么不自己醒過來呢
What is this boss? Why didn't you wake up when she was coming here?

1181
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,330
- 你個白癡 睡著了才能做夢 - 不是的
-Dreams will come in sleep, you idiot! -Not like that

1182
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,000
你有心就能做白日夢
Dreams should come when you are in sense

1183
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:09,090
Bharthiyaar說這就叫真愛
Bharthiyaar said it is called true love

1184
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,340
是Bharthiyaar說的還是Bharathi Raja
Was it Bharthiyaar or Bharathi Raja?

1185
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:16,390
真可憐 他又糊涂了
So pity! He got confused

1186
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,640
我和你說 
I'll tell you one thing

1187
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:21,140
愛情和婚姻就像旅途
Love and marriage are like journey

1188
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,890
愛情就像坐長途車旅行
Love is like bus journey

1189
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:24,480
你覺得不滿意 你可以隨時下車
If we don't like, we can get down in the way.

1190
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:26,480
婚姻就像坐飛機旅行
Marriage is like air plane journey

1191
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,320
你覺得不滿意 你沒法半路跳下去
If we don't like it, we can't get down in the middle

1192
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,780
你會摔死的
We'll die

1193
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,320
走開 什么亂七八糟的
Go away. Nonsense!

1194
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,700
保鏢呢
Where is the bodyguard?

1195
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,870
他去女生宿舍了
He has gone to ladies hostel

1196
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:50,340
AMMUKUTTY
Ammukutty

1197
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:54,170
Why are you standing here like in the airport?

1198
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,260
你舉個牌子站在這里做什么 這里又不是機場
Nothing boss, seeing this name they will come here.

1199
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,340
沒事的 老大 她們看見名字就會過來的 所以我才舉著這塊牌子
That's why this setup

1200
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,260
- 老大 - 什么爛主意
-Boss! -Damn your idea!

1201
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:01,010
牌牌爛了
The board has broken

1202
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,140
老大 為什么啊 你為什么把Ammukutty撕爛了啊
Why boss? Why did you tear Ammukutty?

1203
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,520
- Ammukutty不是她的真名 - 啊 不會吧
-Ammukutty is not her real name -Oh god!

1204
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,150
那我們怎么能把她找出來呢
Then how can we find out that girl?

1205
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,480
她現在會打電話給我的
She'll call me now

1206
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:11,900
我和她電話里不停地聊
I'll keep chatting with her

1207
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:13,900
同時你溜進女生宿舍
Meanwhile you enter into the hostel and..

1208
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,780
要是看到哪個女生在打電話 你就拍張照片帶回來
..if any girl is talking in the phone you take her photo and come back

1209
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:17,910
那個女生就是Ammukutty
She will be Ammukutty

1210
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,950
- 老大 手機響了 - 是她 是她
-Boss! Phone is ringing -lt is her

1211
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,370
是她 那你問她
Is it her? Then while you are talking with her..

1212
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,540
她住哪間房間 把房號告訴我
..ask her in which room she is in and tell me

1213
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:28,170
我會請求她的允許 然后拍張照片帶給你
I'll take her photo with her permission

1214
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,130
好吧 我懂你的感覺
I know your feeling

1215
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:32,130
那這樣吧
Then do one thing

1216
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:33,960
你叫她出來
While you are talking with her, make her to come out

1217
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,550
我偷偷給她拍照片 保證不讓她知道
I'll take her photo without her knowledge

1218
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,430
哦喲 這也行不通
Oh god! This too didn't work out

1219
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,300
你去哪里 往后面走
Where do you go? Go backside

1220
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,390
一大清早的 你在我們宿舍門口干什么呢
At morning what are you doing before our hostel?

1221
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:52,150
你就住在這棟里嗎 我想像不出來
Are you staying in this hostel? I couldn't imagine.

1222
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,820
你的房間號是什么
What is your room number?

1223
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,320
你是要我的房間號呢還是手機號
Do you want my room number or my phone number?

1224
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:01,870
不要告訴我
No need to tell

1225
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,740
我自己能找到
I myself will find it out

1226
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:05,660
除了謹遵命令外
would do what I was told

1227
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,160
我別無他念
I don't know other than that

1228
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,170
怎么能馬上就見面呢
How can it possible to meet at once?

1229
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:11,460
我會告訴你什么時候見面的
I'll tell you the time to our meeting

1230
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,670
你不想告訴他 那我去告訴他
You don't want to tell I'll go and tell him

1231
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,880
我可見到你了 是吧
I've seen you, isn't it?

1232
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:19,590
聽我說
Try to listen to me!

1233
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,970
我和你說今天不可能
I am telling you that today is not possible

1234
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,060
她背對著我
She is showing her back to me

1235
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,020
我到她面前去 拍她的臉
I'll go before her and take a photo of her face

1236
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:29,190
- 你是誰 - 你在做什么
-Who is it? -What are you doing?

1237
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:31,560
- 我什么都沒做 - 你在做什么
-l am not doing anything -What are you doing?

1238
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,820
她用英語說什么來著
What is she saying in English?

1239
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,620
也許就是她
May be she is that girl

1240
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,910
我給她也拍一張照吧
I'll take her photo too

1241
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,500
- 謝天謝地 這里沒有人 - 你來這里干什么
-Thank god! No one is here -Why did you come here?

1242
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,080
我和你說了多少次了 不要到這里來
How many times should I tell you not to come here?

1243
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:58,630
這是神馬情況 所有人都在打手機啊
What is this? Whole gang is speaking in the cell phone

1244
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:03,510
我糊涂了
I am confused

1245
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,680
不能糊涂啊
No confusion

1246
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:07,060
我給所有人都拍張照帶回去給他看
I'll take all of these girls photos and show him

1247
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,390
讓他自己選 
Let him pick it her up

1248
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:12,850
- 你是誰 - 那是誰
-Who are you? -Who is that?

1249
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,070
- 抓小偷啊 - 小偷 - 大家快來
-Thief! -Thief? -Come fast

1250
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,150
為什么小偷這時候出現啊
Why did he come at this moment?

1251
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,740
我的事情本來就多了
They are giving me a lot of work.

1252
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,320
- 小偷在哪里 大姐 - 女孩們快來抓小偷啊
-Where is he madam? -Come girls, let's catch the thief

1253
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:28,250
- 抓的就是你 - 大姐 你為啥打我啊
-You -Madam, why are you hitting me?

1254
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:37,210
偷拍女孩還不夠 你還想親我
Not only taking the girls photos Do you want to kiss me?

1255
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:42,090
女孩們 把他打出去
Girls, bash him off

1256
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,930
慢點 慢點 把我扔地上了
Slowly! Slowly! Don't throw me down

1257
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,310
慢點啊
Take me slowly

1258
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,940
那邊吵什么呢
Is there any struggle?

1259
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,770
好像是個瘋子從樓上摔下來了
I think some mad guy has fallen down from the building

1260
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,070
大家正抬他去醫院呢
They are taking him to the hospital

1261
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:01,280
- 好吧 那我晚上再打給你 - 別掛
-Ok, l'll call you in the evening -Don't cut the call

1262
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,740
- 你繼續說 - 他還挺咋呼
-You go ahead -He is busy.

1263
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:07,740
喊什么喊 再喊把他舌頭割掉
Is he shouting? Cut his tongue

1264
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,160
是 是 是
Yes!

1265
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,170
啊 那個抬過去的是我的搭檔
Is it my party going there?

1266
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,590
你晚上再打給我吧
You call me in the evening

1267
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,590
把尸體還給我
Give me the body!

1268
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:32,430
慢點 慢點 媽啊
Slowly! Oh mom!

1269
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,350
不要亂拉
Don't pull me as you wish!

1270
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,310
我的身體都要散架了
My parts could break up

1271
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,230
我們在哪里 
Where we are now?

1272
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:41,530
公共廁所
In the toilet?

1273
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,570
- 在別墅 - 別墅
-ln the house -House!

1274
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,860
就算上了車我也記得廁所的味道
After coming in the auto it still is in my mind.

1275
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,740
- 啊呀 大叔 - 沒錯 是我 - 怎么回事
-Oh gosh! Uncle! -Yes, it is me -What is this?

1276
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,450
- 發生什么了 - 沒什么 - 沒什么
-How has it happened? -Nothing -Nothing?

1277
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,790
他就是摔了一跤
He has just fallen down

1278
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,540
- 他在哪里摔的啊 - 你就明明白白告訴她 我是被打的
-Where has he fallen down? -Tell her clearly that l was beaten

1279
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,040
被打了 那你沒跪下求饒嗎
Beaten? Then didn't you fall down?

1280
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,710
我跪下了 叫他們別打我
I fell down at everyone's feet telling not to hit me

1281
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,970
可我一跪下 所有人都拿腳踹我
When l fell down at their feet they stamped me

1282
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,260
多少人踹你
How many people?

1283
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,470
我被踹的時候怎么數人頭
How could I count them when I was getting beats?

1284
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,470
她們打我的嘴 我還怎么數數
How could I count when they hit in my mouth?

1285
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,730
其中有個胖女人 好像練過空手道
Among them, one fat lady looks like learnt Karate

1286
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:17,480
她扇耳光的手法與眾不同
Her slaps are different from others

1287
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,320
她踢我的時候我的蛋蛋都被踢到喉嚨口了
When she kicked me with her leg, my balls came to here

1288
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,860
- 閉嘴 - 我當然閉嘴了
-Shut up your mouth -Then l closed my mouth..

1289
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:26,490
否則蛋蛋就從嘴里掉出來了
..else it would've come out

1290
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:31,080
后來我辛辛苦苦才把各個器官復位
After that, I have toiled much to get the things in it's own place

1291
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,700
- 只有造物主才能明白我的痛楚- 你怎么會傷成這樣
-Only my creator knew my pain -Why did you get hurt like this?

1292
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:36,870
難道我是花錢讓人來揍我的嗎
Did I get it by giving money?

1293
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,880
我說不要打了 她們還是把我打得青一塊紫一塊
When l said no, they hit me black and blue

1294
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,920
當時你在哪里
Where were you in that situation?

1295
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:44,550
我接到一個重要的電話 所以
I received an important call. That's why..

1296
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:47,930
就是因為這個電話才會發生這一切
Because of that phone call this has happened

1297
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,100
老大 你撐著
Boss! You be brave

1298
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,350
我死之前一定會幫你搞得水落石出
I'll find out your problem before l die.

1299
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,820
爸 你來了
Come dad!

1300
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:11,370
- 主人 你什么時候到的 - 我在這里有個會議
-Sir! When did you come? -l had a meeting here

1301
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,370
順便過來看看Meera
On the way l came to see Meera

1302
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,200
Bhoomi 學校什么時候放假
Bhoomi! When will your college close down?

1303
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,410
下個月25號
Next month 25th

1304
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,620
- 放假后就回家 - 好
-You come to our house the next day -Ok

1305
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,960
大家都在等Meera考完試
All are waiting for Meera's exam

1306
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,960
等她考完試 她得去倫敦
After her exams, she has to go to London

1307
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:27,170
我們已經決定在倫敦給她辦婚禮
We've decided to conduct her marriage there

1308
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,560
你為什么一個人坐在這里
Why are you sitting here alone?

1309
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,480
沒什么 就是坐著
Nothing. Just sitting

1310
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,270
來吧 我們進屋去
Come, let's go in the room

1311
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,400
沒事 我們就在這里坐一會兒
It's ok, let's sit down here for a while

1312
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:46,070
坐吧
Sit down!

1313
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,490
有些事情我一直想和你說
I was thinking to tell you something for a long time

1314
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:59,370
說吧 盡管說吧
Tell me. Tell me whatever it is

1315
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,290
你為什么沒帶手機 你爸爸等你接電話
Why did you keep your phone there? Dad is on the line

1316
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:05,420
快來
Come fast!

1317
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,850
你爸爸沒有打你電話 我騙你的
Dad didn't call you I lied you

1318
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,520
這個時候你一個人在和Bhoomi說什么
Why are you talking alone with Bhoomi at this time?

1319
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,780
我 我沒說什么
That is.. just nothing

1320
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,940
看到你現在樣子我很害怕
By seeing your behaviour I feel scared

1321
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,200
你都已經是訂了婚的人了
Already your engagement is over

1322
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,950
可是上天有不同的安排
But God's decision is different

1323
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,120
否則Bhoomi也不會進入我的生活
Else Bhoomi wouldn't have entered into my life

1324
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:39,330
你知道的 他不愛你 Meera
As you think he is not loving you Meera

1325
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,790
我現在不是Meera
Now I am not Meera

1326
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,540
只要能做他的戀人就足夠了
It's enough for me if I live as his lover

1327
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:48,250
我不能離開他
I can't be without him

1328
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,550
要是你父親知道了怎么辦
What if your father knows this?

1329
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:52,930
要是Bhoomi知道了這一切
If Bhoomi knows about this,

1330
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:56,100
你覺得他會為了你帶你走而和你父親決裂鬧翻嗎
..do you think that he'll fight for you with your dad and take you?

1331
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:00,680
你還是不懂他
You haven't understood him clearly

1332
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:05,690
他對你父親那么忠誠 他不會背叛你父親的
Because he is having faith on your father he can't betray your father

1333
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:11,400

他不會接受的

1335
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,280
他會把你交給你父母 然后獨自離開
He'll handover you to your parents and go his way

1336
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,330
一定會這樣的

1337
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:24,290
Kamaraj說如果瓦片破了 我們可以換一片
Kamaraj said before that if a tile breaks, we can change it..

1338
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:28,170
可是如果心智破了就沒法換了
..but we can't change if mind break.

1339
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,720
是Kamaraj說的還是Suruli Rajan說的

1340

真可憐 他又糊涂了

Run, run (Tile)

1346
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,280

1349
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:19,800
你怎么沒打電話給我
Why don't you call me?

1350
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,310
是不是起床晚了
Did you wake up late?

1351

01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,860
好你不需要在夢里見我了
Hence you don't need to see me in your dream.

準備好就出來 我們等你

等等 我要去見醫生的

我們在診室外面等你

- 醫生不會同意的 - 為什么呢

1434
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:02,870
我們就叫他醫生 醫生的

1435
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,210
你盡撒謊

1436
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,210
說實話 你要去哪里

1437
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:12,220
我想去見個朋友

1438
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,340
那你干嘛要對我隱瞞呢

1439
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:19,770
因為那位朋友是女孩

如果她不漂亮呢
If she doesn't look beautiful when you see her in person?

1452
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:04,270

Beauty is only for our eyes. Not for our mind.

1453

難道我看見了她 我心里的愛就會消失
When l see her will my love in my mind vanish?

你和我一起去 她看見了會不高興的
If you come with me she won't like that.

1462
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,930
因為我一直跟著你 她已經和我吵過一次了
Already she had a fight with me that I am following you.

1463
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:39,220
我不會讓她看見我的
She can't see me.

1464
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,010
我會躲起來偷偷看她
I'll hide and see her.

1465
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:45,850
- 真有這個必要嗎 - 有啊 我想見見她
-ls all this necessary? -Yes, I want to see her.

1466
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:47,190
聽著
Please listen to me.

1467
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:06,210
你就站在這里
You be stand here.

1468
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:10,040
你從這里能看到我們兩個人
You can see both of us from here.

1469
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,550
時間過得好慢
Time is not moving.

1470
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,210
還有半個小時
There is half an hour to go.

1471
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,470
你能幫我個忙嗎
Will you do a help for me?

1472
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,050
說吧
Tell me.

1473
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:25,220
現在你就是Ammu
Now you are Ammu.

1474
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:29,730
你把自己想成是Ammu就是行了
You just think like that.

1475
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:35,230
我待會要和她說的話 我先和你練習一遍
I'll just practice with you what l am going to say her.

1476
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:37,280
行嗎
Ok?

1477
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:49,710
你來了
Have you come?

1478
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:53,500
我真不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

1479
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:59,050
這么多天你都不見我 為什么你要這么做
These days you didn't meet me.. and why did you do like this?

1480
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:06,720
你是真的愛我嗎 還是和我開玩笑的
Do you love me truly? Or are you kidding me?

1481
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,810
那天你在電話里說愛我
That day I couldn't say anything to you..

1482
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:15,320
我什么都沒說
..when you proposed me through the phone.

1483
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,740
但現在我要當面說出來 我也愛你 非常地愛你
But now I am telling you in person.

1484
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,880
這樣說可以嗎
Is this ok to speak like this?

1485
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,470
現在我有信心了
Now I am confident.

1486
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,970
- 你怎么不祝我好運呢 - 祝你好運
Why don't you say all the best?

1487
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,790
你來了嗎
Have you come?

1488
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,540
你在哪里
Where are you?

1489
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:59,460
你看見我了嗎
Did you see me?

1490
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,130
我不想見你了
I don't want to see you.

1491
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:05,800
以后你也見不到我了
Hence forth you won't see me.

1492
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:10,470
我和你說過不能讓Meera來
Though I have told you that Meera shouldn't come..

1493
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,730
可你還是把她帶來了 還碰她的肩膀
..you touched her shoulder and brought here.

1494
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:16,560
Ammu 我沒做錯什么
Ammu, l didn't do anything wrong.

1495
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:18,560
你以為我沒看見嗎
Do you think that I didn't see that?

1496
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,980
你一直在騙我 欺騙我
You are lying and cheating me

1497
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:29,490
她說要和我一起來 我拒絕不了
I couldn't say no when she said she would come with me.

1498
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:30,950
所以
That's why..

1499
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:34,200
所以你覺得她比我重要 是嗎
Then you are giving more importance than me. lsn't it?

1500
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,460
不是那樣的
Nothing like that.

1501
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,880
你為我連這么點小事都做不到
You couldn't do at least this small thing for me..

1502
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,130
你讓我怎么再相信你
..then how can I believe you?

1503
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:43,260
怎么和你結婚生活在一起
How can I marry you and live with you?

1504
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:45,920
你要是再騙我怎么辦 我怎么能相信你
What if you cheat me again and how can I believe you?

1505
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:47,640
我不是你想的那種人
I am not a guy as you think.

1506
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,640
我不會騙你的
I won't do like that.

1507
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,470
你什么都不用再說了
No, you don't need tell anything.

1508
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:53,180
我不會再打電話給你了
I won't call you again.

1509
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,520
你也不用再等我的電話了
You don't need to wait for my call.

1510
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:38,770
哪里 她來了嗎
Where? Has she come?

1511
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:41,400
沒有 她沒來
No, she has not come.

1512
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,690
她沒來 為什么呢
Didn't she come? Why?

1513
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:47,990
- 她看見你 生氣了 - 然后呢
-She got angry because she has seen you -Then?

1514
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:51,700
然后她掛了電話 說以后再也不打給我了
She cut the call saying that she won't call me.

1515
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,700
天哪 都是我的錯
Oh God! I did a wrong thing.

1516
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,120
我就不該來這時辰在 是嗎
I wouldn't have come here. Isn't it?

1517
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,750
不是的
Nothing like that.

1518
01:51:56,830 --> 01:52:01,830
她說是這么說 但她肯定還會打給我
Definitely she will call me though she has said like that.

1519
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:03,540
走吧
Come.

1520
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,760
你怎么知道她一定會再打給你
How do you say that she will call you again?

1521
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,180
如果她是真心愛我 就一定會再打給我的
If she loves me truly definitely she will call me.

1522
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,640
一定會再打的
Definitely she will call me.

1523
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:25,650
怎么了
What is this?

1524
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:27,110
離考試只有一個星期了
You have only one week for your exam.

1525
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,740
你為什么不學習
Why don't you study?

1526
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,650
我為什么要學習
Why should l study?

1527
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,280
只有去參加考試的人才需要學習
They only will study who is going to write the exam.

1528
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:37,410
我是來當你們的保鏢的
I have come here for being your bodyguard.

1529
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:40,160
不是來通過考試的
Not to write the exam and get passed.

1530
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,080
你們兩個必須好好學習
Both of you must study well.

1531
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:45,090
我答應過主人的
I have promised to sir.

1532
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:47,420
你不參加考試我們也不參加
If you don't write the exam we won't also write the exam.

1533
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,590
你們為什么不參加考試
Why don't you write the exam?

1534
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:51,590
因為你
Because of you.

1535
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,340
你不參加考試 所以我們也不參加
You don't write the exam. That's why we too wouldn't write the exam

1536
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:58,350
你們必須參加考試
You should write the exam.

1537
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:02,350
好吧 我會參加的
Ok, I will write the exam.

1538
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,610
不要拿著手機 認真學習
Keep the phone down and study well.

1539
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:47,770
你要干什么
What are you doing?

1540
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,610
好不容易把問題解決
Now only a problem is solved.

1541
01:53:49,690 --> 01:53:51,320
你還要打電話再弄出些事情來嗎
Why do you start again by your call?

1542
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:53,150
你也看到他了 不是嗎
You are also seeing him. Isn't it?

1543
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:56,620
如果我不打給他 他是不會好好學習去參加考試的
If I don't call him he won't study and write the exam.

1544
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:59,330
就這一次
Only for this time..

1545
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:01,330
就是為了讓他參加考試而已
It is only make him to write the exam.

1546
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:03,250
以后再也不會打給他了
Afterwards I won't call him.

1547
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,540
我向你保證
I promise you.

1548
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:16,260
你怎么一直都沒打給我
Why don't you call me so far?

1549
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,640
我還以為你真的不會再打來了
I thought that you wouldn't call me.

1550
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:22,020
你在生我的氣嗎
Are you angry with me?

1551
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,730
我不生氣了
I am not angry with you.

1552
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:27,810
你要參加考試 所以我不想打電話來打擾你
You have exam. That's why I don't want to disturb you.

1553
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:30,270
你正認真學習呢 不是嗎
You are studying well. lsn't it?

1554
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:34,950
沒有 我說我不參加考試了 Meera正在生我的氣呢
No, Meera is angry with me Because l said that l won't write the exam

1555
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:37,030
不參加考試 為什么
Won't you write the exam? Why?

1556
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:41,330
你如果不好好學習好好考試
If you don't study well and write the exam..

1557
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,700
我就真的不打給你了 
..then l won't call you.

1558
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:45,790
如果你不打給我 我就不參加考試
If you don't call me I won't write the exam.

1559
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,330
我現在不是打給你了嗎
I have called you. lsn't it?

1560
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,090
好好學習 好好考試
Study well and write the exam.

1561
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:52,800
你拿個好名次我才來見你
I'll meet you only when you get rank.

1562
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,170

Shall I believe it?

1563
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:56,800
我會來的

1564
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:01,100
那這次我一定會讓你來見我的
Then this time l'll make you to meet me.

1565
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:22,910
她打給我了
She has called me.

1566
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:24,870
是嗎
Is it?

1567
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,870
我說過她會打給我的
I said that she would call me.

1568
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,710
因為她非常愛我
She loves me very much.

1569
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:36,970
她說只要我考得好 她就會來見我 
If I write the exam well she said that she will meet me.

1570
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:40,680
真高興
Oh no..

1571
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:01,200
當蝴蝶在召喚 我的花兒 不要逃
When butterfly calls, don't go, you flowers.

1572
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:06,240
當我們享受愛情的甜蜜 我的人兒不要吵
Don't talk while enjoying the honey of love!

1573
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:11,040
當蝴蝶在召喚 我的花兒 不要逃
When butterfly calls, don't go, you flowers.

1574
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:16,250

Don't talk while enjoying the honey of love!

1575

你是像牙制的神像
You are the idol made of ivory!

1576
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,590
你是黃金般的無價
You are valuable as the gold!

1577
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:26,720
愛情編制的天羅地網 我已深深陷下
You've trapped me in the net of love.

1578
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:36,570
當蝴蝶在召喚 我的花兒 不要逃
When butterfly calls, don't go, you flowers.

1579
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:41,450
當我們享受愛情的甜蜜 我的人兒不要吵
Don't talk while enjoying the honey of love!

1580
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:06,680
不知道該取什么 不知道該予什么
Don't know what to give or what to take..

1581
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:11,690
我的心如孩童般左右為難上下跳動
My heart jumps over in dilemma like a child

1582
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:14,270
我的頭隨你的視線而轉
Your eyes make my head turn.

1583
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:21,490
我的心因你的出現而痛
My heart is aching when a girl has come to toss my life!

1584
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:26,620
珍貴的回憶永無止境
Memory is valuable and never complete.

1585
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:31,580
你花樣的臉龐是我的初次回憶
Your flowery face is a long first version!

1586
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:34,250
我是女性的詩篇
I am the poem of the women!

1587
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,840
你愿用自己的雙唇誦讀嗎
Will you read it with your lips?

1588
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,470
你愿用漂亮的睫毛愛我嗎

1589
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:46,390
當蝴蝶在召喚 我的花兒 不要逃
When butterfly calls, don't go, you flowers.

1590
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:51,640
當我們享受愛情的甜蜜 我的人兒不要吵
Don't talk while enjoying the honey of love!

1591
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:26,590
我正調到你的頻率
I am interconnecting to your frequency

1592
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:31,390
當我們輕啟雙唇傾訴時 我便忘了整個世界
I forgot the world when our lips were talking

1593
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:36,690
當我們互相靠近時 我便感到萬分的愉悅
If I am near you.. My heart would feel happy..

02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,690
請理解我的處境
Please understand my situation.

1727
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:36,320
我已經把Meera完璧歸趙了
I've handed over Meera safely to you.

1728
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:37,370
還能怎樣
Then what?

1729
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:44,370
放開我 天哪 Bhoomi
Leave me! Oh God! Bhoomi!

1730
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:48,880
老爸 就一分鐘
Dad! One minute!

1731
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:50,840
請聽聽他要說的話
Please understand what he is going to say.

1732
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,590
他愛上了一個女孩
He loves a girl.

1733
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,260
那女孩說會到火車站等他
She said that she have come to the station..

1734
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:55,840
所以他才離開我去火車站的
..that's why he went there to leave me.

1735
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:58,390
他沒做錯你想像的錯事
He didn't do any mistake as you think.

1736
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:04,310
是的 主人 那個女孩子正在火車站等著我
Yes sir. She is waiting for me in the railway station.

1737
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:08,810
如果我不去 她會
If I don't go then she will..

1738
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:10,820
老爸 求你了
Dad! Please..

1739
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,690
他說的都是真的
It is true what he is telling to you.

1740
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:15,240
求求你放過他吧
Please leave him.

1741
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:18,780
- 好 那你走吧 老爸
-Ok, you go. -Dad!

1742
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:22,740
你可以走了
You can go!

1743
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,620
再見 主人
Bye sir!

1744
02:11:29,170 --> 02:11:32,170
Meera我走了
Meera, I'll go.

1745
02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:11,460
那個時候你的父親想到的也許只有死亡
Your dad might think only about death at that time.

1746
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:17,800
如果我沒有在最后一刻登上火車的話
If I didn't get into the train at the last minute that would happen.

1747
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,900
火車就要到站了
Station will come soon.

1748
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:32,810
把你的東西收拾好
Get ready with your things.

1749
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:35,230
我還沒開完會 我在下節車廂
Meeting has not finished for me. I am in next cabin.

1750
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:44,030
你有多愛我的媽媽
How much you loved my mother?

1751
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:51,670
你怎么突然這么問
Why did you ask suddenly?

1752
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:54,250
你媽媽就是我生命的全部
Your mother is life for me.

1753
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:58,970
你媽媽也很愛我
Your mother also loved me very much.

1754
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:03,510
她以前和我說 在她死之前
Before her death..

1755
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:07,180
她不能回Semmanoor
She has told me that I wouldn't go to Semmanoor ever

1756
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:11,640
我同意了 因為你很固執
I agreed because you were very stubborn.

1757
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:24,490
歡迎 歡迎 路上還順利嗎
Come. How was your journey?

1758
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:26,120
你兒子呢
Where is your son?

1759
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:29,750
歡迎 歡迎 我在等你們呢
Come. l am waiting for you.

1760
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:44,470
來吧
Come.

1761
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:52,270
主人 看看是誰來了
Sir, see who has come!

1762
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:04,610
Bhoomi 是你來了嗎 過來
Bhoomi, have you come? Come.

1763
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:07,530
- 主人 你躺好 - 我沒事
-Sir, you take rest. -l am alright.

1764
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,080
坐下吧
Sit down!

1765
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:13,710
我以為你不會來的
I thought you wouldn't come.

1766
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:16,170
我不會拒絕你的
Will I refuse your words?

1767
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:18,880
Chakrapani說你要去澳大利亞
Chakrapani said that your next posting is in Australia..

1768
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:22,090
中途經過這里
..and you have come to this town in the middle.

1769
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:24,090
所以我想見見你
That's why I wanted to see you.

1770
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:26,140
我妨礙你了嗎
Did I give you any trouble?

1771
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,470
主人 哪有的事
Sir, what is this? Nothing like that.

1772
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:30,970
有事盡管說 主人
You tell me sir.

1773
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:36,600
我以為你會來問問Meera的事
I thought that you would ask about Meera when you come here.

1774
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,610
可你一句都沒提
But you didn't ask anything.

1775
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:43,940
對不起 我忘了 
Sorry! I forgot that.

1776
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:47,660
Meera還好嗎 她在倫敦嗎
How is Meera? Is she in London?

1777
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:49,740
還是已經回來了
Or has she come here?

1778
02:14:49,950 --> 02:14:52,200
Meera一直都在這里
Meera is here only.

1779
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:54,500
在這里
Is she here?

1780
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,710
那她為什么不出來呢
Then why didn't she come out?

1781
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:32,240
你什么時候從倫敦回來的
When did you come from London?

1782
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:34,290
你的丈夫孩子一起來了嗎
Have your husband and children come?

1783
02:15:34,450 --> 02:15:36,660
他們人呢 也在這里嗎
Where are they? Are they here?

1784
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:43,590
Meera沒有結婚
Meera didn't marry anyone.

1785
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:47,930
沒有結婚 為什么
Why didn't marry? Why?

1786
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:57,390
我經常和我妻子說
I have told often to my wife.

1787
02:15:57,980 --> 02:16:02,570
誰娶到了Meera那真是好福氣
He'll be a lucky man who is going to marry Meera.

1788
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:09,200
我沒找到那個有福的人
I couldn't find that lucky man.

1789
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:10,950
她自己找到了
She found out.

1790
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:16,000
但我不知道怎樣才能撮合他們
But I didn't know to unite them.

1791
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:20,960
Meera 這是怎么回事
What is this Meera?

1792
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:25,960
我沒想到今天見到你會是這個樣子
I didn't think that l'll be seeing you in this situation.

1793
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:29,010
他們說你兒子和你一起來了
They said you brought your son with me.

1794
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:31,840
他人呢 我還沒見過他
Where is he? I haven't seen him.

1795
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,030
你知道她是誰嗎
Do you know who is she?

1796
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,530
她就是Meera阿姨
She is Meera aunty.

1797
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:09,470
可憐的Meera
Poor Meera!

1798
02:17:09,590 --> 02:17:12,930
她讓你爸爸去車站的時候
She didn't expect this situation..

1799
02:17:13,090 --> 02:17:15,850
她沒想到事情會這樣變化
..when she was lying them and sending your dad from there

1800
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:18,640
老爸 求求你了 他說的都是真的
Dad please.. It is true what he is telling to you.

1801
02:17:18,850 --> 02:17:20,940
求求你放了他
Please leave him.

1802
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,980
- 好 你走吧 - 老爸
-Ok, you go. -Dad!

1803
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:24,900
你可走了 
You can go.

1804
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:27,900
他在撒謊 別相信他
He said lie. Don't believe him.

1805
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,610
我會查清楚是誰在撒謊的
I'll find out who is telling lie.

1806
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:31,280
- Palani - 老板
-Palani -Sir!

1807
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:32,740
你跟著他
You follow him.

1808
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:35,120
如果真像他說的 有個女孩在火車上等他 你就放過他
You leave him when a girl is there as he told in the train.

1809
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,410
- 否則就殺了他 - 是 老板
-Else you kill him. -Ok sir.

1810
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:46,090
過來
Come.

1811
02:17:48,090 --> 02:17:49,300
他怎么知道的
How did he know?

1812
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,090
所有人都在問我 可我什么都沒說
All are asking me. But I said no.

1813
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:53,550
很好 跟我來 
That is good. Come with me.

1814
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:55,550
你還要再幫我一個忙
You have to do one more help for me.

1815
02:17:55,890 --> 02:17:57,510
你去火車站和Bhoomi見面
You go to station and meet Bhoomi.

1816
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,010
- 我 - 嗯 
-Me? -Yes!

1817
02:17:59,310 --> 02:18:00,930
我爸派了人去車站
Dad has sent the men to the station.

1818
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:03,810
如果Bhoomi的愛人沒有出現的話 他們就會殺了他
He told to kill him if his lover is not there.

1819
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:04,770
天哪
Oh God!

1820
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,020
所以我才讓你去
That's why I am asking you to go.

1821
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:08,110
Bhoomi現在必須知道真相了
Bhoomi has to know all truth now.

1822
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,730
告訴他是我一直在打電話給他
Tell him that I have only spoken in the phone.

1823
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:14,360
但是你要告訴他不要為了我回來打架
But you have to tell him that he shouldn't fight for me..

1824
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:18,030
我會等他一輩子的
..and l would be waiting for him life long.

1825
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:23,540
我這么說他會相信嗎
Will he believe me if I tell him all this?

1826
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:25,370
我們沒其他辦法了
We have no way.

1827
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:27,580
他沒有手機了
He doesn't have phone to call.

1828
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:29,960
這樣吧
Else you do one thing.

1829
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:31,300
你見到Bhoomi 然后打給我
You go there and call me.

1830
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:33,590
我親口和她講清楚
I will tell everything to him.

1831
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:36,390
快 快走 別讓任何人看見你
Go quickly without knowing to anyone.

1832
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:44,230
這是末班車 后面沒有車了
There is no train after this. This is the last train.

1833
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:22,060
快來
Come.

1834
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:03,600
是你嗎
Is it you?

1835
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:08,270
你早就可以告訴我了
You could have told me!

1836
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:12,560
Bhoomi 我
Bhoomi, I am..

1837
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:35,880
老板 他說的確實是實話
Yes sir! It is true what he said to me.

1838
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:37,590
有個女孩和他在一起
A girl is with him.

1839
02:21:18,090 --> 02:21:22,930
我背叛了Meera 這不是一個朋友應該做的
I have betrayed Meera which a friend won't do ever.

1840
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:23,970
可是不僅僅是我
Not only me.

1841
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:29,180
誰會愿意放過這個嫁給他的機會呢
Who will miss such an opportunity to marry him?

1842
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:35,190
所以我才把你父親帶到了很遠的地方
That's why I brought your dad so far away.

1843
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:39,360
因為我的背叛 上天給了我懲罰
God has given the punishment because I did this betrayal.

1844
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:46,200
他功成名就后 我卻沒這個好運和他長相廝守
I am not lucky to live with him who has achieved everything. Isn't it?

1845
02:21:47,370 --> 02:21:51,370
我死后很久你才會拿到這本日記
You will get this diary long after my death.

1846
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:54,210
你要把這本日記銷毀掉 不要讓任何人看到
You should destroy it without anyone knowing it.

1847
02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:03,340
因為你的父親永遠不該知道真相
Because your dad shouldn't know this truth ever.

1848
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:17,770
- 怎么了 怎么還不睡 - 我睡不著
-Why? Didn't you sleep? -l didn't get any sleep.

1849
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:22,570
- Siddarth 你哭了嗎 － 沒有
-Siddarth, are you crying? -No.

1850
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,950
別騙我 你爸爸不會騙人
Don't lie. Your dad wouldn't lie.

1851
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:27,740
那他的兒子就不該騙人
Then his son also shouldn't lie.

1852
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:29,990
你為什么哭了
Why did you cry?

1853
02:22:31,370 --> 02:22:33,210
我想我媽媽了
I remembered my mother.

1854
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:40,300
睡吧 我會在這里陪著 直到你睡著
Sleep. I will be with you till you sleep.

1855
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:53,430
阿姨 你會生我媽媽的氣嗎
Aunty, are you angry with my mom?

1856
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:57,400
生氣 為什么
Angry? For what?

1857
02:22:59,270 --> 02:23:00,400
我不生她的氣
I am not angry with your mom.

1858
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:02,820
我只是很難過
I felt very sad.

1859
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:08,990
她去世之前一直都沒說要再見我
Your mom didn't say to meet me before her death.

1860
02:23:09,410 --> 02:23:11,620
所以我才覺得難過
That's why I felt very sad.
