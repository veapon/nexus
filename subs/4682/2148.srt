3
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,850
- 对不起 我不懂西班牙语  - 第一次到西班牙？
- Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.  - First time in Spain?

4
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,642

Yeah, first time in Spain. Where's my luggage?

5
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:06,642
不幸 它还在旧金山呢
Unfortunately, it's still in San Francisco.

6
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:08,017
太棒了
Fantastic.

00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:10,350
赛莉 是我
Sally, it's me.

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,225
你打电话给航空公司 告诉他们把我的包留在旧金山
Can you call the airline and tell them to leave my bags in San Francisco?

9
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:16,476
他们到这儿之前 我就回去了 谢谢
I'll be back before they get here, anyway. Thanks.

10
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,476

00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:47,892
我以为乔许回来
I was... I was expecting Josh.

13
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,851
他还在船上睡觉呢 时差
He's asleep on the boat. Jet lag.

00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,142
- 回去偷袭他一下 很高兴见到你  - 很高兴见到你
- Hit him all of a sudden. Good to see you.  - Good to see you.

15
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,101

How's the posting?

16
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,851
有一阵儿非常好

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,100
然后俄勒冈州立大学的毕加索专家
and then a Picasso expert from Oregon State.

19
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:16,059
西班牙怎么会想听俄勒冈的毕加索专家的意见？
Why on earth would Spain want to hear from a Picasso expert from Oregon?

20
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,767
不同的观点
A different perspective.

21
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,476
对不起 稍等
Sorry, hold on.

22
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,309

24
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,726
- 好 再见

25

26
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,268
这个假期 真不是离开公司的好时机
This vacation, it's just a real bad time for me to be away from the company.

27
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:46,726
你妈妈很高兴这个假期 威尔
Your mother's pretty happy about this vacation, Will.

28
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:52,851
威尔？
Will?

29
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,435
喔! 妈!

你是怎么那么轻松？

嗯 这是因为我们终于来了

33
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,101
你的航班怎样？
How was your flight?

34
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:10,143
飞机起飞 飞过去 降落
The plane went up, flew straight across, went down again.

35
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,268
有个维诺小浴缸就全好了
Nothing a small bathtub of vino won't fix.

36
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,517
我们更好的  先去换件衣服吧
We can do better than that. Now, why don't you get that suit off?

37
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,518
你穿的这件像个手风琴  你的行李呢？
It looks like an accordion on you. Where's your luggage?

38
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,684
它好像还没和金门大桥告别完呢
Apparently it's still saying goodbye to the Golden Gate Bridge.

39
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:23,018
哦 上帝呀
Oh! For heaven's sake. Uh...

40
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,559
还好 这儿有一些是你去年来丢下的衣服
Well, there's some clothes you left behind from last year's trip.

41
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,809
干嘛不去换上呢？
Why don't you put those on?

42
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,310
等你换好了 我给你一杯里奥哈
I'll have a nice glass of Rioja waiting for you when you're ready.

43
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:30,684
看我说什么来着？
See what I mean?

44
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:32,726
我来的时候 她说 “冰箱里有啤酒”
When I got here, she was like, "Beer's in the fridge."

45
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,894
妈妈总是最喜欢你
Mom always liked you best.

46
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,351
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

47
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,685
看看这是谁呀
Look who's here.

48
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,143
达拉 这是威尔 好兄弟
Dara, this is Will. The good brother.

49
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,684
老是对大家讲他是独子的那个
The one who used to tell everybody he was an only child.

50
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,851
只是在生了乔许以后
Only after Josh was born.

51
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,810
去哥斯拉那一趟怎么样？
How was the ride with Godzilla?

52
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:03,018
没血腥 没傻瓜  哦
No blood, no foul. Yeah.

53
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:05,310
放松点儿 就一个星期
Well, just take it nice and easy. It's only a week.

54
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:07,517
我觉得你们爸爸挺好的
I think your dad's a sweetie.

55
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,684
她在苏联孤儿院长大的
She grew up in a Soviet orphanage.

56
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:15,268
好吧 我去换衣服
Well, I gotta get changed.

57
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,684
那不挺好吗
That's not bad.

58
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:20,893
但是在政府工作 就必须忍受官僚
But it's a government job. You have to tolerate the bureaucracy.

59
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,060
政府让你做什么你就做什么 所以没人喜欢
You move when the government tells you to move, so not everybody likes it.

60
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,518
是呀 我也不喜欢
Yeah, I'm not sure I liked it.

61
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:29,057
乔许和我从来没有相同的连续两年以上的朋友
Josh and I never got to have the same friends for more than two years in a row.

62
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,143
更不用说十八年里生活过十二个国家
Not to mention we lived in 12 different countries over 18 years.

63
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,101
好的一面是 为我们学会了十五种当地的体育项目
But the best thing is we learned about 15 weird local sports.

64
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:36,435
好了 老哥
Excuse me, my man.

65
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,934
我们在喀麦隆一起打篮球练田径 记得吗？
We both played basketball and ran track in the Comoros, remember?

66
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,310
学校里几乎没人超过一米六
Although no one in the school was over 5'3",

67
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:45,102
无论我们到哪儿 威尔都是全明星
and Will was pretty much the all-star everywhere we went.

68
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,685
哇 太好了
Wow! Well done.

69
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,059
嗯 怎么样？
Mmm. Got it?

70
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,685
我想告诉你们我太高兴了
Before we start, I just want to say how happy I am

71
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,685
我们终于又聚在一起了
that we're all finally together around a table again.

72
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,269
我都没意识到我有多想念这个
I didn't realize how much I'd missed this.

73
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,852
为家  好
To family. Nice.

74
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,101
为家
To family.

75
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,310
看上去很不错
This looks fantastic.

76
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,102
我的山洞人今天早上刚抓的
My caveman caught it this morning.

77
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,894
你抓的鱼 苏先生？
You fish, Mr. Shaw?

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,435
是 他抓的鱼

- 哦 同志们请严肃点儿  - 我想听这里面的故事
- No, guys, seriously, please.  - Come on! I want to hear this story.

81
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,227
- 鱼叉捕鱼是他强项  - 对不起
-  Spear-fishing, actually, is his forte.  - Excuse me.

82
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:20,518
我必许接一下 很重要
I got to take this. Important.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,478
不许再讲这些故事了 否则我开始讲你们的
No more of those stories or I'll start telling some of yours.

84
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:26,268
你今晚睡哪儿？  你们没睡一起吧？
Where are you sleeping tonight? You guys aren't sleeping together, are you?

85
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,351
哦 爸
Jesus, Dad.

86
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,102
如果我们一起做 我相信我们双方都会获利
If we work together on this, I'm sure it's going to be beneficial for both of us.

87
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,227
星期四？
This Thursday?

88
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,518
我现在国外
I'm out of the country, so...

89
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:50,810
明白
I understand.

90
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,102
好 再见
Okay. Bye.

91
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,852
- 挺危险的吧  - 是 他那次尤其危险
-  Quite dangerous.  - Yeah, in his case it was quite dangerous.

92
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:08,143
- 他来了 嘘  - 可怜的威尔
- Here he comes. Shh!  - Poor Will.

93
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,852
- 这是他的小秘密
- Poor Will.  - It's just his little secret.

94
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,685
这个段子会在家族里流传一段时间呢
That story's going to stay in the family for a while.

95
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:12,728
它哪儿也去不了
It's not going anywhere.

96
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,893
讲讲吧
Please, tell me. Come on.

97
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,101
乔许 停
Josh, that's enough.

98
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:20,102
- 认真的 停 别讲了  - 威尔是那个渔夫
- No, guys, seriously, please. Don't.  - Will is the fisherman.

99
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,226
好吧 在他们讲出任何夸张的段子之前
All right, before they go off on any kind of fantastic story,

100
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,436
真实发生的是
what really happened was that he took me out

101
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:29,227
我才十岁的时候 他带我去叉鱼
when I'm 10 years old spear-fishing, ten years old,

102
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,268
结果我叉到自己脚蹼
and I spear my own flipper.

103
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,311
每个人都觉得很搞笑
And everyone finds this hilarious.

104
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,518
- 就这故事？  - 就这故事
- That's the story?  - That's the story.

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,478
他整夜都在哭
He cried all night.

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,894
几乎叉到脚  一直哭到睡着
He could've speared his foot.  He cried himself to sleep.

107
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,895
威尔 哭的声音 乔许 可以告诉你
Will would make this noise when he cried. Josh could tell you.

108
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,644
- 就像小声抽  - 很好笑
- It's like a little wuffling sound.  - Really funny. Really...

109
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,019
实际上 你们知道吗 今天不是开玩笑的日子
Actually, you know what? This is not the day for a joke.

110
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,603
- 我不能留下一个星期了  - 什么？
- I don't know if I can stay the week.  - What?

111
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:02,685
对不起 妈妈
I'm sorry, Mom.

112
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:07,060
我刚知道
I have just found out

113
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,852
我公司正式破产了
my company is officially bankrupt.

114
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,310
什么？
What?

115
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,436
- 对不起  - 你在说什么？
-  I'm sorry.  - What are you talking about?

116
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,102
威尔？
Will?

117
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,935
对不起 我在饭桌上这样子
I'm sorry I went off at you at dinner.

118
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,519
我很难过你经历这样的困难
I'm sorry you're going through such a difficult time.

119
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,102
谢谢
Thank you.

120
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,269
明天的风会不错
It'll be a good wind tomorrow.

121
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,102
是
Yeah.

122
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,394
准备好出发吧
Get ready to come about!

123
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,102
威尔？
Will?

124
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:56,894
威尔!

125
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,895
绑紧船帆
Tighter on that boom!

126
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,394
紧点儿 威尔!
Tighter, Will!

127
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,686
知道了
I heard you the first time.

128
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,103
乔许, 我们在这下锚
Josh, we'll anchor here!

129
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,269
威尔？
Will?

130
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,894
威尔!
Will!

131
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,270
过来一下
When you get a minute.

132
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,479
把住 冲着风
Keep it into the wind.

133
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,061
威尔! 冲着风
Will! Into the wind!

134
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,854
头冲着风
Head it into the wind!

135
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,686
达拉!
Dara!

we don't give a shit.

403
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,404
也许我比你更了解他
Maybe I knew him better than you did.

404
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:57,403
我要见我家人
I want to see my family.

405
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:58,612
不在我手上
I don't have your family.

406
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,779
在谁手上？
Who does?

407
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:02,404
很抱歉告诉你 是一些恐怖分子
I'm sorry to say that some terrorists do.

408
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:06,362
威尔, 我最不想牵扯你进来
Will, you are the last person I want to get more involved in this right now.

409
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:07,404
但是我需要你帮助
But I need your help.

410
00:44:08,614 --> 00:44:11,945
你要告诉我还有谁 他见过 说过这事
I need you to tell me who else he saw or spoke to about this.

411

你给我我要的

你要告诉他们 我父亲已经死了 我跟这事儿一点关系都没有
You need to tell them that my father's dead and that I've got nothing to do with this.

414
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:22,779
我只是要就会我家人
I just want to save my family!

415
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:24,778
对
Right.

416
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:29,696
我想我肯定是欠你什么
So, I certainly think we owe you something.

417
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:30,738
等等 坐下
Wait, wait, wait. Sit down!

418

425
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:29,404
没路下去！
There's no way down!

426
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:35,404
上帝！
God!

427
00:45:46,822 --> 00:45:49,571
- 你要干嘛？  - 胳膊举起来

You gotta take me to Puerta del Sol. I need to find my family.

454

他们杀了我叔叔
They killed my uncle!

455
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,947
他受伤了 你一定要帮我们
This guy's wounded! You have to help me!

456
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:30,406
不 带他走 你会给我们惹麻烦的
No, take him away. You'll get me into trouble!

457
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,489
你学过医 帮帮他！
You go to medical school, help him!

458
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:35,530
我是学生 不是医生
I'm a student, not a doctor.

459
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:36,946
嘿！
Hey!

Habib, call Maximo, we need help!

462
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:44,822
他流了好多血 我不知道能他去哪儿？
He's losing lots of blood! I don't have anywhere to take him.

463
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:57,614
- 什么时候受得伤  - 可能有一个小时了

办公室
In the office.

468
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:15,405
她以为这是医院吗？
Does she think this is a hospital?

469
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:17,031
我欠他叔叔人情
I owe her uncle some favors

470
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,780
但他不能带一个流血的家伙到我的夜总会里来
but she can't bring a bleeding guy into my club!

471
00:50:19,907 --> 00:50:21,739
我可没时间在这搅和
I don't have time for this shit!

472
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,989
怎么啦 姑娘们？

小伙子救了我的命
This guy saved my life!

476
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,947
他父亲也被杀了
His father's been killed too.

477
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,531
马克斯模 给我点儿伏特加 给我的手消消毒
Maximo, hand me that vodka. I need to sterilize my hands.

478
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:42,364
露西亚 告诉他 这会很痛的
Lucia, tell him this is going to hurt a lot.

479
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:43,739
我要找到子弹在哪儿
I need to see if there's a bullet.

480
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:45,698
- 她在说什么？  - 她说别担心
- What's she saying?  - She says not to worry.

481
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:47,198
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

482
00:50:53,782 --> 00:50:56,906
很好 没有弹片在里面 我现在要止血
Perfect! There's no bullet. Now I have to stop the bleeding.

483
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,572
没有子弹  没有子弹
There is no bullet. There is no bullet.

484
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:01,822
保佑 保佑 保佑
Please, please, please. Okay.

485
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:04,364
你要喝一杯吗？朋友 反正我要

486
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,114
弟兄们 按住他
Guys, hold him tight!

487
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,572
- 她在干什么？她在干什么？  - 好 她在止血
- What's she doing? What's she doing?  - Okay, she's gonna stop the bleeding.

哦 我要去吐了
Oh! I'm going to puke.

490
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:54,789
为什么要杀我叔叔？
Why did they kill my uncle?

491
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,498
我不知道
I don't know.

492
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,540
可能因为我父亲找过他
Probably because my father reached out to him.

493
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,373
我不知道 抱歉
I don't know. I'm sorry.

494
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,915
为什么你手机里会有汤姆 Keaton的照片？
Why do you have a photo of Tom Keaton on your phone?

495
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:11,123
那是我父亲 那是马丁 苏
That's my father. That's Martin Shaw.

496
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:13,914

497
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,539

Yes.

498
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,373

你认识我父亲？你们是朋友？
Did you know my father? Were you friends?

501
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,290
高于一切的朋友
Friends before anything else.

502
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:48,956
我的一生
All my life.

503
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:59,207
哦 上帝我不能待在这儿 我要去找我的家人
Oh, God. I can't stay here. I've gotta find my family.

504
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,707
你要去哪儿找？
Where do you need to go?

505
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:02,331
太阳门广场
To Puerta del Sol.

506
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:05,290
所以 你叫你爸爸 马丁？
So you called your father Martin?

507
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,582
不是我叫他 那是他的名字
I didn't call him that. That was his name.

508
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,873
你知道他干什么吗？
Do you even know what he did?

509
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:21,373
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

510
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,457
他做什么谋生？
What he did for a living.

511
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,790
他说他是商业咨询顾问
He said he was a business consultant.

512
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,540
商业咨询顾问 那么有钱
Business consultant. That's rich.

513
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:44,332
你呢？你是干什么的？
What about you? What do you do?

514
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:48,331
我原来有家小公司
I used to run a small company.

515
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:53,540
做什么的小公司？
And what did your small company do?

516
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,957
商业咨询
Business consultants.

517
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,082
有其父 有其子
Like father, like son.

518
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:09,165
好像你和我父亲很熟 怎么会？
So you seem to know my father pretty well. How come?

519
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,498
你和他上床吗？
Were you sleeping with him?

520
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,749
你这么想？
That's what you think?

521
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,249
我不是你……
I wasn't your...

522
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,707
我不知道我该怎么想
I don't know what I'm supposed to think.

523
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,541
我不是你父亲的情人
I wasn't your father's lover.

524
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,249
我母亲是
My mother was.

525
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,915
他也是我父亲
He was my father, too.

526
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,915
你知道他另一个家吗？
Did you know about his other family?

527
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,457
他几乎从不在家
He was hardly around.

528
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,708
有时我觉得 父母越是不在身边
Sometimes I think the more a parent's absent,

529
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:21,000
你就越爱他们
the more you love them.

530
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:32,249
下一站 太阳门广场
Next stop, Puerta del Sol.

531
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:50,083
你也是？
So, you, too?

532
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,875
我还行
I was fine with it.

533
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,791
肯定是
Sure you were.

534
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,999
你母亲呢？
And your mother?

535
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:04,749
她是什么样子？
What's she like?

536
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,249
我母亲死了
My mother is dead.

537
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,915
对不起
I'm sorry.

538
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:22,583
威尔！等等！
Will! Wait!

539
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,915
等等
Wait.

540
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:32,125
- 好  - 我跟你说过了 我需要单独一个人去
- Okay.  - I told you. I need to go alone.

541
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,916
如果你要找我 我会在夜总会
If you need me, I'll be at the club.

542
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,666
就这样
That's all.

543
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,082
谢谢你
Thank you.

544
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:41,583
我希望你能带他们回来
I hope you will get them back.

545
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:33,749
把手伸出来 让我能看见
Keep your hands where I can see them.

546
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:38,499
转过来 跟我走
Turn around and walk with me.

547
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:40,374
哪儿？
Where?

548
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,124
跟着
Follow me.

549
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:41,166
你父亲在哪儿？
Where is your father?

550
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,667
我家人在哪儿？
Where's my family?

551
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,833
我告诉你了
I've told you,

552
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,542
一遍又一遍
over and over.

553
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:15,583
我父亲死了
My father is dead.

554
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:17,332
如果你不信我
If you don't believe me,

555
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:21,292
让你的人跟着我进城
then have your guy here really go to town on me.

556
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:22,749
他肯定会感觉好些的
Sure he'll feel better.

557
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:25,917
我还是什么他妈的都不知道
And I still won't know a goddamned thing.

558
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:29,709
即使是真的 也是你的问题
Even if that's true, it's still your problem.

559
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:39,083
你知道我们怎么会查到这里吗 威尔？
Do you know how we come to this, Will?

560
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:44,041
两个月前 我的手下发现一个腐化特工
Two months ago, one of my men posed as a corrupt agent

561
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,333
准备向恐怖分子出售敏感情报
willing to sell sensitive pieces of intel to terrorists.

562
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:56,500
任务是揭发一个中央情报局流氓特工
The mission was to uncover a rogue CIA operative

563
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,250
我们已经知道他是为自己的利益来做交易
we knew was making deals for his own interest.

564
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,584
于是 我的人安排了会面
So my agent arranged a rendezvous.

565
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:04,500
猜猜谁露面了？
And guess who showed up?

566
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,333
你父亲杀了我的特工
Your father killed my agent

567
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:16,542
偷走了装有我国非常重要情报的公文箱
and stole a briefcase that held contents vital to my country.

568
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:19,333
现在 你告诉我说他死了？
And now you tell me he's dead?

569
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:20,709
特工？
Agent?

570
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:23,126
或者是恐怖分子
How about terrorist?

571
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,333
恐怖分子？
Terrorist?

572
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:32,916
我妻子和儿子在特拉维夫咖啡馆里遇到恐怖分子
My wife and son met a terrorist once, in a cafe in Tel Aviv.

573
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,791
一瞬间
In an instant,

574
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:37,542
他们 和其他15个人
they and 15 others

575
01:00:37,918 --> 01:00:39,458
变成了灰烬
were turned to ash.

576
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,959
所以问题变成了
So the question becomes

577
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:53,375
是谁要杀你父亲？
who killed your father?

578
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:02,584
他自己部门的人
People from his own agency.

579
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,667
他们杀了他的朋友 也要杀了我
They killed his friend and they've been trying to kill me, too.

580
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:08,333
你是说卡瑞克？
You mean Carrack?

581
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:09,834
是
Yeah.

582
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:16,750
你们真应该一起聊聊这个
You guys should really get together and chat about this.

583
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:18,875
我想你该上来…
I think you'd get on really...

584
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,334
大概她想杀了你 因为是目击者
Perhaps she wants to eliminate you as a witness,

585
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:26,084
还有你家其他人
along with the rest of your family.

586
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:30,041
归根到底 无论你到哪儿
Bottom line is that, wherever you go,

587
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,250
他们都要抓到你
they'll be hunting you.

588
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:36,126
那样正合适
And that will suit our purposes fine.

589
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:48,126
- 威尔!  - 威尔!
- Will!  - Will!

590
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:49,251
- 你还活着！  - 弟兄们！
- You're alive!  -  Guys!

591
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:50,709
- 有人伤着你们吗？  - 威尔 你没事吧？
- Has anyone hurt you?  -  Will, you're okay!

592
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,917
讽刺的是
The irony is,

593
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,458
如果你父亲的杀手们正在追杀证人
if your father's killers are trying to eliminate witnesses,

594
01:01:56,502 --> 01:02:00,459
那么 能让你家人活命的正是他们的囚禁
the only thing keeping your family alive right now is their captivity.

595
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:03,917
所以我的办法是
So here is the deal.

596
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:06,584
你出去 将她引出来
I need you out there to draw her to you.

597
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:08,959
我们知道有些买主已经来了
We know that some potential buyers are in town.

598
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:11,501
感觉交易就在眼前
So we feel that the sale is imminent.

599
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,126
既然她那么想杀了你们
If she really wants to kill you all,

600
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:17,668
我只需要待在你们附近
I just need to stay close to you.

601
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:21,959
但是必须说清楚 如果我没能在交易前抓住卡瑞克
But just so we're clear, if I don't stop Carrack before it's sold,

602
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:26,167
我不会继续扣押你的家人
I won't keep your family any longer.

603
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:29,126
我会放了他们 卡瑞克 会杀了他们
I'll release them, and Carrack will kill them.

604
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,042
明白了？
Understood?

605
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,376
弟兄们！
Guys!

606
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:38,917
威尔！等等！
Will! Wait!

607
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,501
放开我！
Just get off of me!

608
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:38,293
嘿i！把手拿开 放开我
Hey! Get your hands off me! Get off me!

609
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:40,501
让我走！
Let me go!

610
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,543
嘿 兄弟
Hey, man.

611
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:49,959
我要见 露西亚
I need to see Lucia.

612
01:03:50,086 --> 01:03:51,835
来 我带你去
Come. I'll take you.

613
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:16,293
威尔
Will.

614
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:18,668
我见到他们了 他们还活着
I've seen them. They're alive.

615
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:21,918
我要她来找我
I need to get her coming after me.

616
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,668
这不难 反正她一直都想抓我们
It shouldn't be hard, 'cause she's trying to track me down anyway.

617
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:26,917
她要杀掉每个知情人
She wants to kill anyone who knew anything about it.

618
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:30,293
以色列人说买主今晚就到
And the Israeli said that the likely buyers are in town tonight.

619
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:34,293
所以我们必须马上行动 他们随时可能成交
So we gotta move, 'cause the deal could happen any time.

620
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:36,543
嘿
Hey.

621
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:38,877
- 给你  - 谢谢
- For you.  - Thank you.

622
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:41,376
你听到多少？
How much did you hear?

623
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:45,626
加上以前露西亚告诉我的  够了
Along with what Lucia told me before? Enough.

624
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,834
卡瑞克 这个婊子
This bitch, Carrack,

625
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,501
是她杀的 迪亚哥 对吗？
she's the one who killed Diego, right?

626
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:54,043
我能帮些什么？
So, how can I help?

627
01:04:56,628 --> 01:04:58,960
他们是间谍 对吗？到处都有眼线
They're spies, right? Eyes everywhere?

628
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:00,877
电话 电子邮件 所有的
Phones, e-mail. Everything.

629
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:04,127
放一点消息 他们就会找到我们
Let's start a tab. Then they'll find us.

630
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:07,127
露西亚 等一下 你真的要这么做？
Lucia, wait a second. Are you sure you're ready for this?

631
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:09,960
你可以带着荣誉感说我的名字
Say my name and you can say it with honor

632
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:26,710
她今晚不上班
She's not working tonight.

633
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:27,960
谢谢
Gracias.

634
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:21,878
你不了解我 你上学的时候
You don't understand me, but when you were in school,

635
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,627
听过布雷尔兔的故事吗？嗯？
you ever hear the story of Brer Rabbit? Huh?

636
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,335
- 这个卖了吗？  - 这个卖了吗？
- Is it sold?  - Is it sold?

637
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,419
基督呀！  你比你父亲还笨！
Jesus Christ! You're dumber than your father.

638
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:53,419
你究竟要问什么 威尔？
What are you actually asking me, Will?

639
01:06:54,336 --> 01:06:58,168
这个卖了吗？什么卖了？公文箱吗？  还是你家人死了吗？
"Is it sold?" What's sold? The briefcase? Or is your family dead?

640
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:01,086
因为如果卖了 他们就死了 对吗？
'Cause if it's sold, they're dead. Right?

641
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,295
交易一定会做的
The deal's gonna happen.

642
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:11,919
唯一能知道地点的办法 就是让我告诉你
And the only way you'll know where is if you make me tell you.

643
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,710
但我什么也不会告诉你
But I ain't telling you shit.

644
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:14,918
不！
No!

645
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:21,460
把他弄起来
Get him up!

646
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:23,961
- 给他松绑  - 他要杀了你 哥们儿
- Untie him! - He'll kill you, man.

647
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:29,836
威尔!
Will!

648
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,711
放开我！  我们会做的
Get off me! We'll do this!

649
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:34,543
- 放开我！放开我！  - 我们会做的！
- Get off me! Get off me!  - We'll do this!

650
01:07:36,296 --> 01:07:38,502
卡瑞克在哪儿？回答我！
Where's Carrack? Answer me!

651
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,252
告诉我 她在哪儿？她为什么不在这儿？
Tell me! Where is she? Why isn't she here?

652
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,836
- 她为什么不在这儿？  - 因为！
- Why isn't she here?  - Because!

653
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,544
她是女士
She's a lady.

654
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:51,252
不像你小妹妹
And ladies, unlike your little sister,

655
01:07:51,296 --> 01:07:53,128
女士会待在家里 男人出去
stay at home while the men go out...

656
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:59,168
好好修理他！
Kick the shit out of him!

657
01:07:59,628 --> 01:08:02,252
别担心 他会招的  就把他捆起来吧 已经够了
Don't worry. He'll talk.  Just tape him up. We've done enough.

658
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:04,502
我知道看了这个不舒服 但是有效
I know that it's not easy to watch, but it will work.

659
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:05,919
- 不 不会的  - 会的
- No, it won't.  - It will.

660
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:08,127
- 我有个计划  - 胶带弄不住他
- I've got a plan.  - The duct tape won't hold.

661
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,044
我们必须让他走 我们要弄辆车
We have to let him go. We need a car.

662
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,544
- 我不明白  - 向我保证你不会进那边
- I don't understand.  - Promise me you won't go in there.

663
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,085
还是不明白
I still don't understand.

664
01:08:18,129 --> 01:08:21,294
他以为我是白痴 我就装给他看
He thinks I'm an idiot. Let me deliver on that.

665
01:08:29,129 --> 01:08:32,168
爸爸不是叛徒 卡瑞克耍了他
Dad was no traitor. Carrack played him.

666
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:34,878
也耍了以色列人
Played him and the Israelis.

667
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,127
- 以色列人出动了吗？  - 最好是
- And the Israelis are out there?  - They better be.

668
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:02,836
在那儿
There.

669
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:37,295
他们要逃
They are on the move.

670
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,211
跟着他们 如果她出现就告诉我
Stay close to them. Call me if she shows up.

671
01:09:39,296 --> 01:09:40,295
好
Ok.

672
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:06,336
他跑了
He got away.

673
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,087
以后再处理他
I'll deal with him later.

674
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:12,087
为了你的命 希望他们没跟来
Let's hope for your sake he doesn't show up.

675
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,753
在那儿 停车
There. Pull over.

676
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:50,752
小心
