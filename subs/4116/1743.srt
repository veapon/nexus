May I?

731
01:18:05,396 --> 01:18:09,311
You were abducted from your home
the night of September 3, 1958.

732
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:17,200
I'm Kristen,

I'm Kristen!

735
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:23,831
You were left chained up in the
basement of an abandoned farmhouse

736
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:25,541
for nearly two months...

737

the same farmhouse you burned down.

738
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:33,216
You were only 11 years old.

739
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:37,303
Half-starved, sick with fever,
trapped in the darkness,

740
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:39,430
it was a waking nightmare.

741
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:43,893
Your only escape was into delusion.

742
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:48,888
In order to survive the trauma,
your psyche fractured.

743
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:55,020
You suffer from multiple
personality disorder.

744
01:18:57,991 --> 01:19:03,246
Each personality took
a piece of this nightmare

745
01:19:03,246 --> 01:19:06,081
and locked it away from you
for your own protection.

746
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:12,380
But the new personalities
became so... dominant

747
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,675
they completely overwhelmed
Alice's personality.
