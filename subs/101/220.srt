5
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,721
Silencer?

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,481
I'll take it.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,484
- Munitions?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,161
Hey.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,850
It was good to see you.

10
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,721
Two carats a stone.

11
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,604
D colour.

12
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,161
Flawless.

13
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,407
Retail 20 to 22K a carat.

14
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,843
Two stones a pack.

15
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,444
Forty-four packs.

16
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,241
8K a stone.

17
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,724
I have to raise the funds, get them
certified, then find a buyer.

18
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,649
- When do I collect?
- 72 hours.

19
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,406
Almost like old times.

20
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,924
Don't answer it.

21
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,411
Why? Afraid it's your boyfriend?

22
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,921
Yeah?

23
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,801
Where?

24
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,442
Car was stolen in Manchester.

25
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,646
Tools?

26
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,042
Matches Moorgate and
Farringdon.

27
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,601
- HQ confirmed it's our guy?
- Mmm-hmm.

28
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,283
Only a matter of time.

29
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,849
Time to pop your cherry.
We got a new lead.

30
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,166
<i>Mark Corso.</i>

31
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,804
<i>Son of Joseph Corso.</i>

32
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,242
<i>Runs a ticket business earning
him a fast half mil each year.</i>

33
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,366
<i>But he's hooked on the devil's dandruff.</i>

34
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,011
<i>Moonlighting cocaine deals
is a regular gig.</i>

35
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,644
He checked in 45 minutes ago.

36
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,410
He's waiting on the bagman.

37
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,491
Here we go.

38
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,169
Okay. Thanks.

39
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,811
He's just checked out.

40
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,407
Bagman's mine.

41
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,004
We got the bagman.

42
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,647
What's our friend saying?

43
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,282
He got here 30 minutes ago,
went in the back. Hasn't resurfaced.

44
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,683
Done a check, building's clean.

45
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,886
Anything else?

46
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,610
- Paul Myers.
- Whereabouts?

47
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,527
In the back.

48
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,085
All right, let's roll.

49
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,881
Oi!

50
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,248
- Little fucker pulled a knife on me.
- Yeah?

51
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,484
- Good information don't come cheap.
- It's evidence.

52
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,365
Think it's this easy?

53
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,647
He's the bait.

54
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,085
All right!

55
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,449
For fuck's sake.

56
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,569
All right. All right!

57
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,163
What's all this about?

58
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,491
Your son's been arrested.

59
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,442
Possession of cocaine, intent to supply.
Three to five years minimum.

60
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,291
No suspended sentence,
not this time.

61
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,886
Are you fucking with me?

62
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,724
No, your son is.

63
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,490
So what do you want?

64
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,688
I want you to hire someone.

65
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,451
For what?

66
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,206
Score.

67
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,888
Stupidity is better hidden
than displayed, detective.

68
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,090
You heard about Moorgate?
Farringdon?

69
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,126
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,007
I want you to hire the one that's been
playing without your permission.

71
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,209
James Riley.

72
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,803
<i>You supply the target,
we'll assess the risk. Five mil limit.</i>

73
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,729
<i>What if he doesn't wanna
work for me?</i>

74
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,883
<i>There's a recession,
everyone wants to work.</i>

75
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,001
Yeah?

76
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,129
<i>I sold the stones.
I'll have your money by tonight.</i>

77
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,925
- When?
- 9:00.

78
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,726
- Where?
- Camden.

79
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,729
So you think he's up to it?

80
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,204
- He wants to be.
- Don't they all.

81
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,130
<i>We commend to almighty God,
our brother, Adrian Peters,</i>

82
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,921
and commit his body
to the ground.

83
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,047
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

84
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,362
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

85
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,408
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

86
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,764
He was a good man.

87
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,564
Where's the money?

88
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,045
My boss has it. He wants to talk.

89
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,448
Just a conversation.

90
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,968
I wasn't so sure
you'd make it.

91
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,281
You're a high-line pro.
I want us to work together.

92
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,970
I work alone.

93
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,962
- Why don't you just take a look?
- Because I don't like the view.

94
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,204
Do you know what
a merchant is?

95
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,487
I am the merchant of this city.

96
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,522
Anything with a centigrade of heat
comes through me.

97
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,124
Adrian Peters knew the rules.
Even if you didn't.

98
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,370
The money I took off you
is the, uh, commission you owe me.

99
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,969
If we can work together,
we become partners.

100
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,250
If we can't,
then we become competitors.

101
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,366
I've become extremely efficient
in eliminating the competition over the years.

102
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,281
I'm still here.

103
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,050
You'll be working directly for me.

104
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,569
The jobs will be laid out. Blueprints,
schematics, whatever's necessary.

105
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,451
What's my end?

106
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,722
30%. Unnegotiable.

107
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,130
Only one job?

108
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,250
- If that's what you want?
- I do.

109
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,446
Mmm...

110
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,645
Prick.

111
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,369
These tactics?

112
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,767
Yeah.

113
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,761
What if Mark Corso
puts in a complaint?

114
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,521
You wanna make detective?

115
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,763
- Yeah.
- Then listen.

116
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,170
One day you're gonna have to
shoot someone in the back.

117
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,523
And when that moment comes,

118
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,371
you ain't gonna give a
shit about procedure.

119
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,687
Our boy in May?

120
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,201
Mmm-hmm.

121
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,089
- Difficult?
- No.

122
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,241
Medium level security,
no more than five mil in the vault.

123
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,402
By the way, I still haven't
spoken to my son.

124
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,285
I want assurances the
next time we meet.

125
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,004
I'll look into it.

126
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,362
Fifth floor down.
North-east corner.

127
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,926
I see it.

128
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,682
How are they looking after themselves?

129
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,530
It's a binary system
connected to three independent alarms.

130
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,051
To where?

131
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,124
Scotland Yard.

132
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,846
- Response time?
- Six minutes.

133
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,366
- Proximity?
- Not close enough.

134
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,881
Meaning?

135
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,601
Mr Cutter will be with you.

136
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,611
If he steps out of line,
I'll do what's necessary.

137
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,569
How secure is the box?

138
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,961
Two foot of titanium steel.

139
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,243
I'll need two weeks prep.

140
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,646
Okay.

141
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,844
You've got it.

142
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,121
Under the seat.

143
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,725
Are we good?

144
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,970
Yeah, we're good.

145
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,125
We're good to go.

146
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,130
Earliest window?

147
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,446
This weekend.

148
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,604
The access codes?

149
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,891
We're on it.

150
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,009
That's not good enough.

151
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,770
We're experiencing a few difficulties.

152
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,203
The access holder.

153
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,565
You got a profile?

154
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,481
Mmm-hmm.

155
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,290
I've gone over it.

156
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,211
He can't be turned.
Worked for the firm for 22 years.

157
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,884
We got no option but
to go in hard.

158
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,287
Use his, uh... Use his family.

159
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,244
It's not my style.

160
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,930
It's not your style?

161
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,327
Hmm.

162
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,486
- So what do you suggest?
- Nothing.

163
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,003
You said it would be a laid out,
inside job.

164
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,162
Don't be a smartass.

165
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,766
You have an option without
a 10-year default, I'm listening.

166
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,841
Okay.

167
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,526
Maybe.

168
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,723
I'll need 48 hours.

169
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,170
I meant what I said.

170
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,084
You're just like your brother.

171
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,203
He thought he knew everything.

172
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,847
- Why bring him up?
- Why not?

173
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,451
He was a prick.

174
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,691
Yeah. We need to talk.

175
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,886
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,764
I'll see you there.

177
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,728
I told you not to call me,
Corso.

178
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,127
- I want my son released.
- That's not gonna happen.

179
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,210
You stick to the plan, you'll be
playing happy families by the weekend.

180
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,206
- You're not listening to me, detective.
- Yes, I am.

181
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,928
Firstly, you don't tell me what to do.
Secondly, stop wasting my fucking time.

182
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,251
I've spoken to my son.

183
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,483
- He's being looked after.
- By who? By you?

184
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,290
When you've got a junkie for a son,
detective, deaf ears become a necessity.

185
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,604
It's either listen to lies or listen
to more lies. For years I never listened.

186
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,047
Then he mentions a black Range Rover.

187
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,129
I took in every word. Every detail.

188
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,124
I want my son released.

189
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,647
Audio recordings
of our preparations.

190
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,847
Your contributions included.

191
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,049
- You wanna fuck with me, do you?
- No, you fucked with my family first.

192
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,325
Your son wants to distribute cocaine, he
should know it comes with risk and reward.

193
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,607
Same applies to me. Remember?

194
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,561
I remember we didn't
have this problem.

195
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,325
We've had a problem with
the access holder.

196
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,571
The codes are in Scotland
Yard's mainframe.

197
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,251
I want the source
recordings in exchange.

198
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,561
Yeah?

199
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,723
Great. Great.

200
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,363
<i>Jonathan Parker.</i>

201
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,086
Files?

202
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,923
You stay where you are.

203
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,607
Cutter.

204
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,091
Sands.

205
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,561
We're good.

206
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,527
Get in the car.

207
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,046
Access codes?

208
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,571
This one's to run smoothly,
Corso.

209
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,801
<i>We have the access codes.</i>

210
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,163
Give us a minute,
George. Okay?

211
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,170
What is wrong with you?

212
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,481
Hmm?

213
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,366
I thought you would've learned your lesson
after the Dover incident.

214
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,761
Wasn't easy to get you a
suspended sentence.

215
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,166
I know.

216
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,803
They're never gonna let you
be the merchant of this city.

217
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,843
I'll be fine.

218
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,403
It's too late.
They all know your problems.

219
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,091
Sober or not, you'd be seen
as a weak merchant.

220
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,042
I'd always keep you close.

221
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,723
I lost your mother.

222
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,968
I don't wanna lose you.

223
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,961
Okay?

224
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,964
Come the weekend,

225
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,605
I'm retired.

226
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,241
We're set.

227
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,167
Bag it.

228
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,760
What the fuck just happened?

229
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,801
It's £50 million we just stole.

230
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,644
We got lucky.

231
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,768
There's no such thing as luck.

232
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,204
Fool's thinking.

233
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,121
Mmm.

234
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,009
Three cushions,
bit of right-hand side.

235
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,129
Do you mind? There's money on this.
Let him play his own game.

236
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,206
Liberty.

237
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,044
How's Sands?

238
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,400
You still his eyes and ears
of the world?

239
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,928
I've known that man since I was 14 years old.
I'll always have his back.

240
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,610
And your Portugal project?

241
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,321
- Coming on.
- Must be getting close.

242
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,965
Our line of work doesn't pay as well,
does it?

243
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,530
- Who you kidding?
- Who's kidding who?

244
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,643
Is that what you tell Sands?

245
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,891
Relax.

246
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,771
I heard about the Turks.

247
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,406
It's nothing.

248
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,088
Well, that's not what I heard.

249
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,480
I mean, there are people that you fuck with,
people you don't.

250
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,681
It'll be all right.

251
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,650
- Just giving you a little heads up.
- Don't need it.

252
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,121
Gentlemen, good doing
business with you.

253
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,248
- My retirement?
- With no pension.

254
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,850
- Where's Cutter?
- He didn't make it.

255
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,647
- Has our commission been confirmed?
- Yeah.

256
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,131
- How much?
- 10%.

257
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,963
How much we giving Dixon?

258
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,764
Haven't decided.

259
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,371
<i>That's not a good look.</i>

260
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,407
46 million.

261
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,804
Changed their policy three days ago.

262
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,603
Corso set us up.

263
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,809
All right, Sands.
What do you think?

264
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,606
Tell them how it is.

265
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,401
Tell who?

266
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,482
Attorney General and
Police Commissioner.

267
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,481
They're in the loop?

268
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,284
You need to step up your game.

269
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,488
I'm not sure he knows
what game he's playing.

270
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,411
Listen. This ain't me.

271
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,330
- What ain't?
- The snooker club.

272
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,125
- Stop running before you can walk.
- I know what I saw.

273
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,241
Yeah?

274
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,487
Nelson and Roberts are narc. Check
for yourself. Undercover last seven years.

275
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,445
And what about the bagman?

276
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,249
- What about him?
- Never checked in.

277
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,122
No record of him at Wandsworth Prison.
Nothing.

278
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,405
- Gentlemen.
- Take a seat, Parker.

279
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,881
How could you be so stupid?

280
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,323
You should have consulted us.

281
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,249
Well, I didn't believe
it was necessary.

282
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,245
I rather think 46 million
makes it necessary.

283
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,131
We agreed a five mil limit,
like before.

284
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,283
How do you mean "before"?

285
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,203
Fairfax case.

286
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,046
- What about it?
- We employed the same tactics.

287
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,805
Who's the bait?

288
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,930
Joseph Corso.

289
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,006
Wasn't Corso the bait in the
Fairfax case?

290
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,121
Yeah.

291
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,206
Jesus!

292
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,763
We need a result, Parker.

293
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,526
Recover the money,
you can have your usual commission.

294
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,690
How long can you hold
back the fire?

295
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,560
Twenty-four hours?

296
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,447
Can you press this?

297
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,326
Harder.

298
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,641
Fuck!

299
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,931
Come on, Sands, open your eyes.
Why tell us the bagman's in prison?

300
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,165
You wanna stop talking.

301
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,405
He's a criminal with a badge.
No more, no less.

302
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,925
- Watch your mouth.
- Why?

303
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,129
Because I'll make sure you never
make detective, that's why!

304
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,521
Fuck making detective.

305
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,968
Okay. Suit yourself.

306
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,923
Robert Razsiak.

307
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,524
He killed my dad.

308
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,803
Got off soot-free.
That's why I joined.

309
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,647
And you?

310
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,641
Do you even remember
why you joined?

311
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,042
<i>What are you
gonna do about the Turks?</i>

312
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,764
It'll blow over.

313
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,407
And they won't care about your badge.
They'll take you out.

314
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,050
- It's an easy fix.
- How?

315
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,326
Portugal fund.

316
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,044
What about Sands?

317
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,325
He's all right.

318
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,010
Got enough?

319
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,003
- A bit light.
- How much?

320
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,961
One-fifty. It'll be all right.
Go and see Mc'Deer. Cash in a few bits.

321
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,610
And you can clean this up in 24 hours?

322
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,763
I'll stake my badge on it.

323
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,444
You are.

324
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,806
Let's do it.

325
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,127
Twenty-four hours.
Then it's a full-scale investigation.

326
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,130
What about the bagman?

327
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,725
I'll release him tomorrow.

328
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,847
Yeah.

329
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,891
<i>I think I've got
a lead on Corso.</i>

330
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,930
Yeah? Well, I'll come with you.

331
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,445
<i>I've already left.
It shouldn't take too long.</i>

332
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,525
<i>- I'll call you in an hour or so.
- All right.</i>

333
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,843
Why did you come back?

334
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,490
- Adrian asked me to.
- He thought you set him up.

335
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,446
- Because I never explained.
- You never once visited him in prison.

336
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,641
I left after my brother died.

337
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,771
He needed help moving some ice.

338
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,883
He was desperate.

339
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,404
Asked if Adrian would take them.
I said not if they were from him.

340
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,401
Adrian couldn't stand my brother.

341
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,961
The police swooped so quickly,
I still don't know how I got away.

342
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,843
My brother was a mess.

343
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,170
His associates wanted their share
so he had to commit to another job.

344
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,842
Fairfax Security.

345
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,401
They found him a few hours later.

346
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,491
He'd been shot twice
in the back.

347
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,409
It was Corso.

348
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,121
He'd set him up.

349
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,811
I lost a brother and a friend.

350
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,649
I need an address.

351
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,324
Curtis Carter.

352
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,843
How quick can you
Get it to me?

353
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,971
All right. Well, let us know
as soon as possible.

354
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,884
And let's keep Parker out the loop
on this one, yeah?

355
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,401
All right. Cheers.

356
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,164
<i>I have the money.</i>

357
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,081
Good.

358
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,326
Okay. Where do we meet?

359
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,609
Battersea Power Station.
Midnight tonight.

360
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,761
Okay.

361
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,005
I'll be there.

362
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,409
- Where's Parker?
- Told him we had a lead on Corso.

363
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,927
- How long we got?
- Two, three hours max.

364
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,403
Got the bagman's address?

365
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,401
Yeah.

366
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,046
You got a problem?

367
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,281
No.

368
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,561
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

369
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,246
Police!

370
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,406
Curtis Carter?

371
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,531
- He don't live here.
- He's registered as living here.

372
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,362
- You got a warrant?
- No.

373
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,801
Then fuck off!

374
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,607
Oi!

375
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,603
- Where's your brother?
- How do I know!

376
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,006
- He was here.
- Where is he?

377
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,241
I'm not his keeper.

378
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,127
You can't put that on me.

379
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,602
I can do what the fuck I like.
Where's your brother?

380
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,046
Fuck you, man!

381
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,568
Fine. Call it in.

382
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,241
Control.

383
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,051
You just finished a three.

384
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,328
That means you're facing a five.

385
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,290
7-1-2-4, receiving. Go ahead.

386
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,930
What's it gonna be,
five minutes or five years?

387
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,244
<i>7-1-2-4, receiving.
Go ahead.</i>

388
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,521
<i>7- 1-2-4, receiving.</i>

389
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,561
Shit.

390
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,125
Get out the fucking way.

391
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,201
Watch it, mate!

392
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,370
- Get down!
- Get off me, man!

393
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,764
Come on. Get down here.

394
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,806
Oi, where you going? Stay there!

395
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,087
Stay there! Making me run.

396
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,604
What happened after you left the Westbury
Hotel on the night of the 16th?

397
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,563
I don't know what
you're talking about.

398
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,324
- Mark Corso is in custody.
- So?

399
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,641
- So we can put you at the exchange.
- You can't put me anywhere, man.

400
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,721
Oi, what are you doing?

401
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,609
- Tell us what happened.
- You know what happened.

402
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,886
Dixon, what are you waiting for?

403
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,371
All right, look, look.
I'll tell you what happened.

404
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,441
Yeah, go on.

405
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,641
Your man pulled me up
on the Clerkenwell Road.

406
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,248
- You're talking about Parker?
- Yeah.

407
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,407
He arrested me for intent to supply.

408
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,884
So why weren't you put in custody?

409
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,691
He made me an offer. 10%.

410
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,091
How much were you holding?

411
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,481
Seven-fifty.

412
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,684
Doesn't make sense.

413
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,891
He shouldn't have slept
with Velon's woman.

414
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,846
Told Parker he wants five mil
to forget that it ever happened.

415
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,761
Most expensive lay that
he's ever had.

416
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,528
- How long's he got?
- What do you think? Time's up.

417
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,606
Time's up. Now, get off me!

418
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,364
- You get out of here.
- Fuck off.

419
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,281
Hey.

420
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,804
Who's Velon?

421
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,323
Heavyweight Turk.

422
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,003
So, it was never about Riley.

423
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,647
- I need to check on something.
- All right.

424
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,241
<i>- I'll come with you.
- It'll be quicker on my own.</i>

425
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,283
And if Parker wants to meet?

426
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,325
Play along.

427
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,400
<i>Apologies,
Mr Sands, you weren't in the diary.</i>

428
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,131
- No, I didn't have an appointment.
- What can I do for you today?

429
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,521
I need to confirm a transfer
into our account.

430
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,930
But we closed your account.
Mr Parker came in a few weeks ago.

431
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,841
He told us you were considering
another bank.

432
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,728
He signed off on it this morning.

433
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,401
We must have got our wires crossed.

434
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,007
Thank you.

435
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,966
Sands!

436
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,047
You didn't have to choose
the fucking top floor. Where's Dixon?

437
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,448
Covering our tracks at HQ.

438
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,281
Look, this lead on Corso.

439
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,250
The bagman never checked
in to Wandsworth.

440
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,804
Yeah, I checked him in under
a different name.

441
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,885
10%. He told me the deal.

442
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,682
I put it in the Portugal fund.
What the fuck?

443
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,650
"What the fuck?" That's exactly what
I asked myself when I checked the fund.

444
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,926
What the fuck!

445
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,170
3.2 million gone because you
went to bed with a whore.

446
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,442
People used to tell me,
"Be careful of Parker, you can't trust him".

447
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,087
I backed you every time.

448
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,649
All the way.
Like a brother.

449
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,724
All these years and the fucking bagman
knows more than me.

450
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,764
It's all right, I've got you.
I've got you. It's all right.

451
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,561
Don't try to talk. Shh.
It's all right.

452
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,961
Shh.

453
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,009
Robert Razsiak...

454
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,481
The lead on Corso.

455
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,201
Corso.

456
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,766
Where's Sands?

457
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,366
- He'll catch up.
- I thought he had the car?

458
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,488
No, the car's a bit of a giveaway.
He walked.

459
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,530
Where are we going?

460
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,365
To cash in.

461
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,482
- Get the gun.
- Why?

462
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,010
Mc'Deer.
He's a tricky customer.

463
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,450
Hand it over.

464
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,161
- Where's Mc'Deer?
- Office.

465
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,884
How's it going, big guy?

466
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,601
Got the flake?

467
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,761
Robbie.

468
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,806
Where's Sands?

469
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,687
- He's on a case.
- Oh, yeah?

470
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,881
What?

471
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,811
- Come on.
- Come on what?

472
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,890
Come on, Parky, it's me.

473
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,884
You still think you're one of us?

474
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,201
- We made a good team.
- Yeah, back in the day.

475
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,684
Remember, it was me who looked
after you "back in the day".

476
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,884
Fuck's sake.

477
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,443
High value robbery yesterday
in St Paul's.

478
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,131
- Who?
- Don't move in your circles.

479
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,561
They're pretty big circles, Parky.
It's worth asking.

480
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,811
Fine. Robert Razsiak.

481
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,405
Never heard of him.

482
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,843
Right, let's talk.

483
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,766
Fifty a key.

484
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,411
- Let's talk sensibly.
- I am.

485
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,641
Twenty-five a key.

486
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,727
Now we're not even talking.

487
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,161
- It's the quality, see.
- Yeah?

488
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,401
60%.

489
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,529
I'll turn this into a bust
if I hear any more of that nonsense.

490
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,921
- How many pieces?
- Seven.

491
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,691
Thirty-eight does it for me.

492
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,891
Dixon. Count it.

493
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,608
Two-sixty-six, Robbie.

494
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,646
Have a seat.

495
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,842
- You need to watch him.
- Appreciate the tip.

496
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,362
Ten years,
I've never seen him and Sands apart.

497
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,527
- Worked together that long?
- History's longer than the job.

498
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,041
Friends since they was kids.

499
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,767
Right.

500
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,963
<i>Told you to watch him.</i>

501
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,241
Hello?

502
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,882
Velon. It's Parker.
I got 4.1 million for you.

503
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,371
<i>5 million by tonight.</i>

504
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,561
Shit!

505
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,482
You're an hour late.

506
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,202
Well I'm here now, ain't I?

507
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,446
Okay.

508
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,882
One passport, one driving license.

509
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,962
You won't find better quality
at such short notice.

510
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,165
12,000.

511
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,288
I'm not the one who's paying.

512
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,521
Joseph Corso.

513
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,011
What about him?

514
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,731
I need you to help me to find him.

515
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,246
What is this?

516
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,925
Last night,

517
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,405
St Paul's job.

518
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,286
Yeah, go on.

519
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,330
Um...

520
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,004
He was the bait.

521
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,565
He's killed Sands and Dixon.

522
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,443
Me and Sands, we went a long way back.

523
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,408
- Okay. Give us a few hours.
- Yeah.

524
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,442
Have you spoken to Sophia Peters?

525
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,169
Rumour is Corso killed
her husband.

526
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,282
Now she's looking for payback.

527
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,930
<i>Police. Can I come up?</i>

528
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,731
Impressive.

529
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,287
- Balcony?
- Yeah.

530
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,569
- Is there new information?
- About what?

531
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,530
- My husband.
- Not my division.

532
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,404
What do you want, detective?

533
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,448
Well, where's Joseph Corso?

534
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,770
How would I know?

535
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,129
He killed your husband.

536
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,881
- Then why haven't you done anything?
- Like I said, not my division.

537
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,846
- What kind of detective are you?
- The kind who wants Joseph Corso.

538
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,448
My husband deserves justice.

539
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,570
I can arrange justice.

540
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,449
So where is he?

541
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,686
I don't know.

542
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,803
You used to live in Liverpool,
didn't you?

543
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,605
Long time ago.

544
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,405
Do you remember an incident
at the Malmaison?

545
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,521
No.

546
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,843
I bet you don't.

547
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,802
You get me Joseph Corso,

548
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,684
or I tell the fellas in Liverpool
exactly how to find you.

549
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,491
Do you understand?

550
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,849
That's my number.

551
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,481
Call me.

552
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,488
<i>I've heard he'll be
at Battersea Power Station tonight.</i>

553
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,091
No one kills Riley until
I have the bonds.

554
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,085
Any questions?

555
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,841
Okay. Good.

556
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,601
Don't let me down.

557
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,207
I won't.

558
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,127
- I've heard that before.
- This time it's different.

559
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,726
Why is that?

560
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,722
Because we're doing it together.

561
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,086
I'm coming with you.

562
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,523
If it's about anything,
it's about them, mate. All right?

563
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,722
Where's Parker?

564
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,805
You've got the wrong man.

565
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,929
Fairfax Security was a set-up.

566
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,521
Your brother made a bid for freedom.

567
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,251
He died trying to escape.
He was shot by a cop.

568
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,249
A cop who was blackmailing me.

569
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,482
A cop who's blackmailing me now.

570
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,530
And Adrian Peters?

571
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,131
A low-life. Got what he deserved.

572
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,406
No!

573
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,565
No, no.

574
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,561
It's okay.

575
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,966
It's okay.

576
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,051
It's gonna be ok, Mark. It's gonna be ok.

577
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,090
It's okay.

578
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,724
Hands in the air.

579
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,604
I'm here for you, son.

580
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,930
Kick it over there.

581
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,331
- And you, Corso.
- I'm not leaving my son!

582
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,721
The bonds.

583
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,201
My son is dying!
Call an ambulance!

584
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,727
Not till I have the bonds.

585
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,207
He was bringing them to me!
Now call a fucking ambulance!

586
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,046
Is he telling the truth?

587
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,165
Take me to them.

588
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,201
Get it.

589
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,044
And the other one.

590
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,403
Put the gun down.

591
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,805
You ain't gonna shoot me.

592
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,807
It's over. They found Sands.

593
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,646
It's over for you, mate.
Where's your gloves?

594
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,604
You signed the murder weapon
on the way to Mc'Deer's.

595
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,284
I told you, you're a hustler,
not a gee.

596
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,564
I didn't want this.

597
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,405
If you don't like it,
hit the fucking road.

598
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,643
You wanted to play, you're playing.
It's fuck or walk now, mate.

599
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,410
You decide.

600
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,246
Five minutes on the scene,
you bring me this shit.

601
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,606
Er, you gotta get with
the programme, mate.

602
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,489
You're either on the inside
or you're on the outside.

603
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,042
There's no right or wrong.
It's just winners and losers.

604
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,408
What you're feeling right now,
that's gonna go away.

605
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,408
I went through the same thing.
We all did. It's your first time.

606
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,444
I'll hold your hand.

607
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,682
I'll walk you through it.
No one needs to die here except him.

608
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,247
Look, you shoot me,
you're gonna be portrayed as a traitor.

609
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,889
Internal Affairs are gonna fucking
tear you apart. You're gonna be finished.

610
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,966
Dixon, Dixon.

611
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,731
Listen to me, listen to me.

612
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,210
Most people are only capable
of looking forwards and backwards, yeah?

613
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,011
Never at the moment.
Never at the moment they're in.

614
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,481
I've seen people fucking strung up,
slammed down

615
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,847
because they missed their moment
when it came.

616
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,086
Now, Dixon.

617
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,724
Your moment's arrived.

618
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,644
This is it, mate.

619
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,604
Question is,
are you man enough to take it?

620
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,521
Was Sands?

621
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,080
I carried him for 20 years,
so fuck you.

622
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,165
I'm gonna put a bullet in this fucker's head
and we're gonna move on, all right?

623
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,805
I was told that one day,
I'd have to shoot someone in the back.

624
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,561
And he told me, when that moment came,
I wouldn't give a shit about procedure.

625
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,802
Yeah, well, I'm not just someone.

626
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,562
Finally popped your cherry.

627
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,406
You were set up.

628
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,087
What now?

629
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,921
You were never here.

630
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,044
I want her buried next
to her husband.

631
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,603
What do you want from me?

632
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,841
We want to know that the
case is closed.

633
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,044
It's closed.

634
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,686
Can you be trusted?

635
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,566
He means,
are you loyal to the system?

636
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,882
You think the public
won't understand.

637
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,730
Won't understand that if a cop
doesn't commit perjury,

638
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,087
you're never gonna
get a conviction.

639
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,481
That our undercovers cause more damage
on the streets

640
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,608
than those they're
trying to catch.

641
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,891
That the only way to take a criminal
off the streets is to take all their cash.

642
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,520
Because if you don't,
somewhere down the line

643
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,728
they're just gonna buy
themselves out.

644
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:46,684
Even now it feels like I'm lying,
even when I'm telling the truth.

645
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,609
Something like that. Yes.

646
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,570
Detective.
