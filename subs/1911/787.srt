00:06:51,56 --> 00:06:53,74
What do we care if we were expelled from college?

00:06:53,77 --> 00:06:57,19
The war is gonna start any day. We would've left college anyhow.

00:06:57,22 --> 00:06:58,65
War. Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?

00:06:58,69 --> 00:07:00,78
Do you know those Yankees actually want a war?

00:07:00,81 --> 00:07:03,03
We'll show 'em. Fiddle-dee-dee.

00:07:03,07 --> 00:07:04,45
War, war, war.

00:07:04,49 --> 00:07:07,64
This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring.

00:07:07,67 --> 00:07:09,66
I get so bored I could scream.

00:07:10,08 --> 00:07:13,33
Besides, there isn't going to be any war. Not gonna be any war?

00:07:13,38 --> 00:07:15,75
Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war.

00:07:15,79 --> 00:07:19,76
If either of you says war just once again, I'll go in the house and slam the door.

00:07:19,88 --> 00:07:22,97
But, Scarlett, honey... Don't you want us to have a war?

00:07:28,89 --> 00:07:30,06
Well

00:07:31,27 --> 00:07:32,67
but remember

00:07:33,06 --> 00:07:34,27
I warned you.

00:07:34,56 --> 00:07:36,02
I've got an idea.

00:07:36,07 --> 00:07:38,53
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks.

00:07:38,57 --> 00:07:41,32
That's a good idea. Aren't you eating barbecue with us?

00:07:41,36 --> 00:07:44,53
I hadn't thought about that yet. I'll think about that tomorrow.

00:07:44,57 --> 00:07:45,96
We want all your waltzes.

00:07:45,99 --> 00:07:48,54
First Brent, then me, then Brent, then me again and so on.

00:07:48,58 --> 00:07:50,70
Promise? I'd just love to.

00:07:51,66 --> 00:07:55,64
If only I didn't have every one of them taken already.

00:07:55,67 --> 00:07:57,04
Why, honey, you can't do that to us.

00:07:57,09 --> 00:07:59,71
How about if we tell you a secret? A secret? Who about?

00:07:59,76 --> 00:08:01,55
Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta?

00:08:01,59 --> 00:08:04,22
Ashley Wilkes' cousin. She's visiting the Wilkes'

00:08:04,26 --> 00:08:07,22
That goody-goody. Who wants to know a secret about her?

00:08:07,26 --> 00:08:08,93
Anyway, we heard, that is, they say

00:08:08,97 --> 00:08:13,65
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her. The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.

00:08:13,68 --> 00:08:14,87
Now do we get those waltzes?

00:08:15,06 --> 00:08:16,36
Of course.

00:08:17,27 --> 00:08:22,27
I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad. Let 'em be mad. We two can handle 'em.

00:08:22,30 --> 00:08:24,32
It can't be true. Ashley loves me.

00:08:24,36 --> 00:08:25,82
Scarlett.

00:08:25,99 --> 00:08:27,62
What has gotten into her?

00:08:27,66 --> 00:08:29,45
Do you suppose we made her mad?

00:08:29,49 --> 00:08:34,06
Where're you goin' without your shawl, and the night air fixin' to set in?

00:08:34,09 --> 00:08:36,25
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to stay for supper?

00:08:36,29 --> 00:08:38,34
You ain't got no more manners than a field hand

00:08:38,38 --> 00:08:40,55
after me and Miss Ellen done labored with you.

00:08:40,59 --> 00:08:43,13
Miss Scarlett, come on in the house.

00:08:43,17 --> 00:08:45,43
Come on in before you catch your death of dampness.

00:08:45,47 --> 00:08:48,22
No. I'll wait for Pa to come home from the Wilkes'.

00:08:48,26 --> 00:08:49,89
Come on in here.

00:08:50,47 --> 00:08:51,89
Come on.

00:09:07,07 --> 00:09:08,45
Quittin' time.

00:09:08,49 --> 00:09:09,83
Who says it's quittin' time?

00:09:09,87 --> 00:09:11,12
I says it's quittin' time.

00:09:11,16 --> 00:09:14,62
I's the foreman. I's the one that says when it's quittin' time at Tara.

00:09:14,66 --> 00:09:16,17
Quittin' time.

00:09:16,67 --> 00:09:18,58
Quittin' time.

00:09:58,74 --> 00:10:02,80
There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state.

00:10:04,17 --> 00:10:05,17
Pa.

00:10:05,46 --> 00:10:07,76
So it's proud of yourself, you are.

00:10:08,62 --> 00:10:11,12
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.

00:10:11,16 --> 00:10:15,43
So, you've been spying on me, and like your sister, Suellen

00:10:15,47 --> 00:10:17,73
you'll tell your mother I was jumping again.

00:10:17,77 --> 00:10:21,15
Pa, you know I'm no tattletale like Suellen, but it does seem to me

00:10:21,19 --> 00:10:24,03
after you broke your knee last year jumping that same fence

00:10:24,07 --> 00:10:28,65
I'll not have me own daughter tellin' me what I shall jump and not jump.

00:10:28,70 --> 00:10:30,32
It's my own neck, so it is.

00:10:30,36 --> 00:10:34,24
All right, Pa, you jump what you please. How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?

00:10:34,28 --> 00:10:35,33
The Wilkeses?

00:10:35,37 --> 00:10:39,37
Just as you'd expect with the barbecue tomorrow and talking nothing but war.

00:10:39,58 --> 00:10:42,33
Oh, bother the war. Was there anyone else there?

00:10:42,38 --> 00:10:45,71
Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton, from Atlanta and her brother, Charles.

00:10:45,75 --> 00:10:47,21
Melanie Hamilton.

00:10:47,26 --> 00:10:49,43
She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny. I hate her.

00:10:49,47 --> 00:10:51,06
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

00:10:51,09 --> 00:10:54,18
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.

00:10:54,68 --> 00:10:57,06
What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie?

00:10:58,39 --> 00:11:00,52
It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.

00:11:00,56 --> 00:11:03,81
Has he been trifling with you? Has he asked you to marry him?

00:11:03,86 --> 00:11:05,32
No. No, nor will he.

00:11:05,36 --> 00:11:09,24
I have it in strictest confidence from John Wilkes this afternoon

00:11:09,27 --> 00:11:11,13
Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.

00:11:11,17 --> 00:11:12,99
It will be announced tomorrow night at the ball.

00:11:13,57 --> 00:11:15,24
I don't believe it.

00:11:15,28 --> 00:11:17,37
Here. Here. Where are you off to?

00:11:17,66 --> 00:11:18,58
Scarlett.

00:11:19,58 --> 00:11:21,37
What are you about?

00:11:21,79 --> 00:11:24,63
Have you made a spectacle of yourseIf running after a man

00:11:24,67 --> 00:11:27,92
who's not in love with you when you might have any man in the county?

00:11:27,96 --> 00:11:31,43
I haven't been running after him. It's just a surprise, that's all.

00:11:31,47 --> 00:11:34,22
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.

00:11:34,26 --> 00:11:37,85
If Ashley wanted to marry you, it would be with misgivings I'd say yes.

00:11:37,89 --> 00:11:41,44
I want my girl to be happy. You'd not be happy with him.

00:11:41,48 --> 00:11:42,94
I would, I would.

00:11:42,98 --> 00:11:44,73
What difference does it make who you marry

00:11:44,77 --> 00:11:47,32
so long as he's a Southerner and thinks like you?

00:11:47,36 --> 00:11:49,82
And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.

00:11:49,86 --> 00:11:52,32
I don't want Tara. Plantations don't mean anything when

00:11:52,36 --> 00:11:57,12
You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that land doesn't mean anything to you?

00:11:57,16 --> 00:11:59,83
Why, land is the only thing in the world worth working for

00:11:59,87 --> 00:12:03,75
worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts.

00:12:03,79 --> 00:12:08,10
Oh, Pa, you talk like an lrishman. It's proud I am that I'm lrish.

00:12:08,13 --> 00:12:11,05
And don't you be forgetting, Missy, that you're haIf lrish too.

00:12:11,08 --> 00:12:13,43
And to anyone with a drop of lrish blood in them

00:12:13,47 --> 00:12:15,73
why, the land they live on is like their mother.

00:12:15,76 --> 00:12:21,35
Oh, but you're just a child. It'll come to you, this love of the land.

00:12:21,38 --> 00:12:24,57
There's no getting away from it if you're lrish.

00:12:47,67 --> 00:12:48,84
Yonder she comes.

00:12:48,88 --> 00:12:51,64
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, your ma's home.

00:12:51,67 --> 00:12:54,63
Actin' like a wet nurse to them low-down, poor white trash

00:12:54,68 --> 00:12:58,22
instead of bein' here eatin' her supper. Cookie, stir up the fire.

00:12:58,26 --> 00:13:02,01
Miss Ellen's got no business wearin' herseIf out.

00:13:02,04 --> 00:13:04,14
Take the lamp out on the porch. Wearin' herseIf out.

00:13:04,17 --> 00:13:06,23
Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.

00:13:06,27 --> 00:13:08,31
Wearin' herseIf out waitin' on the poor white trash.

00:13:08,36 --> 00:13:09,49
Shut up, dogs. Barkin' in the house like that.

00:13:09,53 --> 00:13:13,24
Get up from there. Don't you hear that Miss Ellen's comin'?

00:13:13,28 --> 00:13:15,57
Get out there and get her medicine chest.

00:13:16,07 --> 00:13:18,32
We was gettin' worried about you, Miss Ellen.

00:13:18,37 --> 00:13:21,08
Mist' Gerald... All right, Pork. I'm home.

00:13:21,49 --> 00:13:25,12
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing the creek bottom today.

00:13:25,16 --> 00:13:27,83
What do you want me to start on tomorrow?

00:13:27,88 --> 00:13:31,75
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come from Emmy Slattery's bedside.

00:13:31,80 --> 00:13:33,42
Your child has been born.

00:13:33,46 --> 00:13:36,72
My child, ma'am? I'm sure I don't understand.

00:13:36,76 --> 00:13:39,18
Has been born and, mercifully, has died.

00:13:39,97 --> 00:13:41,68
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.

00:13:45,18 --> 00:13:47,73
I'll fix your supper for you myself, and you eats it.

00:13:47,76 --> 00:13:48,73
After prayers, Mammy.

00:13:48,77 --> 00:13:49,86
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:51,07 --> 00:13:52,36
Mr. O'Hara.

00:13:52,98 --> 00:13:54,65
You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

00:13:54,69 --> 00:13:58,74
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara? He's the best overseer in the county.

00:13:58,77 --> 00:14:00,45
He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.

00:14:00,49 --> 00:14:01,58
But.

00:14:02,99 --> 00:14:04,08
No. Yes.

00:14:05,50 --> 00:14:08,25
The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl.

00:14:08,29 --> 00:14:10,33
We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.

00:14:10,38 --> 00:14:11,59
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

00:14:17,26 --> 00:14:18,93
I want to wear Scarlett's green dress.

00:14:18,97 --> 00:14:21,72
I don't like your tone, Suellen. Your pink gown is lovely.

00:14:21,76 --> 00:14:25,83
Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow? But you may wear my garnets with it.

00:14:25,86 --> 00:14:28,14
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow night?

00:14:28,19 --> 00:14:29,85
Scarlett

00:14:29,90 --> 00:14:32,48
you look tired, my dear. I'm worried about you.

00:14:33,36 --> 00:14:34,73
I'm all right, Mother.

00:14:34,78 --> 00:14:37,32
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow night?

00:14:37,36 --> 00:14:38,74
I'm 13 now.

00:14:38,78 --> 00:14:41,12
You may go to the barbecue and stay up through supper.

00:14:41,16 --> 00:14:43,45
I didn't want to wear your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy.

00:14:43,49 --> 00:14:44,45
Oh, hush up.

00:14:44,49 --> 00:14:45,99
Prayers, girls.

00:14:52,67 --> 00:14:57,67
And to all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word and deed

00:14:57,97 --> 00:14:59,43
through my fault.

00:14:59,47 --> 00:15:02,68
Through my fault, through my most grievous fault.

00:15:03,10 --> 00:15:06,52
Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary, ever Virgin

00:15:06,56 --> 00:15:09,02
Blessed Michael, the Archangel

00:15:09,06 --> 00:15:10,94
Blessed John the Baptist

00:15:10,98 --> 00:15:13,27
the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul

00:15:13,86 --> 00:15:17,03
and all the saints to pray to the Lord, our God, for me.

00:15:17,07 --> 00:15:19,07
But Ashley doesn't know I love him.

00:15:20,28 --> 00:15:23,99
I'll tell him that I love him and then he can't marry her.

00:15:25,16 --> 00:15:28,33
May the Almighty, and most merciful Lord

00:15:28,37 --> 00:15:30,29
grant us pardon, absolution

00:15:30,66 --> 00:15:32,46
and remission of our sins. Amen.

00:15:34,14 --> 00:15:38,35
Just hold on and suck in.

00:15:38,38 --> 00:15:40,84
Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.

00:15:40,88 --> 00:15:43,34
You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.

00:15:43,39 --> 00:15:45,14
Oh, yes, ma'am, you is.

00:15:45,18 --> 00:15:47,39
You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.

00:15:48,39 --> 00:15:50,48
No, I'm not.

00:15:53,19 --> 00:15:55,23
Put on the dress, because we're late already.

00:15:55,27 --> 00:15:57,23
What's my lamb gonna wear? That.

00:15:57,27 --> 00:16:01,62
No you ain't. You can't show your bosom before three o'clock.

00:16:01,65 --> 00:16:03,32
I'm gonna speak to your ma about you.

00:16:03,36 --> 00:16:06,78
If you say one word to Mother, I won't eat a bite.

00:16:10,87 --> 00:16:11,96
Well.

00:16:17,14 --> 00:16:21,93
Keep your shawl on. I ain't aimin' for you to get all freckled

00:16:21,97 --> 00:16:26,80
after the buttermilk I done put on you all this winter, bleachin' them freckles.

00:16:32,27 --> 00:16:36,23
Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on and be good, and eat just a little, honey.

00:16:36,27 --> 00:16:37,40
No.

00:16:37,69 --> 00:16:41,49
I'm going to have a good time today and do my eating at the barbecue.

00:16:41,78 --> 00:16:44,53
If you don't care what folks says about this family, I does.

00:16:44,57 --> 00:16:47,35
I has told you and told you that you can always tell a lady

00:16:47,38 --> 00:16:50,12
by the way she eats with folks. Like a bird.

00:16:50,16 --> 00:16:52,25
I ain't aimin' for you to go after Mr. Wilkes

00:16:52,29 --> 00:16:54,54
and eat like a field hand and gobble like a hog.

00:16:54,58 --> 00:16:55,87
Fiddle-dee-dee.

00:16:56,38 --> 00:16:59,84
Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl with a healthy appetite.

00:16:59,88 --> 00:17:02,72
What gentlemen says and what they thinks is two different things.

00:17:02,76 --> 00:17:06,95
And I ain't noticed Mist' Ashley askin' to marry you.

00:17:21,98 --> 00:17:26,81
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need of havin' it come right back up again.

00:17:28,37 --> 00:17:31,54
Why does a girl have to be so silly to catch a husband?

00:17:31,58 --> 00:17:36,83
Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time I count ten, we'll be goin' without you.

00:17:36,87 --> 00:17:38,04
I'm coming, Pa.

00:17:38,08 --> 00:17:39,13
One

00:17:39,17 --> 00:17:41,43
two, three

00:17:41,46 --> 00:17:43,59
four, five, six

00:17:44,67 --> 00:17:45,92
Oh, dear.

00:17:45,97 --> 00:17:49,76
My stays are so tight I know I'll never get through the day without belching.

00:18:13,50 --> 00:18:14,54
How are you.

00:18:14,58 --> 00:18:18,54
Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day you'll be having for the barbecue.

00:18:18,58 --> 00:18:21,54
So it seems, Gerald. But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

00:18:21,59 --> 00:18:23,80
She's after settling accounts with the overseer.

00:18:23,83 --> 00:18:25,42
But she'll be along for the ball tonight.

00:18:25,46 --> 00:18:27,34
Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.

00:18:27,38 --> 00:18:29,43
Thank you kindly, lndia.

00:18:29,47 --> 00:18:32,18
Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.

00:18:32,76 --> 00:18:35,72
India, here are the O'Hara girls. We must greet them.

00:18:35,77 --> 00:18:39,47
I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw the way she throws herseIf at Ashley.

00:18:39,50 --> 00:18:41,23
Now, that's your brother's business.

00:18:41,27 --> 00:18:43,82
You must remember your duties as hostess.

00:18:43,86 --> 00:18:45,19
Good morning, girls.

00:18:46,78 --> 00:18:48,36
Good morning, Scarlett.

00:18:49,07 --> 00:18:51,53
Why, lndia Wilkes, what a lovely dress.

00:18:51,57 --> 00:18:54,87
Perfectly lovely, darling. I just can't take my eyes off it.

00:18:56,79 --> 00:18:57,83
Scarlett, honey.

00:18:57,87 --> 00:18:59,92
You're looking mighty fine this morning.

00:18:59,96 --> 00:19:02,29
Good morning, Miss Scarlett. Good morning.

00:19:02,96 --> 00:19:04,92
It's a pleasure to see you. Good morning.

00:19:04,96 --> 00:19:06,17
Howdy, Miss Scarlett.

00:19:07,88 --> 00:19:08,88
Ashley.

00:19:11,26 --> 00:19:12,89
Scarlett, my dear.

00:19:14,39 --> 00:19:16,52
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:19:16,56 --> 00:19:18,73
I've got something I must tell you.

00:19:18,77 --> 00:19:22,44
Can't we go some place where it's quiet? Yes, I'd like to, but l

00:19:22,48 --> 00:19:24,44
I have something to tell you too.

00:19:24,48 --> 00:19:27,28
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.

00:19:28,07 --> 00:19:30,53
But come say hello to my cousin, Melanie, first.

00:19:30,57 --> 00:19:32,16
Oh, do we have to?

00:19:32,49 --> 00:19:35,45
She's been looking forward to seeing you again.

00:19:35,49 --> 00:19:36,58
Melanie.

00:19:37,66 --> 00:19:39,16
Here's Scarlett.

00:19:39,66 --> 00:19:40,66
Scarlett.

00:19:42,17 --> 00:19:43,92
I'm so glad to see you again.

00:19:43,96 --> 00:19:47,13
Melanie Hamilton. What a surprise to run into you here.

00:19:47,17 --> 00:19:49,34
I hope you'll stay with us a few days at least.

00:19:49,38 --> 00:19:53,05
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends, Scarlett.

00:19:53,09 --> 00:19:54,55
I do so want us to be.

00:19:54,60 --> 00:19:56,51
We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?

00:19:56,56 --> 00:19:59,02
We'll just have to make the biggest fuss over her, won't we?

00:19:59,06 --> 00:20:02,14
If there's anybody knows how to give a girl a good time, it's Ashley.

00:20:02,19 --> 00:20:05,78
Though I expect our good times will seem silly to you because you're so serious.

00:20:05,81 --> 00:20:08,72
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

00:20:08,75 --> 00:20:09,94
I've always admired you so.

00:20:09,99 --> 00:20:11,65
I wish I could be more like you.

00:20:11,70 --> 00:20:14,62
You mustn't flatter me, Melanie, and say things you don't mean.

00:20:14,66 --> 00:20:19,02
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

00:20:19,05 --> 00:20:20,83
Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?

00:20:20,87 --> 00:20:23,29
Ashley never means a word he says to any girl.

00:20:23,87 --> 00:20:27,34
Oh, why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you.

00:20:27,38 --> 00:20:29,05
But, oh, Miss O'Hara, l.

00:20:29,09 --> 00:20:31,34
Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here

00:20:31,38 --> 00:20:33,88
just to break my poor, simple, country-girl's heart?

00:20:34,18 --> 00:20:36,22
She never even noticed Charles before.

00:20:36,26 --> 00:20:38,95
Because he's your beau, she's after him like a hornet.

00:20:38,98 --> 00:20:41,15
Charles Hamilton, I want to eat barbecue with you.

00:20:41,18 --> 00:20:45,14
Mind you, don't go philandering with any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.

00:20:45,17 --> 00:20:46,36
I won't, Miss O'Hara.

00:20:46,86 --> 00:20:48,07
I couldn't.

00:20:48,57 --> 00:20:51,32
I do declare, Frank Kennedy, if you don't look dashing

00:20:51,36 --> 00:20:52,74
with that new set of whiskers.

00:20:52,78 --> 00:20:55,28
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

00:20:55,66 --> 00:20:58,53
Charles and Rafe asked me to eat barbecue with them

00:20:58,58 --> 00:21:00,83
but I told them I couldn't because I promised you.

00:21:00,87 --> 00:21:04,46
You needn't be so amused. Look at her. She's after your beau now.

00:21:04,87 --> 00:21:07,67
Oh, that's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett.

00:21:08,17 --> 00:21:10,17
I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.

00:21:10,46 --> 00:21:13,13
What's your sister so mad about? You sparkin' her beau?

00:21:13,17 --> 00:21:16,34
As if I couldn't get a better beau than that old maid in britches.

00:21:16,39 --> 00:21:19,72
Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome old things, you. No, you're not.

00:21:19,76 --> 00:21:21,35
I won't say that. I'm mad at you.

00:21:21,39 --> 00:21:22,43
What have we done?

00:21:22,47 --> 00:21:24,73
You haven't been near me all day. I wore this old dress

00:21:24,77 --> 00:21:26,15
'cause I thought you liked it.

00:21:26,19 --> 00:21:28,23
I was counting on eating barbecue with you two.

00:21:28,27 --> 00:21:30,65
Well, you are, Scarlett. Of course, you are.

00:21:30,69 --> 00:21:34,57
Oh, I never can make up my mind which of you two is the handsomer.

00:21:34,86 --> 00:21:38,07
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out.

00:21:40,75 --> 00:21:41,91
I'm sorry

00:21:43,66 --> 00:21:45,54
Cathleen, who's that?

00:21:45,58 --> 00:21:46,54
Who?

00:21:46,58 --> 00:21:48,58
That man looking at us and smiling.

00:21:48,62 --> 00:21:50,27
The nasty, dark one.

00:21:50,29 --> 00:21:54,78
My dear, don't you know? That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.

00:21:54,81 --> 00:21:56,47
He has the most terrible reputation.

00:22:01,39 --> 00:22:04,64
He looks as if, as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy.

00:22:04,68 --> 00:22:05,77
Scarlett.

00:22:06,06 --> 00:22:07,90
Why, my dear, he isn't received.

00:22:08,27 --> 00:22:09,81
He spends a lot of time up North

00:22:09,86 --> 00:22:12,44
because his folks in Charleston won't even speak to him.

00:22:12,48 --> 00:22:14,82
He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast.

00:22:14,86 --> 00:22:18,24
And then there's that business about that girl he wouldn't marry.

00:22:18,28 --> 00:22:19,45
Tell, tell.

00:22:19,49 --> 00:22:23,49
Well, he took her out buggy riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon.

00:22:23,53 --> 00:22:26,84
And then he refused to marry her.

00:22:30,38 --> 00:22:32,96
No, but she was ruined just the same.

00:22:38,68 --> 00:22:40,34
Ashley.

00:22:40,39 --> 00:22:41,55
Happy?

00:22:41,60 --> 00:22:42,60
So happy.

00:22:44,26 --> 00:22:46,48
You seem to belong here

00:22:46,89 --> 00:22:49,27
as if it had all been imagined for you.

00:22:50,77 --> 00:22:53,15
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love.

00:22:53,19 --> 00:22:54,82
You love Twelve Oaks as I do.

00:22:54,86 --> 00:22:56,34
Yes, Ashley.

00:22:56,37 --> 00:22:57,82
I love it as

00:22:57,86 --> 00:22:59,49
as more than a house.

00:23:00,07 --> 00:23:04,08
It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful.

00:23:04,16 --> 00:23:06,37
It's so unaware that it may not last

00:23:07,16 --> 00:23:08,25
forever.

00:23:08,29 --> 00:23:11,63
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes, aren't you?

00:23:11,67 --> 00:23:14,29
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

00:23:14,88 --> 00:23:17,38
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

00:23:18,38 --> 00:23:19,68
Whatever comes

00:23:20,38 --> 00:23:23,10
I'll love you, just as I do now

00:23:23,89 --> 00:23:24,97
until I die.

00:23:30,06 --> 00:23:31,85
Isn't this better than sitting at a table?

00:23:31,90 --> 00:23:34,36
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table.

00:23:35,77 --> 00:23:36,82
I'll go get her dessert.

00:23:36,86 --> 00:23:40,00
Here, she said me. Allow me, Miss O'Hara.

00:23:41,57 --> 00:23:42,78
I think.

00:23:46,08 --> 00:23:48,87
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

00:23:50,46 --> 00:23:52,17
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara.

00:23:52,67 --> 00:23:53,88
Thank you.

00:23:54,17 --> 00:23:55,42
Go get it.

00:23:55,46 --> 00:23:58,10
Isn't he the luckiest?

00:24:04,89 --> 00:24:05,89
Miss O'Hara

00:24:06,09 --> 00:24:08,69
I love you.

00:24:08,72 --> 00:24:12,48
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.

00:24:15,86 --> 00:24:18,82
Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.

00:24:18,86 --> 00:24:21,32
Well-brought-up young ladies take naps at parties.

00:24:21,36 --> 00:24:25,32
And it's high time you started behavin' and actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

00:24:25,37 --> 00:24:29,02
When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice any Yankee girIs taking naps.

00:24:29,05 --> 00:24:32,83
No, and you ain't gonna see no Yankee girIs at the ball tonight neither.

00:24:32,87 --> 00:24:34,54
How was Ashley today, Scarlett?

00:24:34,58 --> 00:24:37,25
He didn't seem to be paying much attention to you.

00:24:37,29 --> 00:24:38,96
You mind your own business.

00:24:39,30 --> 00:24:41,42
You'll be lucky not to lose ol' whisker-face Kennedy.

00:24:41,47 --> 00:24:42,85
You've liked Ashley for months.

00:24:42,88 --> 00:24:45,60
His engagement's gonna be announced tonight. Pa said so this morning.

00:24:45,63 --> 00:24:46,60
That's all you know.

00:24:47,60 --> 00:24:50,52
Miss Scarlett. Miss Suellen. You all behave yourselves.

00:24:50,56 --> 00:24:52,23
Actin' like poor, white-trash children.

00:24:52,27 --> 00:24:55,23
If you's old enough to go to parties, you's old enough to act like ladies.

00:24:55,27 --> 00:24:56,36
Who cares.

00:25:47,78 --> 00:25:50,33
We've borne enough insults from the meddling Yankees.

00:25:50,37 --> 00:25:53,12
It's time we made them understand we'll keep our slaves

00:25:53,16 --> 00:25:54,62
with or without their approval.

00:25:54,66 --> 00:25:57,54
'Twas the sovereign right of the state of Georgia to secede from the Union.

00:25:57,58 --> 00:25:58,54
That's right.

00:25:58,58 --> 00:26:00,90
The South must assert herseIf by force of arms.

00:26:00,94 --> 00:26:05,92
After we've fired on the Yankee rascaIs at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.

00:26:05,96 --> 00:26:08,64
There's no other way. Fight. That's right. Fight.

00:26:08,67 --> 00:26:10,14
Let the Yankees ask for peace.

00:26:10,18 --> 00:26:14,40
The situation is very simple. The Yankees can't fight and we can.

00:26:14,89 --> 00:26:16,35
There won't even be a battle.

00:26:16,39 --> 00:26:18,02
They'll just turn and run every time.

00:26:18,06 --> 00:26:19,94
One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.

00:26:19,98 --> 00:26:21,94
We'll finish them in one battle.

00:26:21,98 --> 00:26:23,95
Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble.

00:26:23,98 --> 00:26:26,32
Yes, gentlemen always can fight better than rabble.

00:26:26,36 --> 00:26:28,74
What does the captain of our troop say?

00:26:28,78 --> 00:26:33,13
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights I go with her.

00:26:33,16 --> 00:26:36,54
But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees will let us leave the Union in peace.

00:26:36,58 --> 00:26:38,12
But, Ashley.... But, Ashley, they've insulted us.

00:26:38,17 --> 00:26:40,13
You can't mean you don't want war.

00:26:40,17 --> 00:26:43,75
Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars.

00:26:43,80 --> 00:26:47,76
And when the wars were over no one ever knew what they were about.

00:26:47,88 --> 00:26:49,34
If it wasn't that I knew you

00:26:49,39 --> 00:26:53,57
Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear.

00:26:53,60 --> 00:26:55,56
Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?

00:26:56,18 --> 00:26:58,73
I think it's hard winning a war with words, gentlemen.

00:26:58,77 --> 00:27:00,23
What do you mean, sir?

00:27:00,27 --> 00:27:03,23
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South.

00:27:03,27 --> 00:27:05,23
What difference does that make to a gentleman?

00:27:05,28 --> 00:27:08,53
It'll make a great deal of difference to a great many gentlemen, sir.

00:27:08,57 --> 00:27:11,32
Are you hinting, Mr. Butler, that the Yankees can lick us?

00:27:11,37 --> 00:27:12,62
No, I'm not hinting.

00:27:12,66 --> 00:27:15,83
I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees are better equipped than we.

00:27:15,87 --> 00:27:18,12
They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines

00:27:18,16 --> 00:27:21,04
and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us to death.

00:27:21,08 --> 00:27:24,63
All we've got is cotton and slaves and arrogance.

00:27:24,67 --> 00:27:28,22
That's Yankee treachery. Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk.

00:27:28,26 --> 00:27:29,84
I'm sorry if the truth offends you.

00:27:29,88 --> 00:27:32,34
Apologies aren't enough, sir.

00:27:32,39 --> 00:27:35,22
I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler

00:27:35,26 --> 00:27:39,27
and you aren't received by any decent family in Charleston, not even your own.

00:27:43,86 --> 00:27:46,86
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.

00:27:48,69 --> 00:27:51,45
Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about and look over your place.

00:27:51,49 --> 00:27:54,78
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars and

00:27:55,28 --> 00:27:56,66
dreams of victory.

00:28:03,67 --> 00:28:07,25
That's just about what you could expect from somebody like Rhett Butler.

00:28:07,30 --> 00:28:09,13
You did everything but call him out.

00:28:09,17 --> 00:28:10,34
He refused to fight.

00:28:10,38 --> 00:28:13,22
Not quite that, Charles. He refused to take advantage of you.

00:28:13,26 --> 00:28:14,43
Take advantage of me?

00:28:14,47 --> 00:28:15,93
He's one of the best shots in the country

00:28:15,97 --> 00:28:17,65
as he's proved a number of times

00:28:17,68 --> 00:28:19,64
against steadier hands and cooler heads than yours.

00:28:19,68 --> 00:28:20,93
I'll show him. Now, please.

00:28:20,98 --> 00:28:23,52
Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.

00:28:23,56 --> 00:28:26,48
You may be needed for more important fighting, Charles.

00:28:26,77 --> 00:28:29,23
Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Butler is our guest.

00:28:29,28 --> 00:28:31,36
I think I'll just show him around.

00:28:44,08 --> 00:28:45,17
Ashley.

00:28:52,76 --> 00:28:54,26
Ashley.

00:28:54,89 --> 00:28:55,97
Scarlett.

00:28:57,76 --> 00:28:59,97
Who're you hiding from in here?

00:29:05,19 --> 00:29:06,77
What are you up to?

00:29:08,86 --> 00:29:11,86
Well, why aren't you upstairs resting with the other girls?

00:29:13,20 --> 00:29:16,41
What is this, Scarlett? A secret?

00:29:16,44 --> 00:29:18,68
Oh, Ashley, Ashley

00:29:18,71 --> 00:29:19,87
I love you.

00:29:20,16 --> 00:29:21,33
Scarlett.

00:29:21,37 --> 00:29:22,79
I love you, I do.

00:29:25,17 --> 00:29:28,84
Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered every other man's heart today?

00:29:28,88 --> 00:29:31,34
You've always had mine. You cut your teeth on it.

00:29:31,38 --> 00:29:33,05
Oh, don't tease me now.

00:29:33,09 --> 00:29:35,84
Have I your heart, my darling? I love you, I love you.

00:29:35,88 --> 00:29:39,64
You mustn't say such things. You'll hate me for hearing them.

00:29:39,68 --> 00:29:43,68
Oh, I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me.

00:29:44,27 --> 00:29:46,40
Oh, you do care, don't you?

00:29:47,56 --> 00:29:48,69
Yes

00:29:49,27 --> 00:29:50,36
I care.

00:29:51,86 --> 00:29:54,78
Oh, can't we go away and forget we ever said these things?

00:29:56,57 --> 00:29:58,16
But how can we do that?

00:29:58,57 --> 00:30:00,83
Don't you want to marry me?

00:30:00,87 --> 00:30:02,63
I'm going to marry Melanie.

00:30:02,66 --> 00:30:05,12
But you can't. Not if you care for me.

00:30:05,16 --> 00:30:08,29
Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you?

00:30:09,17 --> 00:30:11,17
How can I make you understand?

00:30:12,09 --> 00:30:13,63
You're so young and unthinking.

00:30:13,67 --> 00:30:16,79
You don't know what marriage means.

00:30:16,82 --> 00:30:18,15
I know I love you, and I want to be your wife.

00:30:18,18 --> 00:30:19,22
You don't love Melanie.

00:30:19,26 --> 00:30:20,76
She's like me, Scarlett.

00:30:21,18 --> 00:30:23,89
She's part of my blood and we understand each other.

00:30:24,18 --> 00:30:26,23
But you love me.

00:30:26,27 --> 00:30:27,90
How could I help loving you?

00:30:27,94 --> 00:30:31,02
You have all the passion for life that I lack.

00:30:31,07 --> 00:30:33,65
That kind of love isn't enough for a successful marriage

00:30:33,69 --> 00:30:35,32
for two people as different as we are.

00:30:35,36 --> 00:30:38,57
Well, why don't you say it, you coward? You're afraid to marry me.

00:30:38,86 --> 00:30:40,95
You'd rather live with that fool who can't speak except

00:30:40,99 --> 00:30:44,99
to say yes and no and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.

00:30:45,02 --> 00:30:46,33
You mustn't say such things about Melanie.

00:30:46,37 --> 00:30:48,12
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?

00:30:48,17 --> 00:30:50,79
You led me on, you made me believe you wanted to marry me.

00:30:50,83 --> 00:30:53,42
Now, Scarlett, be fair. I never, at any time

00:30:53,46 --> 00:30:56,97
You did, it's true you did. I'll hate you till I die.

00:30:57,67 --> 00:31:00,97
I can't think of anything bad enough to call you.

00:31:27,87 --> 00:31:29,79
Has the war started?

00:31:30,37 --> 00:31:33,79
Sir, you should have made your presence known.

00:31:34,09 --> 00:31:36,42
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?

00:31:36,46 --> 00:31:38,63
That wouldn't have been very tactful, would it?

00:31:38,67 --> 00:31:41,26
But don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

00:31:41,89 --> 00:31:43,05
Sir, you are no gentleman.

00:31:43,10 --> 00:31:45,18
And you, Miss, are no lady.

00:31:45,68 --> 00:31:47,52
Don't think I hold that against you.

00:31:47,56 --> 00:31:49,35
Ladies have never held any charm for me.

00:31:49,39 --> 00:31:52,44
First you take a low, common advantage of me, then you insuIt me.

00:31:52,48 --> 00:31:54,95
I meant it as a compliment and I hope to see more of you

00:31:54,99 --> 00:31:59,20
when you're free of the spell of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.

00:31:59,23 --> 00:32:03,41
He doesn't strike me as haIf good enough for a girl of your, what was it?

00:32:03,44 --> 00:32:05,03
Your passion for living.

00:32:05,08 --> 00:32:07,66
How dare you. You aren't fit to wipe his boots.

00:32:08,34 --> 00:32:12,23
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life.

00:32:14,59 --> 00:32:18,59
She certainly made a fool of herseIf running after all the men at the barbecue.

00:32:18,67 --> 00:32:20,34
That's not fair, lndia.

00:32:20,38 --> 00:32:23,22
She's so attractive, the menjust naturally flock to her.

00:32:23,26 --> 00:32:25,55
Oh, Melanie, you're just too good to be true.

00:32:25,60 --> 00:32:27,43
Didn't you see her going after your brother, Charles?

00:32:27,47 --> 00:32:29,64
Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.

00:32:29,68 --> 00:32:31,36
Oh, you're wrong, lndia.

00:32:31,39 --> 00:32:34,52
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.

00:32:34,56 --> 00:32:38,23
Men may flirt with girIs like that but they don't marry them.

00:32:38,26 --> 00:32:40,47
I think you're being very mean to her.

00:32:48,37 --> 00:32:51,37
War. War's declared. War.

00:33:03,09 --> 00:33:04,84
Miss O'Hara.

00:33:07,60 --> 00:33:08,93
Miss O'Hara.

00:33:08,97 --> 00:33:12,23
Mr. LincoIn has called for soldiers, volunteers to fight against us.

00:33:12,27 --> 00:33:14,96
Don't you men ever think of anything important?

00:33:14,98 --> 00:33:17,44
But it's war and everybody's going off to enlist.

00:33:17,48 --> 00:33:19,02
They're going right away. I'm going too.

00:33:19,07 --> 00:33:20,07
Everybody?

00:33:24,36 --> 00:33:26,78
Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?

00:33:27,16 --> 00:33:28,68
To see us go, I mean.

00:33:28,72 --> 00:33:31,33
I'll cry into my pillow every night.

00:33:31,37 --> 00:33:33,54
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.

00:33:33,58 --> 00:33:38,13
You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest and the dearest.

00:33:38,17 --> 00:33:40,42
I know I couldn't hope that you could love me.

00:33:40,46 --> 00:33:43,92
I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.

00:33:43,97 --> 00:33:47,97
But if you could think of marrying me I'd do anything in the world for you.

00:33:48,01 --> 00:33:50,12
Just anything. I promise.

00:33:50,18 --> 00:33:51,43
What did you say?

00:33:51,47 --> 00:33:54,27
Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?

00:34:00,07 --> 00:34:02,07
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

00:34:02,69 --> 00:34:04,99
You will? You'll marry me. You'll wait for me?

00:34:05,36 --> 00:34:06,66
I don't think I'd want to wait.

00:34:06,70 --> 00:34:09,16
You mean you'll marry me before I go?

00:34:09,66 --> 00:34:11,62
Oh, Miss O'Hara.

00:34:11,66 --> 00:34:13,37
Scarlett.

00:34:15,08 --> 00:34:16,62
When may I speak to your father?

00:34:16,67 --> 00:34:17,75
The sooner the better.

00:34:17,79 --> 00:34:19,33
I'll go now. I can't wait.

00:34:19,38 --> 00:34:22,48
Will you excuse me, dear?

00:34:26,26 --> 00:34:28,14
Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.

00:34:28,18 --> 00:34:30,14
It'll be a week at least before they call on me.

00:34:30,18 --> 00:34:33,27
Only a week, and then they'll take you away from me.

00:35:02,57 --> 00:35:03,77
Melanie.

00:35:06,47 --> 00:35:09,14
Scarlett, I thought of you at our wedding yesterday

00:35:09,18 --> 00:35:13,54
and I hoped that yours would be as beautiful, and it was.

00:35:13,57 --> 00:35:14,29
Was it?

00:35:14,39 --> 00:35:16,77
Now we're really and truly sisters.

00:35:17,48 --> 00:35:18,98
Charles. Melanie.

00:35:26,86 --> 00:35:30,03
Don't cry, darling, the war will be over in a few weeks

00:35:30,07 --> 00:35:32,16
and I'll be coming back to you.

00:36:16,37 --> 00:36:17,66
Miss Scarlett.

00:36:18,37 --> 00:36:21,75
Well, I don't care. I'm too young to be a widow.

00:36:21,79 --> 00:36:23,08
Miss Scarlett.

00:36:24,88 --> 00:36:27,46
Why, I just go around scaring people in that thing.

00:36:28,59 --> 00:36:31,13
You ain't supposed to be around people. You's in mournin'.

00:36:31,18 --> 00:36:33,64
For what? I don't feel anything.

00:36:34,18 --> 00:36:36,76
Why should I have to pretend and pretend.

00:36:37,47 --> 00:36:38,97
What is it?

00:36:39,68 --> 00:36:42,64
Oh, baby.

00:36:43,19 --> 00:36:44,45
What is it?

00:36:44,48 --> 00:36:45,98
My life is over.

00:36:46,36 --> 00:36:49,60
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.

00:36:51,36 --> 00:36:52,74
Oh, Mother.

00:36:52,78 --> 00:36:57,77
I know you'll think I'm horrible, but I just can't bear going around in black.

00:36:57,80 --> 00:37:00,25
It's bad enough not being able to go to any parties

00:37:00,29 --> 00:37:01,83
but looking this way too.

00:37:01,87 --> 00:37:03,83
I don't think you're at all horrible.

00:37:03,87 --> 00:37:07,67
It's only natural to want to look young and be young when you are young.

00:37:08,30 --> 00:37:09,96
Oh, baby.

00:37:10,96 --> 00:37:12,93
How would you like to go visiting somewhere?

00:37:12,97 --> 00:37:14,22
Savannah perhaps?

00:37:14,26 --> 00:37:16,26
What would I do in Savannah?

00:37:16,60 --> 00:37:18,35
Well, Atlanta then.

00:37:18,39 --> 00:37:20,64
There's lots going on there.

00:37:20,68 --> 00:37:23,69
And you could stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.

00:37:24,56 --> 00:37:25,77
Melanie.

00:37:26,19 --> 00:37:27,27
Yes.

00:37:28,07 --> 00:37:29,32
Yes, I could, couldn't l?

00:37:29,36 --> 00:37:32,53
Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me, sweeter than anybody in the world.

00:37:32,57 --> 00:37:34,45
You'd like it, really?

00:37:34,49 --> 00:37:37,66
All right then. Now stop your crying and smile.

00:37:39,58 --> 00:37:41,16
You can take Prissy with you.

00:37:41,87 --> 00:37:44,08
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.

00:37:44,46 --> 00:37:46,38
I'll go write the necessary letters.

00:37:49,46 --> 00:37:50,46
Atlanta.

00:37:50,80 --> 00:37:54,13
Savannah would be better for you. You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.

00:37:54,17 --> 00:37:55,72
What trouble are you talking about?

00:37:55,76 --> 00:37:59,22
You know what trouble I's talkin' about. I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.

00:37:59,26 --> 00:38:01,22
He'll be comin' to Atlanta when he gets his leave

00:38:01,27 --> 00:38:03,85
and you're sittin' there waitin' for him just like a spider.

00:38:03,89 --> 00:38:07,40
He belongs to Miss Melanie... You go pack my things like Mother said.

00:38:28,38 --> 00:38:31,34
They're all whispering, and I just know it's about her.

00:38:31,38 --> 00:38:33,26
What's it matter what they say, Aunt Pittypat?

00:38:33,30 --> 00:38:38,05
But Scarlett is living under my roof so they all think I'm responsible for her

00:38:38,09 --> 00:38:41,93
and for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering.

00:38:41,97 --> 00:38:44,64
Every time I think of it I feel faint.

00:38:44,68 --> 00:38:48,94
Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the cause.

00:38:48,98 --> 00:38:52,15
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice.

00:38:52,19 --> 00:38:53,94
Anyone would think, to hear you talk

00:38:53,98 --> 00:38:57,54
that she came here to dance instead of to sell things.

00:39:09,79 --> 00:39:11,63
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:39:11,67 --> 00:39:14,30
I have important news. Glorious news.

00:39:14,67 --> 00:39:17,76
Another triumph for our magnificent men in arms.

00:39:18,47 --> 00:39:21,72
General Lee has completely whipped the enemy.

00:39:21,76 --> 00:39:25,77
And swept the Yankee Army northward from Virginia.

00:39:34,98 --> 00:39:38,07
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.

00:39:38,57 --> 00:39:43,51
We have with us tonight that most daring of all blockade-runners

00:39:43,54 --> 00:39:46,63
whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns

00:39:46,66 --> 00:39:50,66
have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight.

00:39:50,67 --> 00:39:54,67
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that will-o' the-wisp of the bounding main.

00:39:54,71 --> 00:39:57,76
None other than our friend from Charleston

00:39:57,79 --> 00:40:00,01
Captain Rhett Butler.

00:40:19,83 --> 00:40:22,07
Permit me.

00:40:26,37 --> 00:40:29,50
Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure to see you again.

00:40:29,87 --> 00:40:31,92
I met you last at my husband's home.

00:40:31,96 --> 00:40:34,17
That's kind of you to remember, Mrs. Wilkes.

00:40:34,59 --> 00:40:37,25
Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?

00:40:37,30 --> 00:40:39,38
Yes. I, I think so.

00:40:39,67 --> 00:40:42,34
Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton. It was in the library.

00:40:42,38 --> 00:40:44,26
You had broken something.

00:40:45,39 --> 00:40:47,85
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.

00:40:47,89 --> 00:40:51,69
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behaIf of our noble cause.

00:40:51,98 --> 00:40:54,02
We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.

00:40:54,06 --> 00:40:55,40
Wait.

00:40:55,98 --> 00:40:58,36
On behaIf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton.

00:40:59,36 --> 00:41:00,78
Thank you, Captain Butler.

00:41:01,07 --> 00:41:02,70
Just a moment, please.

00:41:05,78 --> 00:41:07,83
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.

00:41:07,87 --> 00:41:11,16
It may help my husband more, off my finger.

00:41:11,87 --> 00:41:12,96
Thank you.

00:41:15,38 --> 00:41:17,96
That's a very beautiful thing to do, Mrs. Wilkes.

00:41:18,46 --> 00:41:19,59
Here.

00:41:19,88 --> 00:41:22,38
You can have mine, too, for the cause.

00:41:24,68 --> 00:41:28,60
And you, Mrs. Hamilton. I know just how much that means to you.

00:41:28,89 --> 00:41:30,22
Melanie. Yes, Dr. Meade.

00:41:30,27 --> 00:41:32,64
I need your approval, as a member of the Committee

00:41:32,69 --> 00:41:35,27
for something we want to do that's rather shocking.

00:41:35,98 --> 00:41:37,86
Will you excuse us, please?

00:41:39,78 --> 00:41:43,36
I'll say one thing, the war makes the most peculiar widows.

00:41:43,70 --> 00:41:44,95
I wish you'd go away.

00:41:44,99 --> 00:41:48,08
If you had any raising you'd know I never want to see you again.

00:41:50,99 --> 00:41:52,54
Now, why be silly?

00:41:52,58 --> 00:41:56,80
You've no reason for hating me. I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.

00:41:58,46 --> 00:42:02,13
I guess I'd be very unpatriotic to hate one of the great heroes of the war.

00:42:02,17 --> 00:42:06,16
I do declare I was surprised to see you turn out to be such a noble character.

00:42:06,19 --> 00:42:09,43
I can't bear to take advantage of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.

00:42:09,47 --> 00:42:11,56
I'm neither noble nor heroic.

00:42:11,89 --> 00:42:13,14
But you are a blockade-runner.

00:42:13,18 --> 00:42:15,27
For profit, and profit only.

00:42:15,69 --> 00:42:17,73
Are you telling me you don't believe in the cause?

00:42:17,77 --> 00:42:20,19
I believe in Rhett Butler. He's the only cause I know.

00:42:20,48 --> 00:42:22,28
The rest doesn't mean much to me.

00:42:25,36 --> 00:42:27,45
And now, ladies and gentlemen

00:42:27,49 --> 00:42:30,40
I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital.

00:42:31,09 --> 00:42:36,17
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening reel with the lady of your choice

00:42:36,20 --> 00:42:38,38
you must bid for her.

00:42:39,88 --> 00:42:42,92
Caroline Meade, how can you permit your husband to conduct this

00:42:42,96 --> 00:42:44,64
this slave auction?

00:42:44,67 --> 00:42:47,26
Dolly Merriwether, how dare you criticize me.

00:42:47,68 --> 00:42:49,35
Melanie Wilkes told the doctor

00:42:49,39 --> 00:42:52,22
that if it's for the benefit of the cause, it's quite all right.

00:42:52,26 --> 00:42:53,52
She did.

00:42:53,56 --> 00:42:56,56
Oh dear, oh dear. Where are my smelling salts?

00:42:56,98 --> 00:42:58,23
I think I shall faint.

00:42:58,27 --> 00:43:00,73
Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.

00:43:00,77 --> 00:43:03,36
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.

00:43:04,69 --> 00:43:07,49
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids? Make your offers.

00:43:08,36 --> 00:43:10,07
Don't be bashful, gentlemen.

00:43:10,87 --> 00:43:14,83
Twenty dollars, $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.

00:43:14,87 --> 00:43:17,24
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.

00:43:17,27 --> 00:43:19,33
Only $25 to give your

00:43:19,38 --> 00:43:21,46
One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.

00:43:22,09 --> 00:43:23,34
For what lady, sir?

00:43:23,38 --> 00:43:25,30
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

00:43:28,18 --> 00:43:29,26
For whom, sir?

00:43:29,68 --> 00:43:31,43
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

00:43:31,47 --> 00:43:33,72
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning, Captain Butler

00:43:33,76 --> 00:43:36,52
but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to

00:43:36,56 --> 00:43:40,06
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

00:43:40,77 --> 00:43:43,23
She will not consider it, sir.

00:43:43,27 --> 00:43:44,57
Oh yes, I will.

00:43:56,87 --> 00:44:00,08
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.

00:44:01,17 --> 00:44:03,25
We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.

00:44:03,29 --> 00:44:04,96
It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?

00:44:05,30 --> 00:44:06,42
It's worse.

00:44:06,46 --> 00:44:08,42
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.

00:44:08,47 --> 00:44:10,22
I don't care what you expect or what they think.

00:44:10,26 --> 00:44:11,84
I'm going to dance and dance.

00:44:11,89 --> 00:44:14,89
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe LincoIn himself.

00:44:46,80 --> 00:44:49,42
Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever.

00:44:49,47 --> 00:44:51,63
With enough courage, you can do without a reputation.

00:44:51,68 --> 00:44:53,76
Oh, you do talk scandalous.

00:45:01,77 --> 00:45:04,23
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.

00:45:04,27 --> 00:45:08,15
Don't start flirting with me. I'm not one of your plantation beaux.

00:45:08,19 --> 00:45:10,49
I want more than flirting from you.

00:45:10,99 --> 00:45:12,28
What do you want?

00:45:13,07 --> 00:45:18,04
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take that Southern belle simper off your face.

00:45:18,29 --> 00:45:19,83
Some day I want you to say to me

00:45:19,87 --> 00:45:22,66
the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes

00:45:23,08 --> 00:45:24,29
l love you.

00:45:24,79 --> 00:45:28,80
That's something you'll never hear from me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.

00:45:48,26 --> 00:45:51,50
How sweet, how kind.

00:45:51,86 --> 00:45:53,82
He is a thoughtful gentleman.

00:45:53,86 --> 00:46:00,17
Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice?

00:46:03,97 --> 00:46:07,63
Oh, the darling thing.

00:46:07,67 --> 00:46:09,10
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.

00:46:09,14 --> 00:46:12,92
You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me.

00:46:12,97 --> 00:46:16,49
Yes, I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning.

00:46:16,53 --> 00:46:20,02
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it.

00:46:20,05 --> 00:46:21,14
Oh, Rhett.

00:46:21,18 --> 00:46:27,02
It's my duty to our brave boys at the front to keep our girIs at home looking pretty.

00:46:27,05 --> 00:46:30,07
Oh, it's so long since I've had anything new.

00:46:40,28 --> 00:46:41,58
How do I look?

00:46:42,58 --> 00:46:44,16
Awful. Just awful.

00:46:44,87 --> 00:46:46,12
Why, what's the matter?

00:46:46,17 --> 00:46:47,42
This war has stopped being a joke

00:46:47,46 --> 00:46:50,67
when a girl like you doesn't know how to wear the latest fashion.

00:46:55,29 --> 00:46:58,59
Oh, Rhett, let me do it.

00:47:03,97 --> 00:47:07,06
But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.

00:47:07,98 --> 00:47:09,10
You will though.

00:47:09,14 --> 00:47:12,55
And another thing, those pantalettes.

00:47:12,57 --> 00:47:15,44
I don't know a woman in Paris that wears pantalettes anymore.

00:47:15,49 --> 00:47:16,70
Oh, what do they?

00:47:17,07 --> 00:47:19,24
You shouldn't talk about such things.

00:47:19,28 --> 00:47:20,32
You little hypocrite.

00:47:20,37 --> 00:47:23,04
You don't mind my knowing about them, just my talking.

00:47:23,08 --> 00:47:27,08
But, I really can't go on accepting gifts from you, though you are awfully kind.

00:47:27,11 --> 00:47:28,92
I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.

00:47:28,96 --> 00:47:32,75
I never give anything without expecting something in return. I always get paid.

00:47:32,80 --> 00:47:35,26
If you think I'll marry you to pay for the bonnet, I won't.

00:47:35,30 --> 00:47:38,02
Don't flatter yourself. I'm not a marrying man.

00:47:38,68 --> 00:47:41,26
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.

00:47:51,56 --> 00:47:53,36
Open your eyes and look at me.

00:47:54,78 --> 00:47:56,74
No, I don't think I will kiss you

00:47:56,78 --> 00:47:58,53
although you need kissing badly.

00:47:58,57 --> 00:47:59,95
That's what's wrong with you.

00:47:59,99 --> 00:48:02,95
You should be kissed and often. And by someone who knows how.

00:48:02,99 --> 00:48:05,62
Oh, and I suppose you think you're the proper person.

00:48:05,66 --> 00:48:08,50
I might be, if the right moment ever came.

00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:11,75
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint, Rhett Butler.

00:48:11,79 --> 00:48:14,46
And I don't know why I let you come and see me.

00:48:14,88 --> 00:48:16,55
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.

00:48:16,59 --> 00:48:18,84
Because I'm the only man over 16 and under 60

00:48:18,88 --> 00:48:20,55
who's around to show you a good time.

00:48:20,59 --> 00:48:23,85
But cheer up, the war can't last much longer.

00:48:23,89 --> 00:48:25,64
Oh really, Rhett? Why?

00:48:25,68 --> 00:48:28,85
There's a battle going on right now that ought to pretty well fix things

00:48:28,89 --> 00:48:29,94
one way or the other.

00:48:29,98 --> 00:48:32,06
Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?

00:48:33,77 --> 00:48:37,03
You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.

00:48:37,07 --> 00:48:38,53
Yes, I suppose he's in it.

00:48:38,57 --> 00:48:40,49
Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?

00:48:40,86 --> 00:48:43,99
Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.

00:50:04,95 --> 00:50:06,53
Here you is, Miss Melanie.

00:50:06,57 --> 00:50:09,28
They was fightin' for them so it just got tore in half.

00:50:09,58 --> 00:50:12,37
Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.

00:50:16,29 --> 00:50:19,67
Wellman, Wendell, White, Whitner, Wilkins

00:50:20,30 --> 00:50:21,55
Williams, Woolsey, Workman.

00:50:21,59 --> 00:50:23,88
Scarlett, you've passed him.

00:50:24,47 --> 00:50:26,34
Oh, he isn't there.

00:50:26,39 --> 00:50:27,34
He isn't there.

00:50:27,39 --> 00:50:29,64
Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.

00:50:29,68 --> 00:50:31,89
Oh, he's safe, he's safe.

00:50:33,68 --> 00:50:37,69
Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me.

00:50:45,20 --> 00:50:46,57
I must go to her.

00:50:48,16 --> 00:50:49,99
Don't, my dear, not here.

00:50:50,99 --> 00:50:52,29
Let's go home.

00:50:53,66 --> 00:50:55,33
Dr. Meade, not.

00:50:55,37 --> 00:50:58,08
Yes, our boy, Darcy.

00:50:58,88 --> 00:51:01,46
I was making these mittens for him.

00:51:02,17 --> 00:51:03,96
He won't need them now.

00:51:04,97 --> 00:51:08,93
Mother, I'm going to enlist. I'll show 'em. I'll kill all those Yankees.

00:51:08,97 --> 00:51:10,43
Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.

00:51:10,47 --> 00:51:12,72
Do you think it will help your mother to have you off getting shot too?

00:51:12,77 --> 00:51:14,56
I never heard of anything so silly.

00:51:17,27 --> 00:51:20,52
It's a black day, Scarlett. You haven't had bad news, have you?

00:51:20,56 --> 00:51:21,77
Ashley's safe.

00:51:22,07 --> 00:51:23,73
I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.

00:51:23,78 --> 00:51:25,32
But, Rhett, there are so many others.

00:51:25,36 --> 00:51:26,32
Many of your friends?

00:51:26,36 --> 00:51:30,03
Just about every family in the county. The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.

00:51:30,07 --> 00:51:33,87
Yes, look at them. All these poor tragic people.

00:51:34,66 --> 00:51:38,17
The South's sinking to its knees. It'll never rise again.

00:51:38,96 --> 00:51:40,38
The cause.

00:51:40,67 --> 00:51:43,92
The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.

00:51:43,96 --> 00:51:45,92
I never heard you talk like that before.

00:51:45,96 --> 00:51:49,97
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry. And that's what all this is, sheer waste.

00:51:52,39 --> 00:51:53,89
But don't you be downcast.

00:51:54,18 --> 00:51:57,56
Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home to the women who love him

00:51:57,98 --> 00:51:59,40
both of them.

00:52:36,10 --> 00:52:37,56
Oh, you're here.

00:52:41,06 --> 00:52:43,98
Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.

00:52:44,27 --> 00:52:46,65
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.

00:52:46,69 --> 00:52:49,07
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.

00:52:53,07 --> 00:52:55,08
Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.

00:52:56,58 --> 00:52:57,87
Scarlett, dear.

00:53:00,37 --> 00:53:04,56
Well, is this any way to greet a returning warrior?

00:53:04,59 --> 00:53:05,96
Ashley, l.

00:53:09,30 --> 00:53:10,97
Merry Christmas, Ashley.

00:53:19,56 --> 00:53:23,40
Come on, old gentleman, come on. We've got all your wives.

00:53:23,98 --> 00:53:26,02
We've got all your little chicks.

00:53:26,07 --> 00:53:29,53
You got nobody to worry your head about leavin'.

00:53:29,78 --> 00:53:30,78
Come on.

00:53:31,07 --> 00:53:36,39
Now you just stand still so you can be a Christmas gift for the white folks.

00:53:36,42 --> 00:53:37,50
Now hold on.

00:53:37,53 --> 00:53:38,58
Hold on.

00:53:39,37 --> 00:53:41,54
Don't go gettin' so uppity

00:53:41,58 --> 00:53:43,96
even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.

00:53:46,38 --> 00:53:48,84
Let's not talk about the war. It's Christmas.

00:53:48,88 --> 00:53:52,55
Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara and all the times before the war.

00:53:52,59 --> 00:53:54,13
Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?

00:53:54,18 --> 00:53:56,64
Why did you say there wasn't enough, Uncle Peter?

00:53:56,68 --> 00:54:00,35
There's plenty. It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira.

00:54:00,39 --> 00:54:04,27
He got it from his uncle, Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah

00:54:04,56 --> 00:54:08,15
who married his cousin, Jessica Carroll of Carrollton

00:54:08,19 --> 00:54:11,57
who was his second cousin once removed and a kin to the Wilkeses too.

00:54:11,86 --> 00:54:15,28
I saved it to wish Ashley a Merry Christmas.

00:54:15,86 --> 00:54:19,58
But you mustn't drink it all at once because it is the last.

00:54:24,50 --> 00:54:27,17
I meant it, my dear. It was a lovely Christmas gift.

00:54:27,46 --> 00:54:29,92
Only generaIs have tunics like this, nowadays.

00:54:29,96 --> 00:54:31,76
I'm so happy you like it, dear.

00:54:31,80 --> 00:54:33,63
Where did you get the cloth?

00:54:33,67 --> 00:54:35,84
It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.

00:54:35,88 --> 00:54:39,68
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital, Ashley, before he died and.

00:54:40,39 --> 00:54:42,98
Oh, you will take good care of it, won't you?

00:54:43,27 --> 00:54:45,39
You won't let it get torn.

00:54:45,89 --> 00:54:46,85
Promise me.

00:54:46,90 --> 00:54:48,06
You mustn't worry.

00:54:48,56 --> 00:54:51,98
I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it, I promise.

00:54:54,99 --> 00:54:56,03
Good night, my dear.

00:54:56,07 --> 00:54:57,87
Good night, Scarlett, darling.

00:55:11,59 --> 00:55:13,84
Is it time yet, Uncle Peter, for Mr. Ashley to leave?

00:55:13,88 --> 00:55:15,63
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.

00:55:15,67 --> 00:55:19,22
She isn't going to the depot with him? She hasn't changed her mind?

00:55:19,26 --> 00:55:20,93
No, ma'am. She's layin' down.

00:55:20,97 --> 00:55:24,98
She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs.

00:55:31,57 --> 00:55:32,57
Ashley.

00:55:36,99 --> 00:55:39,37
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.

00:55:39,87 --> 00:55:43,45
Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now

00:55:43,49 --> 00:55:45,29
not shivering at the depot.

00:55:45,79 --> 00:55:47,00
All right.

00:55:47,66 --> 00:55:50,46
Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.

00:55:57,47 --> 00:55:59,47
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.

00:56:00,39 --> 00:56:02,10
Tie it on me, my dear.

00:56:03,39 --> 00:56:07,27
While Melly was making your new tunic, I made this to go with it.

00:56:07,69 --> 00:56:08,89
You made it yourself?

00:56:09,98 --> 00:56:12,77
Well, then I shall value it all the more.

00:56:13,19 --> 00:56:16,19
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

00:56:16,99 --> 00:56:19,15
There's something you can do for me.

00:56:19,20 --> 00:56:20,20
What is it?

00:56:20,57 --> 00:56:22,66
Will you look after Melanie for me?

00:56:23,87 --> 00:56:26,87
She's so frail and gentle and she loves you so much.

00:56:27,37 --> 00:56:28,75
You see, if I were killed and she

00:56:28,79 --> 00:56:32,38
Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck. Say a prayer quickly.

00:56:32,67 --> 00:56:34,17
You say one for me.

00:56:35,17 --> 00:56:38,59
We shall need all our prayers now the end is coming.

00:56:38,88 --> 00:56:39,93
The end?

00:56:39,97 --> 00:56:41,39
The end of the war.

00:56:42,18 --> 00:56:44,10
And the end of our world, Scarlett.

00:56:45,47 --> 00:56:48,43
But, Ashley, you don't think the Yankees are beating us?

00:56:48,48 --> 00:56:52,75
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now

00:56:52,78 --> 00:56:54,97
and the snow in Virginia is deep.

00:56:55,57 --> 00:56:56,98
When I see them

00:56:57,36 --> 00:57:01,78
and I see the Yankees coming and coming, always more and more.

00:57:04,78 --> 00:57:07,49
Well, when the end does come I shall be far away.

00:57:07,99 --> 00:57:11,00
It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you.

00:57:12,08 --> 00:57:14,17
You will promise, won't you?

00:57:16,67 --> 00:57:17,67
Yes.

00:57:19,09 --> 00:57:20,76
Is that all, Ashley?

00:57:21,76 --> 00:57:24,39
All except, goodbye.

00:57:24,97 --> 00:57:26,93
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.

00:57:26,97 --> 00:57:28,22
You must be brave... No....

00:57:28,27 --> 00:57:29,48
You must.

00:57:30,06 --> 00:57:32,06
How else can I bear going?

00:57:32,90 --> 00:57:36,57
Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine and strong and beautiful.

00:57:37,86 --> 00:57:39,78
Not just your sweet face, my dear

00:57:40,78 --> 00:57:42,20
but you.

00:57:45,37 --> 00:57:47,58
Oh, Ashley, kiss me.

00:57:48,37 --> 00:57:50,08
Kiss me goodbye.

00:57:56,79 --> 00:57:57,75
No, Scarlett.

00:57:57,80 --> 00:57:59,38
Oh, Ashley, I love you.

00:57:59,96 --> 00:58:02,88
I've always loved you. I never loved anyone else.

00:58:03,18 --> 00:58:05,64
I only married Charles just to hurt you.

00:58:05,68 --> 00:58:08,10
Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.

00:58:09,10 --> 00:58:11,56
I'll live on it the rest of my life.

00:58:13,48 --> 00:58:14,56
Goodbye.

00:58:34,50 --> 00:58:36,67
When the war is over, Ashley.

00:58:37,46 --> 00:58:39,46
When the war is over.

00:58:59,69 --> 00:59:01,36
And there's a place back home

00:59:02,19 --> 00:59:05,36
where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime.

00:59:06,70 --> 00:59:08,37
Down by the creek, you know.

00:59:08,87 --> 00:59:10,37
Yes, I know, I know.

00:59:11,29 --> 00:59:14,62
When we were little, my brother, Jeff, and I used to.

00:59:14,66 --> 00:59:18,17
I told you about my brother, Jeff, didn't l, ma'am?

00:59:18,67 --> 00:59:19,96
I know I did.

00:59:20,38 --> 00:59:21,63
He.

00:59:21,67 --> 00:59:24,59
We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.

00:59:25,09 --> 00:59:28,39
Since Bull Run we haven't heard anything and.

00:59:28,89 --> 00:59:31,22
Please, we must have your temperature now.

00:59:31,26 --> 00:59:33,93
Just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore.

00:59:33,97 --> 00:59:35,48
Not just now.

00:59:35,89 --> 00:59:38,69
Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.

00:59:39,77 --> 00:59:41,48
Aren't you tired, Melanie?

00:59:41,98 --> 00:59:44,57
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

00:59:45,28 --> 00:59:47,03
This might be

00:59:47,07 --> 00:59:48,07
Ashley.

00:59:48,86 --> 00:59:51,66
And only strangers here to comfort him.

00:59:52,08 --> 00:59:54,08
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

00:59:55,29 --> 00:59:57,00
They could all be

00:59:57,50 --> 00:59:58,79
Ashley.

01:00:10,97 --> 01:00:14,93
I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.

01:00:14,97 --> 01:00:17,73
Go on, you trash, don't you be pesterin' these ladies.

01:00:17,77 --> 01:00:19,35
Don't talk to her, Melly.

01:00:19,40 --> 01:00:21,73
It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?

01:00:21,77 --> 01:00:24,53
My name's Belle Watlin'. But that don't matter.

01:00:24,57 --> 01:00:26,83
I expect you think I've got no business here.

01:00:26,86 --> 01:00:29,54
Hadn't you best tell me what you want to see me about?

01:00:29,57 --> 01:00:32,95
First time I come here, I says, Belle, you're a nurse.

01:00:32,99 --> 01:00:35,12
But the ladies didn't want my kind of nursin'.

01:00:35,16 --> 01:00:37,33
Well, they was more than likely right.

01:00:37,37 --> 01:00:39,25
Then I tried givin' 'em money.

01:00:39,29 --> 01:00:41,83
My money wasn't good enough for 'em, either.

01:00:41,88 --> 01:00:43,17
Old pea-hens.

01:00:43,67 --> 01:00:46,09
I know a gentleman who says you're a human bein'.

01:00:46,38 --> 01:00:50,05
If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital.

01:00:50,09 --> 01:00:53,35
What are you doing here? Haven't you been told twice already?

01:00:53,39 --> 01:00:55,43
This time I'm conversin' with Miss Wilkes.

01:00:55,47 --> 01:00:57,43
You might as well take my money, Miss Wilkes.

01:00:57,47 --> 01:01:00,22
It's good money, even if it is mine.

01:01:00,25 --> 01:01:01,36
I'm sure you're very generous.

01:01:01,40 --> 01:01:04,52
No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate like everybody else, that's all.

01:01:04,57 --> 01:01:06,16
Of course you are.

01:01:06,19 --> 01:01:08,44
There's some folks here wouldn't feel that way.

01:01:08,49 --> 01:01:11,07
But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you.

01:01:18,29 --> 01:01:21,08
Look, Mrs. Meade. It's a great deal of money.

01:01:21,37 --> 01:01:23,58
$Ten, $20, $30, $50.

01:01:23,96 --> 01:01:26,30
And it's not our paper money. It's gold.

01:01:26,88 --> 01:01:28,59
Let me see that handkerchief.

01:01:28,96 --> 01:01:30,59
R. B.

01:01:32,59 --> 01:01:35,76
And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage.

01:01:36,68 --> 01:01:39,77
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady what wouldn't I tell that varmint.

01:02:14,68 --> 01:02:17,64
The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want.

01:02:17,68 --> 01:02:20,27
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

01:02:20,68 --> 01:02:21,77
He leadeth.

01:02:24,19 --> 01:02:26,45
He restoreth my soul.

01:02:26,48 --> 01:02:29,86
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

01:02:30,57 --> 01:02:33,78
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

01:02:34,20 --> 01:02:35,78
I will fear no evil.

01:02:36,07 --> 01:02:37,37
For Thou art with me.

01:02:37,66 --> 01:02:40,16
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

01:02:41,29 --> 01:02:42,29
Yankees.

01:02:42,87 --> 01:02:45,92
The Yankees. Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.

01:02:45,96 --> 01:02:50,59
They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.

01:02:51,59 --> 01:02:53,76
Give me something for the pain.

01:02:54,17 --> 01:02:55,93
Give me something for the pain.

01:02:56,62 --> 01:02:59,75
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything to give you.

01:03:00,86 --> 01:03:03,29
These animaIs is driving me crazy.

01:03:03,96 --> 01:03:06,12
What luck. You've got my jack.

01:03:06,19 --> 01:03:08,79
Give me an ace and I'll start another war.

01:03:08,86 --> 01:03:10,52
I'll bid the moon.

01:03:14,43 --> 01:03:18,49
I'll never see you or Pa again.

01:03:19,47 --> 01:03:21,20
This leg's got to come off, soldier.

01:03:21,27 --> 01:03:23,60
No, no. Leave me alone.

01:03:23,71 --> 01:03:24,83
I'm sorry, soldier.

01:03:24,91 --> 01:03:27,25
We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.

01:03:27,28 --> 01:03:28,57
Then we'll have to operate without it.

01:03:28,65 --> 01:03:30,48
No, no. Leave me alone.

01:03:30,52 --> 01:03:32,82
You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me.

01:03:32,85 --> 01:03:36,08
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off immediately. It's gangrene.

01:03:36,15 --> 01:03:38,25
No, no. Don't.

01:03:38,29 --> 01:03:41,12
I haven't seen my family in three days.

01:03:41,15 --> 01:03:43,42
I'm going home for haIf an hour.

01:03:43,53 --> 01:03:45,09
Orderly. Give me a lift.

01:03:49,23 --> 01:03:51,46
Nurse, you can free this bed.

01:03:52,47 --> 01:03:53,99
Miss Scarlett.

01:03:55,64 --> 01:03:57,34
Why, Frank Kennedy.

01:03:57,41 --> 01:03:59,47
Miss Suellen, is she well?

01:03:59,68 --> 01:04:03,59
When did they bring you in? You all right? Are you badly hurt?

01:04:03,62 --> 01:04:06,21
But Miss Suellen, is she... She's all right, but I

01:04:06,24 --> 01:04:08,39
Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room.

01:04:08,43 --> 01:04:10,54
He's going to take off that leg. Better hurry.

01:04:11,82 --> 01:04:13,26
I'll be back.

01:04:14,86 --> 01:04:19,30
No, no, leave me alone.

01:04:19,33 --> 01:04:23,74
No, no, I can't stand it.

01:04:24,40 --> 01:04:25,73
Don't cut.

01:04:26,30 --> 01:04:28,10
Don't, don't.

01:04:28,47 --> 01:04:29,60
Please.

01:04:30,01 --> 01:04:31,70
Where's the nurse?

01:04:35,94 --> 01:04:37,35
Dr. Wilson's waiting.

01:04:37,98 --> 01:04:39,62
Let him wait. I'm going home. I've done enough.

01:04:39,65 --> 01:04:43,48
I don't want any more men dying. I don't want any more.

01:05:44,28 --> 01:05:46,10
Big Sam.

01:05:46,52 --> 01:05:48,49
Big Sam. Big Sam.

01:05:49,59 --> 01:05:53,51
Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett.

01:05:53,86 --> 01:05:54,98
Big Sam.

01:05:55,06 --> 01:05:59,14
Sam, I'm so glad to see you.

01:05:59,38 --> 01:06:02,27
Tell me about Tara, about my mother. She didn't write me.

01:06:02,31 --> 01:06:04,13
She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett. Sick?

01:06:04,16 --> 01:06:04,93
Just a little bit sick, that's all.

01:06:04,97 --> 01:06:09,30
Your pa was wild when they wouldn't let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.

01:06:09,34 --> 01:06:13,64
He had fits when they took us field hands to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.

01:06:13,67 --> 01:06:14,68
But your ma says the Confederacy needs us.

01:06:14,75 --> 01:06:16,18
So we's gonna dig for the South.

01:06:16,25 --> 01:06:17,37
Sam, was there a doctor?

01:06:17,45 --> 01:06:18,57
Ma'am, we've got to march.

01:06:18,65 --> 01:06:21,48
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.

01:06:21,55 --> 01:06:26,25
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys. If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.

01:06:26,28 --> 01:06:27,07
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.

01:06:27,10 --> 01:06:28,49
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:06:48,65 --> 01:06:49,81
Scarlett.

01:06:49,98 --> 01:06:51,18
Scarlett.

01:06:54,49 --> 01:06:58,58
Climb into this buggy. This is no day for walking.

01:06:58,61 --> 01:06:58,85
You'll get run over.

01:06:58,92 --> 01:07:00,15
Oh, Rhett.

01:07:00,63 --> 01:07:02,86
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.

01:07:04,43 --> 01:07:06,83
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?

01:07:09,67 --> 01:07:12,26
That's just another of Gen. Sherman's calling cards.

01:07:12,34 --> 01:07:13,70
He'll be paying us a visit soon.

01:07:13,74 --> 01:07:17,46
I've got to get out of here before the Yankees come.

01:07:17,49 --> 01:07:18,54
And leave your work at the hospital?

01:07:18,58 --> 01:07:22,38
Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up?

01:07:22,45 --> 01:07:24,75
I suppose you weren't meant for sick men, Scarlett.

01:07:24,82 --> 01:07:28,10
Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.

01:07:28,13 --> 01:07:29,31
I wish I could get out of here.

01:07:29,34 --> 01:07:30,49
Let's get out of here together.

01:07:30,56 --> 01:07:33,79
No use staying here and letting the South come down around your ears.

01:07:33,86 --> 01:07:36,66
There are too many nice places to go and visit.

01:07:36,73 --> 01:07:39,03
Mexico, London, Paris

01:07:39,10 --> 01:07:40,96
With you? Yes, ma'am.

01:07:41,27 --> 01:07:44,70
With a man who understands you and admires you for just what you are.

01:07:44,77 --> 01:07:47,86
I figure we belong together, being the same sort.

01:07:48,24 --> 01:07:52,90
I've been waiting for you to grow up and get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.

01:07:52,98 --> 01:07:57,41
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so.

01:07:57,48 --> 01:08:01,44
It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him.

01:08:03,86 --> 01:08:08,21
Well, here we are. Are you going with me, or are you getting out?

01:08:08,23 --> 01:08:13,03
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler, and I'll hate and despise you till I die.

01:08:13,73 --> 01:08:16,60
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.

01:08:24,14 --> 01:08:25,71
Miss Scarlett. Miss Scarlett.

01:08:25,74 --> 01:08:30,22
Folks is all going to Macon and folks is running away and running away.

01:08:30,25 --> 01:08:32,89
I can't bear it. Those cannon balls right in my ears.

01:08:32,95 --> 01:08:35,18
I faint every time I hear one.

01:08:36,12 --> 01:08:38,45
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.

01:08:38,52 --> 01:08:40,15
But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?

01:08:40,22 --> 01:08:43,13
I may be a coward, but oh, dear.

01:08:43,16 --> 01:08:44,99
Yankees in Georgia.

01:08:45,20 --> 01:08:46,29
How did they ever get in?

01:08:46,36 --> 01:08:50,16
I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things. Get them, quick.

01:08:50,19 --> 01:08:50,97
Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't be a minute.

01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:53,52
Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?

01:08:53,55 --> 01:08:54,14
Scarlett.

01:08:54,17 --> 01:08:57,17
What is this? You ain't planning on running away?

01:08:57,21 --> 01:09:01,41
And don't you dare try to stop me. I'm never going back to that hospital.

01:09:01,44 --> 01:09:03,77
I've had enough of smelling death and rot and death.

01:09:03,85 --> 01:09:06,94
I'm going home. I want my mother. My mother needs me.

01:09:07,02 --> 01:09:09,75
Now you've got to listen to me. You must stay here.

01:09:09,79 --> 01:09:13,17
Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade? It simply isn't done.

01:09:13,20 --> 01:09:16,55
Good heavens, woman, this is war, not a garden party.

01:09:16,58 --> 01:09:18,29
You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.

01:09:18,33 --> 01:09:22,59
She's ill already. She shouldn't even be having a baby.

01:09:22,62 --> 01:09:23,43
Can't we take her along?

01:09:23,50 --> 01:09:24,99
Do you want her to take that chance?

01:09:25,07 --> 01:09:26,63
To be jounced over rough roads

01:09:26,70 --> 01:09:28,64
and have her baby ahead of time, in a buggy?

01:09:28,71 --> 01:09:30,57
It isn't my baby. You take care of her.

01:09:30,64 --> 01:09:32,51
Scarlett. We haven't enough doctors

01:09:32,58 --> 01:09:35,84
much less nurses to look after a sick woman.

01:09:35,87 --> 01:09:37,56
You've got to stay for Melanie.

01:09:37,65 --> 01:09:40,02
I don't know anything about babies being born.

01:09:40,05 --> 01:09:41,28
I knows, I knows.

01:09:41,35 --> 01:09:45,48
I knows how to do it. I's done it lots and lots.

01:09:45,51 --> 01:09:47,26
Let me, Doctor, let me. I can do everything.

01:09:47,29 --> 01:09:50,39
Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us. Yes, Doctor.

01:09:50,46 --> 01:09:53,69
Ashley's fighting in the field, fighting for the cause.

01:09:53,76 --> 01:09:56,65
He may never come back. He may die.

01:09:56,68 --> 01:09:59,53
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.

01:10:00,04 --> 01:10:01,10
Ashley.

01:10:01,17 --> 01:10:05,17
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry.

01:10:05,20 --> 01:10:05,67
I promised Ashley

01:10:05,74 --> 01:10:06,88
something.

01:10:06,91 --> 01:10:08,44
Then you'll stay?

01:10:08,88 --> 01:10:12,01
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat. Scarlett's staying.

01:10:12,08 --> 01:10:16,87
Go on, Uncle Peter. Oh, dear, I don't know what to do.

01:10:16,90 --> 01:10:19,50
It's like the end of the world.

01:10:19,53 --> 01:10:22,09
Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.

01:10:28,87 --> 01:10:31,16
Melanie, it's all your fault.

01:10:31,74 --> 01:10:33,99
I hate you, I hate you.

01:10:34,02 --> 01:10:35,60
And I hate your baby.

01:10:35,71 --> 01:10:38,04
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.

01:10:38,11 --> 01:10:40,34
If only I hadn't promised him.

01:11:09,41 --> 01:11:11,81
Stop. Stop, please stop.

01:11:11,84 --> 01:11:13,48
Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?

01:11:13,51 --> 01:11:15,54
I'm afraid so, ma'am. The Army's pulling out.

01:11:15,58 --> 01:11:18,78
Pulling out of Atlanta? Leaving us to the Yankees?

01:11:18,81 --> 01:11:19,38
Not leaving, ma'am, evacuating.

01:11:19,42 --> 01:11:23,27
We've got to before Sherman cuts the McDonough Road and catches us.

01:11:23,30 --> 01:11:25,55
It can't be true. It can't be true. What'll I do?

01:11:25,59 --> 01:11:29,75
Better refugee south right quick, ma'am. If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

01:11:30,49 --> 01:11:32,60
Prissy.

01:11:32,63 --> 01:11:34,26
Prissy, come here.

01:11:34,33 --> 01:11:37,79
Pack my things and Miss Melanie's, too. We're going to Tara right away.

01:11:37,87 --> 01:11:38,93
The Yankees are coming.

01:11:39,00 --> 01:11:41,05
Yes, ma'am.

01:11:41,81 --> 01:11:42,83
Scarlett.

01:11:42,90 --> 01:11:44,47
Scarlett.

01:11:44,88 --> 01:11:47,43
Melly, we're going to

01:11:49,21 --> 01:11:50,31
Melly.

01:11:52,95 --> 01:11:56,28
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.

01:11:58,82 --> 01:12:02,97
It began at daybreak.

01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:03,83
But, but

01:12:03,86 --> 01:12:06,11
But the Yankees are coming.

01:12:07,13 --> 01:12:08,66
Poor Scarlett.

01:12:09,17 --> 01:12:12,29
You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you

01:12:13,10 --> 01:12:14,94
if it weren't for me?

01:12:15,57 --> 01:12:17,40
Oh, Scarlett, darling

01:12:17,81 --> 01:12:19,71
you've been so good to me.

01:12:19,81 --> 01:12:23,18
No sister could have been sweeter.

01:12:25,52 --> 01:12:27,85
I've been lying here thinking

01:12:28,62 --> 01:12:30,31
if I should die

01:12:31,36 --> 01:12:33,38
will you take my baby?

01:12:35,69 --> 01:12:37,72
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.

01:12:37,80 --> 01:12:41,13
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?

01:12:41,17 --> 01:12:44,07
I'll send for Dr. Meade right away. Not yet, Scarlett.

01:12:44,14 --> 01:12:47,97
I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours, while

01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:51,80
while all those poor, wounded boys... Prissy.

01:12:52,84 --> 01:12:56,65
Prissy. Prissy. Come here, quick.

01:12:56,71 --> 01:12:59,75
Yes, ma'am. The baby.

01:12:59,78 --> 01:13:02,91
Well, don't stand there like a scared goat. Run.

01:13:04,66 --> 01:13:09,63
Hurry. I'll sell you South, I will. I swear I will.

01:13:10,39 --> 01:13:12,93
Where's that Prissy?

01:13:15,20 --> 01:13:17,29
This room's like an oven already

01:13:17,37 --> 01:13:19,30
and it isn't noon yet.

01:13:22,14 --> 01:13:23,94
Oh, don't worry, Melly.

01:13:24,48 --> 01:13:28,14
Mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come.

01:13:29,35 --> 01:13:32,04
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy.

01:13:39,39 --> 01:13:40,62
Oh, Melly.

01:13:41,29 --> 01:13:43,89
You know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether?

01:13:43,96 --> 01:13:46,16
You remember that funny-looking beau of hers?

01:13:46,23 --> 01:13:50,41
The one with a uniform like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.

01:13:50,44 --> 01:13:53,24
You don't have to keep on talking for my sake, Scarlett.

01:13:53,40 --> 01:13:55,37
I know how worried you are.

01:14:08,62 --> 01:14:12,28
Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you some cool water.

01:14:13,86 --> 01:14:16,34
You're as slow as molasses in January.

01:14:16,37 --> 01:14:17,13
And where's Dr. Meade?

01:14:17,16 --> 01:14:19,49
I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett. What?

01:14:19,56 --> 01:14:21,96
No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.

01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:28,02
A man, he told me the doctor's down at the car shed with the wounded soldiers

01:14:28,05 --> 01:14:29,59
Well, why didn't you go after him?

01:14:29,77 --> 01:14:30,97
Miss Scarlett.

01:14:31,04 --> 01:14:34,19
I's scared to go down there to the car shed.

01:14:34,38 --> 01:14:38,31
There's folks dying down there and I's scared of dead folks.

01:14:40,45 --> 01:14:42,15
Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.

01:14:42,22 --> 01:14:46,05
And don't you be upsetting her, or I'll whip the hide off you.

01:15:23,93 --> 01:15:26,52
Have you seen Dr. Meade? Side, lady, please.

01:15:30,47 --> 01:15:31,80
Dr. Meade.

01:16:16,45 --> 01:16:18,18
Dr. Meade. At last.

01:16:18,32 --> 01:16:21,61
Oh, thank heavens you're here. I need every pair of hands.

01:16:21,69 --> 01:16:24,59
Come, child. Wake up. We've got work to do.

01:16:24,96 --> 01:16:28,48
But Melly's having her baby. You've got to come with me.

01:16:28,59 --> 01:16:31,46
Are you crazy? I can't leave these men for a baby.

01:16:31,53 --> 01:16:34,97
They're dying, hundreds of them. Get some woman to help you.

01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:38,41
But there isn't anybody. Dr. Meade, she might die.

01:16:38,44 --> 01:16:38,66
Die.

01:16:38,74 --> 01:16:41,70
Look at them. Bleeding to death in front of my eyes.

01:16:41,74 --> 01:16:46,24
No chloroform. No bandages. Nothing. Nothing to even ease their pain.

01:16:46,38 --> 01:16:48,74
Now run along and don't bother me.

01:16:48,81 --> 01:16:52,11
Now don't worry, child. There's nothing to bringing a baby.

01:16:52,18 --> 01:16:54,22
Now bring those stretchers in here.

01:16:54,25 --> 01:16:55,36
Dr. Meade.

01:16:55,39 --> 01:16:56,47
I'm coming.

01:17:15,57 --> 01:17:17,13
Is the doctor come?

01:17:17,78 --> 01:17:19,21
No, he can't come.

01:17:19,28 --> 01:17:22,07
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.

01:17:22,21 --> 01:17:24,81
He can't come. There's nobody to come.

01:17:25,52 --> 01:17:29,04
Prissy, you've got to manage without the doctor. I'll help you.

01:17:29,12 --> 01:17:32,47
Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.

01:17:32,50 --> 01:17:33,42
Well, what is it?

01:17:33,49 --> 01:17:35,75
Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.

01:17:35,83 --> 01:17:38,66
I don't know nothing about birthing babies.

01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:41,83
What do you mean? I don't know

01:17:41,90 --> 01:17:44,25
You told me you knew everything about it.

01:17:44,28 --> 01:17:45,90
I don't know how come I told such a lie.

01:17:45,94 --> 01:17:49,46
Ma ain't never let me around when folks was having them.

01:17:49,87 --> 01:17:50,97
Scarlett.

01:17:51,58 --> 01:17:52,70
Scarlett.

01:17:53,41 --> 01:17:55,28
Oh, Miss Scarlett

01:17:55,88 --> 01:17:57,11
Stop it.

01:17:58,62 --> 01:18:00,05
Go light a fire in the stove.

01:18:00,12 --> 01:18:03,63
Keep boiling water in the kettle, get me the ball of twine and

01:18:03,66 --> 01:18:06,42
and all the clean toweIs you can find, and the scissors.

01:18:06,45 --> 01:18:07,75
Don't come telling me you can't find them.

01:18:07,78 --> 01:18:09,82
Go get them, and get them quick.

01:18:11,03 --> 01:18:12,29
Scarlett.

01:18:19,93 --> 01:18:20,86
Scarlett.

01:18:21,54 --> 01:18:22,87
Coming, Melly.

01:18:23,97 --> 01:18:25,17
Coming.

01:18:29,01 --> 01:18:31,31
Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.

01:18:31,38 --> 01:18:33,37
I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.

01:18:33,45 --> 01:18:35,15
It's no use. I'm going to die.

01:18:35,22 --> 01:18:39,04
Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me. Hold on to me.

01:18:39,07 --> 01:18:40,98
Talk to me, Scarlett.

01:18:41,01 --> 01:18:42,89
Please talk to me.

01:18:43,06 --> 01:18:44,39
Don't try to be brave, Melly.

01:18:44,43 --> 01:18:46,83
Yell all you want, there's nobody to hear.

01:18:46,90 --> 01:18:51,23
Ma says that if you puts a knife under the bed, it cuts the pain in two.

01:18:56,64 --> 01:18:58,40
Capt. Butler.

01:18:59,28 --> 01:19:00,57
Capt. Butler.

01:19:02,35 --> 01:19:03,37
Who do you want?

01:19:03,45 --> 01:19:04,44
Capt. Butler.

01:19:04,52 --> 01:19:07,18
He's upstairs. Belle Watling's giving a party.

01:19:09,42 --> 01:19:10,61
Thank you.

01:19:12,96 --> 01:19:15,39
Capt. Butler. Oh, Capt. Butler.

01:19:15,63 --> 01:19:17,69
What's all the rumpus about?

01:19:17,86 --> 01:19:21,06
I's got a message for Capt. Butler, Miss Watling.

01:19:21,27 --> 01:19:24,72
Capt. Butler, you come out here in the streets to me.

01:19:25,94 --> 01:19:27,07
What is it, Prissy?

01:19:27,10 --> 01:19:30,23
Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.

01:19:30,26 --> 01:19:33,36
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.

01:19:33,39 --> 01:19:36,35
A fine baby boy

01:19:36,38 --> 01:19:39,14
and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.

01:19:39,22 --> 01:19:40,92
Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett

01:19:40,95 --> 01:19:44,55
Well, it was mostly me, Capt. Butler, only Miss Scarlett

01:19:44,62 --> 01:19:50,46
she helped me a little, but I don't expect no doctor could have done no better.

01:19:50,49 --> 01:19:55,17
Only Miss Melly, she feeling kind of poorly now it's all over.

01:19:55,20 --> 01:19:56,40
Yes, I can believe that.

01:19:56,47 --> 01:20:00,23
And the Yankees is coming, and Miss Scarlett, she said

01:20:01,34 --> 01:20:04,71
Oh, Capt. Butler, the Yankees is here.

01:20:04,74 --> 01:20:08,11
Please come and bring your carriage for us right away.

01:20:08,15 --> 01:20:11,23
I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army took my horse and carriage.

01:20:11,26 --> 01:20:13,64
You'd better come upstairs. I'll see what I can do.

01:20:13,67 --> 01:20:14,98
Oh, no, Capt. Butler.

01:20:15,25 --> 01:20:20,68
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Miss Watling's.

01:20:21,16 --> 01:20:24,79
Any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause?

01:20:31,70 --> 01:20:34,54
Whoa, Marse Robert. Is that you, Rhett?

01:20:34,81 --> 01:20:38,81
We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here. Rhett, I knew you'd come.

01:20:38,84 --> 01:20:39,78
Good evening. Nice weather we're having.

01:20:39,81 --> 01:20:41,94
Prissy tells me you're planning on taking a trip.

01:20:41,98 --> 01:20:44,07
If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you.

01:20:44,15 --> 01:20:45,48
Don't tell me you're frightened.

01:20:45,55 --> 01:20:49,51
I'm scared to death. If you had the sense of a goat, you'd be scared too.

01:20:49,59 --> 01:20:51,58
Oh, the Yankees. No, not yet.

01:20:51,66 --> 01:20:54,39
That's what's left of our Army, blowing up the ammunition

01:20:54,46 --> 01:20:55,58
so the Yankees won't get it.

01:20:55,66 --> 01:20:57,35
We've got to get out of here.

01:20:57,43 --> 01:20:58,42
At your service, madam.

01:20:58,50 --> 01:21:00,72
Just where are you figuring on going?

01:21:00,75 --> 01:21:01,23
Home, to Tara.

01:21:01,27 --> 01:21:03,63
They've been fighting all day around Tara.

01:21:03,67 --> 01:21:06,00
Do you think you can parade through the Yankee Army

01:21:06,07 --> 01:21:08,83
with a sick woman, a baby, and a simple-minded darky

01:21:08,86 --> 01:21:10,27
or do you intend leaving them behind?

01:21:10,34 --> 01:21:12,87
They're going with me. I'm going home. You can't stop me.

01:21:12,94 --> 01:21:16,67
Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?

01:21:16,75 --> 01:21:18,18
I want my mother.

01:21:19,05 --> 01:21:20,95
I want to go home to Tara.

01:21:21,02 --> 01:21:22,85
Tara's probably been burned to the ground.

01:21:22,89 --> 01:21:25,20
The woods are full of stragglers from both armies.

01:21:25,24 --> 01:21:27,52
The least they'll do is take the horse away from you.

01:21:27,59 --> 01:21:30,19
It isn't much of an animal, but I had trouble stealing it.

01:21:30,26 --> 01:21:33,32
I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way.

01:21:33,40 --> 01:21:36,59
I'll kill you if you try to stop me. I will, I will.

01:21:37,10 --> 01:21:41,59
I will.

01:21:44,01 --> 01:21:47,53
All right, darling, all right. Now you shall go home.

01:21:49,41 --> 01:21:53,70
I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman.

01:21:54,48 --> 01:21:56,82
Here, now. Stop crying.

01:21:59,32 --> 01:22:01,62
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.

01:22:01,89 --> 01:22:03,05
There.

01:22:14,77 --> 01:22:15,86
Prissy. What are you doing?

01:22:15,94 --> 01:22:17,37
I's packing, Miss Scarlett.

01:22:17,44 --> 01:22:20,31
Stop it and come get the baby.

01:22:22,75 --> 01:22:23,87
Melly.

01:22:24,88 --> 01:22:27,71
Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.

01:22:27,95 --> 01:22:29,05
Tara

01:22:29,09 --> 01:22:30,99
It's the only way, Melly. No.

01:22:31,02 --> 01:22:34,26
Sherman will burn the house over our heads if we stay.

01:22:34,29 --> 01:22:35,46
It's all right, Melly.

01:22:35,53 --> 01:22:37,08
My baby.

01:22:37,69 --> 01:22:39,22
My poor baby.

01:22:43,77 --> 01:22:46,20
Have you the strength to put your arms around my neck?

01:22:46,27 --> 01:22:48,03
I think so.

01:22:50,84 --> 01:22:52,10
Never mind.

01:22:52,18 --> 01:22:54,58
Oh, Ashley, Charles

01:22:54,61 --> 01:22:56,24
What is it? What does she want?

01:22:56,28 --> 01:22:59,11
Ashley's picture, Charles' sword. She wants us to bring them.

01:22:59,18 --> 01:23:00,21
Get them.

01:23:16,17 --> 01:23:17,22
What's that?

01:23:17,47 --> 01:23:20,59
Our gallant lads must have set fire to the warehouses near the depot.

01:23:20,62 --> 01:23:23,70
There's enough ammunition in the boxcars to blow us to Tara.

01:23:23,74 --> 01:23:25,74
We'll have to hurry to get across the tracks.

01:23:25,78 --> 01:23:27,58
You're not going that way. We have to.

01:23:27,61 --> 01:23:30,77
The McDonough Road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.

01:23:40,02 --> 01:23:42,46
Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.

01:23:42,59 --> 01:23:43,93
What are you laughing at?

01:23:43,96 --> 01:23:46,11
At you, locking the Yankees out.

01:24:03,15 --> 01:24:04,77
Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.

01:24:04,85 --> 01:24:07,58
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go if I were you.

01:24:07,65 --> 01:24:11,68
With them goes the last semblance of law and order.

01:24:12,49 --> 01:24:14,65
The scavengers aren't wasting any time.

01:24:19,13 --> 01:24:21,31
We've got to get out of here fast.

01:24:21,34 --> 01:24:22,16
There's a horse.

01:24:26,02 --> 01:24:27,92
Stay the horse

01:24:33,64 --> 01:24:35,30
Down the alley, cut them off.

01:24:49,29 --> 01:24:50,99
Give me that horse.

01:25:01,17 --> 01:25:02,20
Miss Scarlett.

01:25:06,54 --> 01:25:09,17
They haven't left much for the Yankees to take, have they?

01:25:09,25 --> 01:25:12,70
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.

01:25:33,87 --> 01:25:35,89
Come on.

01:25:39,44 --> 01:25:41,10
Throw me your shawl.

01:25:43,78 --> 01:25:47,34
Sorry, but you'll like it better if you don't see anything.

01:26:46,71 --> 01:26:48,78
Take a good look, my dear.

01:26:49,15 --> 01:26:50,17
It's a historic moment.

01:26:50,25 --> 01:26:51,71
You can tell your grandchildren

01:26:51,78 --> 01:26:55,01
how you watched the old South disappear one night.

01:27:11,37 --> 01:27:13,77
They were going to lick the Yankees in a month.

01:27:13,84 --> 01:27:15,70
Poor gallant fools.

01:27:15,74 --> 01:27:17,10
They make me sick, all of them.

01:27:17,17 --> 01:27:20,30
Getting us all into this with their swaggering and boasting.

01:27:20,64 --> 01:27:23,98
That's the way I feIt once about their swaggering and boasting.

01:27:24,85 --> 01:27:27,21
Rhett, I'm so glad you aren't with the Army.

01:27:27,28 --> 01:27:31,55
You can be proud now, proud that you've been smarter than all of them.

01:27:33,96 --> 01:27:35,74
I'm not so proud.

01:27:54,88 --> 01:27:55,94
Why did you stop?

01:27:56,01 --> 01:27:58,74
This is the turn to Tara. Let the horse breathe a bit.

01:27:59,12 --> 01:28:00,14
Mrs. Wilkes.

01:28:00,22 --> 01:28:03,52
Miss Melly done fainted way back, Capt. Butler.

01:28:03,72 --> 01:28:05,28
Well, she's probably better off.

01:28:05,36 --> 01:28:08,42
She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious.

01:28:08,93 --> 01:28:11,79
Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?

01:28:11,86 --> 01:28:14,69
Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett. I'm sure we can.

01:28:14,73 --> 01:28:16,60
Not we, my dear. You.

01:28:16,97 --> 01:28:18,43
I'm leaving you here.

01:28:18,74 --> 01:28:21,33
You're what? Rhett, where are you going?

01:28:21,57 --> 01:28:23,80
I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.

01:28:24,01 --> 01:28:27,34
You're joking. I could kill you for scaring me so.

01:28:27,37 --> 01:28:28,48
I'm very serious, Scarlett.

01:28:28,51 --> 01:28:31,24
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.

01:28:31,31 --> 01:28:32,44
But they're running away.

01:28:32,52 --> 01:28:35,81
No. They'll turn and make a last stand, if I know anything about them.

01:28:35,89 --> 01:28:39,01
When they do, I'll be with them. A little late, but Better late

01:28:39,09 --> 01:28:40,82
Rhett, you must be joking.

01:28:41,86 --> 01:28:43,38
Selfish to the end, aren't you?

01:28:43,46 --> 01:28:47,90
Thinking only of your own precious hide, with never a thought for the noble cause.

01:28:47,93 --> 01:28:49,19
Rhett, how could you do this to me

01:28:49,27 --> 01:28:52,20
and why should you go now, after it's all over and I need you?

01:28:52,27 --> 01:28:53,26
Why? Why?

01:28:53,34 --> 01:28:54,36
Why?

01:28:54,44 --> 01:28:57,43
Maybe it's because I've always had a weakness for lost causes

01:28:57,51 --> 01:28:58,80
once they're really lost.

01:28:58,88 --> 01:28:59,97
Or maybe

01:29:01,21 --> 01:29:03,24
maybe I'm ashamed of myself.

01:29:04,48 --> 01:29:05,47
Who knows?

01:29:05,55 --> 01:29:08,95
You should die of shame to leave me here alone and helpless.

01:29:08,98 --> 01:29:10,19
You helpless?

01:29:11,25 --> 01:29:14,02
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you.

01:29:14,56 --> 01:29:18,40
Now climb down here. I want to say goodbye.

01:29:18,43 --> 01:29:18,95
No.

01:29:19,56 --> 01:29:21,53
Climb down.

01:29:24,30 --> 01:29:27,63
Oh, Rhett, please don't go. You can't leave me, please.

01:29:27,70 --> 01:29:29,43
I'll never forgive you.

01:29:29,51 --> 01:29:34,13
I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself.

01:29:34,16 --> 01:29:38,05
And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myseIf for being an idiot.

01:29:38,28 --> 01:29:39,91
But there's one thing I do know

01:29:39,98 --> 01:29:41,65
and that is that I love you, Scarlett.

01:29:41,68 --> 01:29:45,18
In spite of you, me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us

01:29:45,26 --> 01:29:46,35
I love you

01:29:46,42 --> 01:29:48,95
because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.

01:29:49,33 --> 01:29:51,12
Selfish and shrewd

01:29:51,46 --> 01:29:54,83
but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names.

01:29:54,90 --> 01:29:56,80
Don't hold me like that.

01:29:56,90 --> 01:29:58,73
Scarlett, look at me.

01:29:59,90 --> 01:30:02,34
I love you more than I've ever loved any woman.

01:30:02,47 --> 01:30:05,70
And I've waited longer for you than I've ever waited for any woman.

01:30:05,78 --> 01:30:06,97
Let me alone.

01:30:08,14 --> 01:30:10,67
Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett

01:30:10,75 --> 01:30:12,37
wants to feel your arms around him

01:30:12,45 --> 01:30:15,65
wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him.

01:30:15,68 --> 01:30:17,01
Never mind about loving me.

01:30:17,09 --> 01:30:20,87
You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.

01:30:21,12 --> 01:30:22,92
Scarlett, kiss me.

01:30:24,06 --> 01:30:25,43
Kiss me, once.

01:30:30,77 --> 01:30:33,50
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you.

01:30:33,54 --> 01:30:37,80
They were right. Everybody was right. You aren't a gentleman.

01:30:40,11 --> 01:30:42,27
A minor point at such a moment.

01:30:44,08 --> 01:30:45,78
Here.

01:30:45,82 --> 01:30:48,11
If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him.

01:30:48,18 --> 01:30:50,15
But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag.

01:30:50,19 --> 01:30:54,32
Oh, go on. I want you to go. I hope a cannonball lands slap on you.

01:30:54,39 --> 01:30:56,22
I hope you're blown into a million pieces.

01:30:56,26 --> 01:30:58,79
Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea.

01:30:58,83 --> 01:31:01,32
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country

01:31:01,40 --> 01:31:03,73
I hope your conscience hurts you.

01:31:04,30 --> 01:31:05,73
Goodbye, Scarlett.

01:31:31,76 --> 01:31:34,36
Come on, you. We're going home.

01:32:50,11 --> 01:32:52,96
Oh, my poor baby.

01:32:54,01 --> 01:32:55,44
Don't worry, Melly.

01:32:55,68 --> 01:32:57,81
Mother will take care of him when we get home.

01:32:57,88 --> 01:33:01,36
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.

01:33:01,39 --> 01:33:03,53
We's got to have something to eat.

01:33:03,56 --> 01:33:04,42
Oh, hush up.

01:33:04,45 --> 01:33:07,45
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks. We'll stop there.

01:33:08,22 --> 01:33:10,21
Go on.

01:34:14,35 --> 01:34:19,70
Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.

01:34:20,80 --> 01:34:22,49
The Yankees.

01:34:22,57 --> 01:34:24,50
The dirty Yankees.

01:34:39,15 --> 01:34:41,64
Prissy, come tie up this cow.

01:34:42,15 --> 01:34:44,55
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.

01:34:44,59 --> 01:34:48,22
We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.

01:34:48,26 --> 01:34:51,39
Tear up your petticoat and tie her on to the back of the wagon.

01:34:51,53 --> 01:34:55,16
We need milk for the baby, and we don't know what we'll find at home.

01:35:04,41 --> 01:35:07,45
Melly. Melly, we're home.

01:35:07,48 --> 01:35:07,63
We're at Tara.

01:35:07,71 --> 01:35:11,12
Hurry. Move, you brute.

01:35:11,18 --> 01:35:13,61
Miss Scarlett, he's dead.

01:35:14,08 --> 01:35:18,35
I can't see the house. Is it there? I can't see the house. Have they burned it?

01:35:22,09 --> 01:35:23,76
Oh, it's all right.

01:35:23,79 --> 01:35:26,85
It's all right. They haven't burned it.

01:35:26,88 --> 01:35:27,79
It's still there.

01:35:30,70 --> 01:35:34,42
Mother. Mother. I'm home.

01:35:36,77 --> 01:35:38,76
Mother. Mother. I'm home.

01:35:44,28 --> 01:35:47,22
Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett.

01:35:51,15 --> 01:35:52,81
Pa.

01:35:53,46 --> 01:35:54,92
Oh, Pa.

01:35:55,66 --> 01:35:57,65
I'm home.

01:35:58,49 --> 01:35:59,59
I'm home.

01:36:02,67 --> 01:36:04,06
Katie.

01:36:04,83 --> 01:36:06,36
Katie Scarlett.

01:36:07,34 --> 01:36:09,13
Oh, darling.

01:36:20,32 --> 01:36:21,51
Mammy.

01:36:22,59 --> 01:36:26,02
Mammy, I'm home. Honey, honey child.

01:36:27,82 --> 01:36:29,92
Oh, Mammy, I'm so

01:36:31,59 --> 01:36:33,12
Where's Mother?

01:36:33,63 --> 01:36:34,65
Why

01:36:35,23 --> 01:36:38,83
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid.

01:36:39,57 --> 01:36:42,40
They had it bad, but they's doing all right now.

01:36:42,74 --> 01:36:44,21
Just weak like little kittens.

01:36:44,27 --> 01:36:46,79
But where's Mother?

01:36:47,94 --> 01:36:49,07
Well

01:36:49,65 --> 01:36:54,55
Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery, that white trash

01:36:55,25 --> 01:36:58,02
and she took down with it, too.

01:36:58,82 --> 01:37:02,89
And last night, she... Mother.

01:37:05,66 --> 01:37:06,89
Mother.

01:37:11,59 --> 01:37:13,16
Mother.

01:37:17,67 --> 01:37:18,69
Where is she?

01:38:14,83 --> 01:38:16,30
Miss Scarlett, honey.

01:38:16,37 --> 01:38:19,15
If there's anything I can do, Miss Scarlett

01:38:19,97 --> 01:38:21,49
What did you do with Miss Melly?

01:38:21,57 --> 01:38:24,17
Don't you worry your pretty head about Miss Melly, child.

01:38:24,24 --> 01:38:27,07
I done slapped her in bed already, along with the baby.

01:38:27,14 --> 01:38:29,61
You better put that cow I brought into the barn, Pork.

01:38:29,68 --> 01:38:31,85
There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.

01:38:31,88 --> 01:38:34,02
The Yankees done burned it for firewood.

01:38:34,08 --> 01:38:36,21
They used the house for their headquarters.

01:38:36,29 --> 01:38:37,95
They camped all around the place.

01:38:38,02 --> 01:38:39,49
Yankees in Tara.

01:38:39,56 --> 01:38:42,49
Yes, ma'am, and they stole most everything they didn't burn.

01:38:42,56 --> 01:38:47,71
All the clothes and all the rugs and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.

01:38:48,86 --> 01:38:50,83
I'm starving, Pork. Get me something to eat.

01:38:50,90 --> 01:38:54,10
There ain't nothing to eat, honey. They took it all.

01:38:54,44 --> 01:38:56,00
All the chickens, everything?

01:38:56,14 --> 01:38:57,83
They took them the first thing.

01:38:57,91 --> 01:39:01,06
And what they didn't eat they carried off across their saddles.

01:39:01,09 --> 01:39:03,67
Don't tell me any more about what they did.

01:39:19,56 --> 01:39:21,55
What's this, Pa?

01:39:21,63 --> 01:39:22,72
Whiskey?

01:39:23,20 --> 01:39:24,46
Yes, daughter.

01:39:28,50 --> 01:39:30,63
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.

01:39:30,71 --> 01:39:34,04
You're not knowing spirits, you'll make yourseIf tipsy.

01:39:34,11 --> 01:39:36,01
I hope it makes me drunk.

01:39:36,31 --> 01:39:37,90
I'd like to be drunk.

01:39:41,05 --> 01:39:42,18
Oh, Pa.

01:39:45,62 --> 01:39:47,49
What are those papers?

01:39:47,55 --> 01:39:49,55
Bonds.

01:39:51,43 --> 01:39:53,12
They're all we've saved.

01:39:53,20 --> 01:39:54,92
All we have left.

01:39:55,33 --> 01:39:56,53
Bonds.

01:39:56,93 --> 01:39:58,66
What kind of bonds, Pa?

01:39:59,74 --> 01:40:02,30
Why, Confederate bonds, of course, daughter.

01:40:02,47 --> 01:40:04,13
Confederate bonds.

01:40:04,44 --> 01:40:06,67
What good are they to anybody?

01:40:06,91 --> 01:40:09,57
I'll not have you talking like that, Katie Scarlett.

01:40:09,78 --> 01:40:13,84
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money and nothing to eat?

01:40:15,32 --> 01:40:17,29
We must ask your mother.

01:40:18,02 --> 01:40:19,35
That's it.

01:40:19,79 --> 01:40:22,02
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.

01:40:23,53 --> 01:40:25,26
Ask Mother? Yes.

01:40:26,16 --> 01:40:28,72
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.

01:40:29,83 --> 01:40:31,73
Now don't be bothering me.

01:40:31,80 --> 01:40:33,56
Go out for a ride.

01:40:34,20 --> 01:40:35,47
I'm busy.

01:40:53,46 --> 01:40:55,01
Oh, Pa

01:40:55,76 --> 01:40:57,85
don't worry about anything.

01:40:58,66 --> 01:41:00,53
Katie Scarlett's home.

01:41:02,93 --> 01:41:04,59
You needn't worry.

01:41:19,72 --> 01:41:20,74
Miss Scarlett.

01:41:20,82 --> 01:41:24,75
What are we gonna to do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child?

01:41:26,29 --> 01:41:27,88
I don't know, Mammy.

01:41:28,72 --> 01:41:29,85
I don't know.

01:41:29,93 --> 01:41:32,99
We ain't got nothing but radishes in the garden.

01:41:33,06 --> 01:41:36,12
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen

01:41:36,20 --> 01:41:38,91
they's fussing to be sponged off.

01:41:39,27 --> 01:41:40,83
Where are the other servants, Mammy?

01:41:40,90 --> 01:41:43,46
Miss Scarlett, there's only just me and Pork left.

01:41:43,54 --> 01:41:45,80
The others went off to the war or runned away.

01:41:45,88 --> 01:41:50,18
I can't take care of that baby and sick folks, too.

01:41:50,21 --> 01:41:51,74
I's only got two hands.

01:41:52,18 --> 01:41:56,85
Who's going to milk that cow, Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.

01:43:19,57 --> 01:43:21,54
As God is my witness

01:43:22,10 --> 01:43:25,40
As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me.

01:43:25,84 --> 01:43:30,83
I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.

01:43:31,08 --> 01:43:32,74
No, nor any of my folks.

01:43:34,32 --> 01:43:36,88
If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.

01:43:38,19 --> 01:43:42,06
As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.

01:50:55,51 --> 01:50:57,60
My back's near broken.

01:50:59,99 --> 01:51:01,72
Look at my hands.

01:51:02,43 --> 01:51:05,87
Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.

01:51:06,07 --> 01:51:10,13
I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore.

01:51:10,87 --> 01:51:15,14
You rest, Sue. You're not well yet, and I can pick cotton for both of us.

01:51:15,17 --> 01:51:18,50
Scarlett's hateful, making us work in the fields like

01:51:18,83 --> 01:51:20,56
Too bad about that.

01:51:20,90 --> 01:51:24,00
Now get back to work. I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.

01:51:24,07 --> 01:51:26,80
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara.

01:51:30,01 --> 01:51:32,95
Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again.

01:51:33,65 --> 01:51:36,14
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.

01:51:42,86 --> 01:51:45,63
Katie Scarlett, there's something I must speak to you about.

01:51:45,70 --> 01:51:46,80
Yes, Pa, what is it?

01:51:46,83 --> 01:51:51,72
I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy. I don't like the way you're treating them.

01:51:51,75 --> 01:51:54,51
You must be firm with inferiors, but you must be gentle with them

01:51:54,54 --> 01:51:55,77
especially darkies.

01:51:55,84 --> 01:52:00,19
Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them to do anything I'm not doing myself.

01:52:00,23 --> 01:52:04,55
Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it. I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.

01:52:18,77 --> 01:52:20,90
What are you doing out of bed, Melly?

01:52:20,93 --> 01:52:24,13
Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you. You are all working so hard.

01:52:24,17 --> 01:52:25,94
I can't lie in bed doing nothing.

01:52:25,97 --> 01:52:28,50
Go on back upstairs. You're as weak as a newborn colt.

01:52:28,57 --> 01:52:29,84
Please, Scarlett, let me.

01:52:29,91 --> 01:52:32,21
Stop being noble. I've got enough on my hands

01:52:32,28 --> 01:52:35,18
without you making yourseIf sick so you'll never be any use.

01:52:35,25 --> 01:52:37,77
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.

01:53:33,47 --> 01:53:36,07
Who's there? HaIt or I'll shoot.

01:53:42,38 --> 01:53:44,32
You're alone, little lady?

01:53:47,15 --> 01:53:49,52
You ain't very friendly, are you?

01:53:52,53 --> 01:53:55,32
You got anything else besides these earbobs?

01:53:55,40 --> 01:53:57,92
You Yankees have been here before.

01:53:58,10 --> 01:54:00,73
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?

01:54:01,77 --> 01:54:04,24
What have you got hidden in your hand?

01:54:39,87 --> 01:54:41,84
Scarlett, you killed him.

01:54:43,01 --> 01:54:44,87
I'm glad you killed him.

01:54:46,05 --> 01:54:50,00
Scarlett, what happened? What is it, Scarlett? What is it?

01:54:53,85 --> 01:54:57,08
Don't be scared, chickens. Your big sister was cleaning a revolver

01:54:57,16 --> 01:54:59,72
and it went off and nearly scared her to death.

01:54:59,79 --> 01:55:03,32
Oh, thank goodness. Haven't we got enough to frighten us?

01:55:03,35 --> 01:55:05,66
Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful.

01:55:08,87 --> 01:55:11,03
What a cool liar you are, Melly.

01:55:11,07 --> 01:55:14,21
We've got to get him out of here and bury him.

01:55:14,24 --> 01:55:16,17
If the Yankees find him here, they'll

01:55:16,24 --> 01:55:19,30
I didn't see anyone else. I think he must be a deserter.

01:55:19,38 --> 01:55:21,01
But even so, we've got to hide him.

01:55:21,08 --> 01:55:24,85
They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you.

01:55:27,75 --> 01:55:30,38
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft

01:55:30,46 --> 01:55:32,92
but how will I get him out of here?

01:55:33,56 --> 01:55:35,19
We'll both take a leg and drag him.

01:55:35,26 --> 01:55:37,02
You couldn't drag a cat.

01:55:41,49 --> 01:55:47,17
Do you think it would be dishonest if we went through his haversack?

01:55:47,24 --> 01:55:49,71
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.

01:55:49,78 --> 01:55:52,61
You take the haversack, I'll search his pockets.

01:56:04,82 --> 01:56:06,09
You look.

01:56:06,49 --> 01:56:08,26
I'm feeling a little weak.

01:56:08,33 --> 01:56:10,92
Melly, I think it's full of money.

01:56:11,76 --> 01:56:13,36
Oh, Melly, look.

01:56:13,43 --> 01:56:14,39
Look.

01:56:14,43 --> 01:56:16,30
$10, $20, $30, $40

01:56:16,34 --> 01:56:18,46
Don't stop to count it now. We haven't got time.

01:56:18,54 --> 01:56:21,03
Do you realize this means we'll have something to eat?

01:56:21,11 --> 01:56:22,94
Look in his other pockets.

01:56:24,98 --> 01:56:26,41
Hurry, hurry.

01:56:26,61 --> 01:56:28,98
We've got to get him out of here. Here.

01:56:42,26 --> 01:56:45,16
If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it.

01:56:45,23 --> 01:56:48,24
Give me your nightgown, Melly. I'll wad it around his head.

01:56:48,27 --> 01:56:49,86
Don't be silly. I won't look at you.

01:56:49,94 --> 01:56:53,27
If I had my petticoat or pantalets, I'd use them.

01:57:06,85 --> 01:57:09,15
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.

01:57:10,16 --> 01:57:12,68
Now go back to bed. You'll be dead if you don't.

01:57:12,76 --> 01:57:15,42
I'll clean up the mess when I've buried him.

01:57:15,49 --> 01:57:17,66
No, I'll clean it up.

01:57:21,03 --> 01:57:23,33
Well, I guess I've done murder.

01:57:24,90 --> 01:57:27,03
I won't think about that now.

01:57:27,11 --> 01:57:29,37
I'll think about that tomorrow.

01:57:38,68 --> 01:57:40,21
Katie Scarlett.

01:57:41,15 --> 01:57:44,39
Katie Scarlett.

01:57:44,42 --> 01:57:45,53
It's over. It's over.

01:57:45,86 --> 01:57:47,72
It's all over. The war.

01:57:47,79 --> 01:57:49,32
Lee surrendered.

01:57:49,40 --> 01:57:51,99
It's not possible. Why did we ever fight?

01:57:52,06 --> 01:57:54,12
Ashley will be coming home.

01:57:54,20 --> 01:57:56,43
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.

01:57:56,50 --> 01:57:58,13
We'll plant more cotton.

01:57:58,20 --> 01:58:00,17
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.

01:58:17,49 --> 01:58:19,72
While we were marching through Georgia

01:58:19,79 --> 01:58:20,48
Hurrah, hurrah.

01:58:22,66 --> 01:58:24,19
Hurrah, hurrah.

01:58:24,26 --> 01:58:26,13
The flag that makes you free

01:58:26,20 --> 01:58:29,17
So we sing the chorus from Atlanta to the sea

01:58:29,37 --> 01:58:32,10
While we were marching through Georgia

01:58:33,17 --> 01:58:35,27
Get out of the road, rebel. Get out of the way.

01:58:35,34 --> 01:58:37,64
Have you room in your carriage for a dying man?

01:58:37,71 --> 01:58:40,37
I got no room for any Southern scum, alive or dead.

01:58:40,45 --> 01:58:41,85
Get out of the way.

01:58:41,91 --> 01:58:44,44
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.

01:58:44,52 --> 01:58:47,15
Giddap. Jump, you gray-backed beggars.

01:58:47,29 --> 01:58:49,19
Act like they won the war.

01:58:49,86 --> 01:58:52,59
Now you come on and give me them pants, Mr. Kennedy.

01:58:52,66 --> 01:58:53,72
Come on.

01:58:56,00 --> 01:58:59,52
You scrub yourseIf with that strong lye soap before I scrubs you myself.

01:58:59,60 --> 01:59:02,66
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot.

01:59:05,37 --> 01:59:07,81
The whole Confederate Army's got the same trouble

01:59:07,87 --> 01:59:09,93
Crawling clothes and dysentery.

01:59:10,84 --> 01:59:12,74
It's humiliating, how you treat Mr. Kennedy.

01:59:12,81 --> 01:59:17,08
You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.

01:59:18,68 --> 01:59:20,05
Come on, Beau.

01:59:20,12 --> 01:59:24,39
We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry.

01:59:24,79 --> 01:59:27,66
I don't mind, ma'am. Good to see a youngster again.

01:59:27,73 --> 01:59:29,16
Nice little fellow.

01:59:29,20 --> 01:59:32,93
Another two years of war and we could have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.

01:59:33,80 --> 01:59:35,29
Were you in Cobb's Legion?

01:59:35,37 --> 01:59:36,66
Yes, ma'am.

01:59:36,74 --> 01:59:39,97
Why, then, you must know my husband, Maj. Wilkes.

01:59:40,04 --> 01:59:41,54
Oh, yes, ma'am.

01:59:41,57 --> 01:59:45,46
He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.

01:59:46,21 --> 01:59:48,48
Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't

01:59:48,55 --> 01:59:51,21
Oh, my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison.

01:59:51,28 --> 01:59:52,51
Melanie.

01:59:52,62 --> 01:59:55,38
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming. Come along, Beau.

01:59:55,45 --> 01:59:57,79
I'll watch out for him, ma'am. We're good friends.

01:59:57,86 --> 01:59:59,35
Oh, thank you.

02:00:03,76 --> 02:00:07,22
I slave day and night so we can have food to keep body and soul together.

02:00:07,30 --> 02:00:09,77
And you give it all away to these starving scarecrows.

02:00:09,84 --> 02:00:11,80
I'd sooner have a plague of locusts here.

02:00:11,87 --> 02:00:13,81
Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.

02:00:13,87 --> 02:00:16,64
I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner.

02:00:16,71 --> 02:00:18,40
Ashley, a prisoner? Yes.

02:00:18,48 --> 02:00:22,68
And maybe if he's alive and well, he's on some Northern road right now.

02:00:23,05 --> 02:00:26,28
And maybe some Northern woman is giving him a share of her dinner

02:00:26,35 --> 02:00:29,41
and helping my beloved to come back home to me.

02:00:31,36 --> 02:00:32,52
I hope so, Melly.

02:00:32,59 --> 02:00:34,45
Miss Scarlett.

02:00:37,46 --> 02:00:40,90
Miss Scarlett, I want to take up something with your pa, but

02:00:40,97 --> 02:00:42,06
he doesn't seem to

02:00:42,13 --> 02:00:45,17
Perhaps I can help you. I'm head of the house now.

02:00:45,20 --> 02:00:46,18
Well, I

02:00:46,22 --> 02:00:50,10
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask for Suellen.

02:00:50,71 --> 02:00:53,01
Do you mean to tell me you haven't asked for her

02:00:53,08 --> 02:00:55,32
after all these years she's been counting on you?

02:00:55,35 --> 02:00:59,11
Well, the truth is, I'm so much older than she is, and

02:00:59,25 --> 02:01:01,45
Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.

02:01:01,52 --> 02:01:03,15
Who has nowadays?

02:01:03,32 --> 02:01:06,26
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you

02:01:06,33 --> 02:01:08,95
you can be sure your sister will be rich in that.

02:01:09,03 --> 02:01:12,66
I'll go out somewhere and get myseIf a little business if we're engaged.

02:01:12,73 --> 02:01:14,29
As soon as I get on my feet again

02:01:14,37 --> 02:01:16,86
All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa.

02:01:16,87 --> 02:01:18,47
You go ask her now.

02:01:18,51 --> 02:01:21,68
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

02:01:24,71 --> 02:01:26,74
Excuse me, excuse me.

02:01:29,48 --> 02:01:32,45
Scarlett, what seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

02:01:32,52 --> 02:01:34,48
More trouble than he guesses.

02:01:34,52 --> 02:01:36,42
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.

02:01:36,49 --> 02:01:38,08
Oh, I'm so glad.

02:01:38,16 --> 02:01:42,75
It's a pity he can't marry her now. At least there'd be one less mouth to feed.

02:01:46,20 --> 02:01:47,72
Oh, another one.

02:01:48,30 --> 02:01:49,63
I hope this one isn't hungry.

02:01:49,70 --> 02:01:50,79
He'll be hungry.

02:01:50,87 --> 02:01:53,70
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate

02:02:05,15 --> 02:02:06,34
Ashley.

02:02:08,49 --> 02:02:09,75
Ashley.

02:02:11,46 --> 02:02:13,00
Darling.

02:02:22,84 --> 02:02:25,53
Miss Scarlett. Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.

02:02:25,60 --> 02:02:28,51
Turn me loose, you fool. Turn me loose, it's Ashley.

02:02:28,57 --> 02:02:30,67
He's her husband, ain't he?

02:02:42,89 --> 02:02:45,08
Miss Scarlett, ma'am. High time you got back.

02:02:45,16 --> 02:02:47,26
Did you get the horse shod? Yes, he shod all right.

02:02:47,30 --> 02:02:51,86
Fine thing when a horse can get shoes and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.

02:02:51,93 --> 02:02:54,06
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.

02:02:54,10 --> 02:02:57,50
I gotta know how much money have you got left, in gold.

02:02:57,74 --> 02:02:59,43
$10. Why?

02:03:00,51 --> 02:03:01,73
That won't be enough.

02:03:01,81 --> 02:03:04,00
What in heaven's name are you talking about?

02:03:04,08 --> 02:03:08,52
Well, Miss Scarlett, I seed that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson

02:03:08,55 --> 02:03:11,08
that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

02:03:11,15 --> 02:03:14,55
He's a regular Yankee now, and he was making a brag

02:03:14,82 --> 02:03:20,20
that his carpetbagger friends done run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

02:03:20,23 --> 02:03:21,76
But how much more have we got to pay?

02:03:21,83 --> 02:03:24,89
I hear the taxman say $300.

02:03:24,96 --> 02:03:26,30
$300.00 

02:03:27,77 --> 02:03:30,00
Might just as well be $3 million.

02:03:30,07 --> 02:03:31,87
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

02:03:31,94 --> 02:03:33,13
Yes, ma'am.

02:03:33,21 --> 02:03:34,23
How?

02:03:36,64 --> 02:03:37,97
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.

02:03:38,04 --> 02:03:40,38
Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.

02:03:40,45 --> 02:03:43,24
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?

02:03:45,32 --> 02:03:46,91
Asking ain't getting.

02:03:56,30 --> 02:03:57,49
Ashley.

02:03:58,76 --> 02:04:02,03
They say Abe LincoIn got his start splitting rails.

02:04:02,20 --> 02:04:04,67
Think what heights I may climb to once I get the knack.

02:04:05,31 --> 02:04:09,14
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.

02:04:10,38 --> 02:04:11,97
What shall we do?

02:04:12,68 --> 02:04:15,01
Ashley, what's to become of us?

02:04:15,28 --> 02:04:18,77
What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up?

02:04:18,85 --> 02:04:21,82
Those who have brains and courage come through all right.

02:04:21,89 --> 02:04:23,55
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

02:04:23,62 --> 02:04:26,92
For heaven's sake, don't stand there talking nonsense at me

02:04:26,99 --> 02:04:28,86
when it's us who are being winnowed out.

02:04:28,93 --> 02:04:30,66
You're right, Scarlett.

02:04:30,73 --> 02:04:33,76
Here I am talking tommyrot about civilization

02:04:33,83 --> 02:04:35,93
when your Tara's in danger.

02:04:36,10 --> 02:04:39,47
You've come to me for help, and I've no help to give you.

02:04:39,54 --> 02:04:41,20
Oh, Scarlett, I

02:04:41,27 --> 02:04:42,76
I'm a coward.

02:04:43,54 --> 02:04:45,41
You, Ashley, a coward?

02:04:46,18 --> 02:04:47,98
What are you afraid of?

02:04:48,05 --> 02:04:51,54
Oh, mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose.

02:04:52,72 --> 02:04:55,08
Not that I mind splitting rails

02:04:55,52 --> 02:04:59,89
but I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved.

02:05:02,03 --> 02:05:06,52
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

02:05:07,13 --> 02:05:09,03
But the war did come.

02:05:09,27 --> 02:05:11,93
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

02:05:12,00 --> 02:05:15,06
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them.

02:05:15,77 --> 02:05:19,84
And now I find myseIf in a world which for me is worse than death.

02:05:20,61 --> 02:05:23,41
A world in which there's no place for me.

02:05:25,08 --> 02:05:28,99
I can never make you understand because you don't know the meaning of fear.

02:05:29,05 --> 02:05:31,49
You never mind facing realities

02:05:32,29 --> 02:05:35,16
and you never want to escape from them as I do.

02:05:37,80 --> 02:05:38,99
Escape?

02:05:40,33 --> 02:05:42,10
Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.

02:05:42,50 --> 02:05:44,44
I do want to escape, too.

02:05:44,77 --> 02:05:48,91
I'm so very tired of it all. I've struggled for food and for money.

02:05:48,94 --> 02:05:53,34
I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton until I can't stand it another minute.

02:05:53,41 --> 02:05:54,88
I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead. It's dead.

02:05:54,92 --> 02:06:00,71
The Yankees and the carpetbaggers have got it and there's nothing left for us.

02:06:02,12 --> 02:06:03,42
Oh, Ashley

02:06:04,26 --> 02:06:05,88
let's run away.

02:06:05,96 --> 02:06:07,15
We'd go to Mexico.

02:06:07,23 --> 02:06:10,42
They want officers in the Mexican Army. We could be so happy there.

02:06:10,50 --> 02:06:14,61
I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you. You know you don't love Melanie.

02:06:14,64 --> 02:06:16,56
You told me you loved me that day at Twelve Oaks.

02:06:16,64 --> 02:06:18,57
And anyway, Melanie can't

02:06:18,64 --> 02:06:22,40
Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have any more children and I could give you

02:06:22,44 --> 02:06:24,00
Can't we ever forget that day at Twelve Oaks?

02:06:24,04 --> 02:06:27,38
Do you think I could ever forget it? Have you forgotten it?

02:06:27,41 --> 02:06:30,11
Can you honestly say you don't love me?

02:06:31,12 --> 02:06:33,48
No. I don't love you. It's a lie.

02:06:33,59 --> 02:06:38,03
Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie and the baby, break Melanie's heart?

02:06:38,06 --> 02:06:39,71
You couldn't leave your father and the girls.

02:06:39,79 --> 02:06:42,52
I could leave them. I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them.

02:06:42,59 --> 02:06:46,50
Yes, you're sick and tired. That's why you're talking this way.

02:06:47,17 --> 02:06:49,36
You've carried the load for all of us

02:06:49,43 --> 02:06:52,73
but from now on I'm going to be more help to you, I promise.

02:06:52,80 --> 02:06:54,90
There's only one way you can help me.

02:06:54,97 --> 02:06:56,44
Take me away.

02:06:56,61 --> 02:06:58,94
There's nothing to keep us here.

02:06:59,91 --> 02:07:01,17
Nothing.

02:07:02,88 --> 02:07:04,68
Nothing except honor.

02:07:17,30 --> 02:07:19,03
Oh, please, Scarlett.

02:07:19,10 --> 02:07:21,33
Please, dear, you mustn't cry.

02:07:21,53 --> 02:07:22,59
You mustn't.

02:07:22,67 --> 02:07:25,47
Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.

02:07:38,45 --> 02:07:40,71
You do love me, you do love me.

02:07:40,79 --> 02:07:42,65
Say it, say it. Don't, don't.

02:07:42,69 --> 02:07:44,52
You love me, you love me.

02:07:44,59 --> 02:07:48,70
We won't do this, I tell you. It won't happen again.

02:07:48,73 --> 02:07:50,76
I'm going to take Melanie and the baby, and go.

02:07:50,80 --> 02:07:54,53
All right, I'll say it. I love your courage and your stubbornness.

02:07:54,57 --> 02:07:58,27
So much that I could have forgotten the best wife a man ever had.

02:07:58,34 --> 02:08:01,24
But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.

02:08:07,54 --> 02:08:12,88
Then there's nothing left for me.

02:08:13,89 --> 02:08:15,94
Nothing to fight for.

02:08:16,79 --> 02:08:18,72
Nothing to live for.

02:08:21,43 --> 02:08:23,39
Yes, there is something.

02:08:24,33 --> 02:08:26,85
Something you love better than me

02:08:27,13 --> 02:08:29,23
though you may not know it.

02:08:34,97 --> 02:08:36,10
Tara.

02:08:39,88 --> 02:08:41,44
Yes, I

02:08:43,22 --> 02:08:44,88
I still have this.

02:08:49,89 --> 02:08:51,41
You needn't go.

02:08:52,09 --> 02:08:56,42
I won't have you all starve simply because I threw myseIf at your head.

02:08:56,46 --> 02:08:59,34
It won't happen again.

02:09:26,39 --> 02:09:28,88
Why, it's Emmy Slattery. Yes, ma'am, it's me.

02:09:28,96 --> 02:09:30,05
Stop.

02:09:30,70 --> 02:09:33,60
You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you?

02:09:34,43 --> 02:09:36,33
Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

02:09:36,40 --> 02:09:39,37
Get off those steps, you trashy wench. Get off this land.

02:09:39,44 --> 02:09:41,27
You can't speak that way to my wife.

02:09:41,34 --> 02:09:43,90
Wife. High time you made her your wife.

02:09:43,98 --> 02:09:46,67
Who baptized your other brats after you killed my mother?

02:09:46,75 --> 02:09:52,08
We came out here to pay a friendly call and talk a little business with old friends.

02:09:52,11 --> 02:09:54,35
Friends. When were we ever friends with the likes of you?

02:09:54,39 --> 02:09:58,11
Still high and mighty, ain't you? Well, I know all about you.

02:09:58,14 --> 02:09:59,38
I know your father's turned idiot.

02:09:59,46 --> 02:10:00,95
You can't pay your taxes.

02:10:01,03 --> 02:10:03,59
And I come here to offer to buy the place from you

02:10:03,66 --> 02:10:05,39
to make you a right good offer.

02:10:05,46 --> 02:10:07,06
Emmy's had a hankering to live here.

02:10:07,13 --> 02:10:08,90
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.

02:10:08,97 --> 02:10:12,33
You high-flying Irish will find out who's running things around here

02:10:12,40 --> 02:10:14,07
when you get sold out for taxes.

02:10:14,14 --> 02:10:17,07
I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel and I'll live in it.

02:10:17,14 --> 02:10:19,54
But I'll wait for the Sheriff's sale.

02:10:19,61 --> 02:10:22,10
That's all of Tara you'll ever get.

02:10:23,32 --> 02:10:25,31
You'll be sorry for that.

02:10:33,83 --> 02:10:35,12
We'll be back.

02:10:35,19 --> 02:10:37,89
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.

02:10:43,24 --> 02:10:44,73
Pa, come back.

02:10:47,87 --> 02:10:49,03
Pa, come back.

02:10:49,11 --> 02:10:50,13
Pa.

02:10:51,81 --> 02:10:53,30
Yankee coward.

02:11:01,25 --> 02:11:02,28
Pa.

02:11:22,77 --> 02:11:25,87
Lordsy, Miss Scarlett. That's Mr. Gerald's watch.

02:11:26,14 --> 02:11:29,31
You take it. It's for you. Pa'd want you to have it.

02:11:29,38 --> 02:11:32,71
You ain't got no business parting from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.

02:11:32,78 --> 02:11:36,22
You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money.

02:11:36,39 --> 02:11:38,79
You think I'd sell Pa's watch?

02:11:40,06 --> 02:11:41,58
And don't cry.

02:11:42,29 --> 02:11:45,06
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.

02:11:48,73 --> 02:11:50,43
Oh, Mammy, Mammy.

02:11:56,34 --> 02:12:00,74
You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett, you just gotta go on being brave.

02:12:00,95 --> 02:12:02,94
Think about your pa like he used to be.

02:12:03,01 --> 02:12:04,85
I can't think about Pa.

02:12:05,08 --> 02:12:07,25
I can't think of anything but that $300.

02:12:07,29 --> 02:12:09,45
Ain't no good thinking about that, Miss Scarlett.

02:12:09,52 --> 02:12:11,28
Ain't nobody got that much money.

02:12:12,29 --> 02:12:15,85
Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got that much money now.

02:12:18,03 --> 02:12:19,09
Rhett.

02:12:19,16 --> 02:12:20,89
Who that? A Yankee?

02:12:26,07 --> 02:12:28,97
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and

02:12:29,84 --> 02:12:31,71
I haven't any clothes.

02:12:41,32 --> 02:12:44,45
Scoot up to the attic and get down Ma's old box of dress patterns.

02:12:44,52 --> 02:12:46,32
What you up to with Miss Ellen's portiere?

02:12:46,39 --> 02:12:47,48
You'll make me a new dress.

02:12:47,56 --> 02:12:50,39
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres. Not while I got breath in me.

02:12:50,46 --> 02:12:53,06
Great balls of fire. They're my portieres now.

02:12:53,13 --> 02:12:56,97
I'm going to Atlanta for that $300 and I've got to go looking like a queen.

02:12:57,00 --> 02:12:58,96
Who going to Atlanta with you? I'm going alone.

02:12:59,04 --> 02:13:01,44
That's what you think. I's going to Atlanta with you.

02:13:01,51 --> 02:13:03,06
With you and that new dress.

02:13:03,14 --> 02:13:04,17
Now, Mammy, darling.

02:13:04,24 --> 02:13:06,23
No use to try to sweet-talk me, Miss Scarlett.

02:13:06,31 --> 02:13:09,01
I's knowed you since I put the first pair of diapers on you.

02:13:09,08 --> 02:13:11,67
I said I's going to Atlanta with you, and going I is.

02:13:12,32 --> 02:13:15,48
Kings and treys, huh? Too good for me, Major.

02:13:15,89 --> 02:13:18,72
Pity we couldn't have fought the war out in a poker game.

02:13:18,79 --> 02:13:21,82
You'd have done better than Gen. Grant with far less effort.

02:13:21,89 --> 02:13:23,02
What is it, Corporal?

02:13:23,09 --> 02:13:26,83
Sir, there's a lady to see Capt. Butler. Says she's his sister.

02:13:26,90 --> 02:13:28,42
Another sister?

02:13:28,77 --> 02:13:31,13
This is a jail, not a harem, Capt. Butler.

02:13:31,20 --> 02:13:33,03
No, Major, she ain't one of those.

02:13:33,10 --> 02:13:35,57
This one's got her mammy with her.

02:13:35,81 --> 02:13:36,97
She has?

02:13:38,08 --> 02:13:41,34
I'd like to see this one, Major, without her mammy.

02:13:42,85 --> 02:13:46,15
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what?

02:13:48,12 --> 02:13:49,71
$340.00 

02:13:49,79 --> 02:13:52,52
My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?

02:13:52,72 --> 02:13:53,95
All right, Corporal.

02:13:54,03 --> 02:13:56,89
Show Capt. Butler's sister to his cell.

02:13:57,76 --> 02:14:00,49
Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.

02:14:05,07 --> 02:14:08,67
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.

02:14:10,74 --> 02:14:11,76
Rhett. Scarlett.

02:14:11,80 --> 02:14:16,21
My dear little sister.

02:14:17,18 --> 02:14:21,35
It's all right, Corporal. My sister has brought me no files or saws.

02:14:26,69 --> 02:14:27,89
Can I really kiss you now?

02:14:27,96 --> 02:14:30,09
On the forehead like a good brother.

02:14:30,16 --> 02:14:32,86
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things.

02:14:33,67 --> 02:14:36,69
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail.

02:14:36,73 --> 02:14:38,72
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.

02:14:38,79 --> 02:14:40,79
It's not true they're going to hang you?

02:14:40,86 --> 02:14:42,02
Would you be sorry?

02:14:42,13 --> 02:14:43,96
Oh, Rhett. Well, don't worry yet.

02:14:44,03 --> 02:14:46,00
They have plotted some charge against me

02:14:46,07 --> 02:14:47,76
but they're really after my money.

02:14:47,84 --> 02:14:50,17
They think I made off with the Confederate Treasury.

02:14:50,24 --> 02:14:51,73
Well, did you?

02:14:51,91 --> 02:14:53,47
What a leading question.

02:14:53,54 --> 02:14:56,03
But let's not talk about sordid things like money.

02:14:56,11 --> 02:14:59,34
How good of you to come and see me. And how pretty you look.

02:14:59,41 --> 02:15:02,38
Oh, Rhett, how you do run on, teasing a country girl like me.

02:15:02,45 --> 02:15:05,72
Thank heavens you're not in rags. I'm tired of seeing women in rags.

02:15:05,79 --> 02:15:07,19
Turn around.

02:15:07,82 --> 02:15:10,35
You look good enough to eat. And prosperous, too.

02:15:10,43 --> 02:15:12,29
Thank you, I've been doing very well.

02:15:12,33 --> 02:15:14,16
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only

02:15:14,20 --> 02:15:17,80
I got so bored I just thought I'd treat myseIf to a visit to town.

02:15:17,83 --> 02:15:20,56
You're a heartless creature. But that's part of your charm.

02:15:20,64 --> 02:15:22,94
You know you've got more charm than the law allows.

02:15:22,97 --> 02:15:25,53
Now I didn't come here to talk silliness about me, Rhett.

02:15:25,61 --> 02:15:28,70
I came because I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.

02:15:28,78 --> 02:15:31,64
I was mad at you the night you left me on the road to Tara

02:15:31,71 --> 02:15:33,24
and I still haven't forgiven you.

02:15:33,32 --> 02:15:34,91
Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.

02:15:34,98 --> 02:15:39,02
Well, I must admit I might not be alive now, only for you.

02:15:39,05 --> 02:15:45,46
And when I think of myseIf with everything I could possibly hope for

02:15:45,49 --> 02:15:47,57
and not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail

02:15:47,60 --> 02:15:50,20
and not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail.

02:15:51,63 --> 02:15:54,19
Oh, listen to me trying to make jokes when

02:15:54,27 --> 02:15:56,33
when I really want to cry.

02:15:56,47 --> 02:15:58,44
In a minute I shall cry.

02:16:01,54 --> 02:16:04,38
Scarlett, can it be possible that

02:16:05,08 --> 02:16:07,05
Can what be possible, Rhett?

02:16:07,12 --> 02:16:10,61
That you've grown a woman's heart, a real woman's heart?

02:16:10,85 --> 02:16:13,91
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

02:16:15,79 --> 02:16:19,59
You know, it's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.

02:16:20,90 --> 02:16:22,63
It's well worth it.

02:16:27,14 --> 02:16:29,60
You can drop the moonlight and magnolias, Scarlett.

02:16:29,67 --> 02:16:32,07
So things have been going well at Tara, have they?

02:16:32,14 --> 02:16:33,66
What have you done with your hands?

02:16:33,74 --> 02:16:35,64
I went riding last week without my gloves.

02:16:35,71 --> 02:16:39,11
These don't belong to a lady. You've worked with them like a field hand.

02:16:39,18 --> 02:16:41,01
Why did you lie? What are you up to?

02:16:41,08 --> 02:16:43,78
In another minute, I'd almost believe you cared something.

02:16:43,85 --> 02:16:44,94
But I do care.

02:16:45,02 --> 02:16:46,42
Suppose we get down to the truth.

02:16:46,49 --> 02:16:48,25
You want something from me badly enough

02:16:48,32 --> 02:16:50,72
to put on quite a show in your velvets.

02:16:50,79 --> 02:16:52,19
What is it? Money?

02:16:53,33 --> 02:16:55,92
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

02:16:56,20 --> 02:16:58,93
I did lie to you when I said everything was all right.

02:16:59,00 --> 02:17:03,29
Things are just as bad as they possibly could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.

02:17:03,97 --> 02:17:05,84
What collateral are you offering?

02:17:05,94 --> 02:17:07,53
My earbobs. Not interested.

02:17:07,61 --> 02:17:09,84
A mortgage on Tara. What would I do with a farm?

02:17:09,88 --> 02:17:12,68
You wouldn't lose. I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.

02:17:12,75 --> 02:17:15,51
Not good enough. Have you nothing better?

02:17:17,35 --> 02:17:19,48
You once said you loved me.

02:17:19,86 --> 02:17:22,05
If you still love me, Rhett

02:17:22,12 --> 02:17:25,32
You haven't forgotten that I'm not a marrying man?

02:17:25,39 --> 02:17:27,69
No, I haven't forgotten.

02:17:31,34 --> 02:17:35,26
You're not worth $300.

02:17:35,78 --> 02:17:38,65
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man.

02:17:38,72 --> 02:17:39,78
Go on, insuIt me.

02:17:39,85 --> 02:17:42,02
I don't care what you say, only give me the money.

02:17:42,09 --> 02:17:45,86
I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go while there's a breath left in my body.

02:17:46,09 --> 02:17:47,15
Oh, Rhett.

02:17:47,46 --> 02:17:49,59
Won't you please give me the money?

02:17:49,76 --> 02:17:52,13
I couldn't give you the money if I wanted to.

02:17:52,20 --> 02:17:54,29
My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.

02:17:54,37 --> 02:17:58,20
If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be on me like a duck on a June bug.

02:17:58,37 --> 02:18:01,34
So you see, my dear, you've abased yourseIf to no purpose.

02:18:04,58 --> 02:18:06,33
Here, here, here, stop it.

02:18:06,37 --> 02:18:09,28
Want the Yankees to see you like this?

02:18:09,35 --> 02:18:11,18
Take your hands off me, you skunk.

02:18:11,29 --> 02:18:13,55
You knew what I was going to say before I started.

02:18:13,62 --> 02:18:17,13
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and yet you let me go on.

02:18:17,16 --> 02:18:18,76
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.

02:18:18,83 --> 02:18:21,99
Cheer up. You can come to my hanging and I'll remember you in my will.

02:18:22,03 --> 02:18:24,66
I'll come to your hanging. The only thing I'm afraid of

02:18:24,70 --> 02:18:28,33
is that they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara.

02:18:34,13 --> 02:18:36,60
Tell him Belle Watling.

02:18:36,68 --> 02:18:39,51
Where you been lately? Thought you'd deserted Capt. Butler.

02:18:39,58 --> 02:18:42,28
Oh, I keep myseIf occupied. Help me out.

02:18:51,33 --> 02:18:55,43
Who that? I ain't never seen hair that color before in my life.

02:18:55,46 --> 02:18:57,09
Does you know a dyed-haired woman?

02:18:57,17 --> 02:19:00,26
I wish I did know that one. She'd get my money for me.

02:19:02,04 --> 02:19:04,44
No matter what they done to you in that jail

02:19:04,51 --> 02:19:07,55
they didn't do no more than you deserve

02:19:07,58 --> 02:19:08,70
for visiting white trash in a jail.

02:19:15,25 --> 02:19:16,44
Fresh and green.

02:19:17,75 --> 02:19:19,81
Hey, what are you doing tonight, Susy?

02:19:19,89 --> 02:19:21,55
That's one of them Georgia peaches.

02:19:21,62 --> 02:19:22,98
There's nothing like that in Ohio.

02:19:23,02 --> 02:19:26,32
You know what we're going to do? What?

02:19:26,39 --> 02:19:29,42
We're going to give every last one of you 40 acres and a mule.

02:19:29,50 --> 02:19:31,93
And a mule? Forty acres and a mule.

02:19:32,03 --> 02:19:33,16
Gee.

02:19:33,23 --> 02:19:35,00
'Cause we're your friends

02:19:35,07 --> 02:19:36,97
and you're gonna become voters

02:19:37,04 --> 02:19:39,30
and you're gonna vote like your friends do.

02:19:41,40 --> 02:19:42,73
What's your hurry, sister?

02:19:42,77 --> 02:19:44,23
What's come over this here town?

02:19:44,27 --> 02:19:47,92
Yankees have come over it. Same as they've come over all of us.

02:19:49,99 --> 02:19:51,49
Out of our way, trash.

02:19:52,20 --> 02:19:53,24
Get out of the way here.

02:19:53,28 --> 02:19:54,49
Get away. Go on.

02:20:03,08 --> 02:20:04,75
Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett.

02:20:04,79 --> 02:20:06,75
Why Frank Kennedy. And Mammy.

02:20:06,80 --> 02:20:08,76
It sure is good to see home folks.

02:20:08,80 --> 02:20:10,34
I didn't know you were in Atlanta.

02:20:10,38 --> 02:20:11,84
I didn't know you were.

02:20:11,88 --> 02:20:14,10
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you about my store?

02:20:14,47 --> 02:20:16,68
Did she? I don't remember. Have you a store?

02:20:17,60 --> 02:20:18,44
This?

02:20:18,47 --> 02:20:20,77
Won't you come in, and look around a bit?

02:20:29,28 --> 02:20:31,95
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady, but

02:20:31,99 --> 02:20:33,78
I can't help being proud of it.

02:20:34,57 --> 02:20:35,87
You're not making money?

02:20:35,91 --> 02:20:39,08
Well, I can't complain. In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

02:20:39,58 --> 02:20:41,71
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.

02:20:42,21 --> 02:20:45,08
It won't be long now before Miss Suellen and I can marry.

02:20:45,38 --> 02:20:47,04
Are you doing as well as all that?

02:20:47,09 --> 02:20:48,84
Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.

02:20:48,88 --> 02:20:50,84
I'm no millionaire yet

02:20:50,88 --> 02:20:53,18
but I've cleared $1, 000 already.

02:20:53,47 --> 02:20:54,64
And lumber too.

02:20:54,68 --> 02:20:55,80
Well

02:20:56,47 --> 02:20:57,85
that's only a sideline.

02:20:57,89 --> 02:20:59,43
A sideline, Frank?

02:20:59,47 --> 02:21:03,46
With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta and all this building going on?

02:21:03,48 --> 02:21:05,98
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett

02:21:06,98 --> 02:21:09,15
and I've got to be thinking about buying a home.

02:21:09,19 --> 02:21:10,73
What do you want a home for?

02:21:10,78 --> 02:21:12,90
For Miss Suellen and me to set up housekeeping.

02:21:12,96 --> 02:21:17,03
Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her to Atlanta, wouldn't you?

02:21:17,70 --> 02:21:19,70
There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.

02:21:20,27 --> 02:21:23,58
I don't rightly know what you mean, Miss Scarlett.

02:21:24,08 --> 02:21:25,33
I don't mean a thing.

02:21:25,37 --> 02:21:28,59
Frank, how'd you like to drive me out to my Aunt Pitty's?

02:21:29,50 --> 02:21:31,84
Nothing would give me more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.

02:21:31,88 --> 02:21:33,63
You'd better stay to supper, too.

02:21:33,67 --> 02:21:37,14
I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable and I'd like a good long visit with you.

02:21:37,18 --> 02:21:40,12
Oh, you act on me just like a tonic, Miss Scarlett.

02:21:40,97 --> 02:21:42,98
And will you tell me all the news

02:21:43,27 --> 02:21:45,10
all the news of Miss Suellen?

02:21:47,98 --> 02:21:49,48
What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?

02:21:49,77 --> 02:21:51,44
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

02:21:51,48 --> 02:21:52,57
Oh, no, no.

02:21:53,07 --> 02:21:55,15
I thought surely she had written you.

02:21:55,20 --> 02:21:56,86
I guess she was ashamed to write you.

02:21:56,91 --> 02:21:58,53
She should be ashamed.

02:21:58,57 --> 02:22:01,24
Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.

02:22:01,29 --> 02:22:05,38
You must tell me, Miss Scarlett. Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

02:22:05,50 --> 02:22:08,50
Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month.

02:22:10,00 --> 02:22:13,63
She just got tired of waiting and was afraid she'd be an old maid and.

02:22:13,67 --> 02:22:15,88
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.

02:22:17,18 --> 02:22:19,80
Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.

02:22:20,10 --> 02:22:22,97
Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket?

02:22:39,24 --> 02:22:41,74
But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done.

02:22:42,45 --> 02:22:47,01
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.

02:22:47,04 --> 02:22:49,29
She did it to save Tara, you must understand that.

02:22:49,33 --> 02:22:50,71
I hate Tara.

02:22:50,75 --> 02:22:53,96
And I hate Scarlett. She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara.

02:22:58,64 --> 02:22:59,85
It's all my fault.

02:23:01,14 --> 02:23:04,52
I should have committed highway robbery to get that tax money for you.

02:23:04,56 --> 02:23:07,10
I couldn't let you do anything like that, and.

02:23:07,14 --> 02:23:08,73
Well, anyway, it's done now.

02:23:08,77 --> 02:23:10,15
Yes, it's done now.

02:23:11,27 --> 02:23:12,90
You wouldn't let me do anything dishonorable

02:23:12,94 --> 02:23:15,65
but you'd sell yourseIf in marriage to a man you didn't love.

02:23:16,74 --> 02:23:20,03
Well, at least you won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore.

02:23:21,37 --> 02:23:22,45
What do you mean?

02:23:22,87 --> 02:23:24,24
I'm going to New York.

02:23:24,94 --> 02:23:28,00
I've arranged to get a position in a bank there.

02:23:28,04 --> 02:23:29,33
But you can't do that.

02:23:31,46 --> 02:23:34,63
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business, Ashley

02:23:34,67 --> 02:23:36,80
and, well, I counted on you.

02:23:36,84 --> 02:23:38,30
I wouldn't be any good to you.

02:23:38,34 --> 02:23:40,01
I don't know anything about the lumber business.

02:23:40,05 --> 02:23:41,55
You know as much as you do about banking.

02:23:42,64 --> 02:23:44,77
And I'd give you haIf the business, Ashley.

02:23:45,64 --> 02:23:47,43
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

02:23:48,64 --> 02:23:49,94
But it isn't that.

02:23:50,35 --> 02:23:52,56
If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again

02:23:53,57 --> 02:23:56,11
I'dbury forever any hope of standing alone.

02:23:56,15 --> 02:23:57,24
Oh, is that all?

02:23:57,74 --> 02:24:02,10
Well, you could gradually buy the business and then it would be your own, and.

02:24:03,16 --> 02:24:04,45
No, Scarlett.

02:24:06,88 --> 02:24:09,74
Ashley.

02:24:17,05 --> 02:24:18,05
Ashley.

02:24:25,76 --> 02:24:26,85
Scarlett.

02:24:28,64 --> 02:24:30,02
Scarlett, what is it?

02:24:30,06 --> 02:24:31,65
Ashley's so mean and hateful.

02:24:32,77 --> 02:24:33,86
What have you done?

02:24:35,01 --> 02:24:38,19
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

02:24:38,24 --> 02:24:42,53
To help me start my lumber business, and he won't lift a finger to help me, and he.

02:24:42,57 --> 02:24:44,24
Why, how unchivalrous of you.

02:24:44,53 --> 02:24:46,24
Why, think, Ashley, think.

02:24:46,74 --> 02:24:49,54
If it hadn't been for Scarlett, I'd have died in Atlanta.

02:24:49,57 --> 02:24:52,79
And maybe we wouldn't have had little Beau, and

02:24:52,83 --> 02:24:56,30
and when I think of her picking cotton and plowing just to keep food

02:24:56,33 --> 02:24:58,31
in our mouths, I could just.

02:24:58,34 --> 02:24:59,34
Oh, my darling.

02:25:04,26 --> 02:25:05,55
All right, Melanie.

02:25:06,14 --> 02:25:07,35
I'll go to Atlanta.

02:25:09,27 --> 02:25:10,56
I can't fight you both.

02:25:26,62 --> 02:25:27,76
Quick then please

02:25:30,45 --> 02:25:33,04
Well, here's your new mill hands, Mrs. Kennedy.

02:25:33,54 --> 02:25:35,75
The pick of all the best jaiIs in Georgia.

02:25:36,84 --> 02:25:39,13
They look pretty thin and weak to me, Gallegher.

02:25:39,17 --> 02:25:39,76
Halt.

02:25:41,94 --> 02:25:44,31
They're the best you can lease, ma'am.

02:25:44,34 --> 02:25:47,22
And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher a free hand

02:25:47,26 --> 02:25:49,35
you'll get what you want out of them.

02:25:49,38 --> 02:25:51,06
All right, you're the foreman.

02:25:51,64 --> 02:25:55,23
All I ask is, you keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it.

02:25:55,27 --> 02:25:56,81
Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.

02:25:56,86 --> 02:25:57,94
But remember

02:25:58,27 --> 02:26:00,73
no questions and no interference.

02:26:01,23 --> 02:26:03,61
That's a bargain. Start them in the morning, Gallegher.

02:26:03,64 --> 02:26:05,94
Come on, get a move on. Come on, move on there.

02:26:05,98 --> 02:26:08,24
But, Scarlett, this isn't right and you know it.

02:26:08,74 --> 02:26:11,12
It's bad enough for a woman to be in business, but

02:26:11,16 --> 02:26:12,33
What are you complaining about?

02:26:12,37 --> 02:26:14,83
You wouldn't have owned a mill had I not taken over.

02:26:14,87 --> 02:26:16,63
I didn't want the mill, and we couldn't have bought it

02:26:16,67 --> 02:26:20,92
if you hadn't pressed all of our friends for the money they owed me.

02:26:20,96 --> 02:26:21,93
Isn't that right, Ashley?

02:26:21,96 --> 02:26:24,22
What are you running, a charitable institution?

02:26:24,26 --> 02:26:26,80
Go back to the store, then go home and take your medicine.

02:26:26,84 --> 02:26:27,93
You're not looking very well.

02:26:27,97 --> 02:26:30,22
But, sugar, shouldn't you come home with me?

02:26:30,26 --> 02:26:33,60
Great balls of fire. Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar.

02:26:33,64 --> 02:26:35,56
All right, all right.

02:26:36,06 --> 02:26:37,56
Good night, Ashley.

02:26:39,56 --> 02:26:42,15
She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw.

02:26:43,94 --> 02:26:46,11
Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but

02:26:46,15 --> 02:26:49,62
I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies instead of using convicts.

02:26:49,66 --> 02:26:50,99
I believe we could do better.

02:26:51,03 --> 02:26:54,12
Darkies. Why, their pay would break us, and convicts are dirt cheap.

02:26:54,16 --> 02:26:55,91
If we just give Gallegher a free hand

02:26:55,96 --> 02:26:59,42
A free hand. You know what that means. He'll starve them and whip them.

02:26:59,46 --> 02:27:01,42
Some of them are sick, underfed.

02:27:01,46 --> 02:27:03,21
Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.

02:27:03,26 --> 02:27:06,09
Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken three times a day and

02:27:06,13 --> 02:27:08,22
tucking them to sleep with eiderdown quilts.

02:27:08,26 --> 02:27:12,26
Scarlett, I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.

02:27:12,35 --> 02:27:14,10
You weren't so particular about owning slaves.

02:27:14,14 --> 02:27:16,89
That was different. We didn't treat them that way.

02:27:16,94 --> 02:27:19,23
Besides, I'd have freed them all when father died

02:27:19,27 --> 02:27:21,27
if the war hadn't already freed them.

02:27:21,57 --> 02:27:22,86
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

02:27:23,23 --> 02:27:25,69
But have you forgotten what it's like without money?

02:27:25,74 --> 02:27:28,61
I found out that money is the most important thing in the world

02:27:28,66 --> 02:27:31,12
and I don't intend ever to be without it again.

02:27:31,16 --> 02:27:34,12
I'll make enough so the Yankees can never take Tara away from me.

02:27:34,16 --> 02:27:35,62
I'll make it the only way I know how.

02:27:35,66 --> 02:27:38,21
But we're not the only Southerners who have suffered.

02:27:38,25 --> 02:27:42,00
Look at all our friends. They're keeping their honor and their kindness, too.

02:27:42,04 --> 02:27:45,80
And they're starving. I've got no use for fooIs who won't help themselves.

02:27:45,84 --> 02:27:48,30
I know what they're saying about me, and I don't care.

02:27:48,34 --> 02:27:50,10
I'll make friends with the Yankee carpetbaggers.

02:27:50,14 --> 02:27:53,35
And I'll beat them at their own game, and you'll beat them with me.

02:27:55,77 --> 02:27:58,14
That's it. Move it a little over to that side.

02:27:59,14 --> 02:28:00,73
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.

02:28:00,77 --> 02:28:01,81
Good afternoon.

02:28:01,86 --> 02:28:03,52
Business is certainly growing, ain't it?

02:28:03,57 --> 02:28:04,57
It certainly is.

02:28:06,15 --> 02:28:09,20
But you're doing business with the same people who robbed us

02:28:09,24 --> 02:28:11,82
and tortured us and left us to starve.

02:28:11,87 --> 02:28:13,12
All that's past, Melly.

02:28:13,16 --> 02:28:16,66
And I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things.

02:28:18,66 --> 02:28:22,71
And do you know, Dolly Merriwether, that Dr. Meade actually saw her

02:28:22,74 --> 02:28:25,13
peddling lumber to those Yankees, herself.

02:28:25,17 --> 02:28:26,21
And that isn't all.

02:28:26,25 --> 02:28:29,22
I think it's shocking what she's doing to my brother, Ashley.

02:28:29,26 --> 02:28:31,76
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.

02:28:39,56 --> 02:28:41,31
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.

02:28:41,35 --> 02:28:43,06
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.

02:28:43,65 --> 02:28:45,69
I don't see how you have the gall to face me.

02:28:45,73 --> 02:28:47,40
When I think you could have had my millions

02:28:47,44 --> 02:28:49,11
if you'd just waited a little while.

02:28:49,15 --> 02:28:50,86
Oh, how fickle is woman.

02:28:51,24 --> 02:28:53,70
What is it you want? I have important things to do.

02:28:53,74 --> 02:28:58,00
Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has bothered me for some time?

02:28:58,04 --> 02:28:59,25
Well, what is it? Be quick.

02:28:59,75 --> 02:29:03,17
Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love?

02:29:04,04 --> 02:29:06,96
How did you ever get out of jail? Why didn't they hang you?

02:29:07,96 --> 02:29:09,42
Oh, that. Not much trouble.

02:29:09,46 --> 02:29:11,22
There's nothing much that money won't buy.

02:29:11,26 --> 02:29:14,05
I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

02:29:14,97 --> 02:29:16,64
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.

02:29:17,26 --> 02:29:19,10
Do you know, I believe you're jealous of him.

02:29:19,14 --> 02:29:22,02
You still think you're the belle of the county, don't you?

02:29:22,06 --> 02:29:24,10
That you're the cutest little trick in shoe leather.

02:29:24,15 --> 02:29:26,32
And that every man you meet is dying of love for you.

02:29:26,36 --> 02:29:27,29
Let me by.

02:29:27,33 --> 02:29:30,86
Don't be angry, Scarlett. Tell me, where are you going?

02:29:31,36 --> 02:29:33,20
To the mill, if it's any of your business.

02:29:33,24 --> 02:29:34,70
Through shantytown, alone?

02:29:34,74 --> 02:29:38,20
Haven't you been told it's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff?

02:29:38,24 --> 02:29:39,83
Don't worry about me.

02:29:39,87 --> 02:29:42,54
I can shoot straight if I don't have to shoot too far.

02:29:50,26 --> 02:29:51,26
What a woman.

02:30:26,67 --> 02:30:28,29
Could ya gimme a quarter?

02:30:28,34 --> 02:30:29,67
Let go of my horse.

02:30:30,83 --> 02:30:33,22
Hold this horse.

02:30:40,84 --> 02:30:42,25
She has a gun.

02:30:44,14 --> 02:30:45,27
Help.

02:30:45,77 --> 02:30:47,15
Help.

02:30:48,77 --> 02:30:49,86
Help.

02:31:24,06 --> 02:31:25,35
Miss Scarlett.

02:31:42,53 --> 02:31:47,02
Miss Scarlett, wait. Miss Scarlett.

02:31:47,46 --> 02:31:48,92
Miss Scarlett. It's Big Sam.

02:31:48,96 --> 02:31:49,96
Big Sam.

02:31:50,33 --> 02:31:51,67
Miss Scarlett. Wait.

02:31:54,34 --> 02:31:55,76
Sam. Sam.

02:31:56,26 --> 02:31:58,76
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett? Did they hurt you?

02:31:59,42 --> 02:32:03,85
Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett. Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.

02:32:04,77 --> 02:32:05,85
Horse, make tracks.

02:32:09,94 --> 02:32:12,40
You get to Tara just as quick as you can, and stay there.

02:32:12,44 --> 02:32:14,86
I sure will. I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.

02:32:15,15 --> 02:32:17,63
Thank you, Mr. Frank. Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.

02:32:17,66 --> 02:32:19,20
Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.

02:32:19,24 --> 02:32:22,62
Scarlett, change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's for the evening.

02:32:22,66 --> 02:32:24,49
I've got to go to a political meeting.

02:32:24,53 --> 02:32:25,83
A political meeting.

02:32:25,87 --> 02:32:27,41
How can you go to a political meeting

02:32:27,45 --> 02:32:29,21
after what I've been through this afternoon?

02:32:29,25 --> 02:32:31,67
Oh, sugar. You're more scared than hurt.

02:32:32,33 --> 02:32:36,64
Nobody cares about me. You all act as though it was nothing at all.

02:32:58,15 --> 02:33:00,86
The men talk, talk, talk about protecting our women

02:33:01,15 --> 02:33:04,95
and after what happened to me today Frank has to go to a political meeting.

02:33:09,16 --> 02:33:11,08
And if it won't pain you too much, lndia Wilkes

02:33:11,12 --> 02:33:14,92
I'dbe much obliged if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.

02:33:14,95 --> 02:33:16,43
Has my face gone green or something?

02:33:16,46 --> 02:33:17,46
It won't pain me.

02:33:18,05 --> 02:33:20,72
What happened this afternoon was just what you deserved.

02:33:20,76 --> 02:33:22,93
And if there was any justice, you'd have gotten worse.

02:33:22,97 --> 02:33:23,93
India, hush up.

02:33:23,97 --> 02:33:26,31
Let her talk, Melanie. She's always hated me.

02:33:26,35 --> 02:33:27,93
Ever since I took your brother away from her

02:33:27,97 --> 02:33:30,10
though she's too much of a hypocrite to admit it.

02:33:30,14 --> 02:33:31,60
If she thought anyone'd go for her

02:33:31,64 --> 02:33:33,23
she'd walk down the street naked.

02:33:33,27 --> 02:33:34,77
I do hate you.

02:33:35,77 --> 02:33:38,94
You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people.

02:33:39,23 --> 02:33:41,82
Now you've endangered the lives of our men, because they

02:33:41,86 --> 02:33:43,03
India.

02:33:43,07 --> 02:33:46,66
I don't think we'd better say any more, or one of us will be saying too much.

02:33:46,95 --> 02:33:49,66
What's going on around here that I don't know about?

02:33:55,46 --> 02:33:57,29
Somebody's comin' up the walk.

02:33:57,34 --> 02:33:59,05
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.

02:33:59,96 --> 02:34:02,34
Will you hand me the pistol, please, Mrs. Meade?

02:34:08,85 --> 02:34:10,06
Whoever it is

02:34:11,27 --> 02:34:12,56
we know nothing.

02:34:16,36 --> 02:34:17,52
Where have they gone?

02:34:17,56 --> 02:34:19,82
You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes. It's life or death.

02:34:19,86 --> 02:34:22,03
Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.

02:34:22,07 --> 02:34:24,40
Quickly, please. There may still be time.

02:34:24,45 --> 02:34:25,61
How did you know?

02:34:25,66 --> 02:34:27,41
I've been playing poker with two Yankee captains.

02:34:27,45 --> 02:34:28,62
They knew there'd be trouble tonight.

02:34:28,66 --> 02:34:30,41
They've sent their cavalry out to be ready for it.

02:34:30,45 --> 02:34:32,62
Your husband and his friends are walking into a trap.

02:34:32,66 --> 02:34:34,87
Don't tell him. He's trying to trap you.

02:34:38,04 --> 02:34:40,84
Out the Decatur Road. The old Sullivan plantation.

02:34:41,34 --> 02:34:43,01
The house is burned. They're meeting in the cellar.

02:34:43,05 --> 02:34:44,34
I'll do what I can.

02:34:49,26 --> 02:34:52,27
What's all this about? If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.

02:34:52,64 --> 02:34:54,10
We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.

02:34:54,14 --> 02:34:56,73
But Ashley and Frank and the others have gone to clean out those woods

02:34:56,77 --> 02:34:58,40
where you were attacked.

02:34:58,44 --> 02:35:00,02
It's what a great many of our Southern gentlemen have had

02:35:00,07 --> 02:35:01,90
to do lately for our protection.

02:35:01,94 --> 02:35:04,86
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged, Scarlett.

02:35:05,24 --> 02:35:06,70
And it will be your fault.

02:35:06,74 --> 02:35:08,70
Another word, and you go out of this house, lndia.

02:35:08,74 --> 02:35:10,83
Scarlett did what she thought she had to do.

02:35:10,87 --> 02:35:13,54
And our men are doing what they think they have to do.

02:35:14,37 --> 02:35:15,46
Frank.

02:35:16,16 --> 02:35:17,46
And Ashley.

02:35:19,75 --> 02:35:21,04
Oh, it isn't possible.

02:35:24,97 --> 02:35:27,51
There's horses, Miss Melly. Here they come.

02:35:27,55 --> 02:35:29,14
You're sewing, you're sewing.

02:35:34,06 --> 02:35:35,35
Open the door, Mammy.

02:35:45,57 --> 02:35:47,36
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.

02:35:49,87 --> 02:35:51,41
Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?

02:35:51,45 --> 02:35:52,53
I am Mrs. Wilkes.

02:35:53,37 --> 02:35:55,83
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes, if you please.

02:35:55,87 --> 02:35:56,87
He's not here.

02:35:57,25 --> 02:35:58,33
Are you sure?

02:35:58,37 --> 02:36:00,17
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.

02:36:00,46 --> 02:36:02,34
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.

02:36:03,05 --> 02:36:05,71
If you'll give me your word, I won't search the house.

02:36:05,76 --> 02:36:09,59
Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.

02:36:09,64 --> 02:36:12,26
He's not at the store, and there's no meeting tonight.

02:36:12,64 --> 02:36:13,97
No political meeting.

02:36:14,35 --> 02:36:16,93
We'll wait outside till he and his friends return.

02:36:18,44 --> 02:36:21,40
Sergeant, surround the house. Put a man on each door and window.

02:36:21,44 --> 02:36:22,56
Yes, sir.

02:36:27,15 --> 02:36:28,95
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.

02:36:29,86 --> 02:36:32,16
And I'll read aloud.

02:36:35,66 --> 02:36:38,75
The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield.

02:36:41,83 --> 02:36:42,96
Chapter one.

02:36:43,46 --> 02:36:44,54
I'm born.

02:36:49,05 --> 02:36:52,84
To begin my life, with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born.

02:36:52,88 --> 02:36:56,43
Chapter Nine. I have a memorable birthday.

02:36:56,47 --> 02:36:58,52
l pass over all that happened at school

02:36:58,56 --> 02:37:01,77
until the anniversary of my birthday came around in March.

02:37:02,94 --> 02:37:05,52
Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever.

02:37:05,57 --> 02:37:06,90
l remember nothing.

02:37:06,94 --> 02:37:10,44
He was going away at the end of the haIf year, if not sooner

02:37:10,47 --> 02:37:13,94
and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes

02:37:13,97 --> 02:37:16,33
and, therefore, more engaging than before, but

02:37:16,37 --> 02:37:18,37
beyond this I remember nothing.

02:37:18,41 --> 02:37:20,37
The great.

02:37:22,75 --> 02:37:23,96
l remember nothing.

02:37:28,96 --> 02:37:30,67
Melly. They're drunk.

02:37:31,47 --> 02:37:33,09
Leave this to me, Scarlett.

02:37:33,14 --> 02:37:34,97
And, please, say nothing.

02:37:38,47 --> 02:37:39,85
You stupid fool.

02:37:42,06 --> 02:37:43,27
Quiet.

02:37:43,85 --> 02:37:45,86
Will you shut up for the love of?

02:37:46,36 --> 02:37:47,52
Hello, Melly.

02:37:47,57 --> 02:37:50,57
So, you've got my husband intoxicated again, Captain Butler.

02:37:51,07 --> 02:37:52,11
Well, bring him in.

02:37:52,15 --> 02:37:54,62
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes. Your husband's under arrest.

02:37:54,66 --> 02:37:56,70
If you arrest all the men who get intoxicated

02:37:56,74 --> 02:37:59,63
you must have a good many Yankees in jail.

02:37:59,66 --> 02:38:03,16
Bring him in, Captain Butler. If you can walk yourself.

02:38:03,65 --> 02:38:04,30
Oh

02:38:04,33 --> 02:38:07,05
I want to tell you a story.

02:38:07,08 --> 02:38:07,17
Listen, Doctor, l.

02:38:07,46 --> 02:38:08,75
Put him there in that chair.

02:38:12,84 --> 02:38:15,22
And now, Captain Butler, will you please leave my house

02:38:15,26 --> 02:38:17,85
and try to remember not to come here again?

02:38:18,26 --> 02:38:21,06
Well, now that's fine thanks I get for bringing him home

02:38:21,35 --> 02:38:25,29
and not leaving him on the streets in this shameful condition.

02:38:25,32 --> 02:38:25,65
Now, boys, all together.

02:38:26,06 --> 02:38:27,56
Dr. Meade

02:38:28,27 --> 02:38:30,07
I'm astonished at you.

02:38:36,87 --> 02:38:39,16
Oh, Ashley. How can you do this to me?

02:38:40,95 --> 02:38:42,66
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.

02:38:43,75 --> 02:38:46,42
Take him into the bedroom and lay him out on the bed as usual.

02:38:46,46 --> 02:38:48,13
Don't touch him, he's under arrest.

02:38:48,17 --> 02:38:49,21
Now, Tom.

02:38:49,25 --> 02:38:51,05
What do you want to arrest him for?

02:38:51,34 --> 02:38:53,22
I've seen him drunker.

02:38:53,26 --> 02:38:55,93
I've seen you drunker. And you've seen me.

02:38:55,97 --> 02:38:59,86
He can lie in the gutter for all I care. I'm not a policeman.

02:38:59,89 --> 02:39:01,52
But he led a raid tonight on that shantytown

02:39:01,56 --> 02:39:04,32
where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble this afternoon.

02:39:04,35 --> 02:39:07,40
A lot of those shanties were burned. A couple of men were killed.

02:39:07,44 --> 02:39:11,44
It's about time you rebeIs learned you can't take the law into your own hands.

02:39:11,48 --> 02:39:14,77
What are you laughing at?

02:39:14,86 --> 02:39:16,75
This isn't your night to teach that lesson, Tom.

02:39:16,79 --> 02:39:20,83
These two have been with me tonight. Yes, sir.

02:39:20,87 --> 02:39:22,16
With you, Rhett?

02:39:23,16 --> 02:39:24,16
Where?

02:39:28,25 --> 02:39:30,67
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.

02:39:31,17 --> 02:39:32,25
You'd better say.

02:39:32,84 --> 02:39:35,13
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.

02:39:35,17 --> 02:39:36,30
Speak out, Captain Butler.

02:39:36,34 --> 02:39:39,05
I think I have a right to know where my husband's been.

02:39:41,26 --> 02:39:44,56
Well, ma'am, we dropped in on a friend of mine

02:39:45,77 --> 02:39:47,14
and the captain's.

02:39:47,64 --> 02:39:49,06
A Mrs. Belle Watling.

02:39:50,06 --> 02:39:53,07
We played cards, drank champagne and

02:39:54,07 --> 02:39:55,19
well.

02:39:55,24 --> 02:39:58,66
Now, you've done it. Did you have to show me up in front of my wife?

02:40:00,24 --> 02:40:02,33
Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.

02:40:02,37 --> 02:40:05,66
These ladies won't be on speaking terms with their husbands tomorrow.

02:40:07,04 --> 02:40:09,17
Rhett, I had no idea, l.

02:40:10,46 --> 02:40:13,96
Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at

02:40:14,46 --> 02:40:15,55
at Belle's?

02:40:15,96 --> 02:40:18,93
Ask Belle, if you don't believe me. She'll tell you, Captain.

02:40:18,97 --> 02:40:21,14
Will you give me your word as a gentleman?

02:40:21,55 --> 02:40:22,64
As a gentleman?

02:40:22,97 --> 02:40:24,26
Why certainly, Tom.

02:40:26,93 --> 02:40:28,23
Well, if l

02:40:28,27 --> 02:40:30,44
if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.

02:40:31,56 --> 02:40:33,86
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I.

02:40:35,57 --> 02:40:37,69
If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.

02:40:37,74 --> 02:40:40,36
Well, I say I'm sorry, and

02:40:41,57 --> 02:40:43,20
well, I am sorry.

02:40:43,24 --> 02:40:44,66
Come on, Sergeant.

02:40:51,17 --> 02:40:53,17
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.

02:40:55,34 --> 02:40:56,51
Ashley.

02:40:56,55 --> 02:40:58,97
It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.

02:40:59,26 --> 02:41:01,51
Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound.

02:41:01,55 --> 02:41:02,97
I think I can walk.

02:41:04,05 --> 02:41:06,10
It's not worth the effort. Which way?

02:41:06,14 --> 02:41:07,27
In here.

02:41:08,93 --> 02:41:10,89
Mammy, I want some hot water. Yes, sir.

02:41:10,94 --> 02:41:12,40
And lint for bandages. I'll find some.

02:41:12,44 --> 02:41:15,52
Now what can I use for a probe? If I only had my bag.

02:41:15,57 --> 02:41:18,15
Were you really there? What did it look like?

02:41:18,86 --> 02:41:22,86
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

02:41:22,95 --> 02:41:25,16
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself.

02:41:27,87 --> 02:41:31,04
And now, Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened.

02:41:31,67 --> 02:41:32,96
I was too late.

02:41:33,67 --> 02:41:37,13
When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd already been a skirmish with the Yankees.

02:41:37,17 --> 02:41:40,05
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded and Dr. Meade was with him.

02:41:40,47 --> 02:41:43,76
I had to prove they had been somewhere, anyplace but where they were.

02:41:43,80 --> 02:41:46,43
So I took them to Belle's.

02:41:46,47 --> 02:41:47,76
And she took them in?

02:41:48,14 --> 02:41:50,35
She's by way of being an old friend of mine.

02:41:50,93 --> 02:41:52,89
Oh, I'm sorry. I

02:41:52,94 --> 02:41:55,65
I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.

02:41:59,65 --> 02:42:03,32
This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster, Captain Butler.

02:42:03,36 --> 02:42:06,16
It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.

02:42:08,37 --> 02:42:11,66
And now, I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.

02:42:17,34 --> 02:42:18,67
Oh, Ashley.

02:42:20,46 --> 02:42:21,55
Ashley.

02:42:23,63 --> 02:42:27,14
Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?

02:42:28,81 --> 02:42:32,31
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?

02:42:32,35 --> 02:42:33,44
No.

02:42:34,06 --> 02:42:35,15
Well, where is he?

02:42:36,15 --> 02:42:37,94
He's lying out on Decatur Road

02:42:39,07 --> 02:42:40,44
shot through the head.

02:42:41,65 --> 02:42:42,74
He's dead.

02:42:53,04 --> 02:42:54,16
Who is it?

02:42:54,54 --> 02:42:55,92
It's Miss Watlin'.

02:42:55,96 --> 02:42:58,34
Oh, Mrs. Watling. Won't you come in the house?

02:42:58,96 --> 02:43:01,05
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.

02:43:02,05 --> 02:43:04,17
You come in and sit a minute with me.

02:43:12,56 --> 02:43:14,73
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?

02:43:14,77 --> 02:43:16,52
How can any of us thank you enough?

02:43:16,56 --> 02:43:19,73
I got your note sayin' you was goin' to call on me and thank me.

02:43:19,77 --> 02:43:22,15
Why, Miss Wilkes, you must have lost your mind.

02:43:23,07 --> 02:43:26,70
I come up here as soon as it was dark to tell you

02:43:26,73 --> 02:43:30,82
you mustn't even think of any such thing.

02:43:31,03 --> 02:43:32,83
Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.

02:43:32,87 --> 02:43:36,87
It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind woman who saved my husband's life?

02:43:36,96 --> 02:43:41,25
Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady in this town nice to me like you was.

02:43:42,05 --> 02:43:44,55
I mean, about the money for the hospital, you know.

02:43:44,97 --> 02:43:46,55
And I don't forget a kindness.

02:43:46,97 --> 02:43:50,10
And I got to thinking about you being left a widow with a little boy

02:43:50,14 --> 02:43:51,85
if Mr. Wilkes got hung

02:43:52,47 --> 02:43:55,27
and he's a nice little boy, your boy is, Miss Wilkes.

02:43:56,06 --> 02:43:58,65
I got a boy myseIf and so l.

02:43:59,27 --> 02:44:01,52
Oh, you have? Does he live?

02:44:01,57 --> 02:44:03,73
Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.

02:44:04,94 --> 02:44:06,45
He ain't never been here.

02:44:06,95 --> 02:44:08,86
He's off at school.

02:44:09,36 --> 02:44:11,37
I ain't seen him since he was little.

02:44:14,37 --> 02:44:18,37
Well, anyway, if it had been that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself

02:44:18,67 --> 02:44:22,13
I wouldn't have lifted a finger to, no matter what Captain Butler said.

02:44:22,16 --> 02:44:24,13
She's a mighty cold woman.

02:44:24,17 --> 02:44:26,65
Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.

02:44:26,69 --> 02:44:29,13
She killed her husband same as if she shot him.

02:44:29,76 --> 02:44:32,47
You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law.

02:44:35,51 --> 02:44:38,06
Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.

02:44:38,35 --> 02:44:40,15
I forgot how you liked her.

02:44:41,36 --> 02:44:45,36
But she just ain't in the same class with you and I can't help it if I think so.

02:44:46,15 --> 02:44:48,18
Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.

02:44:48,22 --> 02:44:53,33
I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stayed here any longer.

02:44:53,36 --> 02:44:55,16
That wouldn't do you no good.

02:44:56,04 --> 02:44:57,45
And Miss Wilkes

02:44:58,04 --> 02:45:01,25
if you ever see me on the street, you don't have to speak to me.

02:45:02,04 --> 02:45:03,34
I'll understand.

02:45:04,17 --> 02:45:07,97
I should be proud to speak to you. Proud to be under obligation to you.

02:45:09,26 --> 02:45:10,63
I hope we meet again.

02:45:11,05 --> 02:45:13,35
Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.

02:45:15,56 --> 02:45:18,59
Good night, Miss Wilkes. Good night, Mrs. Watling.

02:45:23,77 --> 02:45:25,90
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.

02:45:25,94 --> 02:45:28,24
She's brokenhearted about her husband.

02:46:12,57 --> 02:46:14,74
Great balls of fire. It's Rhett.

02:46:39,92 --> 02:46:43,27
Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here to see you.

02:46:43,30 --> 02:46:45,77
I told him you was prostrate with grief.

02:46:45,77 --> 02:46:48,44
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.

02:47:19,05 --> 02:47:20,47
She says she's comin'.

02:47:20,85 --> 02:47:23,23
I don't know why she's comin'. But she's a-comin'.

02:47:23,27 --> 02:47:24,81
You don't like me, Mammy.

02:47:24,85 --> 02:47:28,15
Now don't you argue with me, you don't. You really don't.

02:47:40,16 --> 02:47:41,66
It's no good, Scarlett.

02:47:42,24 --> 02:47:43,20
What?

02:47:43,25 --> 02:47:44,25
The cologne.

02:47:44,75 --> 02:47:46,96
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

02:47:47,46 --> 02:47:50,67
I mean you've been drinking. Brandy. Quite a lot.

02:47:51,55 --> 02:47:54,05
Well, what if I have? Is that any of your affair?

02:47:56,63 --> 02:47:58,43
Don't drink alone, Scarlett.

02:47:58,47 --> 02:48:01,47
People always find out and it ruins the reputation.

02:48:07,94 --> 02:48:09,10
What is it?

02:48:09,15 --> 02:48:11,06
This is more than losing old Frank.

02:48:11,57 --> 02:48:13,03
Oh, Rhett

02:48:13,07 --> 02:48:14,07
I'm so afraid.

02:48:14,44 --> 02:48:17,20
I don't believe it. You've never been afraid in your life.

02:48:17,24 --> 02:48:18,66
I'm afraid now.

02:48:18,95 --> 02:48:21,07
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.

02:48:22,87 --> 02:48:26,25
You look pretty healthy, and maybe there isn't any hell.

02:48:26,28 --> 02:48:29,17
Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it.

02:48:30,04 --> 02:48:33,17
Well, far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.

02:48:33,75 --> 02:48:36,47
Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you.

02:48:37,35 --> 02:48:40,64
I ought never to have married Frank to begin with.

02:48:40,76 --> 02:48:43,26
He was Suellen's beau and he loved her, not me.

02:48:44,14 --> 02:48:46,85
And I made him miserable. And I killed him.

02:48:47,35 --> 02:48:50,18
Yes, I did. I killed him.

02:48:51,26 --> 02:48:52,74
Oh, Rhett

02:48:52,77 --> 02:48:57,44
For the first time I'm finding out what it is to be sorry for something I've done.

02:48:57,95 --> 02:48:59,95
Here. Dry your eyes.

02:49:01,24 --> 02:49:04,20
If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently.

02:49:04,24 --> 02:49:06,83
You're like the thief who isn't the least bit sorry he stole

02:49:06,87 --> 02:49:10,05
but he's terribly, terribly sorry he's going to jail.

02:49:10,08 --> 02:49:11,96
I'm glad Mother's dead.

02:49:12,67 --> 02:49:15,34
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.

02:49:16,34 --> 02:49:19,17
I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind and.

02:49:20,34 --> 02:49:22,84
And I certainly have turned out disappointing.

02:49:24,76 --> 02:49:28,66
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag.

02:49:36,28 --> 02:49:39,07
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.

02:49:39,57 --> 02:49:40,95
Say it, then, and get out.

02:49:42,45 --> 02:49:43,41
What is it?

02:49:43,45 --> 02:49:45,74
That I can't go on any longer without you.

02:49:46,45 --> 02:49:51,59
You are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time like this with your filthy

02:49:51,62 --> 02:49:54,97
I made up my mind that you were the only woman for me

02:49:55,00 --> 02:49:55,13
the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.

02:49:55,17 --> 02:49:57,42
Now that you've got the lumber mill and Frank's money

02:49:57,46 --> 02:49:59,92
you won't come to me as you did to the jail.

02:49:59,97 --> 02:50:01,97
So I see I shall have to marry you.

02:50:02,76 --> 02:50:04,43
I never heard of such bad taste.

02:50:04,47 --> 02:50:06,93
Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees?

02:50:06,97 --> 02:50:08,81
Turn me loose, you varmint, and get out of here.

02:50:08,85 --> 02:50:11,81
Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments

02:50:11,85 --> 02:50:14,56
my dear Scarlett. I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

02:50:14,86 --> 02:50:16,67
But it cannot have escaped your notice that for some time past

02:50:16,71 --> 02:50:21,40
the friendship I have feIt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling.

02:50:21,44 --> 02:50:25,31
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred.

02:50:26,07 --> 02:50:28,16
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

02:50:28,74 --> 02:50:31,41
Get up off your knees. I don't like your common jokes.

02:50:31,46 --> 02:50:33,12
This is an honorable proposal of marriage

02:50:33,17 --> 02:50:35,75
made at what I consider a most opportune moment.

02:50:36,84 --> 02:50:39,84
I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands.

02:50:40,46 --> 02:50:42,67
You're coarse, and you're conceited.

02:50:43,63 --> 02:50:46,26
And I think this conversation has gone far enough.

02:50:47,14 --> 02:50:49,64
Besides, I shall never marry again.

02:50:50,64 --> 02:50:53,14
Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.

02:50:53,77 --> 02:50:55,44
You? You.

02:50:56,15 --> 02:50:57,56
I don't love you.

02:50:58,07 --> 02:51:00,36
And I don't like being married.

02:51:01,36 --> 02:51:03,70
Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?

02:51:03,74 --> 02:51:07,93
Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee. Fun for men, you mean.

02:51:08,37 --> 02:51:10,12
Hush up. Do you want them to hear you?

02:51:10,16 --> 02:51:12,37
You've been married to a boy and an old man.

02:51:12,66 --> 02:51:15,67
Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women?

02:51:16,54 --> 02:51:21,66
You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know I shall always love another man.

02:51:22,34 --> 02:51:25,63
Stop it. Do you hear me, Scarlett? Stop it. No more of that talk.

02:51:32,06 --> 02:51:33,52
Rhett, don't, I shall faint.

02:51:33,56 --> 02:51:36,40
I want you to faint. This is what you were meant for.

02:51:36,44 --> 02:51:39,23
None of the fooIs you've known have kissed you like this, have they?

02:51:39,27 --> 02:51:42,39
Your Charles, or your Frank, or your stupid Ashley.

02:51:50,45 --> 02:51:54,20
Say you're going to marry me. Say yes. Say yes.

02:51:54,23 --> 02:51:54,87
Yes.

02:51:57,17 --> 02:51:59,63
Are you sure you meant it? You don't want to take it back?

02:51:59,67 --> 02:52:00,67
No.

02:52:01,34 --> 02:52:03,46
Look at me and try to tell me the truth.

02:52:04,05 --> 02:52:06,05
Did you say yes because of my money?

02:52:06,63 --> 02:52:07,63
Well.

02:52:07,97 --> 02:52:09,34
Yes. Partly.

02:52:10,55 --> 02:52:11,76
Partly?

02:52:12,47 --> 02:52:17,80
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help, and, of course I am fond of you.

02:52:17,83 --> 02:52:18,40
Fond of me.

02:52:18,44 --> 02:52:22,02
Well, if I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying

02:52:22,07 --> 02:52:23,90
but you always said we had a lot in common.

02:52:23,94 --> 02:52:25,44
Yes, you're right, my dear.

02:52:25,94 --> 02:52:28,32
I'm not in love with you any more than you are with me.

02:52:28,36 --> 02:52:30,66
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you.

02:52:31,37 --> 02:52:33,33
What kind of a ring would you like, my darling?

02:52:33,37 --> 02:52:36,62
Oh, a diamond ring. And do buy a great big one, Rhett.

02:52:36,66 --> 02:52:39,54
You shall have the biggest and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

02:52:39,96 --> 02:52:41,92
I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon

02:52:41,96 --> 02:52:43,63
my ill-gotten gains can buy.

02:52:43,67 --> 02:52:45,05
Oh, that would be just heavenly.

02:52:45,34 --> 02:52:47,42
And I think I'll buy your trousseau for you, too.

02:52:47,47 --> 02:52:49,05
Rhett, how wonderful, but

02:52:49,84 --> 02:52:51,97
you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?

02:52:52,47 --> 02:52:53,97
Still the little hypocrite.

02:52:56,64 --> 02:52:58,81
Rhett, aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?

02:52:58,85 --> 02:53:01,61
Don't you think you've had enough kissing for one afternoon?

02:53:01,65 --> 02:53:02,73
You're impossible.

02:53:02,77 --> 02:53:05,19
You can go and I don't care if you never come back.

02:53:05,23 --> 02:53:06,57
But I will come back.

02:53:21,54 --> 02:53:23,71
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

02:53:23,75 --> 02:53:25,67
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

02:53:27,67 --> 02:53:29,93
Rhett, I can keep the lumber business too, can't l?

02:53:29,97 --> 02:53:32,43
Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.

02:53:32,47 --> 02:53:35,10
Now that you're rich you can tell everyone to go to the devil

02:53:35,14 --> 02:53:36,56
as you've always said you wanted to.

02:53:37,06 --> 02:53:39,56
But you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil.

02:53:57,37 --> 02:54:00,87
Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett. I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.

02:54:01,16 --> 02:54:04,67
Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?

02:54:05,17 --> 02:54:08,51
If you don't stop being such a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy

02:54:08,55 --> 02:54:09,97
then I'll divorce you.

02:54:10,76 --> 02:54:13,51
Wouldn't it be nice if you bought something for Mammy, too?

02:54:13,55 --> 02:54:17,15
Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules?

02:54:17,35 --> 02:54:18,64
Mules? Why mules?

02:54:18,97 --> 02:54:23,77
Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs, and get ourselves all slicked up

02:54:23,80 --> 02:54:25,68
like racehorses but we were just mules in horse harness

02:54:25,71 --> 02:54:26,86
and we didn't fool anybody.

02:54:26,94 --> 02:54:30,51
I never heard anything more true.

02:54:30,54 --> 02:54:31,54
Mammy's a smart old soul

02:54:31,57 --> 02:54:34,87
and one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have.

02:54:36,07 --> 02:54:37,83
I won't give her a thing. She doesn't deserve it.

02:54:37,87 --> 02:54:39,70
Then I'll take her a petticoat.

02:54:39,75 --> 02:54:42,00
My Mammy always said when she went to heaven

02:54:42,04 --> 02:54:45,96
she wanted a red taffeta petticoat, so stiff that it would stand by itself

02:54:46,25 --> 02:54:49,79
and so rustly, the Lord would think it was made of angels' wings.

02:54:49,82 --> 02:54:52,51
Why, she won't take it from you. She'd rather die than wear it.

02:54:52,55 --> 02:54:55,34
That may be, but I'm making the gesture just the same.

02:54:58,40 --> 02:55:02,82
Wake up. Wake up.

02:55:04,06 --> 02:55:05,94
You were having another nightmare.

02:55:07,27 --> 02:55:08,27
Oh, Rhett.

02:55:08,65 --> 02:55:10,90
When I was so cold and hungry and

02:55:10,94 --> 02:55:12,44
and so tired l

02:55:13,07 --> 02:55:17,07
I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it.

02:55:17,87 --> 02:55:19,87
Find what, honey? Oh, I don't know.

02:55:20,66 --> 02:55:23,16
I always dream the same dream and I never know.

02:55:23,75 --> 02:55:25,83
It seems to be hidden in the mist.

02:55:25,87 --> 02:55:26,96
Darling.

02:55:28,25 --> 02:55:32,26
Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I've found it and that I'm safe?

02:55:33,76 --> 02:55:37,76
Dreams don't work that way, but when you get used to being safe and warm

02:55:38,26 --> 02:55:40,26
you'll stop dreaming that dream.

02:55:40,64 --> 02:55:43,64
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.

02:55:47,94 --> 02:55:50,27
Would you do something for me if I asked you?

02:55:50,65 --> 02:55:51,86
You know I would.

02:55:53,15 --> 02:55:55,45
Will you take me away from here?

02:55:55,74 --> 02:55:57,32
Don't you like New Orleans?

02:55:57,36 --> 02:56:01,59
Oh, I love New Orleans, but I want to go home and visit Tara.

02:56:02,24 --> 02:56:03,75
Will you take me to Tara?

02:56:04,66 --> 02:56:09,71
Yes, Scarlett, of course I will. We'll go tomorrow.

02:56:12,46 --> 02:56:15,30
You get your strength from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.

02:56:15,34 --> 02:56:17,43
You're part of it, and it's part of you.

02:56:17,47 --> 02:56:21,43
Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war.

02:56:21,46 --> 02:56:24,73
Would you? Then go ahead and make it that way.

02:56:24,77 --> 02:56:28,78
Spend whatever you want, make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.

02:56:28,81 --> 02:56:30,15
Oh, Rhett.

02:56:30,77 --> 02:56:32,27
Rhett, you are good to me.

02:56:32,57 --> 02:56:35,03
And can we still have our big new house in Atlanta?

02:56:35,07 --> 02:56:37,57
Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want

02:56:38,07 --> 02:56:40,41
marbled terraces, stained-glass windows and all.

02:56:40,45 --> 02:56:42,41
Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?

02:56:42,45 --> 02:56:45,54
I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.

02:56:47,37 --> 02:56:52,37
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful, building that new house just to show off

02:56:52,40 --> 02:56:54,50
and even taking our servants.

02:56:54,96 --> 02:56:57,84
Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her.

02:56:58,26 --> 02:57:00,84
She's made it possible for us to keep Tara always.

02:57:01,35 --> 02:57:02,97
Yes, and what good is Tara?

02:57:03,47 --> 02:57:07,06
She's had three husbands and I'll be an old maid.

02:57:09,46 --> 02:57:11,91
Great Jehosophat.

02:57:11,94 --> 02:57:14,36
Great Jehosophat.

02:57:14,78 --> 02:57:17,03
Lordsy, we sure is rich now.

02:57:17,07 --> 02:57:18,07
It ain't quality.

02:57:18,57 --> 02:57:20,74
But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?

02:57:21,57 --> 02:57:23,99
I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like.

02:57:24,03 --> 02:57:27,88
You control yourself, Mr. Rhett. You'll be seein' it for a long time.

02:57:28,37 --> 02:57:31,12
I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett, about it's not being a boy.

02:57:31,17 --> 02:57:33,63
Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy. Who wants a boy?

02:57:33,67 --> 02:57:36,96
Boys aren't any use to anybody. Don't you think I'm proof of that?

02:57:37,00 --> 02:57:39,51
Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.

02:57:39,55 --> 02:57:42,05
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?

02:57:42,47 --> 02:57:43,76
She sure is.

02:57:44,64 --> 02:57:46,31
Did you ever see a prettier one?

02:57:46,35 --> 02:57:50,27
Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh that pretty when she come, but not quite.

02:57:50,77 --> 02:57:52,15
Have another glass, Mammy.

02:57:55,10 --> 02:57:58,91
What's that rustling noise I hear?

02:57:58,94 --> 02:58:03,38
Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but my red silk petticoat you done give me.

02:58:03,41 --> 02:58:06,41
Nothing but your petticoat. I don't believe it. Let me see.

02:58:06,45 --> 02:58:07,66
Pull up your skirt.

02:58:08,16 --> 02:58:09,75
Mr. Rhett. You is bad.

02:58:10,75 --> 02:58:11,87
Yeah, oh, Lord.

02:58:17,96 --> 02:58:20,47
You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.

02:58:21,17 --> 02:58:22,76
Yes, sir, too long.

02:58:23,47 --> 02:58:25,47
No more mule in horse's harness?

02:58:25,76 --> 02:58:28,77
Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad tellin' you about that.

02:58:29,06 --> 02:58:31,64
You ain't holdin' that against old Mammy, is you?

02:58:32,06 --> 02:58:34,90
No, I ain't holding it against you. I just wanted to know.

02:58:34,94 --> 02:58:37,90
Have another glass, Mammy. Here, take the whole bottle.

02:58:37,94 --> 02:58:40,36
Dr. Meade says you may go in now, Captain Butler.

02:58:44,36 --> 02:58:46,24
This sure is a happy day to me.

02:58:46,58 --> 02:58:50,20
I done diapered three generations of this family's girls

02:58:50,23 --> 02:58:52,00
and it sure is a happy day.

02:58:52,04 --> 02:58:55,42
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are when babies come.

02:58:55,46 --> 02:58:56,67
I wish.

02:58:57,25 --> 02:59:00,42
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful. What do you suppose they'll name her?

02:59:00,46 --> 02:59:02,42
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl

02:59:02,46 --> 02:59:06,60
she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.

02:59:06,97 --> 02:59:07,97
Yes

02:59:08,26 --> 02:59:10,14
she's a beautiful baby

02:59:10,97 --> 02:59:13,35
the most beautiful baby ever.

02:59:14,35 --> 02:59:15,56
Yes.

02:59:17,15 --> 02:59:19,44
Do you know that this is your birthday?

02:59:20,15 --> 02:59:22,36
That you're a week old today?

02:59:22,95 --> 02:59:28,16
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes of which this town has never seen.

02:59:28,87 --> 02:59:31,95
Yes, I'm gonna send her to the best schooIs in Charleston.

02:59:32,45 --> 02:59:36,46
Yes. And her'll be received by the best families in the South.

02:59:37,33 --> 02:59:39,80
And when it comes time for her to marry

02:59:39,84 --> 02:59:42,84
well, she'll be a little princess.

02:59:43,76 --> 02:59:45,93
You certainly are making a fool of yourself.

02:59:45,97 --> 02:59:47,26
And why shouldn't l?

02:59:48,26 --> 02:59:51,27
She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me.

02:59:52,56 --> 02:59:54,31
Great balls of fire.

02:59:54,35 --> 02:59:55,85
I had the baby, didn't l?

02:59:56,85 --> 02:59:58,40
It's Melanie. May I come in?

02:59:58,44 --> 02:59:59,73
Come in, Melly.

02:59:59,77 --> 03:00:03,07
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.

03:00:05,36 --> 03:00:08,32
But, Captain Butler, most babies have blue eyes when they're born.

03:00:08,37 --> 03:00:11,33
Don't try to tell him anything. He knows everything about babies.

03:00:11,37 --> 03:00:14,62
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they're going to stay blue.

03:00:14,66 --> 03:00:16,54
As blue as the bonnie blue flag.

03:00:17,54 --> 03:00:20,00
That's it. That's what we'll call her.

03:00:20,04 --> 03:00:21,25
Bonnie Blue Butler.

03:00:30,05 --> 03:00:31,26
Try again, Mammy.

03:00:39,27 --> 03:00:40,36
Twenty inches.

03:00:40,94 --> 03:00:43,91
Twenty inches. I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

03:00:44,57 --> 03:00:47,03
You've simply got to make it 18 and a haIf again, Mammy.

03:00:47,07 --> 03:00:48,70
You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett

03:00:48,74 --> 03:00:51,12
and you ain't never goin' to be no 18 and a haIf inches again.

03:00:51,16 --> 03:00:53,54
Never. And there ain't nothin' to do about it.

03:00:54,08 --> 03:00:56,91
There is something to do about it.

03:00:56,96 --> 03:00:59,54
I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time.

03:01:00,67 --> 03:01:02,67
I just won't have any more babies.

03:01:03,55 --> 03:01:06,67
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'll be wantin' a son next year.

03:01:07,34 --> 03:01:10,22
Go tell Captain Butler I've decided not to go out after all.

03:01:10,26 --> 03:01:11,97
I'll have supper in my room.

03:01:32,57 --> 03:01:36,98
I got your message. I'll have them bring my supper up here too.

03:01:43,34 --> 03:01:45,13
No objections to that, I hope?

03:01:45,17 --> 03:01:46,25
No.

03:01:47,46 --> 03:01:48,47
Yes.

03:01:49,87 --> 03:01:52,84
I mean, I don't care where you have your supper.

03:01:55,64 --> 03:01:57,12
Rhett?

03:01:57,15 --> 03:01:58,60
Yes?

03:01:58,64 --> 03:01:59,64
You see

03:02:00,27 --> 03:02:01,85
well, I've decided

03:02:04,15 --> 03:02:06,44
well, I hope I don't have any more children.

03:02:19,25 --> 03:02:22,17
My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born

03:02:23,04 --> 03:02:26,13
it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20.

03:02:26,17 --> 03:02:27,67
No, but you know what l.

03:02:28,34 --> 03:02:30,01
Do you know what I mean?

03:02:30,05 --> 03:02:33,51
I do. And do you know I can divorce you for this?

03:02:34,34 --> 03:02:36,60
You're just low enough to think of something like that.

03:02:36,64 --> 03:02:40,52
If you had any chivalry in you or would be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes.

03:02:40,55 --> 03:02:44,16
Melanie can't have any more children and he.

03:02:45,44 --> 03:02:48,23
You've been to the lumber office this afternoon, haven't you?

03:02:48,27 --> 03:02:49,86
What has that got to do with it?

03:02:50,90 --> 03:02:54,91
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley. Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.

03:02:54,95 --> 03:02:57,24
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

03:02:58,54 --> 03:03:00,50
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.

03:03:00,54 --> 03:03:01,83
Sorry for me?

03:03:01,87 --> 03:03:05,50
Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing away happiness with both hands

03:03:05,54 --> 03:03:08,00
and reaching out for something that will never make you happy.

03:03:08,05 --> 03:03:09,71
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:03:09,76 --> 03:03:12,72
If you were free and Miss Melly were dead and you had your precious

03:03:12,76 --> 03:03:15,64
honorable Ashley, do you think you'd be happy with him?

03:03:16,97 --> 03:03:19,85
You'd never know him, never even understand his mind

03:03:20,64 --> 03:03:23,56
any more than you understand anything except money.

03:03:23,94 --> 03:03:25,90
Never mind about that. What I want to know is

03:03:25,94 --> 03:03:29,44
You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett. It'll work no hardship on me.

03:03:30,36 --> 03:03:31,90
Do you mean to say you don't care?

03:03:31,94 --> 03:03:35,83
The world is full of many things and many people, and I shan't be lonely.

03:03:36,24 --> 03:03:37,74
I'll find comfort elsewhere.

03:03:38,24 --> 03:03:39,50
Well, that's fine. But I warn you.

03:03:39,54 --> 03:03:43,50
Just in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door.

03:03:43,54 --> 03:03:46,96
Why bother? If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out.

03:04:05,10 --> 03:04:09,02
I always knew that most women were cheats, hypocritical and hard.

03:04:09,06 --> 03:04:09,93
But this one.... Rhett, it ain't no use.

03:04:09,97 --> 03:04:14,53
What do you mean? I mean you're poisoned with her.

03:04:14,57 --> 03:04:17,91
I don't care what she's done to you, you're still in love with her.

03:04:17,95 --> 03:04:19,91
And don't think it pleasures me none to say it.

03:04:19,95 --> 03:04:22,91
Maybe so. But I'm through with her, I tell you. I'm through.

03:04:22,95 --> 03:04:26,16
You gotta think of the child. The child's worth ten of the mother.

03:04:32,84 --> 03:04:36,58
You're a shrewd woman, Belle, and a very nice one.

03:04:37,76 --> 03:04:38,80
Yes, Rhett?

03:04:38,84 --> 03:04:41,76
I was just thinking of the difference between you, and

03:04:42,47 --> 03:04:46,02
you're both hard-headed business women and you're both successful.

03:04:46,06 --> 03:04:49,40
But you've got a heart, Belle

03:04:49,77 --> 03:04:51,06
and you're honest.

03:04:53,86 --> 03:04:54,94
Goodbye, Rhett.

03:04:56,24 --> 03:04:57,57
Goodbye, Belle.

03:05:11,38 --> 03:05:13,86
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.

03:05:13,90 --> 03:05:17,84
Look at those hands, and that seat.

03:05:18,18 --> 03:05:19,51
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee.

03:05:19,55 --> 03:05:22,51
Just why we have to wheel the baby when we have a house full of servants.

03:05:22,55 --> 03:05:23,72
Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.

03:05:23,76 --> 03:05:25,31
Good morning, Captain Butler.

03:05:25,35 --> 03:05:26,73
Good morning, Scarlett.

03:05:26,77 --> 03:05:29,73
Making fooIs of ourselves in front of these old buffaloes.

03:05:29,77 --> 03:05:32,73
If you'd thought of your position years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.

03:05:32,77 --> 03:05:36,74
But as it is, we'll cultivate every female dragon of the old guard in this town.

03:05:37,95 --> 03:05:39,32
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.

03:05:39,36 --> 03:05:42,74
Good morning, Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

03:05:43,45 --> 03:05:46,24
So the millionaire speculator's turning respectable.

03:05:46,87 --> 03:05:49,12
All of our money can't buy what I want for Bonnie.

03:05:49,16 --> 03:05:51,42
Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.

03:05:51,46 --> 03:05:53,92
But Bonnie's going to have a place among decent people.

03:05:53,96 --> 03:05:57,46
Yes, even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat.

03:05:58,47 --> 03:06:00,18
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

03:06:00,47 --> 03:06:03,14
Good morning, Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

03:06:09,64 --> 03:06:12,60
Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had a great regard for your knowledge.

03:06:12,65 --> 03:06:14,40
I wonder if you could give me some advice.

03:06:14,44 --> 03:06:15,52
Why, certainly, Captain Butler.

03:06:15,57 --> 03:06:17,82
My Bonnie sucks her thumb. I can't make her stop it.

03:06:17,86 --> 03:06:20,32
You should make her stop it. It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

03:06:20,36 --> 03:06:21,53
I know, I know.

03:06:21,57 --> 03:06:25,20
She has such a beautiful mouth, too. I tried putting soap under her nails.

03:06:25,24 --> 03:06:26,41
Soap. Bah.

03:06:26,45 --> 03:06:29,87
Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

03:06:30,16 --> 03:06:32,67
Quinine. I never would have thought of it.

03:06:33,17 --> 03:06:35,21
I can't thank you enough, Mrs. Merriwether.

03:06:35,25 --> 03:06:38,46
You've taken a great load off my mind. Good morning.

03:06:42,18 --> 03:06:43,51
Good morning, Dolly.

03:06:43,55 --> 03:06:45,22
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

03:06:45,26 --> 03:06:47,76
Good morning, Caroline. I was just thinking.

03:06:48,27 --> 03:06:52,27
There must be a great deal of good in a man who could love a child so much.

03:06:52,35 --> 03:06:54,23
But of course there is.

03:06:54,27 --> 03:06:58,11
Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler

03:06:58,15 --> 03:07:00,90
finally admitted he was honored by the Confederate Congress

03:07:00,94 --> 03:07:03,11
for his services at the Battle of Franklin?

03:07:03,16 --> 03:07:06,70
No. And did I tell you, Caroline, that Captain Butler

03:07:06,74 --> 03:07:09,91
made a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification

03:07:09,95 --> 03:07:11,91
of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?

03:07:11,96 --> 03:07:12,96
No.

03:07:13,75 --> 03:07:17,63
My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

03:07:17,67 --> 03:07:20,42
Why, Dolly Merriwether, you know right well it was my idea

03:07:20,46 --> 03:07:21,92
to give a party for Bonnie Butler.

03:07:21,97 --> 03:07:23,66
Why Caroline Meade.

03:07:32,56 --> 03:07:35,44
Now watch Daddy put your pony over, Bonnie. Now watch.

03:07:38,65 --> 03:07:41,11
Daddy, let me. Let me.

03:07:41,15 --> 03:07:43,45
All right, darling. Put her on, Pork.

03:07:47,16 --> 03:07:48,37
Up we go.

03:07:48,66 --> 03:07:49,95
Oh, there.

03:07:50,24 --> 03:07:52,83
Lordsy mercy. There he goes again.

03:07:52,87 --> 03:07:56,21
Grip tightly with your legs and sit close. Lean forward and be sure you go with him.

03:07:56,25 --> 03:07:59,04
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up.

03:08:00,17 --> 03:08:02,46
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.

03:08:02,76 --> 03:08:05,72
When you get a little older, I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

03:08:05,76 --> 03:08:09,14
You'll be the greatest horsewoman in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.

03:08:10,26 --> 03:08:11,56
Mr. Rhett. Mr. Rhett.

03:08:12,77 --> 03:08:13,77
Mr. Rhett.

03:08:14,77 --> 03:08:17,06
Did you see her, Mammy? Wasn't she wonderful?

03:08:17,44 --> 03:08:21,40
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you it just ain't fittin'

03:08:21,44 --> 03:08:24,70
for a girl child to ride astraddle with her dress flyin' up.

03:08:24,74 --> 03:08:27,11
All right, Mammy. I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.

03:08:27,16 --> 03:08:30,41
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that.

03:08:30,45 --> 03:08:32,83
A nice black broadcloth is what little girIs wear.

03:08:32,87 --> 03:08:34,96
Now, Mammy, be reasonable.

03:08:35,46 --> 03:08:37,67
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but.

03:08:39,67 --> 03:08:41,84
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.

03:08:43,55 --> 03:08:44,97
It ain't fittin'.

03:08:55,06 --> 03:08:56,35
Why, Scarlett.

03:08:57,06 --> 03:08:59,10
What are you doing downtown at this time of day?

03:08:59,15 --> 03:09:00,23
Ashley, I just

03:09:00,27 --> 03:09:03,77
Why aren't you helping Melly get ready for my surprise birthday party?

03:09:03,86 --> 03:09:07,15
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.

03:09:07,19 --> 03:09:10,32
Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised.

03:09:10,37 --> 03:09:13,54
I won't let on. I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.

03:09:14,75 --> 03:09:16,91
As long as you're here, let me show you the books

03:09:16,96 --> 03:09:19,71
so you can see just how bad a businessman I really am.

03:09:19,75 --> 03:09:21,96
Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.

03:09:22,25 --> 03:09:24,92
When I'm wearing a new bonnet, all the figures I ever knew

03:09:24,96 --> 03:09:26,64
go right slap out of my head.

03:09:26,67 --> 03:09:29,97
The figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.

03:09:30,47 --> 03:09:33,35
Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time.

03:09:34,35 --> 03:09:39,09
You haven't changed a bit since the day of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks

03:09:39,12 --> 03:09:41,65
where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaux.

03:09:43,77 --> 03:09:46,15
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

03:09:46,65 --> 03:09:49,24
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.

03:09:49,57 --> 03:09:50,66
Nothing.

03:09:50,87 --> 03:09:55,16
Yes, we've travelled a long road since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?

03:09:55,74 --> 03:09:57,50
Oh, the lazy days

03:09:57,54 --> 03:09:59,75
the warm, still country twilights

03:10:01,04 --> 03:10:03,67
the high, soft negro laughter from the quarters

03:10:04,84 --> 03:10:08,17
the golden warmth and security of those days.

03:10:10,34 --> 03:10:11,84
Don't look back, Ashley.

03:10:12,55 --> 03:10:13,76
Don't look back.

03:10:15,85 --> 03:10:20,56
It drags at your heart till you can't do anything, but look back.

03:10:25,65 --> 03:10:27,86
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.

03:10:29,07 --> 03:10:32,07
I'd never want you to be anything but completely happy.

03:10:52,55 --> 03:10:53,55
Oh, Ashley.

03:10:56,14 --> 03:10:57,22
Who is it?

03:10:57,26 --> 03:10:58,47
Only your husband.

03:10:59,56 --> 03:11:00,35
Come in.

03:11:01,64 --> 03:11:04,33
Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?

03:11:05,65 --> 03:11:07,57
You're not ready for Melanie's party.

03:11:08,07 --> 03:11:09,69
I've got a headache, Rhett.

03:11:09,74 --> 03:11:12,15
You go without me, and make my excuses to Melanie.

03:11:14,16 --> 03:11:16,66
What a white-livered little coward you are. Get up.

03:11:17,16 --> 03:11:19,75
You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.

03:11:20,16 --> 03:11:22,12
Has lndia dared to... Yes. India has.

03:11:22,16 --> 03:11:24,12
Every woman and man in town knows the story.

03:11:24,17 --> 03:11:25,63
You should kill them, spreading lies.

03:11:25,67 --> 03:11:28,42
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth.

03:11:28,46 --> 03:11:29,80
There's no time to argue now. Get up.

03:11:29,84 --> 03:11:33,01
I won't go. I can't go until this misunderstanding is cleared up.

03:11:33,05 --> 03:11:35,72
You won't cheat Miss Melly out of the satisfaction of publicly

03:11:35,76 --> 03:11:37,22
ordering you out of her house.

03:11:37,26 --> 03:11:39,01
There was nothing wrong. India hates me so.

03:11:39,06 --> 03:11:41,02
I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.

03:11:41,06 --> 03:11:44,52
If you don't show it tonight, you'll never be able to as long as you live.

03:11:44,56 --> 03:11:47,52
While that wouldn't bother me, you're ruining Bonnie's chances.

03:11:47,56 --> 03:11:50,86
You're going to that party, if only for her sake. Now, get dressed.

03:12:04,46 --> 03:12:07,83
Wear that. Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion.

03:12:08,34 --> 03:12:11,34
And put on plenty of rouge. I want you to look your part tonight.

03:12:18,64 --> 03:12:27,72
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

03:12:27,75 --> 03:12:34,77
For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny

03:12:34,80 --> 03:12:36,36
For he's a jolly good fellow.

03:12:38,07 --> 03:12:40,62
Good night, Scarlett. But Rhett, you can't

03:12:40,66 --> 03:12:43,83
You go into the arena alone. The lions are hungry for you.

03:12:43,87 --> 03:12:45,50
Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.

03:12:45,54 --> 03:12:46,83
You're not afraid?

03:12:46,87 --> 03:12:49,13
Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny

03:12:49,17 --> 03:12:53,71
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

03:12:53,76 --> 03:12:59,05
For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny.

03:13:13,57 --> 03:13:15,57
What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.

03:13:15,94 --> 03:13:17,96
India wasn't able to come tonight.

03:13:17,99 --> 03:13:18,91
Will you be an angel?

03:13:18,95 --> 03:13:22,42
I do need you to help me receive my guests.

03:13:25,25 --> 03:13:26,66
Mrs. Meade

03:13:26,96 --> 03:13:28,54
here's our darling Scarlett.

03:13:30,67 --> 03:13:32,84
Good evening.

03:13:33,17 --> 03:13:34,17
Why Scarlett.

03:13:34,24 --> 03:13:37,84
Good evening, Miss Scarlett. Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

03:13:38,55 --> 03:13:41,76
Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?

03:13:49,65 --> 03:13:52,61
Did you have a good time tonight at Miss Melly's party, child?

03:13:52,65 --> 03:13:53,73
Yes, yes.

03:13:53,77 --> 03:13:55,73
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word

03:13:55,78 --> 03:13:58,86
if Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep.

03:13:59,15 --> 03:14:00,16
Yes, ma'am.

03:14:29,56 --> 03:14:30,94
Come in, Mrs. Butler.

03:14:40,45 --> 03:14:41,57
Come here.

03:14:57,46 --> 03:14:58,46
Sit down.

03:15:01,17 --> 03:15:04,93
There's no reason why you shouldn't have your nightcap even if I am here.

03:15:04,97 --> 03:15:07,10
I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and

03:15:07,14 --> 03:15:08,97
You heard nothing of the kind.

03:15:09,47 --> 03:15:12,31
You wouldn't have come down if you'd thought I was here.

03:15:12,35 --> 03:15:14,61
You must need a drink badly. I do not.

03:15:14,65 --> 03:15:17,52
Take it. Don't give yourseIf airs.

03:15:17,57 --> 03:15:20,57
I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.

03:15:21,07 --> 03:15:23,36
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?

03:15:30,45 --> 03:15:31,83
You're drunk, and I'm going to bed.

03:15:31,87 --> 03:15:33,37
I'm very drunk

03:15:33,67 --> 03:15:36,96
and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over

03:15:37,67 --> 03:15:40,34
but you're not going to bed, not yet.

03:15:41,67 --> 03:15:42,76
Sit down.

03:15:45,97 --> 03:15:47,97
So she stood by you, did she?

03:15:49,14 --> 03:15:52,77
How does it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins for you?

03:15:54,44 --> 03:15:57,15
You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley.

03:15:57,65 --> 03:16:00,28
You're wondering if she did it just to save her face.

03:16:00,86 --> 03:16:04,53
You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it even if it did save your hide.

03:16:04,57 --> 03:16:06,74
I will not listen. Yes, you'll listen.

03:16:07,87 --> 03:16:10,24
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.

03:16:11,16 --> 03:16:14,33
It's just that there's too much honor in her to ever conceive of dishonor

03:16:14,37 --> 03:16:15,96
in anyone she loves.

03:16:16,88 --> 03:16:18,17
And she loves you.

03:16:18,96 --> 03:16:21,76
Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know.

03:16:22,97 --> 03:16:26,26
If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything.

03:16:26,64 --> 03:16:29,55
As it is though... If you get out of that chair once more.

03:16:33,98 --> 03:16:38,56
Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.

03:16:39,65 --> 03:16:42,73
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife

03:16:42,78 --> 03:16:45,24
and won't be unfaithful to her technically.

03:16:46,95 --> 03:16:48,82
Why doesn't he make up his mind?

03:16:48,87 --> 03:16:49,87
Rhett, you.

03:16:53,37 --> 03:16:55,75
Observe my hands, my dear.

03:16:56,75 --> 03:16:59,17
I could tear you to pieces with them.

03:16:59,84 --> 03:17:03,34
And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever.

03:17:04,46 --> 03:17:06,05
But it wouldn't.

03:17:06,84 --> 03:17:10,64
So I'll remove him from your mind forever this way.

03:17:11,85 --> 03:17:13,97
I'll put my hands so

03:17:14,77 --> 03:17:16,94
one on each side of your head

03:17:17,94 --> 03:17:21,94
and I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut.

03:17:22,77 --> 03:17:25,07
And that'll block him out.

03:17:26,36 --> 03:17:29,07
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.

03:17:34,24 --> 03:17:37,54
You know I've always admired your spirit, my dear.

03:17:38,46 --> 03:17:40,75
Never more than now, when you're cornered.

03:17:41,96 --> 03:17:43,17
I'm not cornered.

03:17:43,46 --> 03:17:46,21
And you'll never corner me, Rhett Butler, or frighten me.

03:17:46,26 --> 03:17:49,47
You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else.

03:17:49,84 --> 03:17:53,56
And you're jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.

03:17:56,14 --> 03:17:57,60
Jealous, am l?

03:17:57,64 --> 03:17:59,14
Yes, I suppose I am.

03:18:00,06 --> 03:18:03,07
Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along.

03:18:03,65 --> 03:18:05,03
How do I know?

03:18:05,07 --> 03:18:08,15
Because I know Ashley Wilkes, and his honorable breed.

03:18:08,86 --> 03:18:09,86
They're gentlemen.

03:18:10,57 --> 03:18:13,16
And that's more than I can say for you or for me.

03:18:14,16 --> 03:18:17,75
We're not gentlemen, and we have no honor, have we?

03:18:27,34 --> 03:18:29,47
It's not that easy, Scarlett.

03:18:33,85 --> 03:18:35,81
You turned me out while you chased Ashley Wilkes.

03:18:35,85 --> 03:18:37,72
While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.

03:18:37,77 --> 03:18:39,94
This is one night you're not turning me out.

03:19:08,46 --> 03:19:10,63
How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?

03:19:10,67 --> 03:19:14,55
Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.

03:19:17,47 --> 03:19:20,10
You actin' mighty happy this mornin', Miss Scarlett.

03:19:20,14 --> 03:19:21,64
I am, Mammy. I am.

03:19:28,78 --> 03:19:33,57
Oh, she wept with delight when he gave her a smile

03:19:34,07 --> 03:19:38,66
And trembled with fear at his frown.

03:19:55,55 --> 03:19:56,55
Hello.

03:19:59,47 --> 03:20:03,23
I'd like to extend my apologies for my conduct of last night.

03:20:03,27 --> 03:20:04,56
Oh, but Rhett.

03:20:05,06 --> 03:20:06,23
I was very drunk

03:20:06,27 --> 03:20:09,57
and quite swept off my feet by your charms.

03:20:11,86 --> 03:20:15,36
Well, you needn't bother to apologize. Nothing you ever do surprises me.

03:20:16,07 --> 03:20:18,91
I've been thinking things over, and I really believe that

03:20:18,95 --> 03:20:20,49
it would be better for both of us

03:20:20,54 --> 03:20:23,41
if we admitted we'd made a mistake and got a divorce.

03:20:23,46 --> 03:20:24,75
A divorce? Yes.

03:20:25,25 --> 03:20:27,92
There's no point in our holding on to each other, is there?

03:20:27,96 --> 03:20:30,50
I'll provide for you amply. You've plenty of grounds.

03:20:30,55 --> 03:20:33,42
Just give me Bonnie. You can say what you please, I won't contest it.

03:20:33,47 --> 03:20:34,42
Thank you very much.

03:20:34,47 --> 03:20:37,55
But I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.

03:20:38,26 --> 03:20:40,81
You'd disgrace it quick enough if Ashley were free.

03:20:40,85 --> 03:20:43,85
It makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.

03:20:44,94 --> 03:20:46,35
Wouldn't you, Scarlett?

03:20:47,77 --> 03:20:49,11
Well, answer me.

03:20:49,15 --> 03:20:50,23
Wouldn't you?

03:20:50,27 --> 03:20:52,44
Will you please go now, and leave me alone?

03:20:53,94 --> 03:20:56,36
Yes, I'm going. That's what I came to tell you.

03:20:57,36 --> 03:21:00,74
I'm going on a very extended trip to London, and I'm leaving today.

03:21:02,04 --> 03:21:03,83
And I'm taking Bonnie with me.

03:21:03,87 --> 03:21:06,33
So you'll please get her little duds packed right away.

03:21:06,37 --> 03:21:08,54
You'll never take my child out of this house.

03:21:08,96 --> 03:21:10,92
She's my child, too, Scarlett.

03:21:10,96 --> 03:21:13,13
You're making a mistake, if you think I'm leaving her here

03:21:13,17 --> 03:21:15,80
with a mother who hasn't the decency to consider her own reputation.

03:21:15,84 --> 03:21:17,26
You're a fine one to talk.

03:21:17,84 --> 03:21:19,30
You think I'll let that child out of this house

03:21:19,34 --> 03:21:23,02
when you'll probably have her around with people like that Belle?

03:21:23,06 --> 03:21:25,48
If you were a man I'd break your neck for that.

03:21:25,85 --> 03:21:28,02
As it is, I'll thank you to shut your stupid mouth.

03:21:28,06 --> 03:21:31,02
As for you, giving yourseIf pious airs about your motherhood.

03:21:31,06 --> 03:21:33,32
Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.

03:21:33,36 --> 03:21:36,32
Have her things packed and ready for me in an hour, or I warn you.

03:21:36,36 --> 03:21:40,24
I've always thought a good lashing with a buggy whip would benefit you immensely.

03:21:45,66 --> 03:21:46,96
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.

03:21:48,04 --> 03:21:49,12
Hello, Uncle Rhett.

03:21:49,17 --> 03:21:50,63
Hello, hello, Beau.

03:21:50,67 --> 03:21:51,96
Daddy, Daddy.

03:21:52,34 --> 03:21:55,67
Where have you been? I've been waiting for you all morning.

03:21:55,96 --> 03:21:59,64
Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in.

03:21:59,68 --> 03:22:01,55
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.

03:22:04,97 --> 03:22:08,06
I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland.

03:22:09,06 --> 03:22:10,35
Where? Where?

03:22:10,77 --> 03:22:14,36
I'm going to show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were

03:22:14,78 --> 03:22:16,07
and London Bridge.

03:22:16,74 --> 03:22:18,20
London Bridge.

03:22:18,24 --> 03:22:20,07
Will it be falling down?

03:22:21,57 --> 03:22:23,87
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.

03:22:26,37 --> 03:22:28,46
Daddy, dark.

03:22:29,87 --> 03:22:31,50
Dark.

03:22:31,54 --> 03:22:32,54
Daddy. Dark.

03:22:34,54 --> 03:22:37,42
It's all right. Who put out that light? Nurse.

03:22:37,46 --> 03:22:38,84
Daddy, dark.

03:22:40,18 --> 03:22:41,22
Daddy, dark.

03:22:41,26 --> 03:22:42,97
There. Yes, yes.

03:22:43,55 --> 03:22:45,43
What's the matter with my Bonnie?

03:22:45,47 --> 03:22:46,77
A bear.

03:22:47,27 --> 03:22:49,56
Oh, a bear? A big bear?

03:22:49,98 --> 03:22:52,90
Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.

03:22:52,94 --> 03:22:56,28
Well, I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.

03:23:11,46 --> 03:23:13,17
Good evening, Mr. Butler.

03:23:16,34 --> 03:23:19,13
Haven't I told you never to leave her alone in the dark?

03:23:19,17 --> 03:23:23,14
If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it.

03:23:23,18 --> 03:23:24,93
If you just let her scream for a night or two.

03:23:24,97 --> 03:23:28,93
Let her scream. Either you're a fool or the most inhuman woman I've ever seen.

03:23:28,97 --> 03:23:31,60
Of course, sir, if you want her to grow up nervous and cowardly.

03:23:31,64 --> 03:23:32,81
Cowardly.

03:23:32,85 --> 03:23:36,27
There isn't a cowardly bone in her body. You're discharged.

03:23:37,15 --> 03:23:38,28
As you say, sir.

03:23:55,38 --> 03:23:56,84
Where is Mother?

03:24:03,34 --> 03:24:05,47
Aren't you happy here in London with me?

03:24:06,14 --> 03:24:08,64
I want to go home.

03:24:20,86 --> 03:24:22,24
Miss Bonnie.

03:24:22,57 --> 03:24:24,36
And Captain Butler.

03:24:24,74 --> 03:24:26,57
Miss Scarlett. Hello, Mammy.

03:24:26,87 --> 03:24:28,08
Honey, child.

03:24:29,45 --> 03:24:32,41
Miss Scarlett. They's back. They's back, Miss Scarlett.

03:24:32,45 --> 03:24:33,46
Bonnie.

03:24:34,54 --> 03:24:36,46
Bonnie. Bonnie, baby.

03:24:36,88 --> 03:24:38,13
Darling, baby.

03:24:38,17 --> 03:24:39,63
Are you glad to be home?

03:24:39,67 --> 03:24:41,21
Daddy gave me a kitten.

03:24:41,26 --> 03:24:44,55
What a little, lovely kitten. London's a horrid place.

03:24:45,05 --> 03:24:47,51
Oh, my darling. Where's my pony?

03:24:47,55 --> 03:24:50,76
I want to go out and see my pony. You go out and see your pony.

03:25:00,27 --> 03:25:01,36
Where's my pony?

03:25:02,86 --> 03:25:04,65
I wanna go out and see my pony.

03:25:05,36 --> 03:25:07,11
You run along with Mammy.

03:25:07,16 --> 03:25:08,70
Come on, honey child. Go with Mammy.

03:25:08,74 --> 03:25:10,74
Mammy sure has missed you, honey.

03:25:12,87 --> 03:25:14,37
Mrs. Butler, I believe.

03:25:15,37 --> 03:25:16,87
Mammy said you'd come back.

03:25:18,38 --> 03:25:19,92
But only to bring Bonnie.

03:25:19,96 --> 03:25:23,34
Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better for a child than none.

03:25:24,17 --> 03:25:25,97
You mean you're going away again?

03:25:26,26 --> 03:25:27,84
What perception, Mrs. Butler.

03:25:28,26 --> 03:25:29,43
Right away.

03:25:29,47 --> 03:25:31,47
In fact, I left my bags at the station.

03:25:33,64 --> 03:25:36,48
You're looking pale. Is there a shortage of rouge?

03:25:36,94 --> 03:25:39,35
Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me?

03:25:40,27 --> 03:25:41,90
If I'm pale, it's your fault.

03:25:41,94 --> 03:25:44,36
Not because I've been missing you, but because.

03:25:48,66 --> 03:25:50,24
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.

03:25:51,45 --> 03:25:53,66
It's because I'm going to have a baby.

03:25:59,75 --> 03:26:00,75
Indeed?

03:26:01,25 --> 03:26:02,96
And who's the happy father?

03:26:03,75 --> 03:26:05,05
You know it's yours.

03:26:05,34 --> 03:26:07,22
I don't want it any more than you do.

03:26:07,26 --> 03:26:09,43
No woman would want the child of a cad like you.

03:26:09,47 --> 03:26:12,14
I wish it were anybody's child but yours.

03:26:14,14 --> 03:26:16,48
Well, cheer up. Maybe you'll have an accident.

03:26:31,07 --> 03:26:32,24
Is she better?

03:26:36,87 --> 03:26:38,33
Has she asked for me?

03:26:38,37 --> 03:26:40,37
Don't you understand? She's delirious.

03:26:41,96 --> 03:26:43,75
Rhett.

03:26:44,96 --> 03:26:46,67
I want Rhett.

03:26:50,97 --> 03:26:54,30
What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child?

03:26:54,35 --> 03:26:55,85
It's no use.

03:26:57,06 --> 03:26:58,48
It's no use.

03:27:20,46 --> 03:27:21,67
Dr. Meade's left.

03:27:23,04 --> 03:27:24,42
Scarlett's dead.

03:27:24,46 --> 03:27:26,17
Oh, no, she's much better.

03:27:26,75 --> 03:27:27,84
Really she is.

03:27:44,86 --> 03:27:47,44
There, there, Captain Butler. You're beside yourself.

03:27:48,07 --> 03:27:50,32
She'll very soon be well again, I promise you.

03:27:50,36 --> 03:27:53,41
No, you don't understand. She never wanted this baby.

03:27:53,45 --> 03:27:56,03
Not want a baby? Why, every woman wants a baby.

03:27:56,07 --> 03:27:58,87
Yes, you want children, but she doesn't. Not my children.

03:27:59,37 --> 03:28:01,50
She told me she didn't want any more children

03:28:01,54 --> 03:28:03,62
and I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me.

03:28:03,67 --> 03:28:05,00
I wanted to and I did.

03:28:05,04 --> 03:28:08,21
Hush. You mustn't tell me these things. It's not fit.

03:28:08,25 --> 03:28:11,13
I didn't know about this baby until the other day when she fell.

03:28:11,17 --> 03:28:14,22
If I'd known, I'd have come straight home whether she wanted me or not.

03:28:14,26 --> 03:28:15,93
Well, of course you would.

03:28:15,97 --> 03:28:19,26
And then when she told me, there on the steps, what did I do?

03:28:19,85 --> 03:28:22,73
What did I say? I laughed and I said

03:28:22,77 --> 03:28:25,27
But you didn't mean it. I know you didn't mean it.

03:28:26,15 --> 03:28:28,57
Oh, but I did mean it. I was crazy with jealousy.

03:28:28,94 --> 03:28:32,57
She's never cared for me. I thought I could make her care, but I couldn't.

03:28:34,57 --> 03:28:35,74
You're so wrong.

03:28:36,16 --> 03:28:39,45
Scarlett loves you a great deal, much more than she knows.

03:28:41,16 --> 03:28:43,12
If that were only true I could wait forever.

03:28:43,16 --> 03:28:45,42
If she'd only forgive me, forget this ever happened.

03:28:45,46 --> 03:28:46,38
She will.

03:28:46,88 --> 03:28:48,46
You must be patient.

03:28:50,84 --> 03:28:52,26
Oh, no, it's not possible.

03:28:52,67 --> 03:28:55,68
You don't understand. If you only knew who she really loved

03:28:56,76 --> 03:28:58,35
you wouldn't believe it.

03:29:01,64 --> 03:29:04,23
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.

03:29:04,27 --> 03:29:06,77
No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.

03:29:08,86 --> 03:29:13,28
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well and there can be other babies.

03:29:13,57 --> 03:29:17,32
Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she wanted to, after what she's been through.

03:29:17,36 --> 03:29:19,37
But of course she could.

03:29:19,87 --> 03:29:21,24
I'm going to.

03:29:24,16 --> 03:29:27,37
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it. It's too dangerous.

03:29:27,87 --> 03:29:30,46
Children are life renewing itself, Captain Butler

03:29:30,96 --> 03:29:34,46
and when life does that danger seems very unimportant.

03:29:37,68 --> 03:29:40,35
I've never before known anyone who was really brave.

03:29:41,47 --> 03:29:43,97
I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly.

03:29:44,56 --> 03:29:48,06
And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett.

03:29:49,56 --> 03:29:51,27
From my heart, I thank you.

03:29:58,36 --> 03:30:00,95
Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

03:30:01,66 --> 03:30:02,87
Thank you, Mammy.

03:30:10,38 --> 03:30:12,34
I've come to ask your forgiveness

03:30:12,67 --> 03:30:15,63
in the hope that we can give our life together another chance.

03:30:15,67 --> 03:30:16,84
Our life together?

03:30:17,34 --> 03:30:19,47
When did we ever have a life together?

03:30:20,76 --> 03:30:21,97
Yes, you're right.

03:30:22,85 --> 03:30:26,35
But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy.

03:30:27,06 --> 03:30:29,35
Well, what is there to make us happy now?

03:30:30,27 --> 03:30:32,44
Well, there's Bonnie and

03:30:33,44 --> 03:30:35,07
and I love you, Scarlett.

03:30:35,78 --> 03:30:37,53
When did you discover that?

03:30:37,57 --> 03:30:40,95
I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it.

03:30:42,66 --> 03:30:45,16
Well, and just what do you want me to do?

03:30:46,95 --> 03:30:49,16
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.

03:30:49,96 --> 03:30:51,12
We'll go away.

03:30:51,17 --> 03:30:53,34
We'll take Bonnie and we'll have another honeymoon.

03:30:53,38 --> 03:30:56,21
Give up the mill? But why? It's making more money than ever.

03:30:56,26 --> 03:30:58,22
Yes, I know, but we don't need it.

03:30:58,26 --> 03:31:00,76
Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.

03:31:01,47 --> 03:31:03,22
Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.

03:31:03,26 --> 03:31:05,93
Always Melanie. If you'd only think a little more about me.

03:31:05,97 --> 03:31:07,35
I am thinking of you

03:31:08,48 --> 03:31:10,27
and I'm thinking that

03:31:10,56 --> 03:31:13,77
well, maybe it's the mill that's taken you away from me

03:31:14,15 --> 03:31:15,52
and from Bonnie.

03:31:15,57 --> 03:31:18,40
I know what you're thinking. Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.

03:31:18,44 --> 03:31:20,11
You're the one taking her away from me.

03:31:20,15 --> 03:31:21,32
But she loves you.

03:31:21,36 --> 03:31:23,82
You've done everything possible to make her love you and not me.

03:31:23,87 --> 03:31:25,20
Why, she's so spoiled now that

03:31:25,24 --> 03:31:26,58
Mommy. Daddy.

03:31:26,95 --> 03:31:27,95
Watch me.

03:31:28,54 --> 03:31:29,54
We're watching, darling.

03:31:30,37 --> 03:31:32,33
You're mighty pretty, precious.

03:31:32,37 --> 03:31:33,67
So are you.

03:31:34,04 --> 03:31:36,67
I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.

03:31:37,46 --> 03:31:40,13
I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet, Bonnie.

03:31:40,17 --> 03:31:42,63
Remember, you've just learned to ride sidesaddle.

03:31:42,68 --> 03:31:44,01
I will so jump.

03:31:44,05 --> 03:31:46,56
I can jump better than ever 'cause I've grown

03:31:46,97 --> 03:31:48,60
and I've moved the bar higher.

03:31:48,64 --> 03:31:50,06
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

03:31:50,56 --> 03:31:54,56
No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off, don't cry and blame me.

03:31:55,65 --> 03:31:57,07
Rhett, stop her.

03:31:59,07 --> 03:32:00,28
Bonnie.

03:32:01,07 --> 03:32:02,07
Bonnie.

03:32:03,36 --> 03:32:04,57
Just like Pa.

03:32:08,37 --> 03:32:09,45
Just like Pa.

03:32:11,16 --> 03:32:12,16
Bonnie.

03:32:20,76 --> 03:32:21,76
Bonnie.

03:32:22,55 --> 03:32:23,47
Bonnie.

03:32:40,37 --> 03:32:43,37
Lordsy, Miss Melly. I sure is glad you has come.

03:32:45,96 --> 03:32:48,83
This house won't seem the same without Bonnie.

03:32:48,88 --> 03:32:50,54
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

03:32:50,88 --> 03:32:53,67
Miss Melly, this here done broke her heart

03:32:54,46 --> 03:32:57,01
but I didn't fetch you here on Miss Scarlett's account.

03:32:57,05 --> 03:33:01,05
What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand.

03:33:02,76 --> 03:33:04,77
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

03:33:08,56 --> 03:33:11,11
He done lost his mind these last couple of days.

03:33:11,15 --> 03:33:12,65
No, Mammy, no.

03:33:13,07 --> 03:33:17,07
I ain't never see'd no man, black or white, set such store on any child.

03:33:17,86 --> 03:33:19,95
When Dr. Meade says her neck broke

03:33:20,37 --> 03:33:23,95
Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there and shoot that poor pony

03:33:24,95 --> 03:33:28,00
and for a minute I think he going to shoot hisself.

03:33:28,04 --> 03:33:29,83
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

03:33:29,87 --> 03:33:34,67
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.

03:33:35,17 --> 03:33:37,55
She say, You give me my baby what you kill.

03:33:37,97 --> 03:33:41,76
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.

03:33:42,26 --> 03:33:46,27
It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another.

03:33:46,77 --> 03:33:48,85
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

03:33:52,06 --> 03:33:53,86
And then that night

03:33:54,86 --> 03:33:58,24
Mr. Rhett, he locked hisseIf in the nursery with Miss Bonnie

03:33:59,45 --> 03:34:01,03
and he wouldn't even open the door

03:34:01,07 --> 03:34:03,33
when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered to him.

03:34:03,37 --> 03:34:05,70
And that's the way it's been for two whole days.

03:34:05,74 --> 03:34:06,87
Oh, Mammy.

03:34:08,25 --> 03:34:11,37
And then this evenin', Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door

03:34:11,67 --> 03:34:13,92
and she say the funeral set for tomorrow mornin'

03:34:13,96 --> 03:34:16,76
and he says You try that and I kills you tomorrow.

03:34:17,05 --> 03:34:19,67
Do you think I's goin' to put my child away in the

03:34:20,05 --> 03:34:21,97
in the dark when she's so scared of it?

03:34:22,47 --> 03:34:25,22
Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.

03:34:25,26 --> 03:34:28,93
Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth. He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.

03:34:28,98 --> 03:34:30,64
You gotta help us, Miss Melly.

03:34:31,06 --> 03:34:32,73
Oh, but I can't intrude.

03:34:32,77 --> 03:34:34,77
If you can't help us, who can?

03:34:35,07 --> 03:34:37,65
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion.

03:34:40,15 --> 03:34:41,36
Please, Miss Melly.

03:34:43,57 --> 03:34:45,45
I'll do what I can, Mammy.

03:34:52,17 --> 03:34:54,25
Get away from that door, and leave us alone.

03:34:54,67 --> 03:34:56,34
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.

03:34:56,67 --> 03:34:58,30
Please let me in.

03:34:58,34 --> 03:34:59,97
I've come to see Bonnie.

03:35:21,36 --> 03:35:22,36
Oh, Lord

03:35:23,15 --> 03:35:25,66
please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief.

03:35:38,17 --> 03:35:41,17
I want you to go and make a good deal of strong coffee

03:35:41,46 --> 03:35:44,97
and bring it up to Captain Butler. I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.

03:35:45,47 --> 03:35:46,34
But.

03:35:46,85 --> 03:35:50,22
Captain Butler is quite willing for the funeral to take place

03:35:50,27 --> 03:35:51,43
tomorrow morning.

03:35:51,47 --> 03:35:56,27
Hallelujah. I suspects the angeIs fights on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.

03:35:57,56 --> 03:35:59,15
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.

03:36:00,07 --> 03:36:01,03
Miss Melly.

03:36:01,07 --> 03:36:02,65
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.

03:36:04,36 --> 03:36:06,36
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy

03:36:07,07 --> 03:36:08,33
and try

03:36:08,37 --> 03:36:10,08
try to get me home.

03:36:11,75 --> 03:36:13,37
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.

03:36:21,17 --> 03:36:23,72
Where is my mother goin' away to?

03:36:23,76 --> 03:36:26,68
And why can't I go along, please?

03:36:27,26 --> 03:36:30,56
We can't always go along, Beau, much as we may want to.

03:36:32,27 --> 03:36:34,06
You're going back to bed now.

03:36:35,06 --> 03:36:38,27
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be.

03:36:39,06 --> 03:36:40,40
She hasn't your strength.

03:36:40,44 --> 03:36:43,78
She's never had any strength. She's never had anything but heart.

03:36:44,28 --> 03:36:45,70
You knew that, too.

03:36:45,74 --> 03:36:48,57
Why do I have to go back to bed? It's morning.

03:36:49,37 --> 03:36:51,37
It isn't really morning yet.

03:36:57,54 --> 03:36:59,33
You may come in now, Scarlett.

03:36:59,38 --> 03:37:00,84
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.

03:37:00,88 --> 03:37:04,46
I've been waiting here two whole days and I've got to tell her

03:37:04,97 --> 03:37:06,63
that I was wrong about something.

03:37:06,68 --> 03:37:09,26
She knows you were wrong. She wants to see Scarlett.

03:37:13,27 --> 03:37:15,23
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.

03:37:15,27 --> 03:37:17,60
I won't have you easing your conscience telling her things

03:37:17,64 --> 03:37:20,06
that make no difference now. You understand?

03:37:35,16 --> 03:37:36,25
It's me, Melly.

03:37:38,16 --> 03:37:39,25
Promise me?

03:37:40,38 --> 03:37:41,38
Anything.

03:37:42,67 --> 03:37:44,34
Look after my little son.

03:37:45,76 --> 03:37:48,05
I gave him to you once before.

03:37:49,18 --> 03:37:50,68
Remember?

03:37:51,47 --> 03:37:52,85
The day he was born.

03:37:53,47 --> 03:37:56,77
Please, Melly, don't talk this way. I know you'll get well.

03:37:57,56 --> 03:37:58,56
Promise me

03:37:59,48 --> 03:38:00,60
college.

03:38:00,65 --> 03:38:04,65
Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony, whatever he wants. But

03:38:05,94 --> 03:38:07,28
Melly, do try.

03:38:07,65 --> 03:38:08,57
Ashley.

03:38:10,66 --> 03:38:11,87
Ashley and you.

03:38:14,45 --> 03:38:17,25
What about Ashley, Melly?

03:38:18,75 --> 03:38:20,96
Look after him for me.

03:38:21,67 --> 03:38:22,96
Just as you

03:38:24,38 --> 03:38:25,96
looked after me for him.

03:38:29,97 --> 03:38:30,97
I will, Melly.

03:38:32,68 --> 03:38:34,93
Look after him

03:38:34,97 --> 03:38:37,97
but never let him know.

03:38:48,07 --> 03:38:49,07
Good night.

03:38:50,95 --> 03:38:51,95
Promise?

03:38:53,66 --> 03:38:54,87
What else, Melly?

03:38:56,08 --> 03:38:57,87
Captain Butler

03:38:59,25 --> 03:39:00,75
be kind to him.

03:39:01,46 --> 03:39:02,46
Rhett?

03:39:03,25 --> 03:39:04,96
He loves you so.

03:39:09,05 --> 03:39:10,17
Yes, Melly.

03:39:13,34 --> 03:39:14,47
Goodbye.

03:39:16,05 --> 03:39:17,06
Goodbye.

03:39:33,24 --> 03:39:34,86
You ladies may come in now.

03:39:40,87 --> 03:39:42,16
Ashley.

03:39:43,04 --> 03:39:45,67
I don't know where the mate to this is.

03:39:46,54 --> 03:39:48,17
She must have put it away.

03:39:49,34 --> 03:39:50,76
Oh, stop it.

03:39:51,34 --> 03:39:52,47
Hold me.

03:39:52,84 --> 03:39:54,47
I'm so frightened.

03:39:56,26 --> 03:39:57,76
I'm so frightened.

03:40:02,85 --> 03:40:06,35
Oh, Scarlett, what can I do? I can't live without her, I can't.

03:40:08,06 --> 03:40:09,44
Everything I ever had is

03:40:09,94 --> 03:40:11,44
is going with her.

03:40:12,65 --> 03:40:13,95
Oh, Ashley.

03:40:15,45 --> 03:40:17,37
You really love her, don't you?

03:40:18,16 --> 03:40:22,87
She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality.

03:40:23,75 --> 03:40:26,75
Dreams. Always dreams with you, never common sense.

03:40:27,04 --> 03:40:29,54
Oh, Scarlett. If you knew what I've gone through.

03:40:31,17 --> 03:40:34,97
Ashley, you should have told me years ago that you loved her and not me

03:40:35,34 --> 03:40:38,30
and not left me dangling with your talk of honor.

03:40:38,35 --> 03:40:41,56
But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying

03:40:42,47 --> 03:40:45,48
to show me that I could never mean any more to you than

03:40:45,98 --> 03:40:48,06
than this Watling woman does to Rhett.

03:40:50,44 --> 03:40:52,28
And I've loved something that

03:40:53,15 --> 03:40:55,07
that doesn't really exist.

03:40:57,74 --> 03:40:58,95
Somehow

03:41:00,37 --> 03:41:01,66
I don't care.

03:41:03,16 --> 03:41:04,87
Somehow it doesn't matter.

03:41:07,04 --> 03:41:08,67
It doesn't matter one bit.

03:41:13,76 --> 03:41:15,26
Ashley, forgive me.

03:41:15,97 --> 03:41:18,97
Don't cry. She mustn't see you've been crying.

03:41:19,47 --> 03:41:20,55
Ashley.

03:41:24,14 --> 03:41:25,48
Melly.

03:41:27,27 --> 03:41:28,65
Melly.

03:41:33,07 --> 03:41:35,07
Rhett, Rhett.

03:41:38,57 --> 03:41:39,86
Rhett, where are you?

03:41:44,37 --> 03:41:45,87
Rhett, wait for me.

03:41:50,88 --> 03:41:52,38
Rhett, wait for me.

03:42:19,65 --> 03:42:20,86
Rhett.

03:42:24,08 --> 03:42:25,16
Come in.

03:42:33,17 --> 03:42:34,17
Rhett.

03:42:34,88 --> 03:42:36,46
Melanie, she's.

03:42:40,18 --> 03:42:41,34
Well, God rest her.

03:42:42,05 --> 03:42:44,97
She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.

03:42:45,97 --> 03:42:47,27
A great lady.

03:42:47,77 --> 03:42:48,98
A very great lady.

03:42:51,77 --> 03:42:55,15
So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?

03:42:56,15 --> 03:42:59,86
Oh, how can you say such a thing? You know how I loved her, really.

03:43:01,24 --> 03:43:02,74
No, I don't know that I do.

03:43:03,24 --> 03:43:06,53
But at least it's to your credit that you could appreciate her at the end.

03:43:06,58 --> 03:43:09,87
Of course I appreciated her. She thought of everybody except herself.

03:43:11,16 --> 03:43:12,96
Why her last words were about you.

03:43:14,17 --> 03:43:15,38
What did she say?

03:43:15,67 --> 03:43:16,75
She said

03:43:17,17 --> 03:43:19,76
Be kind to Captain Butler. He loves you so.

03:43:25,97 --> 03:43:27,10
Did she say anything else?

03:43:27,14 --> 03:43:28,64
She said

03:43:29,27 --> 03:43:31,64
she asked me to look after Ashley, too.

03:43:34,06 --> 03:43:37,07
It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?

03:43:39,44 --> 03:43:40,65
What do you mean?

03:43:43,57 --> 03:43:44,74
What are you doing?

03:43:45,24 --> 03:43:46,74
I'm leaving you, my dear.

03:43:47,16 --> 03:43:50,75
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

03:43:54,17 --> 03:43:55,67
Oh, no.

03:43:56,38 --> 03:43:58,80
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.

03:43:58,84 --> 03:44:02,13
I don't want a divorce. Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight

03:44:02,17 --> 03:44:04,72
when I knew I loved you, I ran home to tell you.

03:44:04,76 --> 03:44:06,80
Oh, darling, darling.

03:44:06,85 --> 03:44:08,43
Please don't go on with this.

03:44:08,47 --> 03:44:12,10
Leave us some dignity to remember out of our marriage. Spare us this last.

03:44:12,14 --> 03:44:13,27
This last?

03:44:13,64 --> 03:44:15,40
Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.

03:44:15,44 --> 03:44:19,32
I must have loved you for years, only I was such a stupid fool I didn't know it.

03:44:19,36 --> 03:44:21,78
Please believe me. You must care.

03:44:22,28 --> 03:44:23,57
Melly said you did.

03:44:24,15 --> 03:44:26,66
I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?

03:44:27,87 --> 03:44:29,58
I never really loved Ashley.

03:44:30,66 --> 03:44:33,87
You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up till this morning.

03:44:35,17 --> 03:44:37,38
No, Scarlett. I tried everything.

03:44:37,88 --> 03:44:40,80
If you'd only met me haIf way, even when I came back from London.

03:44:40,84 --> 03:44:44,63
I was so glad to see you. I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

03:44:44,67 --> 03:44:47,47
And then, when you were sick and it was all my fault

03:44:47,97 --> 03:44:50,81
I hoped against hope that you'd call for me, but you didn't.

03:44:50,85 --> 03:44:55,14
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately, but I didn't think you wanted me.

03:44:56,56 --> 03:45:00,57
It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it? But it's no use now.

03:45:01,78 --> 03:45:04,86
As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.

03:45:05,36 --> 03:45:07,20
I liked to think that Bonnie was you.

03:45:07,24 --> 03:45:10,74
A little girl again, before the war, and poverty had done things to you.

03:45:11,66 --> 03:45:16,16
She was so like you, and I could pet her, and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.

03:45:18,25 --> 03:45:20,46
But when she went, she took everything.

03:45:20,75 --> 03:45:21,75
Oh, Rhett.

03:45:22,34 --> 03:45:24,21
Rhett, please don't say that.

03:45:24,26 --> 03:45:26,97
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.

03:45:29,26 --> 03:45:30,85
My darling, you're such a child.

03:45:31,76 --> 03:45:35,48
You think that by saying, I'm sorry,  all the past can be corrected.

03:45:38,44 --> 03:45:40,44
Here, take my handkerchief.

03:45:41,06 --> 03:45:44,57
Never, at any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.

03:45:50,45 --> 03:45:52,33
Rhett, where are you going?

03:45:52,37 --> 03:45:54,54
I'm going to Charleston. Back where I belong.

03:45:54,58 --> 03:45:56,45
Please. Please take me with you.

03:45:57,54 --> 03:46:00,04
No. I'm through with everything here.

03:46:00,88 --> 03:46:02,63
I want peace.

03:46:02,67 --> 03:46:06,55
I want to see if somewhere there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.

03:46:07,67 --> 03:46:11,18
Do you know what I'm talking about? No. I only know that I love you.

03:46:12,05 --> 03:46:13,64
That's your misfortune.

03:46:13,97 --> 03:46:14,97
Oh, Rhett.

03:46:20,15 --> 03:46:21,15
Rhett.

03:46:27,65 --> 03:46:28,82
Rhett.

03:46:28,86 --> 03:46:31,87
If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?

03:46:32,87 --> 03:46:35,16
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

03:46:49,17 --> 03:46:51,55
Oh, I can't let him go. I can't.

03:46:52,47 --> 03:46:55,06
There must be some way to bring him back.

03:46:57,77 --> 03:47:00,98
I can't think about it now. I'll go crazy if I do.

03:47:02,77 --> 03:47:04,65
I'll think about it tomorrow.

03:47:19,16 --> 03:47:21,25
But I must think about it.

03:47:21,87 --> 03:47:23,67
I must think about it.

03:47:25,25 --> 03:47:26,67
What is there to do?

03:47:28,17 --> 03:47:29,97
What is there that matters?

03:47:33,18 --> 03:47:35,43
Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara

03:47:35,47 --> 03:47:39,47
that Tara doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land's the only thing that matters.

03:47:39,85 --> 03:47:42,23
It's the only thing that lasts.

03:47:42,27 --> 03:47:46,02
Something you love better than me, though you may not know it. Tara.

03:47:46,06 --> 03:47:49,44
It's this from which you get your strength. The red earth of Tara.

03:47:49,78 --> 03:47:53,61
Why, land's the only thing that matters. It's the only thing that lasts.

03:47:53,66 --> 03:47:56,91
Something you love better than me, though you may not know it. Tara.

03:47:56,95 --> 03:47:59,91
This from which you get your strength. The red earth of Tara.

03:47:59,95 --> 03:48:01,62
Why, land's the only thing that matters.

03:48:01,66 --> 03:48:03,12
Something you love better than me.

03:48:03,16 --> 03:48:04,33
The red earth of Tara.

03:48:04,37 --> 03:48:06,04
Tara. Tara.

03:48:09,46 --> 03:48:10,55
Tara.

03:48:11,97 --> 03:48:12,97
Home.

03:48:14,34 --> 03:48:15,34
I'll go home.

03:48:16,85 --> 03:48:19,47
And I'll think of some way to get him back.

03:48:20,14 --> 03:48:21,47
After all, tomorrow is another day.


00:06:07,71 --> 00:06:13,63
这里曾是骑士和棉花的土地称为老南方

00:06:14,92 --> 00:06:21,02
在这个美丽的世界里骑士之风 以成为过去

00:06:22,51 --> 00:06:24,61
骑士和他们的淑女

00:06:24,65 --> 00:06:26,72
庄园主和奴隶

00:06:26,76 --> 00:06:29,41
在这里最后一次出现

00:06:30,51 --> 00:06:33,42
只有在书中才能见到

00:06:33,71 --> 00:06:36,39
如今只是梦的追忆

00:06:37,31 --> 00:06:42,97
一代文明 随风飘逝

00:06:51,56 --> 00:06:53,74
我们才不在乎被学校开除呢

00:06:53,77 --> 00:06:57,19
就要打仗了反正我们得离开学校

00:06:57,22 --> 00:06:58,65
哦战争  多让人激动啊

00:06:58,69 --> 00:07:00,78
那些穷北佬真要打仗啊?

00:07:00,81 --> 00:07:03,03
让他们看看讨厌

00:07:03,07 --> 00:07:04,45
战争  战争  战争

00:07:04,49 --> 00:07:07,64
这个春天里每次聚会都要谈论战争

00:07:07,67 --> 00:07:09,66
我烦得都要喊出来了

00:07:10,08 --> 00:07:13,33
再说 不会有战争的你说不会有战争?

00:07:13,38 --> 00:07:15,75
不会? 亲爱的真的要打仗了

00:07:15,79 --> 00:07:19,76
你们谁要是再说一句战争我就进屋去把门关上

00:07:19,88 --> 00:07:22,97
可是斯卡莉特 亲爱的 你不要我们打仗吗?

00:07:28,89 --> 00:07:30,06
好吧

00:07:31,27 --> 00:07:32,67
别忘了

00:07:33,06 --> 00:07:34,27
我警告过你们

00:07:34,56 --> 00:07:36,02
那谈谈我们明天到

00:07:36,07 --> 00:07:38,53
十二棵橡树卫尔科斯家的野餐会吧

00:07:38,57 --> 00:07:41,32
好主意和我们一起去野餐好吗?

00:07:41,36 --> 00:07:44,53
哦 我还没想过呢  我明天再说吧

00:07:44,57 --> 00:07:45,96
和我们跳华尔滋

00:07:45,99 --> 00:07:48,54
先跟他 再跟我再跟他 再跟我

00:07:48,58 --> 00:07:50,70
就这样答应了好倒是好 哦 太好了  不过

00:07:51,66 --> 00:07:55,64
那得要我没答应跟别人跳舞

00:07:55,67 --> 00:07:57,04
怎么 亲爱的 你不能这样对我们

00:07:57,09 --> 00:07:59,71
我想告诉你一个秘密? 秘密? 谁的?

00:07:59,76 --> 00:08:01,55
亚特兰大的梅兰妮・韩密尔敦小姐?

00:08:01,59 --> 00:08:04,22
艾希礼的表妹 她要到十二棵橡树卫尔科斯家

00:08:04,26 --> 00:08:07,22
梅兰妮・韩密尔敦那个假正经 谁要听她的秘密

00:08:07,26 --> 00:08:08,93
可是我们听说 他们

00:08:08,97 --> 00:08:13,65
艾希礼要和她结婚了你知道他们家的人 通常是表亲之间通婚的

00:08:13,68 --> 00:08:14,87
我们可以跳华尔滋了吧?

00:08:15,06 --> 00:08:16,36
当然了

00:08:17,27 --> 00:08:22,27
我敢说别的小伙子都要气疯了让他们气去吧  我们俩可以应付

00:08:22,30 --> 00:08:24,32
这不可能  艾希礼爱我

00:08:24,36 --> 00:08:25,82
斯卡莉

00:08:25,99 --> 00:08:27,62
我们怎么惹着她了?

00:08:27,66 --> 00:08:29,45
我们说错了什么让她生气了?

00:08:29,49 --> 00:08:34,06
斯卡莉小姐你出去也不围上披肩晚上天凉了

00:08:34,09 --> 00:08:36,25
你为什么不留先生们吃晚饭?

00:08:36,29 --> 00:08:38,34
你这样就象一个乡下姑娘

00:08:38,38 --> 00:08:40,55
爱伦小姐没功夫像我这么管你

00:08:40,59 --> 00:08:43,13
快进屋来

00:08:43,17 --> 00:08:45,43
再不进来就要着凉了

00:08:45,47 --> 00:08:48,22
不  我要去等爸爸从威尔克斯家回来

00:08:48,26 --> 00:08:49,89
快回来

00:08:50,47 --> 00:08:51,89
回来

00:09:07,07 --> 00:09:08,45
收工了

00:09:08,49 --> 00:09:09,83
谁说收工了?

00:09:09,87 --> 00:09:11,12
我说收工了

00:09:11,16 --> 00:09:14,62
我是头 在泰拉庄园什么时候收工 得我说

00:09:14,66 --> 00:09:16,17
收工了

00:09:16,67 --> 00:09:18,58
收工了

00:09:58,74 --> 00:10:02,80
哦 在这个郡整个州里没有能比得过你的

00:10:04,17 --> 00:10:05,17
爸爸

00:10:05,46 --> 00:10:07,76
现在你又感到骄傲了

00:10:08,62 --> 00:10:11,12
啊 郝斯卡莉

00:10:11,16 --> 00:10:15,43
你在监视我像你妹妹修伦那样

00:10:15,47 --> 00:10:17,73
去告诉你妈妈说我又跳栏杆了

00:10:17,77 --> 00:10:21,15
爸爸 我可不像修伦那样爱告状 可我觉得

00:10:21,19 --> 00:10:24,03
自从去年你跳这个栏杆摔伤膝盖以后

00:10:24,07 --> 00:10:28,65
我可不需要自己的女儿告诉我该不该跳

00:10:28,70 --> 00:10:30,32
那是我自己的脖子

00:10:30,36 --> 00:10:34,24
爸爸 你喜欢跳就跳吧十二橡树那儿怎么样了?

00:10:34,28 --> 00:10:35,33
威尔克斯家?

00:10:35,37 --> 00:10:39,37
他们正准备明天的野餐会无非是谈论战争

00:10:39,58 --> 00:10:42,33
讨厌的战争 那儿还有什么人吗?

00:10:42,38 --> 00:10:45,71
哦 梅兰妮和她弟弟卡尔斯从亚特兰大来了

00:10:45,75 --> 00:10:47,21
梅兰妮

00:10:47,26 --> 00:10:49,43
脸色苍白 说话好 转弯抹角 我讨厌她

00:10:49,47 --> 00:10:51,06
艾希礼可不这么认为

00:10:51,09 --> 00:10:54,18
艾希礼不会喜欢象她那样的人

00:10:54,68 --> 00:10:57,06
你怎么对他们那么感兴趣?

00:10:58,39 --> 00:11:00,52
没什么 我们回家吧 爸爸

00:11:00,56 --> 00:11:03,81
他跟你胡说过什么吗? 还是向你求过婚?

00:11:03,86 --> 00:11:05,32
没有 没有啊他不会的

00:11:05,36 --> 00:11:09,24
今天下午我听约翰・卫克斯说

00:11:09,27 --> 00:11:11,13
艾希礼要和梅兰妮小姐结婚

00:11:11,17 --> 00:11:12,99
在明天的舞会上宣布

00:11:13,57 --> 00:11:15,24
我不相信

00:11:15,28 --> 00:11:17,37
回来  你要到哪儿去?

00:11:17,66 --> 00:11:18,58
斯卡莉

00:11:19,58 --> 00:11:21,37
你怎么了?

00:11:21,79 --> 00:11:24,63
你要为追一个并不爱你的男人

00:11:24,67 --> 00:11:27,92
而丢脸吗?

00:11:27,96 --> 00:11:31,43
我并没有追他 只是 我只是觉得很奇怪

00:11:31,47 --> 00:11:34,22
你别吞吞吐吐的

00:11:34,26 --> 00:11:37,85
如果艾希礼想要娶你 我即使答应了也担心

00:11:37,89 --> 00:11:41,44
我愿意我孩子幸福 你跟着他不会幸福的

00:11:41,48 --> 00:11:42,94
我会的 我会的

00:11:42,98 --> 00:11:44,73
你嫁给谁都可以

00:11:44,77 --> 00:11:47,32
只要他是个南方人和你情投意和

00:11:47,36 --> 00:11:49,82
等我死了以后把泰拉庄园留给你

00:11:49,86 --> 00:11:52,32
我不要泰拉庄园 种植园对我毫无意义

00:11:52,36 --> 00:11:57,12
你是说 斯卡莉土地对你毫无意义?

00:11:57,16 --> 00:11:59,83
世界上只有土地才值得为它耕耘

00:11:59,87 --> 00:12:03,75
为它战斗 为它去死因为只有它 才是永恒的

00:12:03,79 --> 00:12:08,10
爸 你说话真像个爱尔兰人我为我是爱尔兰人而感到自豪

00:12:08,13 --> 00:12:11,05
你别忘了 小姐你也是半个爱尔兰人

00:12:11,08 --> 00:12:13,43
任何人身上那怕只有一滴爱尔兰人的血

00:12:13,47 --> 00:12:15,73
就会把他们生存的土地当作母亲

00:12:15,76 --> 00:12:21,35
可是你还是个孩子你将来会爱土地的

00:12:21,38 --> 00:12:24,57
只要你是爱尔兰人就会的

00:12:47,67 --> 00:12:48,84
她回来了

00:12:48,88 --> 00:12:51,64
你们的妈妈回来了

00:12:51,67 --> 00:12:54,63
她去照看那个下流的白种人

00:12:54,68 --> 00:12:58,22
连晚饭都顾不得吃拿点心来 把火挑起来

00:12:58,26 --> 00:13:02,01
爱伦小姐干什么这么累波 克是 墨利

00:13:02,04 --> 00:13:04,14
把蜡烛拿到走廊上她累坏了

00:13:04,17 --> 00:13:06,23
先生 爱伦小姐回来了

00:13:06,27 --> 00:13:08,31
她把自己累坏了

00:13:08,36 --> 00:13:09,49
狗别叫了

00:13:09,53 --> 00:13:13,24
起来 孩子 你没听见爱伦小姐回来了吗?

00:13:13,28 --> 00:13:15,57
去给她拿药箱

00:13:16,07 --> 00:13:18,32
我们正着急呢 爱伦小姐

00:13:18,37 --> 00:13:21,08
杰纳尔先生 没事 波克 我不是回来了吗

00:13:21,49 --> 00:13:25,12
欧郝纳太太 今天已经耕完了那块洼地了

00:13:25,16 --> 00:13:27,83
明天你要我干什么?

00:13:27,88 --> 00:13:31,75
威克尔森先生我刚从挨米施爱特那儿来

00:13:31,80 --> 00:13:33,42
你的孩子以经出生了

00:13:33,46 --> 00:13:36,72
我的孩子? 哦 我真的不明白

00:13:36,76 --> 00:13:39,18
以经出生了 还好 以经死了

00:13:39,97 --> 00:13:41,68
晚安 威克尔森先生

00:13:45,18 --> 00:13:47,73
我去为你准备晚饭

00:13:47,76 --> 00:13:48,73
先等我祈祷 妈蜜

00:13:48,77 --> 00:13:49,86
哦 是的

00:13:51,07 --> 00:13:52,36
欧郝呐先生

00:13:52,98 --> 00:13:54,65
你必须辞掉乔拉・斯威克森

00:13:54,69 --> 00:13:58,74
嗯 辞退他? 他是这个郡里最好的监工

00:13:58,77 --> 00:14:00,45
明天早上就让他走

00:14:00,49 --> 00:14:01,58
哦 可是

00:14:02,99 --> 00:14:04,08
是吗? 是的

00:14:05,50 --> 00:14:08,25
这个北方佬和那个下流女孩斯奈特利

00:14:08,29 --> 00:14:10,33
过一会再谈吧

00:14:10,38 --> 00:14:11,59
好吧 欧郝纳太太

00:14:17,26 --> 00:14:18,93
妈妈 我要穿斯卡莉的绿衣服

00:14:18,97 --> 00:14:21,72
休伦 你的那件粉红色长裙可漂亮了

00:14:21,76 --> 00:14:25,83
我为什么不能参加明天晚上的舞会呢? 不过你可以戴我的石榴石项链

00:14:25,86 --> 00:14:28,14
我为什么不能参加明天晚上的舞会?

00:14:28,19 --> 00:14:29,85
斯卡莉

00:14:29,90 --> 00:14:32,48
你显得很累 亲爱的我有点担心

00:14:33,36 --> 00:14:34,73
我很好 妈妈

00:14:34,78 --> 00:14:37,32
为什么我不能参加明天晚上的舞会?

00:14:37,36 --> 00:14:38,74
我已经13岁了

00:14:38,78 --> 00:14:41,12
你可以去野餐一直到吃晚饭

00:14:41,16 --> 00:14:43,45
我不穿你的破绿裙子了小气鬼

00:14:43,49 --> 00:14:44,45
少废话

00:14:44,49 --> 00:14:45,99
祈祷了  孩子们

00:14:52,67 --> 00:14:57,67
对所有圣人而言 我在思想言语及行为上犯罪太多

00:14:57,97 --> 00:14:59,43
为了我的过错

00:14:59,47 --> 00:15:02,68
为了我的过错为了我最严重的过错

00:15:03,10 --> 00:15:06,52
在此我向永远的处子圣母码利亚祈求

00:15:06,56 --> 00:15:09,02
神圣的麦克天使长

00:15:09,06 --> 00:15:10,94
神圣的施洗者约翰

00:15:10,98 --> 00:15:13,27
圣徒彼得与保罗

00:15:13,86 --> 00:15:17,03
以及所有圣人们祈求上帝保佑我

00:15:17,07 --> 00:15:19,07
艾希礼不知道我爱他

00:15:20,28 --> 00:15:23,99
我告诉他 我爱他那他就不会娶她了

00:15:25,16 --> 00:15:28,33
愿万能仁慈的上帝

00:15:28,37 --> 00:15:30,29
原谅我们 赦免

00:15:30,66 --> 00:15:32,46
并宽恕我们的罪行 阿们

00:15:34,14 --> 00:15:38,35
啊哦 别动 吸气

00:15:38,38 --> 00:15:40,84
奶妈 斯卡莉小姐的点心

00:15:40,88 --> 00:15:43,34
都拿回橱房去  我一点儿也不想吃

00:15:43,39 --> 00:15:45,14
哦 你得吃

00:15:45,18 --> 00:15:47,39
你要大口大口的吃

00:15:48,39 --> 00:15:50,48
不  我不吃

00:15:53,19 --> 00:15:55,23
快给我穿衣服我们已经晚了

00:15:55,27 --> 00:15:57,23
你要穿哪一件? 那件

00:15:57,27 --> 00:16:01,62
不行 3点钟以前是不能穿露胸的衣服的

00:16:01,65 --> 00:16:03,32
我要去告诉你妈妈

00:16:03,36 --> 00:16:06,78
你要是敢告诉妈妈一个字我一口也不吃

00:16:10,87 --> 00:16:11,96
好吧

00:16:17,14 --> 00:16:21,93
你 要把披肩披上 我可不想让你再长一身小疙瘩

00:16:21,97 --> 00:16:26,80
去年一个冬天都用牛奶给你擦才擦好的

00:16:32,27 --> 00:16:36,23
斯卡莉小姐 乖乖地听话吃一点吧 宝贝

00:16:36,27 --> 00:16:37,40
不

00:16:37,69 --> 00:16:41,49
我今天要好好的玩一天在野餐会上吃

00:16:41,78 --> 00:16:44,53
你难道不怕别人笑话你们家

00:16:44,57 --> 00:16:47,35
我告诉你多少次了

00:16:47,38 --> 00:16:50,12
小姐在人面前吃东西要像小鸟似的

00:16:50,16 --> 00:16:52,25
你这次去艾希礼先生家

00:16:52,29 --> 00:16:54,54
不能象庄稼人那样吃象只大老鹰

00:16:54,58 --> 00:16:55,87
胡说什么

00:16:56,38 --> 00:16:59,84
艾希礼・卫尔克斯跟我说过他喜欢女孩的胃口好

00:16:59,88 --> 00:17:02,72
男人们嘴里这么说心理可不这么想

00:17:02,76 --> 00:17:06,95
我看得出来艾希礼先生没想娶你

00:17:21,98 --> 00:17:26,81
喔 别吃得太快不然你又会吐出来了

00:17:28,37 --> 00:17:31,54
女孩子为什么那么傻非得找个丈夫

00:17:31,58 --> 00:17:36,83
斯卡莉・欧郝钠 如果我数到10 你还没下来 我们就不等你了

00:17:36,87 --> 00:17:38,04
我来了 爸爸

00:17:38,08 --> 00:17:39,13

00:17:44,67 --> 00:17:45,92
哦 天呐

00:17:45,97 --> 00:17:49,76
我的衣服这么紧这一天我都得打嗝了

00:17:52,08 --> 00:17:55,75
十二橡树园 卫约翰警告

00:17:56,12 --> 00:18:01,49
任何擅闯本农P者都将遭到起诉

00:18:13,50 --> 00:18:14,54

00:18:14,58 --> 00:18:18,54
卫约翰 今天的野餐会一定很热闹

00:18:18,58 --> 00:18:21,54
是的 杰拉尔德欧郝纳太太没有一起来?

00:18:21,59 --> 00:18:23,80
她和监工结算帐目呢

00:18:23,83 --> 00:18:25,42
晚上要来参加舞会

00:18:25,46 --> 00:18:27,34
欢迎到十二橡树来欧郝纳先生

00:18:27,38 --> 00:18:29,43
谢谢你 英蒂雅

00:18:29,47 --> 00:18:32,18
你的女儿越长越漂亮了 约翰

00:18:32,76 --> 00:18:35,72
英蒂雅 你去招呼一下欧郝纳家的姑娘

00:18:35,77 --> 00:18:39,47
我受不了斯卡莉看她讨好艾希礼的那副样子

00:18:39,50 --> 00:18:41,23
好了 那是你哥哥的事

00:18:41,27 --> 00:18:43,82
记住你的责任是当好女主人

00:18:43,86 --> 00:18:45,19
早上好 姑娘们

00:18:46,78 --> 00:18:48,36

见到你真荣幸

00:19:04,96 --> 00:19:06,17
看到你真是太高兴了

00:19:07,88 --> 00:19:08,88
艾希礼

00:19:11,26 --> 00:19:12,89
斯卡莉 亲爱的

00:19:14,39 --> 00:19:16,52
我各处找你

00:19:16,56 --> 00:19:18,73
我有点事想跟你说

00:19:18,77 --> 00:19:22,44
你能找个辟静的地方吗? 好的 我愿意陪你

00:19:22,48 --> 00:19:24,44
不过我也有件事想告诉你

00:19:24,48 --> 00:19:27,28
我希望 我希望你听了会高兴

00:19:28,07 --> 00:19:30,53
先跟我表妹打个招呼好吗

00:19:30,57 --> 00:19:32,16
哦 有这个必要吗?

00:19:32,49 --> 00:19:35,45
她正在等着 见见你呢

00:19:35,49 --> 00:19:36,58
梅兰妮

00:19:37,66 --> 00:19:39,16
斯卡莉在这儿

00:19:39,66 --> 00:19:40,66
斯卡莉

00:19:42,17 --> 00:19:43,92
又见到你 我真高兴

00:19:43,96 --> 00:19:47,13
梅兰妮・韩蜜尔敦没想到在这儿见到你

00:19:47,17 --> 00:19:49,34
希望你在这儿能跟我们多呆几天

00:19:49,38 --> 00:19:53,05
我希望我们常在一起成为好朋友

00:19:53,09 --> 00:19:54,55
我真希望这样

00:19:54,60 --> 00:19:56,51
我们把她留下来好吗? 斯卡莉

00:19:56,56 --> 00:19:59,02
喔  那我们得让她玩得高兴是不是 艾希礼?

00:19:59,06 --> 00:20:02,14
艾希礼最会哄女孩子高兴了

00:20:02,19 --> 00:20:05,78
所以我认为我们开玩笑你会看不惯因为你很严肃

00:20:05,81 --> 00:20:08,72
斯卡莉 你是这么活泼

00:20:08,75 --> 00:20:09,94
我非常羡慕你

00:20:09,99 --> 00:20:11,65
我真希望能像你一点儿

00:20:11,70 --> 00:20:14,62
你可别恭维我 梅兰妮没这么想就别这么说

00:20:14,66 --> 00:20:19,02
没有人能说梅兰妮是不真诚的是吧? 亲爱的

00:20:19,05 --> 00:20:20,83
喔  那她可不像你了是吗?

00:20:20,87 --> 00:20:23,29
艾希礼从来没有对女孩子说过实话

00:20:23,87 --> 00:20:27,34
哦 卡尔斯・韩蜜尔敦漂亮的老家伙

00:20:27,38 --> 00:20:29,05
喔 欧郝纳小姐

00:20:29,09 --> 00:20:31,34
你把你的漂亮兄弟带到这儿来

00:20:31,38 --> 00:20:33,88
是为了伤我这可怜的 单纯的乡村姑娘的心吗?

00:20:34,18 --> 00:20:36,22
看 斯卡莉 以前她从没理过卡尔斯

00:20:36,26 --> 00:20:38,95
现在因为他是你的男朋友 她就盯上他了

00:20:38,98 --> 00:20:41,15
卡尔斯・韩蜜尔敦 我要跟你一起吃野餐

00:20:41,18 --> 00:20:45,14
你可不要跟别的女孩子调情 我要忌妒的

00:20:45,17 --> 00:20:46,36
我不会的 欧郝纳小姐

00:20:46,86 --> 00:20:48,07
我不会的

00:20:48,57 --> 00:20:51,32
弗兰克・肯尼迪 你留着胡子

00:20:51,36 --> 00:20:52,74
看起来更漂亮了

00:20:52,78 --> 00:20:55,28
谢谢 谢谢你斯卡莉小姐

00:20:55,66 --> 00:20:58,53
恰尔斯跟卡尔斯特邀请我一起吃野餐

00:20:58,58 --> 00:21:00,83
我告诉他们 我答应你了

00:21:00,87 --> 00:21:04,46
别觉得可笑了 你看她又盯上你的男朋友了

00:21:04,87 --> 00:21:07,67
真让我受宠若惊了 斯卡莉小姐

00:21:08,17 --> 00:21:10,17
我愿意为你效劳 斯卡莉小姐

00:21:10,46 --> 00:21:13,13
你妹妹为什么生气啊? 你勾引她的男朋友了?

00:21:13,17 --> 00:21:16,34
好像我找不到比他更好的了

00:21:16,39 --> 00:21:19,72
伯伦特 史托尔特 亲爱的俩个漂亮小伙子

00:21:19,76 --> 00:21:21,35
我不是说你们 我在生你们的气呢

00:21:21,39 --> 00:21:22,43
为什么? 斯卡莉 我们怎么了?

00:21:22,47 --> 00:21:24,73
你们一整天都没有接近我 我穿这件旧衣服

00:21:24,77 --> 00:21:26,15
就因为你们喜欢

00:21:26,19 --> 00:21:28,23
我准备和你们一起吃野餐呢

00:21:28,27 --> 00:21:30,65
太好了 斯卡莉 当然了 亲爱的

00:21:30,69 --> 00:21:34,57
我还没有想好你们俩个谁更漂亮

00:21:34,86 --> 00:21:38,07
我昨天晚上整整想了一夜

00:21:40,75 --> 00:21:41,91
喔 对不起

00:21:43,66 --> 00:21:45,54
凯沙林 那个人是谁?

00:21:45,58 --> 00:21:46,54
谁?

00:21:46,58 --> 00:21:48,58
盯着我们看还笑的那个人

00:21:48,62 --> 00:21:50,27
长得挺黑的讨厌的人

00:21:50,29 --> 00:21:54,78
啊  你不认识他? 他是瑞德・巴得勒 是查尔斯人

00:21:54,81 --> 00:21:56,47
他的名声很坏

00:22:01,39 --> 00:22:04,64
他的目光好象要透过我的内衣

00:22:04,68 --> 00:22:05,77
斯卡莉

00:22:06,06 --> 00:22:07,90
他是不受欢迎的

00:22:08,27 --> 00:22:09,81
他大部分时间要到北方度过

00:22:09,86 --> 00:22:12,44
因为查斯特人都不愿意理他

00:22:12,48 --> 00:22:14,82
他被西点军校给开除了 他的生活放荡

00:22:14,86 --> 00:22:18,24
他和一个女孩子有事又没有娶她

00:22:18,28 --> 00:22:19,45
说  快说啊

00:22:19,49 --> 00:22:23,49
天都黑了 他把她一个人带上了一辆马车

00:22:23,53 --> 00:22:26,84
没带监护人然后 他又不肯娶她

00:22:30,38 --> 00:22:32,96
没有  可她的名声破坏了

00:22:38,68 --> 00:22:40,34
艾希礼

00:22:40,39 --> 00:22:41,55
高兴吗?

00:22:41,60 --> 00:22:42,60
非常高兴

00:22:44,26 --> 00:22:46,48
你似乎就应该属于这里

00:22:46,89 --> 00:22:49,27
好像一切都是为你而设计好的

00:22:50,77 --> 00:22:53,15
我愿意让我属于你所爱的一切

00:22:53,19 --> 00:22:54,82
你跟我一样爱十二橡树

00:22:54,86 --> 00:22:56,34
是的 艾希礼

00:22:56,37 --> 00:22:57,82
我爱它

00:22:57,86 --> 00:22:59,49
不仅是这所房子

00:23:00,07 --> 00:23:04,08
这里有人世间最美好最优雅的一切

00:23:04,16 --> 00:23:06,37
不知道它会不会永远是这样

00:23:07,16 --> 00:23:08,25
梅兰妮

00:23:08,29 --> 00:23:11,63
你担心战争暴发了怎么办 是吗?

00:23:11,67 --> 00:23:14,29
我们不用害怕 不用

00:23:14,88 --> 00:23:17,38
任何战争都不会进入我们俩的世界

00:23:18,38 --> 00:23:19,68
无论发生什么事

00:23:20,38 --> 00:23:23,10
我都像现在 一样爱你

00:23:23,89 --> 00:23:24,97
只到死

00:23:30,06 --> 00:23:31,85
那好 在餐桌上只能

00:23:31,90 --> 00:23:34,36
一边有一个男伴

00:23:35,77 --> 00:23:36,82
我去给她拿甜食

00:23:36,86 --> 00:23:40,00
她说让我去的  欧郝纳小姐

00:23:41,57 --> 00:23:42,78
我想想

00:23:46,08 --> 00:23:48,87
让卡尔斯・韩密尔敦去拿吧

00:23:50,46 --> 00:23:52,17
谢谢你 欧郝纳小姐

00:23:52,67 --> 00:23:53,88
谢谢

00:23:54,17 --> 00:23:55,42
快去吧  快啊

00:23:55,46 --> 00:23:58,10
他真是太幸运了  真高兴啊

00:24:04,89 --> 00:24:05,89
欧郝纳小姐

00:24:06,09 --> 00:24:08,69
我 我爱你

00:24:08,72 --> 00:24:12,48
我 我觉得一点儿也不饿呢

00:24:15,86 --> 00:24:18,82
为什么非要睡午觉? 我并不累

00:24:18,86 --> 00:24:21,32
有教养的姑娘都要睡午觉的

00:24:21,36 --> 00:24:25,32
在这时候你的行为和举止都要像爱伦小姐的女儿

00:24:25,37 --> 00:24:29,02
我们在萨拉托卡的时候我没看见过北方女孩子睡午觉

00:24:29,05 --> 00:24:32,83
今天晚上的舞会可没有北方姑娘

00:24:32,87 --> 00:24:34,54
艾希礼今天是怎么那? 斯卡莉

00:24:34,58 --> 00:24:37,25
他好像没注意你

00:24:37,29 --> 00:24:38,96
你少管闲事

00:24:39,30 --> 00:24:41,42
但愿你能保住那个肯尼迪就不错了

00:24:41,47 --> 00:24:42,85
你一直对艾希礼有意

00:24:42,88 --> 00:24:45,60
今天晚上他就要宣讯┗榱

00:24:45,63 --> 00:24:46,60
全都知道

00:24:47,60 --> 00:24:50,52
斯卡莉小姐 休伦小姐注意点举止

00:24:50,56 --> 00:24:52,23
别像没教养的女孩子

00:24:52,27 --> 00:24:55,23
要象上等人那样去参加宴会

00:24:55,27 --> 00:24:56,36
我不在乎

00:25:03,48 --> 00:25:13,01
不要浪费光阴生命即是由时间所构成

00:25:47,78 --> 00:25:50,33
我们受够了北方佬的侮辱

00:25:50,37 --> 00:25:53,12
现在该让他们明白我们要保留奴隶

00:25:53,16 --> 00:25:54,62
用不着他们批准

00:25:54,66 --> 00:25:57,54
退出联邦是乔治亚州的权力

00:25:57,58 --> 00:25:58,54
闭嘴

00:25:58,58 --> 00:26:00,90
南方要用武力来维护自己

00:26:00,94 --> 00:26:05,92
我们在沙摩特要塞向北方流氓开火以后我们就必需打了

00:26:05,96 --> 00:26:08,64
没有别的选择战斗  对  战斗

00:26:08,67 --> 00:26:10,14
让北方佬向我们求和对

00:26:10,18 --> 00:26:14,40
情况非常简单 北方佬不会打仗而我们会

00:26:14,89 --> 00:26:16,35
甚至不用交火

00:26:16,39 --> 00:26:18,02
他们只会转身逃跑

00:26:18,06 --> 00:26:19,94
1个南方人可以消灭20个北方佬

00:26:19,98 --> 00:26:21,94
一次战斗就就可以把他们消灭光

00:26:21,98 --> 00:26:23,95
绅士总比暴徒能战斗

00:26:23,98 --> 00:26:26,32
对  绅士总比暴徒能战斗

00:26:26,36 --> 00:26:28,74
让我们这里的队长说说吧?

00:26:28,78 --> 00:26:33,13
如果左治亚州要打 我也会参加 不过象我的父亲那样

00:26:33,16 --> 00:26:36,54
我希望北方能够让我们和平地脱离联邦

00:26:36,58 --> 00:26:38,12
可是艾希礼 他们侮辱了我们

00:26:38,17 --> 00:26:40,13
你是不愿意打仗吗?

00:26:40,17 --> 00:26:43,75
世界上许多不辛的事都是由于战争

00:26:43,80 --> 00:26:47,76
可是等战争结束以后没有人知道为什么要打

00:26:47,88 --> 00:26:49,34
艾希礼 艾希礼 要不是我了解你

00:26:49,39 --> 00:26:53,57
好了  好了 先生们听说巴特勒先生到过北方

00:26:53,60 --> 00:26:55,56
你同意我们说的吗?

00:26:56,18 --> 00:26:58,73
我想只可以说是打不胜的 先生们

00:26:58,77 --> 00:27:00,23
你这是什么意思? 先生

00:27:00,27 --> 00:27:03,23
我是说整个南方没有一座制造大炮的工厂

00:27:03,27 --> 00:27:05,23
这对于一个绅士来说又有什么关系?

00:27:05,28 --> 00:27:08,53
恐怕这对于很多绅士都有很大的关系 先生

00:27:08,57 --> 00:27:11,32
你在暗示他们会打垮我们? 是吗?

00:27:11,37 --> 00:27:12,62
不 我没有

00:27:12,66 --> 00:27:15,83
我是明确地说北方佬的装备比我们好

00:27:15,87 --> 00:27:18,12
他们有工厂 造船厂和煤矿

00:27:18,16 --> 00:27:21,04
有舰队封锁我们的港口会把我们困死

00:27:21,08 --> 00:27:24,63
而我们有的只是棉花 奴隶和狂望

00:27:24,67 --> 00:27:28,22
替北方佬说话我拒绝听背叛的话

00:27:28,26 --> 00:27:29,84
很抱歉 我的实话冒犯了您

00:27:29,88 --> 00:27:32,34
道歉是不够的

00:27:32,39 --> 00:27:35,22
听说你是被西点军校开除的 先生

00:27:35,26 --> 00:27:39,27
查尔斯屯的任何正派的家庭都不欢迎你 甚至自己家

00:27:43,86 --> 00:27:46,86
我再次为我所有的缺点道歉

00:27:48,69 --> 00:27:51,45
卫尔科斯先生你不介意我各处走走

00:27:51,49 --> 00:27:54,78
看看你的庄园吧我好像破坏了各位的美酒 雪茄

00:27:55,28 --> 00:27:56,66
和胜利的美梦

00:28:03,67 --> 00:28:07,25
象巴特勒这样的人 还能指望他做出什么来吗

00:28:07,30 --> 00:28:09,13
就差把你叫出去了

00:28:09,17 --> 00:28:10,34
他不敢决斗

00:28:10,38 --> 00:28:13,22
不是那样的 卡尔斯他只是不想捉弄你

00:28:13,26 --> 00:28:14,43
捉弄我 ?

00:28:14,47 --> 00:28:15,93
是的 他是这里最好的射手了

00:28:15,97 --> 00:28:17,65
战胜过不少

00:28:17,68 --> 00:28:19,64
手比你稳头脑比你冷静的人

00:28:19,68 --> 00:28:20,93
我要让他看看

00:28:20,98 --> 00:28:23,52
好了  好了  别去找他的麻烦了

00:28:23,56 --> 00:28:26,48
有更重要的战斗需要你 卡尔斯

00:28:26,77 --> 00:28:29,23
巴特勒先生是我们的客人

00:28:29,28 --> 00:28:31,36
我去陪他走走

00:28:44,08 --> 00:28:45,17
艾希礼

00:28:52,76 --> 00:28:54,26
艾希礼

00:28:54,89 --> 00:28:55,97
斯卡莉

00:28:57,76 --> 00:28:59,97
你在这儿躲谁呢?

00:29:05,19 --> 00:29:06,77
你要干什么?

00:29:08,86 --> 00:29:11,86
为什么不跟女孩子在楼上休息呢?

00:29:13,20 --> 00:29:16,41
怎么那? 斯卡莉? 有什么秘密?

00:29:16,44 --> 00:29:18,68
艾希礼 艾希礼

00:29:18,71 --> 00:29:19,87
我爱你

00:29:20,16 --> 00:29:21,33
斯卡莉

00:29:21,37 --> 00:29:22,79
我爱你 真的

00:29:25,17 --> 00:29:28,84
你今天把所有男人的心都收走了 还不够吗?

00:29:28,88 --> 00:29:31,34
我心里一直有你这你是知道的

00:29:31,38 --> 00:29:33,05
喔 别开玩笑了

00:29:33,09 --> 00:29:35,84
你的心给我了吗? 亲爱的我爱你 我爱你

00:29:35,88 --> 00:29:39,64
你别再说这些了 你听了我的话会恨我的

00:29:39,68 --> 00:29:43,68
永远不会恨你我知道你喜欢我

00:29:44,27 --> 00:29:46,40
你是喜欢我 对吗?

00:29:47,56 --> 00:29:48,69
是的

00:29:49,27 --> 00:29:50,36
我喜欢

00:29:51,86 --> 00:29:54,78
让我们离开吧忘掉所说的这些

00:29:56,57 --> 00:29:58,16
我们怎么能这样?

00:29:58,57 --> 00:30:00,83
你 你不想跟我结婚吗?

00:30:00,87 --> 00:30:02,63
我要跟梅兰妮结婚了

00:30:02,66 --> 00:30:05,12
你不能 如果你喜欢我

00:30:05,16 --> 00:30:08,29
为什么一定要我说出让你难过的话呢?

00:30:09,17 --> 00:30:11,17
我怎么才能让你明白呢?

00:30:12,09 --> 00:30:13,63
你太年青 缺乏思想

00:30:13,67 --> 00:30:16,79
你不知道结婚意着什么

00:30:16,82 --> 00:30:18,15
我就知道我爱你 我要做你的妻子

00:30:18,18 --> 00:30:19,22
你并不爱梅兰妮

00:30:19,26 --> 00:30:20,76
她和我一样 斯卡莉

00:30:21,18 --> 00:30:23,89
我们有血缘关系而且彼此彼此了解

00:30:24,18 --> 00:30:26,23
可你爱我呀

00:30:26,27 --> 00:30:27,90
我怎么能不爱呢?

00:30:27,94 --> 00:30:31,02
你对生活充满热情我却缺少这些

00:30:31,07 --> 00:30:33,65
可是象我们这样性格不同的人

00:30:33,69 --> 00:30:35,32
是不会有美满的婚姻的

00:30:35,36 --> 00:30:38,57
你为什么不说? 胆小鬼你不敢娶我

00:30:38,86 --> 00:30:40,95
你宁愿和那个小傻瓜一起生活

00:30:40,99 --> 00:30:44,99
她只会说是或不是再给你生出那些象她那样笨的小崽子来

00:30:45,02 --> 00:30:46,33
你不应该这样说梅兰妮

00:30:46,37 --> 00:30:48,12
你是谁? 敢教训我该不该说?

00:30:48,17 --> 00:30:50,79
是你让我相信你会和我结婚的

00:30:50,83 --> 00:30:53,42
好了斯卡莉 要公平一点  我从来没有

00:30:53,46 --> 00:30:56,97
就是 就是我要恨你一辈子

00:30:57,67 --> 00:31:00,97
我想不出用什么话来骂你 才出气

00:31:27,87 --> 00:31:29,79
战争暴发了?

00:31:30,37 --> 00:31:33,79
先生 你应该让人知道你在这儿

00:31:34,09 --> 00:31:36,42
打断美妙的爱情场景?

00:31:36,46 --> 00:31:38,63
那太不明智了吧?

00:31:38,67 --> 00:31:41,26
别担心 我会保守秘密的

00:31:41,89 --> 00:31:43,05
先生 你不太象是个绅士

00:31:43,10 --> 00:31:45,18
小姐 你也不象是个淑女

00:31:45,68 --> 00:31:47,52
别认为我会要胁你

00:31:47,56 --> 00:31:49,35
淑女对我没有一点吸引力

00:31:49,39 --> 00:31:52,44
先偷听了我说的话然后再来羞辱我

00:31:52,48 --> 00:31:54,95
我对你充满敬意

00:31:54,99 --> 00:31:59,20
我希望等到你不再迷恋那位温雅的卫尔克斯先生时再见到你

00:31:59,23 --> 00:32:03,41
我看他配不上你这样的 怎么说的呢

00:32:03,44 --> 00:32:05,03
充满热情的姑娘

00:32:05,08 --> 00:32:07,66
你敢这么说你给他擦靴子都不配

00:32:08,34 --> 00:32:12,23
可是你还要恨他一辈子呢

00:32:14,59 --> 00:32:18,59
她可真行啊把野餐会上的每个男人都追到了

00:32:18,67 --> 00:32:20,34
别这么说 英蒂雅

00:32:20,38 --> 00:32:23,22
她太迷人男人们自然都围着她转

00:32:23,26 --> 00:32:25,55
梅兰妮 你真是太好了

00:32:25,60 --> 00:32:27,43
你没看见她追你弟弟 卡尔斯吗?

00:32:27,47 --> 00:32:29,64
而且她知卡尔斯跟我好

00:32:29,68 --> 00:32:31,36
你想错了 英蒂雅

00:32:31,39 --> 00:32:34,52
斯卡莉只不过是很活跃罢了

00:32:34,56 --> 00:32:38,23
男人只能拿这样的女人开开心 而不会娶她的

00:32:38,26 --> 00:32:40,47
你这话说得太刻薄点了

00:32:48,37 --> 00:32:51,37
打仗了  打仗了  要打仗了

00:33:03,09 --> 00:33:04,84
欧郝纳小姐

00:33:07,60 --> 00:33:08,93
欧郝纳小姐

00:33:08,97 --> 00:33:12,23
真让人激动 林肯先生召募自愿军

00:33:12,27 --> 00:33:14,96
和我们作战胡说什么 你们男人就没有别的重要的事吗?

00:33:14,98 --> 00:33:17,44
可这是战争每个人都要入伍了

00:33:17,48 --> 00:33:19,02
立刻就走 我也去

00:33:19,07 --> 00:33:20,07
每个人?

00:33:24,36 --> 00:33:26,78
欧郝纳小姐 看到我们走

00:33:27,16 --> 00:33:28,68
你会难过吧

00:33:28,72 --> 00:33:31,33
我每天都会把枕头哭湿的

00:33:31,37 --> 00:33:33,54
欧郝纳小姐 我说过我爱你

00:33:33,58 --> 00:33:38,13
你是世上最美 最甜的 最可爱的姑娘

00:33:38,17 --> 00:33:40,42
我知道我不指望你爱我

00:33:40,46 --> 00:33:43,92
我这么笨这么傻根本配不上你

00:33:43,97 --> 00:33:47,97
可如果你考虑嫁给我 我愿意为你做

00:33:48,01 --> 00:33:50,12
世界上任何事 我保证

00:33:50,18 --> 00:33:51,43
你 你在说什么?

00:33:51,47 --> 00:33:54,27
欧郝纳小姐 你愿意嫁我吗?

00:34:00,07 --> 00:34:02,07
好吧 韩密尔敦先生我愿意

00:34:02,69 --> 00:34:04,99
你愿意? 愿意嫁我你愿意等我?

00:34:05,36 --> 00:34:06,66
我 我不想再等了

00:34:06,70 --> 00:34:09,16
在我走以前 和我结婚?

00:34:09,66 --> 00:34:11,62
欧郝纳小姐

00:34:11,66 --> 00:34:13,37
太好了

00:34:15,08 --> 00:34:16,62
我什么时候和你父亲说?

00:34:16,67 --> 00:34:17,75
越快越好

00:34:17,79 --> 00:34:19,33
好吧 我这就去我不能等了

00:34:19,38 --> 00:34:22,48
请原谅 亲爱的

00:34:26,26 --> 00:34:28,14
欧郝纳先生

00:34:28,18 --> 00:34:30,14
我们至少还有1星期的时间

00:34:30,18 --> 00:34:33,27
只有1星期 他们就要把你招走了

00:35:02,57 --> 00:35:03,77
梅兰妮

00:35:06,47 --> 00:35:09,14
斯卡莉 在我们昨天的婚礼上

00:35:09,18 --> 00:35:13,54
我就希望你的婚礼也一样隆重

00:35:13,57 --> 00:35:14,29
是吗?

00:35:14,39 --> 00:35:16,77
现在我们真正成了姐妹了

00:35:17,48 --> 00:35:18,98
卡尔斯 梅兰妮

00:35:26,86 --> 00:35:30,03
亲爱的 别哭战争几个星期就会结束

00:35:30,07 --> 00:35:32,16
我又会回到你的身边

00:35:41,47 --> 00:35:45,53
虽然韩密尔敦上尉不是壮烈的战死在沙场

00:35:45,56 --> 00:35:48,36
但仍无愧为一位英雄

00:35:48,39 --> 00:35:51,16
他死于麻疹并发肺炎

00:35:51,66 --> 00:35:54,53
夫人 我是非常尊敬您的

00:35:54,54 --> 00:35:59,38
您忠实的仆人威德・韩密尔敦上尉

00:36:16,37 --> 00:36:17,66
斯卡莉小姐

00:36:18,37 --> 00:36:21,75
我不在乎我这么年轻就成为寡妇

00:36:21,79 --> 00:36:23,08
斯卡莉小姐

00:36:24,88 --> 00:36:27,46
我 我这个样子怎么见人那?

00:36:28,59 --> 00:36:31,13
你不能到外面去 你穿着丧服呢

00:36:31,18 --> 00:36:33,64
为什么? 我并不难过

00:36:34,18 --> 00:36:36,76
为什么要我装呢?

00:36:37,47 --> 00:36:38,97
怎么了?

00:36:39,68 --> 00:36:42,64

00:36:43,19 --> 00:36:44,45

00:36:44,48 --> 00:36:45,98
我的一切都完了

00:36:46,36 --> 00:36:49,60
我没什么指望了

00:36:51,36 --> 00:36:52,74
妈妈

00:36:52,78 --> 00:36:57,77
我一定认为我太不象话了可我不能穿着黑衣服各处走

00:36:57,80 --> 00:37:00,25
不但不能参加任何舞会

00:37:00,29 --> 00:37:01,83
还要这副样子

00:37:01,87 --> 00:37:03,83
我并没有觉得你不象话

00:37:03,87 --> 00:37:07,67
这很自然 你还年轻当然喜欢漂亮了

00:37:08,30 --> 00:37:09,96
好了 宝贝

00:37:10,96 --> 00:37:12,93
你到外面去走走? 怎么样

00:37:12,97 --> 00:37:14,22
去沙凡摩 好吗?

00:37:14,26 --> 00:37:16,26
我去沙凡摩干什么?

00:37:16,60 --> 00:37:18,35
那就 去亚特兰大

00:37:18,39 --> 00:37:20,64
那儿有很多事情可以做

00:37:20,68 --> 00:37:23,69
可以和梅兰妮和她的碧蒂姑妈在一起

00:37:24,56 --> 00:37:25,77
梅兰妮

00:37:26,19 --> 00:37:27,27
对

00:37:28,07 --> 00:37:29,32
对 可以吗

00:37:29,36 --> 00:37:32,53
喔 妈妈 你对我太好了比任何人都好

00:37:32,57 --> 00:37:34,45
你愿意了 真的

00:37:34,49 --> 00:37:37,66
那好吧  那就别哭了  笑一笑

00:37:39,58 --> 00:37:41,16
你可以带碧西一起去

00:37:41,87 --> 00:37:44,08
给斯卡莉小姐收拾行李 奶妈

00:37:44,46 --> 00:37:46,38
我去写封信

00:37:49,46 --> 00:37:50,46
亚特兰大

00:37:50,80 --> 00:37:54,13
你还是去沙凡摩好你在亚特兰大会有麻烦的

00:37:54,17 --> 00:37:55,72
你说有什么麻烦?

00:37:55,76 --> 00:37:59,22
你知道是什么麻烦我说的是卫尔克斯先生

00:37:59,26 --> 00:38:01,22
他一休假就要回到亚特兰大

00:38:01,27 --> 00:38:03,85
你就会像蜘蛛一样在那里等着他

00:38:03,89 --> 00:38:07,40
他是属于梅兰妮小姐的 照妈妈说的给我收拾行理

00:38:28,38 --> 00:38:31,34
人们都在议论我知道准是说她

00:38:31,38 --> 00:38:33,26
爱说就让他们说去吧碧蒂姑妈

00:38:33,30 --> 00:38:38,05
可斯卡莉住在我家人们知道我该为她负责

00:38:38,09 --> 00:38:41,93
一个寡妇在公共场合出头露面

00:38:41,97 --> 00:38:44,64
我一想起这些 就要晕了

00:38:44,68 --> 00:38:48,94
碧蒂姑妈 斯卡莉来这儿是为了义卖筹款帮忙的

00:38:48,98 --> 00:38:52,15
对于她来说 已经作出牺牲了

00:38:52,19 --> 00:38:53,94
别人要是听见你这么说

00:38:53,98 --> 00:38:57,54
还以为她来这儿是为了跳舞呢

00:39:09,79 --> 00:39:11,63
女士们 先生们

00:39:11,67 --> 00:39:14,30

李将军彻底打败了敌人

00:39:21,76 --> 00:39:25,77
把北方的军队从佛尔吉尼亚赶回北方去了

00:39:34,98 --> 00:39:38,07
现在报告大家一个令人惊喜的消息

00:39:38,57 --> 00:39:43,51

00:39:43,54 --> 00:39:46,63
他的船只 冒着北方佬的枪林弹雨

00:39:46,66 --> 00:39:50,66
给我们运来了今天晚上大家穿的丝毛衣料

00:39:50,67 --> 00:39:54,67
女士们 先生们 我说的这位

00:39:54,71 --> 00:39:57,76
不是别人 他就是我们的朋友

00:39:57,79 --> 00:40:00,01
查尔斯敦的瑞德・巴特勒船长

00:40:19,83 --> 00:40:22,07

00:40:29,87 --> 00:40:31,92
上次在我丈夫家里见过面

00:40:31,96 --> 00:40:34,17
很荣幸你还记得我卫尔克斯太太

00:40:34,59 --> 00:40:37,25
在十二颗橡树见过巴特勒船长吗? 斯卡莉

00:40:37,30 --> 00:40:39,38
是的 我 我见过

00:40:39,67 --> 00:40:42,34
只见了一会儿 韩密尔敦太太是在书房里

00:40:42,38 --> 00:40:44,26
你是打碎了什么东西

00:40:45,39 --> 00:40:47,85
是的 巴特勒船长 我记得你

00:40:47,89 --> 00:40:51,69
女士们 请求你们捐献珠宝支援我们崇高的事业

00:40:51,98 --> 00:40:54,02

00:41:05,78 --> 00:41:07,83
这是您的结婚戒指 太太

00:41:07,87 --> 00:41:11,16
这可能 对我丈夫会有所帮助

00:41:11,87 --> 00:41:12,96
谢谢

00:41:15,38 --> 00:41:17,96
这真是一个崇高的举动卫尔克斯太太

00:41:18,46 --> 00:41:19,59
给

00:41:19,88 --> 00:41:22,38
我的也给你  为了事业

00:41:24,68 --> 00:41:28,60
可是你 韩密尔敦太太我知道它对你有多大的意义

00:41:28,89 --> 00:41:30,22
梅兰妮什么? 米特大夫

00:41:30,27 --> 00:41:32,64
我要做一件惊人的事情

00:41:32,69 --> 00:41:35,27
你作为委员会的成员我需要你的同意

00:41:35,98 --> 00:41:37,86
请原谅  我们去一下

00:41:39,78 --> 00:41:43,36
我说一件事 战争造成了最奇特的寡妇

00:41:43,70 --> 00:41:44,95
我希望你走开

00:41:44,99 --> 00:41:48,08
你应该知道我不想再见到你

00:41:50,99 --> 00:41:52,54
别这么傻了?

00:41:52,58 --> 00:41:56,80
你没有理由恨我我会把你的秘密带到坟墓里去的

00:41:58,46 --> 00:42:02,13
我怎么能恨你这样一位战争中的大英雄呢?

00:42:02,17 --> 00:42:06,16
我很奇怪 你怎么会成为一个品德高尚的人呢?

00:42:06,19 --> 00:42:09,43
我不能欺骗你这样一个小女孩 欧郝纳小姐

00:42:09,47 --> 00:42:11,56
我既不高尚 也不是英雄

00:42:11,89 --> 00:42:13,14
可你穿过封锁线那?

00:42:13,18 --> 00:42:15,27
为了利益 只是为了利益

00:42:15,69 --> 00:42:17,73
你是说 你不相信什么理想?

00:42:17,77 --> 00:42:20,19
我只相信瑞德・巴特勒他是我唯一的理想

00:42:20,48 --> 00:42:22,28
别的对我毫无意义

00:42:25,36 --> 00:42:27,45
女士们先生们

00:42:27,49 --> 00:42:30,40
我有一个惊人的提议为了给医院募捐

00:42:31,09 --> 00:42:36,17
先生们 如果你们想选哪位女士做你的舞伴

00:42:36,20 --> 00:42:38,38
就请出个价钱

00:42:39,88 --> 00:42:42,92
卡沃尔米达 你怎么允许你丈夫这么做呢?

00:42:42,96 --> 00:42:44,64
就象拍卖奴隶

00:42:44,67 --> 00:42:47,26
多莉・梅丽瑞你怎么能批评我呢?

00:42:47,68 --> 00:42:49,35
梅兰妮告诉过大夫

00:42:49,39 --> 00:42:52,22
只要是为了崇高的理想这没有什么不对的

00:42:52,26 --> 00:42:53,52
她这么说?

00:42:53,56 --> 00:42:56,56
天啊  天啊  我的嗅盐在哪儿?

00:42:56,98 --> 00:42:58,23
我要晕倒了

00:42:58,27 --> 00:43:00,73
你别晕 碧蒂・韩密尔敦

00:43:00,77 --> 00:43:03,36
梅兰妮说没什么 就没什么

00:43:04,69 --> 00:43:07,49
来吧 先生们 你们出什么价? 说吧?

00:43:08,36 --> 00:43:10,07
别不好意思 先生们

00:43:10,87 --> 00:43:14,83
我出20元请美贝尔・梅丽贝丝小姐

00:43:14,87 --> 00:43:17,24
我出25元请芬妮小姐

00:43:17,27 --> 00:43:19,33
只出到25元就

00:43:19,38 --> 00:43:21,46
我出150元金币

00:43:22,09 --> 00:43:23,34
请哪位小姐? 先生

00:43:23,38 --> 00:43:25,30
请卡尔斯・韩密尔敦太太

00:43:28,18 --> 00:43:29,26
请谁? 先生

00:43:29,68 --> 00:43:31,43
卡尔斯・韩密尔敦太太

00:43:31,47 --> 00:43:33,72
韩密尔敦太太在戴孝期间

00:43:33,76 --> 00:43:36,52
不过我们亚特兰大每位美女们都会感到骄傲的

00:43:36,56 --> 00:43:40,06
米格大夫 我是说恰尔斯・韩密尔敦太太

00:43:40,77 --> 00:43:43,23
她不会考虑的 先生

00:43:43,27 --> 00:43:44,57
喔 我愿意

00:43:56,87 --> 00:44:00,08
舞会开始了 请选好舞伴

00:44:01,17 --> 00:44:03,25
我们震惊了南方邦联 太太

00:44:03,29 --> 00:44:04,96
这有点像穿过封锁线是不是?

00:44:05,30 --> 00:44:06,42
比这更糟

00:44:06,46 --> 00:44:08,42
不过我期望从中得到更多

00:44:08,47 --> 00:44:10,22
我不管你期望什么他们怎么想

00:44:10,26 --> 00:44:11,84
我就是要跳舞

00:44:11,89 --> 00:44:14,89
今天晚上就是跟林肯跳舞我也不在乎

00:44:46,80 --> 00:44:49,42
再跳一支舞我就名誉扫地了

00:44:49,47 --> 00:44:51,63
如果你有足够的勇气就不用管什么名誉

00:44:51,68 --> 00:44:53,76
我不爱听你这么说

00:45:01,77 --> 00:45:04,23
你的华尔兹跳得真神了巴特勒船长

00:45:04,27 --> 00:45:08,15
别给我卖弄风情我可不象葛米雅那些追求你的人

00:45:08,19 --> 00:45:10,49
我只想得到更多

00:45:10,99 --> 00:45:12,28
你想要什么?

00:45:13,07 --> 00:45:18,04
告诉你 斯卡莉・欧郝纳你脸上不要装成南方美人的那种假笑

00:45:18,29 --> 00:45:19,83
有一天我要你对我说

00:45:19,87 --> 00:45:22,66
你跟艾希礼说过的话

00:45:23,08 --> 00:45:24,29
我爱你

00:45:24,79 --> 00:45:28,80
你一辈子也不会听到这话巴特勒船长 永远听不到

00:45:33,67 --> 00:45:35,55
亲爱的卫尔科斯太太

00:45:35,59 --> 00:45:38,02
南方联邦可能需要男人们的鲜血

00:45:38,05 --> 00:45:39,72
但不需要妇女心中的血

00:45:39,76 --> 00:45:42,81
我已赎回了您的戒指现在把它退还给您

00:45:43,31 --> 00:45:45,96
等我从巴黎回来将要登门拜访

00:45:45,97 --> 00:45:48,24
亲自向您这位伟大女性的勇气

00:45:48,26 --> 00:45:51,50
和奉献精神表示敬意瑞德・巴特勒

00:45:51,86 --> 00:45:53,82
我也把韩密尔敦太太的戒指附上

00:45:53,86 --> 00:46:00,17
他心肠多好啊真是一位有心人别胡说了 他为什么一句也不提我的奉献精神?

00:46:03,97 --> 00:46:07,63
喔 喔  太可爱了

00:46:07,67 --> 00:46:09,10
瑞德 真是太漂亮了

00:46:09,14 --> 00:46:12,92
你不会真的是从巴黎专门给我买的吧?

00:46:12,97 --> 00:46:16,49
是的 我是想让你别在穿这虚伪的丧服了

00:46:16,53 --> 00:46:20,02
下一次我给你带一块绿丝绸做衣服配这顶帽子

00:46:20,05 --> 00:46:21,14
喔 瑞德

00:46:21,18 --> 00:46:27,02
让在家的女孩子们打扮得漂漂亮亮是对我们前方勇士应尽的责任

00:46:27,05 --> 00:46:30,07
我好长时间没有新东西了

00:46:40,28 --> 00:46:41,58
你看怎么样?

00:46:42,58 --> 00:46:44,16
难看  太难看了

00:46:44,87 --> 00:46:46,12
喔 怎么了?

00:46:46,17 --> 00:46:47,42
战争弄得你这样的女孩子

00:46:47,46 --> 00:46:50,67
都不知道时装该怎么穿戴了

00:46:55,29 --> 00:46:58,59
瑞德 我自己来吧

00:47:03,97 --> 00:47:07,06
可是瑞德 我还不知道自己敢不敢戴出去

00:47:07,98 --> 00:47:09,10
你会的

00:47:09,14 --> 00:47:12,55
奥 还有 你这条长裤

00:47:12,57 --> 00:47:15,44
现在巴黎还有那个女人穿长裤

00:47:15,49 --> 00:47:16,70
那穿什么?

00:47:17,07 --> 00:47:19,24
你不该跟我说这种事

00:47:19,28 --> 00:47:20,32
哼  小伪君子你不在乎 我知道

00:47:20,37 --> 00:47:23,04
只是不要说出来

00:47:23,08 --> 00:47:27,08
瑞德 我不能再接受你的礼物了 虽然你是一片好心

00:47:27,11 --> 00:47:28,92
不是好心 是诱惑你

00:47:28,96 --> 00:47:32,75
我送东西从来是指望回报的 我总是得到了

00:47:32,80 --> 00:47:35,26
我不会因为你送我一顶帽子就嫁给

00:47:35,30 --> 00:47:38,02
你别抬高自己了 我是不结婚的人

00:47:38,68 --> 00:47:41,26
我也不会为它和你接吻那

00:47:51,56 --> 00:47:53,36
睁开眼睛看着我

00:47:54,78 --> 00:47:56,74
不 我不想吻你

00:47:56,78 --> 00:47:58,53
尽管你非常需要人吻你

00:47:58,57 --> 00:47:59,95
毛病就在这儿

00:47:59,99 --> 00:48:02,95
你需要经常被人家吻 被会亲吻的人去吻

00:48:02,99 --> 00:48:05,62
我看 你以为你就是那个人

00:48:05,66 --> 00:48:08,50
可能吗? 如果那个时刻到来的话

00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:11,75
你是一个自负的 黑心肠的家伙 瑞德

00:48:11,79 --> 00:48:14,46
我为什么会让你来看我

00:48:14,88 --> 00:48:16,55
我来告诉你为什么

00:48:16,59 --> 00:48:18,84
因为我是这儿唯一能让你高兴

00:48:18,88 --> 00:48:20,55
的16岁到60岁的男人了

00:48:20,59 --> 00:48:23,85
高兴点吧 仗不会打多久了

00:48:23,89 --> 00:48:25,64
真的? 瑞德 为什么?

00:48:25,68 --> 00:48:28,85
现在正在进行着一场小的战斗

00:48:28,89 --> 00:48:29,94
无疑是 决定性的

00:48:29,98 --> 00:48:32,06
瑞德 艾希礼参加了吗?

00:48:33,77 --> 00:48:37,03
你还在想着那个木头脑袋的卫尔克斯先生?

00:48:37,07 --> 00:48:38,53
是的 我想他也参加了

00:48:38,57 --> 00:48:40,49
告诉我 瑞德 他在哪儿?

00:48:40,86 --> 00:48:43,99
在宾西法尼亚洲的一个小镇 叫葛里茨堡

00:48:48,30 --> 00:48:51,66
沉静而严峻

00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:55,35
亚特兰大将痛苦的目光

00:48:55,39 --> 00:48:57,05
投向远方的小镇

00:48:57,15 --> 00:48:58,24
葛里茨堡

00:48:59,45 --> 00:49:00,87
历史上新的一页

00:49:01,03 --> 00:49:02,58
正等待三天来

00:49:02,62 --> 00:49:04,54
在宾西法尼亚洲的田野上

00:49:04,63 --> 00:49:05,93
所进行的一场

00:49:06,27 --> 00:49:07,97
殊死决战

00:49:14,53 --> 00:49:15,34
阵亡名单

00:49:15,94 --> 00:49:16,87
阵亡名单

00:49:17,47 --> 00:49:18,57
阵亡名单

00:50:04,95 --> 00:50:06,53
给你 梅兰妮小姐

00:50:06,57 --> 00:50:09,28
他们都在抢所以把它撕成两半了

00:50:09,58 --> 00:50:12,37
斯卡莉你看 W字头的在末尾

00:50:16,29 --> 00:50:19,67
威尔曼 温岱尔怀特 辉特 威尔金

00:50:20,30 --> 00:50:21,55
威廉士伍喜 俄克纳

00:50:21,59 --> 00:50:23,88
斯卡莉 俄克纳已经过了他了

00:50:24,47 --> 00:50:26,34
没在里面

00:50:26,39 --> 00:50:27,34
他没在里面

00:50:27,39 --> 00:50:29,64
艾希礼还平安

00:50:29,68 --> 00:50:31,89
他还平安  他还平安

00:50:33,68 --> 00:50:37,69
喔 斯卡莉 你真好替我为艾希礼担心

00:50:45,20 --> 00:50:46,57
我要去看看她

00:50:48,16 --> 00:50:49,99
别在这儿哭了 亲爱的

00:50:50,99 --> 00:50:52,29
我们回家吧

00:50:53,66 --> 00:50:55,33
米格大夫 你们

00:50:55,37 --> 00:50:58,08
是的 我们的儿子达尔西

00:50:58,88 --> 00:51:01,46
我正在给他织手套呢

00:51:02,17 --> 00:51:03,96
现在用不上了

00:51:04,97 --> 00:51:08,93
妈妈  我要去参军我要把所有的北方佬都杀死

00:51:08,97 --> 00:51:10,43
德米特 别说了

00:51:10,47 --> 00:51:12,72
你去了再被打死你妈妈可怎么办?

00:51:12,77 --> 00:51:14,56
别说傻话了

00:51:17,27 --> 00:51:20,52
真是凄惨的一天 你没听到什么坏消息吧?

00:51:20,56 --> 00:51:21,77
艾希礼还平安

00:51:22,07 --> 00:51:23,73
我为卫尔克斯太太高兴

00:51:23,78 --> 00:51:25,32
可是很多人阵亡了

00:51:25,36 --> 00:51:26,32
你的朋友呢?

00:51:26,36 --> 00:51:30,03
几乎每个家庭都有 玖泰克兄弟两个

00:51:30,07 --> 00:51:33,87
是这样  看看他们看看这些可怜的人们

00:51:34,66 --> 00:51:38,17
南方算是垮了 再也站不起来了

00:51:38,96 --> 00:51:40,38
过去的

00:51:40,67 --> 00:51:43,92
生活的理想正在我们面前破裂

00:51:43,96 --> 00:51:45,92
我以前没听你这样说过

00:51:45,96 --> 00:51:49,97
我很气愤  浪费使我气愤 所有这一切纯粹是浪费

00:51:52,39 --> 00:51:53,89
不过你不用伤心

00:51:54,18 --> 00:51:57,56
艾希礼・威尔克斯还活着会回到爱他的女人家里

00:51:57,98 --> 00:51:59,40
两个女人

00:52:01,16 --> 00:52:02,98

把你的小鸡也给吃了

00:53:29,78 --> 00:53:30,78

00:53:39,37 --> 00:53:41,54
听说你是亚特兰大

00:53:41,58 --> 00:53:43,96
最后一只鸡

00:53:46,38 --> 00:53:48,84

00:53:52,59 --> 00:53:54,13
我们喝点酒好吗? 碧蒂姑妈

00:53:54,18 --> 00:53:56,64
你怎么说酒不够了呢? 彼得大叔

00:53:56,68 --> 00:54:00,35

他也是和表妹结婚的 和威尔卡斯家也是表亲

00:54:08,19 --> 00:54:11,57
我一直留着它等艾希礼回来过圣诞节的

00:54:11,86 --> 00:54:15,28
你们可以喝不过可别喝光了

00:54:15,86 --> 00:54:19,58
因为这是最后一瓶啦很珍贵的

00:54:24,50 --> 00:54:27,17

我们在医院里看护过她儿子 后来他死啦

00:54:40,39 --> 00:54:42,98

00:54:43,27 --> 00:54:45,39

00:54:45,89 --> 00:54:46,85

00:55:31,57 --> 00:55:32,57
艾希礼

00:55:36,99 --> 00:55:39,37
艾希礼让我送你去车站

00:55:39,87 --> 00:55:43,45
我宁愿记着 你现在这样

00:55:43,49 --> 00:55:45,29
也不愿看见 在车站发抖

00:55:45,79 --> 00:55:47,00

00:55:47,66 --> 00:55:50,46

快给我系上 亲爱的

00:56:03,39 --> 00:56:07,27
梅兰妮给你做新衣服的时候

00:56:07,69 --> 00:56:08,89
你亲手做的?

00:56:09,98 --> 00:56:12,77
这我太有价值啦

00:56:13,19 --> 00:56:16,19
你知道 我为你做什么都可以

00:56:16,99 --> 00:56:19,15
有件事你能替我做吗?

00:56:19,20 --> 00:56:20,20
什么事?

00:56:20,57 --> 00:56:22,66
你愿意替我照顾梅兰妮吗?

00:56:23,87 --> 00:56:26,87
她是那么地脆弱 那么地文静

00:56:27,37 --> 00:56:28,75
如果我死啦以后

00:56:28,79 --> 00:56:32,38
奥 别说啦 不吉利赶快祈祷吧

00:56:32,67 --> 00:56:34,17
你替我祈祷吧

00:56:35,17 --> 00:56:38,59
所有的人都应该祈祷末日快要到啦

00:56:38,88 --> 00:56:39,93
末日?

00:56:39,97 --> 00:56:41,39
战争的末日

00:56:42,18 --> 00:56:44,10
我们的世界末日

00:56:45,47 --> 00:56:48,43
你不会认为北方佬会打败我们吧?

00:56:48,48 --> 00:56:52,75
斯卡莉 我们的人现在光着脚

00:56:52,78 --> 00:56:54,97
而拂吉尼亚的雪很厚

00:56:55,57 --> 00:56:56,98
看看他们把

00:56:57,36 --> 00:57:01,78
再看看北方佬 一批一批越来越多

00:57:04,78 --> 00:57:07,49
等结束啦 我会在遥远的地方

00:57:07,99 --> 00:57:11,00
而由你照顾她对我是一个安慰

00:57:12,08 --> 00:57:14,17
告诉我 斯卡莉 能答应吗?

00:57:16,67 --> 00:57:17,67
我能

00:57:19,09 --> 00:57:20,76
艾希礼 就这些?

00:57:21,76 --> 00:57:24,39
就这些啦 再见

00:57:24,97 --> 00:57:26,93
艾希礼 我不能让你走

00:57:26,97 --> 00:57:28,22
你要坚强些不

00:57:28,27 --> 00:57:29,48
一定要不

00:57:30,06 --> 00:57:32,06
我又何尝忍心走呢?

00:57:32,90 --> 00:57:36,57
斯卡莉 你是那么的善良 那么的坚强那么的美丽

00:57:37,86 --> 00:57:39,78
不仅是甜美的脸

00:57:40,78 --> 00:57:42,20
还有

00:57:45,37 --> 00:57:47,58
艾希礼 艾希礼 亲亲我

00:57:48,37 --> 00:57:50,08
跟我吻别

00:57:56,79 --> 00:57:57,75
不 斯卡莉

00:57:57,80 --> 00:57:59,38
艾希礼 我爱你

00:57:59,96 --> 00:58:02,88
我一直爱着你从没爱过别人

00:58:03,18 --> 00:58:05,64
我跟卡里斯结婚只是为了气你

00:58:05,68 --> 00:58:08,10
艾希礼 跟我说你爱我

00:58:09,10 --> 00:58:11,56
我就靠它来渡过我的余生啦

00:58:13,48 --> 00:58:14,56
再见

00:58:34,50 --> 00:58:36,67
等战争结束啦 艾希礼

00:58:37,46 --> 00:58:39,46
等战争结束

00:58:44,26 --> 00:58:46,90
亚特兰大在祈祷与此同时

00:58:46,93 --> 00:58:49,22
北方军正乘胜前进

00:58:49,26 --> 00:58:51,10
人们仰着头

00:58:51,13 --> 00:58:52,95
但是心情沉重

00:58:53,27 --> 00:58:55,41
一批批伤员和难民

00:58:55,44 --> 00:58:57,22
涌入不幸的左治亚州

00:58:59,69 --> 00:59:01,36
我家的后面

00:59:02,19 --> 00:59:05,36
有一棵野李子树 春天开满了花

00:59:06,70 --> 00:59:08,37
下面有一条小溪你知道吗?

00:59:08,87 --> 00:59:10,37
是的 我知道

00:59:11,29 --> 00:59:14,62
我们小时候我和我的哥哥杰夫

00:59:14,66 --> 00:59:18,17
我跟你说过杰夫的事是吧? 夫人

00:59:18,67 --> 00:59:19,96
我是说过的

00:59:20,38 --> 00:59:21,63
现在

00:59:21,67 --> 00:59:24,59
也不知道他在什么地方

00:59:25,09 --> 00:59:28,39
自从波尔园战役之后 就得不到他的消息啦

00:59:28,89 --> 00:59:31,22
现在我们要给你量体温啦

00:59:31,26 --> 00:59:33,93
把这个放在嘴里 别再说话啦

00:59:33,97 --> 00:59:35,48
现在别说

00:59:35,89 --> 00:59:38,69
梅兰妮 我太累啦我得回家

00:59:39,77 --> 00:59:41,48
你不累吗? 梅兰妮

00:59:41,98 --> 00:59:44,57
不 我不累 斯卡莉

00:59:45,28 --> 00:59:47,03
被送来的 也可能是

00:59:47,07 --> 00:59:48,07
艾希礼

00:59:48,86 --> 00:59:51,66
只有陌生人来安慰他

00:59:52,08 --> 00:59:54,08
我不累 斯卡莉

00:59:55,29 --> 00:59:57,00
他们可能

00:59:57,50 --> 00:59:58,79
都是艾希礼

01:00:10,97 --> 01:00:14,93
我已经在马车上等了整整1小时想跟你说句话 卫尔克斯太太

01:00:14,97 --> 01:00:17,73
走开 你这垃圾别打扰这俩位太太

01:00:17,77 --> 01:00:19,35
别理她 梅妮

01:00:19,40 --> 01:00:21,73
这没什么 斯卡莉 你是谁?

01:00:21,77 --> 01:00:24,53
我是贝儿・沃特琳 不过这没关系

01:00:24,57 --> 01:00:26,83
也许你认为这儿没我的事

01:00:26,86 --> 01:00:29,54
告诉我你找我有什么事?

01:00:29,57 --> 01:00:32,95
我第一次到这儿来我说我要当护士

01:00:32,99 --> 01:00:35,12
可是这儿的太太们不要我

01:00:35,16 --> 01:00:37,33
也许她们是对的

01:00:37,37 --> 01:00:39,25
后来我要捐钱

01:00:39,29 --> 01:00:41,83
她们认为我的钱也不够好

01:00:41,88 --> 01:00:43,17
这些老孔雀

01:00:43,67 --> 01:00:46,09
我认识一位先生说你心肠好

01:00:46,38 --> 01:00:50,05
如果你是这样 请替医院收下我的钱

01:00:50,09 --> 01:00:53,35
你在这儿干什么? 不是已经跟你说过两次了吗?

01:00:53,39 --> 01:00:55,43
我是在跟卫尔克斯太太谈话

01:00:55,47 --> 01:00:57,43
请你收下我的钱 卫尔克斯太太

01:00:57,47 --> 01:01:00,22
既使是我的 也是好的钱

01:01:00,25 --> 01:01:01,36
你确实很慷慨

01:01:01,40 --> 01:01:04,52
不  我不是 我不过跟大家一样 是南方人

01:01:04,57 --> 01:01:06,16
你当然是

01:01:06,19 --> 01:01:08,44
这里很人可不这么想

01:01:08,49 --> 01:01:11,07
他们不像你 是这么好的基督徒

01:01:18,29 --> 01:01:21,08
看 米格太太 这有好多钱

01:01:21,37 --> 01:01:23,58
十  二十  三十  五十

01:01:23,96 --> 01:01:26,30
还不是我们的纸币 是金币

01:01:26,88 --> 01:01:28,59
让我看看这个手绢

01:01:28,96 --> 01:01:30,59
RB

01:01:32,59 --> 01:01:35,76
她坐的是瑞德・巴特勒的马车

01:01:36,68 --> 01:01:39,77
我要是不怕失身份看我怎么教训这个狐狸精

01:01:45,30 --> 01:01:49,35
谢尔曼将军的第一发炮弹给这个城市造成了恐慌

01:01:49,38 --> 01:01:52,21
没有援军 没有武器

01:01:52,41 --> 01:01:55,32
人们纷纷逃避即将来临的灾难

01:01:56,14 --> 01:01:59,04
勇敢的残存部队开赴前方

01:01:59,08 --> 01:02:02,09
姑铸一掷的迎击敌人

01:02:14,68 --> 01:02:17,64
主是我的牧者 我必不至缺乏

01:02:17,68 --> 01:02:20,27
他使我躺卧在青草地上

01:02:20,68 --> 01:02:21,77
领略着安歇的时间

01:02:24,19 --> 01:02:26,45
他使我的灵魂苏醒

01:02:26,48 --> 01:02:29,86
以自己的名誉引导我走正义路

01:02:30,57 --> 01:02:33,78
我虽然走过死阴的幽谷

01:02:34,20 --> 01:02:35,78
也不怕遭害

01:02:36,07 --> 01:02:37,37
因为你与我同在

01:02:37,66 --> 01:02:40,16
你的脏 你的肝都安慰吧

01:02:41,29 --> 01:02:42,29
北方佬

01:02:42,87 --> 01:02:45,92
米格大夫 他们离我们近啦

01:02:45,96 --> 01:02:50,59
他们永远进不了亚特兰大永远越不过我们的防线

01:02:51,59 --> 01:02:53,76
给我点止痛药吧

01:02:54,17 --> 01:02:55,93
大夫 给我点止痛药吧

01:02:56,62 --> 01:02:59,75
很抱歉 孩子 我们没有

01:03:00,86 --> 01:03:03,29
这些虱子快让我发疯啦

01:03:03,96 --> 01:03:06,12
什么运气你抓到啦我的J

01:03:06,19 --> 01:03:08,79
给我力量我要去打仗

01:03:08,86 --> 01:03:10,52
我会祝愿你

01:03:14,43 --> 01:03:18,49
我再也见不到你和爸爸啦

01:03:19,47 --> 01:03:21,20
这条腿得锯掉 孩子

01:03:21,27 --> 01:03:23,60
不  不  别管我

01:03:23,71 --> 01:03:24,83
对不起 没别的办法啦

01:03:24,91 --> 01:03:27,25
我们没有麻醉药了 大夫

01:03:27,28 --> 01:03:28,57
只好不用麻药做手术啦

01:03:28,65 --> 01:03:30,48
不  不  我不锯

01:03:30,52 --> 01:03:32,82
你们不能这样  我不要你们锯

01:03:32,85 --> 01:03:36,08
告诉威尔克森大夫立刻把它锯掉已经坏死啦

01:03:36,15 --> 01:03:38,25
不  不  不要锯

01:03:38,29 --> 01:03:41,12
我已经3天3夜没回家啦

01:03:41,15 --> 01:03:43,42
我得回去半小时看一下

01:03:43,53 --> 01:03:45,09
护理员 帮我一把

01:03:49,23 --> 01:03:51,46
护士把这张床腾出来吧

01:03:52,47 --> 01:03:53,99
斯卡莉小姐

01:03:55,64 --> 01:03:57,34
弗兰克・肯尼迪

01:03:57,41 --> 01:03:59,47
休伦小姐 她好吗?

01:03:59,68 --> 01:04:03,59
你什么时候进来的 弗兰克? 你伤势重吗?

01:04:03,62 --> 01:04:06,21
休伦小姐她好吗? 她很好 弗兰克

01:04:06,24 --> 01:04:08,39
大夫让你到手术室去

01:04:08,43 --> 01:04:10,54

01:04:26,30 --> 01:04:28,10
别

01:04:28,47 --> 01:04:29,60
求你了

01:04:30,01 --> 01:04:31,70
护士护士在哪儿?

01:04:35,94 --> 01:04:37,35

大山姆

01:05:46,52 --> 01:05:48,49
大山姆  山姆

01:06:04,16 --> 01:06:04,93
只是一点小病小姐

01:06:04,97 --> 01:06:09,30
你爸爸因为膝盖受伤 没让他去打仗

01:06:09,34 --> 01:06:13,64
军队让我们这些人为

01:06:13,67 --> 01:06:14,68
白人士兵挖掩体

01:06:14,75 --> 01:06:16,18
你妈妈说挖这个是为了南方

01:06:16,25 --> 01:06:17,37
那有大夫吗?

01:06:17,45 --> 01:06:18,57

01:07:00,63 --> 01:07:02,86
请你快送我到碧蒂姑妈家

01:07:04,43 --> 01:07:06,83
逃难挺好看的是不是?

01:07:09,67 --> 01:07:12,26
这是雪尔曼将军又送来的一张名片

01:07:12,34 --> 01:07:13,70
他要来拜访我们啦

01:07:13,74 --> 01:07:17,46
我得离开这儿 趁北方佬还没来赶快离开这儿

01:07:17,49 --> 01:07:18,54
你不打算在医院工作啦?

01:07:18,58 --> 01:07:22,38
你对死亡 蚤子 做手续切肉赶到厌倦啦?

01:07:22,45 --> 01:07:24,75
我看你不适和照顾伤病员

01:07:24,82 --> 01:07:28,10
别跟我说这些啦 我快吓死啦

01:07:28,13 --> 01:07:29,31
我希望离开这儿

01:07:29,34 --> 01:07:30,49
那我们就一块走

01:07:30,56 --> 01:07:33,79
没有必要呆在这儿看到南方遭秧

01:07:33,86 --> 01:07:36,66
有很多好地方可以去

01:07:36,73 --> 01:07:39,03
墨西哥 伦敦 巴黎

01:07:39,10 --> 01:07:40,96
跟你? 是的 太太

01:07:41,27 --> 01:07:44,70
跟一个了解和钦佩你为人的男人

01:07:44,77 --> 01:07:47,86
我认为我们俩人是同一类人

01:07:48,24 --> 01:07:52,90
我等着你心里不再想着那位愁眉苦脸的艾希礼・卫尔克斯

01:07:52,98 --> 01:07:57,41
听说卫尔克斯太太还有一个月就要生产啦

01:07:57,48 --> 01:08:01,44
爱上一个有妻儿的人一定会非常的痛苦

01:08:03,86 --> 01:08:08,21
我们到啦 你是跟我走? 还是下车?

01:08:08,23 --> 01:08:13,03
我讨厌你 看不上你 至死都讨厌你 看不上你

01:08:13,73 --> 01:08:16,60
不 不会的 斯卡莉 不会那么久的

01:08:24,14 --> 01:08:25,71
斯卡莉小姐 斯卡莉小姐

01:08:25,74 --> 01:08:30,22
人们都到梅肯去啦跑啦 都跑啦

01:08:30,25 --> 01:08:32,89
我受不了啦 耳朵里全是炮声

01:08:32,95 --> 01:08:35,18
我一听到炮声 就要晕倒

01:08:36,12 --> 01:08:38,45
彼得大叔 小心箱子

01:08:38,52 --> 01:08:40,15
碧蒂姑妈 你要走吗?

01:08:40,22 --> 01:08:43,13
也许我是个胆小鬼 可是亲爱的

01:08:43,16 --> 01:08:44,99
北方佬进了左治亚

01:08:45,20 --> 01:08:46,29
他们是怎么进来的?

01:08:46,36 --> 01:08:50,16
我也要走 普里西替我收拾东西 快点

01:08:50,19 --> 01:08:50,97
碧蒂姑妈 我也得走

01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:53,52
斯卡莉 你真的要走吗?

01:08:53,55 --> 01:08:54,14
斯卡莉

01:08:54,17 --> 01:08:57,17
怎么会事? 你不是想逃跑吧?

01:08:57,21 --> 01:09:01,41
请你不要拦阻我 我再也不想回医院去啦

01:09:01,44 --> 01:09:03,77
我闻够啦死人和腐烂的味

01:09:03,85 --> 01:09:06,94
我要回家 找我妈妈去 她需要我

01:09:07,02 --> 01:09:09,75
你要听我的话一定得留下

01:09:09,79 --> 01:09:13,17
没有监护人? 米格大夫这绝对不行

01:09:13,20 --> 01:09:16,55
天啊  夫人  这是战争不是花圆舞会

01:09:16,58 --> 01:09:18,29
你必需留下 梅兰妮需要你

01:09:18,33 --> 01:09:22,59
她已经病啦 她不应该有孩子

01:09:22,62 --> 01:09:23,43
我们可以把她带走啊?

01:09:23,50 --> 01:09:24,99
你要让她冒这个危险吗?

01:09:25,07 --> 01:09:26,63
让她在坑坑洼洼的路上

01:09:26,70 --> 01:09:28,64
把孩子早产在马车里吗?

01:09:28,71 --> 01:09:30,57
又不是我的孩子 你照看她吧

01:09:30,64 --> 01:09:32,51
斯卡莉 沃特大夫不够

01:09:32,58 --> 01:09:35,84
又没有护士去照顾一个产妇

01:09:35,87 --> 01:09:37,56
你得留下来照顾她

01:09:37,65 --> 01:09:40,02
我一点也不懂接生的事

01:09:40,05 --> 01:09:41,28
我懂  我懂

01:09:41,35 --> 01:09:45,48
我知道怎么做 我帮人接过好多次啦

01:09:45,51 --> 01:09:47,26
让我来干吧 大夫我什么都会

01:09:47,29 --> 01:09:50,39
好 那我就指望你帮忙啦 好吧 大夫

01:09:50,46 --> 01:09:53,69
艾希礼在战场上打仗 为理想在战斗

01:09:53,76 --> 01:09:56,65
他可能回不来啦 可能战死啦

01:09:56,68 --> 01:09:59,53
我们应该为他留下一个孩子

01:10:00,04 --> 01:10:01,10
艾希礼

01:10:01,17 --> 01:10:05,17
斯卡莉 你要走就赶快来吧

01:10:05,20 --> 01:10:05,67
我答应过

01:10:05,74 --> 01:10:06,88
艾希礼

01:10:06,91 --> 01:10:08,44
你不走啦?

01:10:08,88 --> 01:10:12,01
好 你走吧 碧蒂小姐斯卡莉不走啦

01:10:12,08 --> 01:10:16,87
走吧 彼德大叔天啊  我不知道该怎么办啦

01:10:16,90 --> 01:10:19,50
就像世界末日就要到啦

01:10:19,53 --> 01:10:22,09
彼德大叔 我的嗅盐

01:10:28,87 --> 01:10:31,16
梅兰妮 梅兰妮 全都为了你

01:10:31,74 --> 01:10:33,99
我恨你  我恨你

01:10:34,02 --> 01:10:35,60
恨你的孩子

01:10:35,71 --> 01:10:38,04
如果我没答应过艾希礼就好啦

01:10:38,11 --> 01:10:40,34
如果我没答应他

01:10:42,01 --> 01:10:44,43
围城

01:10:44,44 --> 01:10:46,35
死亡从天而降

01:10:47,99 --> 01:10:51,10
被炮火轰击了三十五天的亚特兰大

01:10:51,25 --> 01:10:54,62
顽强地抵御着 盼望出现奇迹

01:10:55,82 --> 01:10:58,49
随后这里是一片沉寂

01:10:59,69 --> 01:11:03,61
这比隆隆的炮声更加令人恐惧

01:11:09,41 --> 01:11:11,81
停一下  请停一下

01:11:11,84 --> 01:11:13,48
北方佬真的要打进来啦吗?

01:11:13,51 --> 01:11:15,54
是的 太太 部队在撤退

01:11:15,58 --> 01:11:18,78
撤出亚特兰大? 把我们丢给北方佬?

01:11:18,81 --> 01:11:19,38
不是丢下 是撤退

01:11:19,42 --> 01:11:23,27
我们必须在雪尔曼切断通往南方的路以前撤出去

01:11:23,30 --> 01:11:25,55
这不是真的  不是真的我怎么办?

01:11:25,59 --> 01:11:29,75
最好赶快往南逃太太 我得走啦

01:11:30,49 --> 01:11:32,60
普里西

01:11:32,63 --> 01:11:34,26
普里西 快点 普里西

01:11:34,33 --> 01:11:37,79

01:11:37,87 --> 01:11:38,93
北方佬现在来啦

01:11:39,00 --> 01:11:41,05

01:11:41,81 --> 01:11:42,83
斯卡莉

01:11:42,90 --> 01:11:44,47
斯卡莉

01:11:44,88 --> 01:11:47,43
梅妮 我们得走

01:11:49,21 --> 01:11:50,31
梅妮

01:11:52,95 --> 01:11:56,28
真抱歉 成了你的累赘

01:11:58,82 --> 01:12:02,97
天刚亮我就开始痛起来啦

01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:03,83
可是 可是

01:12:03,86 --> 01:12:06,11
北方佬要来啦

01:12:07,13 --> 01:12:08,66
可怜的斯卡莉

01:12:09,17 --> 01:12:12,29
要不是为了我 现在你以经在泰拉庄园

01:12:13,10 --> 01:12:14,94
和你妈妈在一起啦

01:12:15,57 --> 01:12:17,40
喔  亲爱的

01:12:17,81 --> 01:12:19,71
你对我太好啦

01:12:19,81 --> 01:12:23,18
亲姐妹也没这么好

01:12:25,52 --> 01:12:27,85
我躺在这儿想

01:12:28,62 --> 01:12:30,31
要是我死啦

01:12:31,36 --> 01:12:33,38
你能收养我的孩子吗?

01:12:35,69 --> 01:12:37,72
别胡说啦 梅兰妮

01:12:37,80 --> 01:12:41,13
事情够糟的啦 别在说到死啦

01:12:41,17 --> 01:12:44,07
我去请米格大夫来 等一等 斯卡莉

01:12:44,14 --> 01:12:47,97
我不能让米格大夫坐等几个小时

01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:51,80
而那些可怜的伤兵 梅妮 普里西

01:12:52,84 --> 01:12:56,65
普里西  普里西  快一点儿

01:12:56,71 --> 01:12:59,75

01:13:04,66 --> 01:13:09,63
快点  快点  看我不把你卖到南方去的 我会的

01:13:10,39 --> 01:13:12,93
普里西还没回来?

01:13:15,20 --> 01:13:17,29
这屋子热得像个火炉啦

01:13:17,37 --> 01:13:19,30
还没到中午呢

01:13:22,14 --> 01:13:23,94
别怕 梅妮

01:13:24,48 --> 01:13:28,14
妈妈说 就好像大夫走不回来似的

01:13:29,35 --> 01:13:32,04
该把这个普里西抽一顿

01:13:39,39 --> 01:13:40,62
梅妮

01:13:41,29 --> 01:13:43,89
你知道我听说过梅贝尔的事吗?

01:13:43,96 --> 01:13:46,16
还记得她那个怪模怪样的男朋友吗?

01:13:46,23 --> 01:13:50,41
穿的红色制服像女们内衣的料子

01:13:50,44 --> 01:13:53,24
你别为啦我不停的说话啦

01:13:53,40 --> 01:13:55,37
我知道你现在有多烦

01:14:08,62 --> 01:14:12,28
梅妮 我去给你拿点凉水来

01:14:13,86 --> 01:14:16,34
你怎么去了这么半天?

01:14:16,37 --> 01:14:17,13
米格大夫在那?

01:14:17,16 --> 01:14:19,49
我跟本就没有看见 什么?

01:14:19,56 --> 01:14:21,96
他没有在医院里

01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:28,02
有 有一个人告诉我大夫在车棚和伤兵在一起

01:14:28,05 --> 01:14:29,59
为什么不到那里找他?

01:14:29,77 --> 01:14:30,97
斯卡莉小姐

01:14:31,04 --> 01:14:34,19
我不敢到那个车棚去

01:14:34,38 --> 01:14:38,31
那里有很多死人我最害怕见到死人啦

01:14:40,45 --> 01:14:42,15
你去照看梅妮小姐

01:14:42,22 --> 01:14:46,05
你让她着急不然我剥了你的皮

01:15:23,93 --> 01:15:26,52
看见米格大夫啦吗? 在那边

01:15:30,47 --> 01:15:31,80

梅妮要生孩啦 你得跟我一起回去

01:16:28,59 --> 01:16:31,46
你糊涂啦? 我不能因为一个孩子离开这些人

01:16:31,53 --> 01:16:34,97
他们要死啦  这么多人找个女人帮你

01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:38,41
可我上哪儿去找人啦? 米格大夫 她会死的

01:16:38,44 --> 01:16:38,66

01:16:38,74 --> 01:16:41,70
瞧瞧他们吧 眼看着他们将会失血而死

01:16:41,74 --> 01:16:46,24
没有麻醉药 没有绷带 连止痛药都没有

01:16:46,38 --> 01:16:48,74
走吧 别来打扰我啦

01:16:48,81 --> 01:16:52,11
别担心 孩子 接生并不是什么大事

01:16:52,18 --> 01:16:54,22
把那只担架抬过来

01:16:54,25 --> 01:16:55,36
米格大夫

01:16:55,39 --> 01:16:56,47
好 我来啦

01:17:15,57 --> 01:17:17,13
大夫来了吗?

01:17:17,78 --> 01:17:19,21

01:17:19,28 --> 01:17:22,07
喔  小姐梅妮小姐要生啦

01:17:22,21 --> 01:17:24,81
他不能来 没有有人能来

01:17:25,52 --> 01:17:29,04
普里西 没有大夫 你来接生 我来帮你

01:17:29,12 --> 01:17:32,47
哦  不行  斯卡莉小姐不行

01:17:32,50 --> 01:17:33,42

01:17:33,49 --> 01:17:35,75
不行  我们得找一个大夫

01:17:35,83 --> 01:17:38,66
我对生孩子的事一点也不懂

01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:41,83
你说什么? 我不会

01:17:41,90 --> 01:17:44,25
你说过接生的事你全会

01:17:44,28 --> 01:17:45,90
我也不知道为什么撒那个谎

01:17:45,94 --> 01:17:49,46
妈妈从来不让我看生孩子 啊

01:17:49,87 --> 01:17:50,97
斯卡莉

01:17:51,58 --> 01:17:52,70
斯卡莉

01:17:53,41 --> 01:17:55,28
斯卡莉小姐

01:17:55,88 --> 01:17:57,11
别说啦

01:17:58,62 --> 01:18:00,05
去把炉子点着

01:18:00,12 --> 01:18:03,63
烧一壶开水找一团线来

01:18:03,66 --> 01:18:06,42
把干净毛巾都拿来还有剪刀

01:18:06,45 --> 01:18:07,75

要喊就喊吧这没人听见

01:18:46,90 --> 01:18:51,23
妈妈说 床底下放一把刀能去掉一半的疼

01:18:56,64 --> 01:18:58,40
巴特勒船长

01:18:59,28 --> 01:19:00,57
巴特勒船长

01:19:02,35 --> 01:19:03,37
你要找谁啊?

01:19:03,45 --> 01:19:04,44
巴特勒船长

01:19:04,52 --> 01:19:07,18
他在楼上 贝尔・沃特琳在请客呢

01:19:09,42 --> 01:19:10,61
谢谢你

01:19:12,96 --> 01:19:15,39
巴特勒船长

01:19:15,63 --> 01:19:17,69
什么事? 这么吵啊?

01:19:17,86 --> 01:19:21,06
嗯 我来给巴特勒船长送个口信 沃特琳小姐

01:19:21,27 --> 01:19:24,72
巴特勒船长 请你到这边来一下

01:19:25,94 --> 01:19:27,07
什么事? 普里西

01:19:27,10 --> 01:19:30,23
斯卡莉小姐让我来找你

01:19:30,26 --> 01:19:33,36
梅妮小姐今天生孩子啦

01:19:33,39 --> 01:19:36,35
一个可爱的小男孩

01:19:36,38 --> 01:19:39,14
是斯卡莉小姐和我给她接的生

01:19:39,22 --> 01:19:40,92
你是来告诉我 斯卡莉

01:19:40,95 --> 01:19:44,55
主要是我 巴特勒船长

01:19:44,62 --> 01:19:50,46
斯卡莉小姐她只是帮了一点忙没有一个大夫能接得这么好

01:19:50,49 --> 01:19:55,17
只是 梅妮小姐觉得有点难受现在都好啦

01:19:55,20 --> 01:19:56,40
好 我相信你

01:19:56,47 --> 01:20:00,23
北方佬要来啦斯卡莉小姐说 她说 啊

01:20:01,34 --> 01:20:04,71
啊 巴特勒船长北方佬要来啦

01:20:04,74 --> 01:20:08,11
请你马上赶着马车到我们家

01:20:08,15 --> 01:20:11,23
对不起 军队把我的马车拉走了

01:20:11,26 --> 01:20:13,64
你上来看我能想点什么办法

01:20:13,67 --> 01:20:14,98
哦 不

01:20:15,25 --> 01:20:20,68
我要是进了沃特琳小姐的家门 我妈妈会用玉米杆打死我的

01:20:21,16 --> 01:20:24,79
你们谁能告诉我到哪儿能偷一匹马去?

01:20:31,70 --> 01:20:34,54
到啦瑞德 瑞德 是你吗?

01:20:34,81 --> 01:20:38,81
我们到啦 斯卡莉小姐瑞德 我就知道你会来的

01:20:38,84 --> 01:20:39,78
晚安 真是个美好的天气

01:20:39,81 --> 01:20:41,94
普里西说你要出去旅行

01:20:41,98 --> 01:20:44,07
你要再开玩笑 我就杀了你

01:20:44,15 --> 01:20:45,48
你不是说你害怕了吧?

01:20:45,55 --> 01:20:49,51
即使你是一头山羊的话你也会害怕的

01:20:49,59 --> 01:20:51,58
哦 北方佬 不  不

01:20:51,66 --> 01:20:54,39
还没有来这是我们的军队在销毁军火

01:20:54,46 --> 01:20:55,58
免得留给北方佬

01:20:55,66 --> 01:20:57,35
我们一定得离开这儿

01:20:57,43 --> 01:20:58,42
愿为您效劳

01:20:58,50 --> 01:21:00,72
可是你有去哪儿呢?

01:21:00,75 --> 01:21:01,23
回家 去泰拉庄园

01:21:01,27 --> 01:21:03,63
泰拉庄园? 泰拉庄园附近已经打了一整天啦

01:21:03,67 --> 01:21:06,00
你能带着一个产妇 一个婴儿

01:21:06,07 --> 01:21:08,83
和一个头脑简单的黑丫头穿过北方的军队吗?

01:21:08,86 --> 01:21:10,27
还是要把他们扔下?

01:21:10,34 --> 01:21:12,87
我们一起走我要回家 别拦着我

01:21:12,94 --> 01:21:16,67
你知道卫尔克斯太太在野外长途颠簸有多危险?

01:21:16,75 --> 01:21:18,18
我想我妈妈

01:21:19,05 --> 01:21:20,95
我要回泰拉庄园去

01:21:21,02 --> 01:21:22,85
泰拉庄园也可能都被烧光啦

01:21:22,89 --> 01:21:25,20
现在树林里到处都是散兵游勇

01:21:25,24 --> 01:21:27,52
他们会把你的马抢走的

01:21:27,59 --> 01:21:30,19
我是费了很大力气才把它们偷来的

01:21:30,26 --> 01:21:33,32
我就是一步一步的走也要走回家

01:21:33,40 --> 01:21:36,59
如果你要阻拦我 我就杀了你 我会的

01:21:37,10 --> 01:21:41,59
我会 会的

01:21:44,01 --> 01:21:47,53
好啦 亲爱的 好啦回家就是啦

01:21:49,41 --> 01:21:53,70
我想任何人能有你今天的本事也对付得了雪尔曼啦

01:21:54,48 --> 01:21:56,82
好啦 好啦 别哭啦

01:21:59,32 --> 01:22:01,62
擦擦鼻子 像个乖孩子

01:22:01,89 --> 01:22:03,05
啊

01:22:14,77 --> 01:22:15,86
普里西 你在干什么吗?

01:22:15,94 --> 01:22:17,37
正在收拾东西 斯卡莉小姐

01:22:17,44 --> 01:22:20,31
别收拾啦 把孩子抱来

01:22:22,75 --> 01:22:23,87
梅妮 梅妮

01:22:24,88 --> 01:22:27,71
卫尔克斯太太 我们送你去泰拉庄园

01:22:27,95 --> 01:22:29,05
泰拉庄园

01:22:29,09 --> 01:22:30,99
只能这样 梅妮不

01:22:31,02 --> 01:22:34,26
再等着雪尔曼来啦会把房子烧掉

01:22:34,29 --> 01:22:35,46
没什么 梅妮这没什么

01:22:35,53 --> 01:22:37,08
我的孩子

01:22:37,69 --> 01:22:39,22
我的贝迪

01:22:43,77 --> 01:22:46,20
你还有力气搂住我的脖子吗?

01:22:46,27 --> 01:22:48,03
我想能行

01:22:50,84 --> 01:22:52,10
别担心

01:22:52,18 --> 01:22:54,58
艾希礼 卡里斯

01:22:54,61 --> 01:22:56,24
怎么? 她要什么?

01:22:56,28 --> 01:22:59,11
艾希礼的照片 卡里斯的军带她要带走

01:22:59,18 --> 01:23:00,21
带上吧

01:23:16,17 --> 01:23:17,22
那是什么?

01:23:17,47 --> 01:23:20,59
大概是我们的勇士在放火烧仓库

01:23:20,62 --> 01:23:23,70
那里整车厢的军火足能把我们崩到泰拉庄园

01:23:23,74 --> 01:23:25,74
我们要穿过去就赶快走

01:23:25,78 --> 01:23:27,58
别走那条路只能这样

01:23:27,61 --> 01:23:30,77
这使唯一没有被切断的路

01:23:40,02 --> 01:23:42,46
等等  我忘了锁大门啦

01:23:42,59 --> 01:23:43,93
你在笑什么?

01:23:43,96 --> 01:23:46,11
笑你想锁住北方佬

01:24:03,15 --> 01:24:04,77
希望他们走快点

01:24:04,85 --> 01:24:07,58
我要是你就不会急着要他们走

01:24:07,65 --> 01:24:11,68
他们这一走这最后的法律和秩序就象征着消失啦

01:24:12,49 --> 01:24:14,65
那些暴徒可不会浪费时问

01:24:19,13 --> 01:24:21,31
我们得赶快走

01:24:21,34 --> 01:24:22,16
那儿有匹马

01:24:26,02 --> 01:24:27,92
把它留下 留下

01:24:33,64 --> 01:24:35,30
到那边去 把他们截住

01:24:49,29 --> 01:24:50,99
把马给我

01:25:01,17 --> 01:25:02,20
斯卡莉小姐 斯卡莉小姐

01:25:06,54 --> 01:25:09,17
军队不给北方佬而留下任何东西

01:25:09,25 --> 01:25:12,70
趁大火还没有烧到军火库以前 我们得冲过去

01:25:33,87 --> 01:25:35,89
快点

01:25:39,44 --> 01:25:41,10
把披肩给我

01:25:43,78 --> 01:25:47,34
对不起 你什么看不见会好一些的

01:26:46,71 --> 01:26:48,78
好好看看吧 亲爱的

01:26:49,15 --> 01:26:50,17
这是一个历史性的时刻

01:26:50,25 --> 01:26:51,71
你可以告诉你的子孙

01:26:51,78 --> 01:26:55,01
老南方是怎样在一夜之间覆灭的

01:27:11,37 --> 01:27:13,77
还说1个月消灭北方佬

01:27:13,84 --> 01:27:15,70
可怜的傻瓜

01:27:15,74 --> 01:27:17,10
都是由于他们的

01:27:17,17 --> 01:27:20,30
狂妄自负才把我们弄到这个地步

01:27:20,64 --> 01:27:23,98
我那时候就认为他们太狂妄自负啦

01:27:24,85 --> 01:27:27,21
瑞德 我正高兴你没去参军

01:27:27,28 --> 01:27:31,55
现在你可以得意啦因为你比他们聪明

01:27:33,96 --> 01:27:35,74
我并不得意

01:27:54,88 --> 01:27:55,94
为什么停车?

01:27:56,01 --> 01:27:58,74
这是去泰拉庄园的路 让马喘口气

01:27:59,12 --> 01:28:00,14
卫尔克斯太太

01:28:00,22 --> 01:28:03,52
梅妮小姐昏过去啦巴特勒船长

01:28:03,72 --> 01:28:05,28
啊  或许这样样会更好

01:28:05,36 --> 01:28:08,42
不然受不了这份罪的

01:28:08,93 --> 01:28:11,79
斯卡莉 你一定要干这愚蠢的事吗?

01:28:11,86 --> 01:28:14,69
奥 是 我知道我们能过去

01:28:14,73 --> 01:28:16,60
我们一定能不是我们 亲爱的

01:28:16,97 --> 01:28:18,43
我离开你们啦

01:28:18,74 --> 01:28:21,33
你说什么? 你要去哪儿?

01:28:21,57 --> 01:28:23,80
亲爱的 我要参军去

01:28:24,01 --> 01:28:27,34
你在开玩笑? 又在吓唬我

01:28:27,37 --> 01:28:28,48
我是认真的

01:28:28,51 --> 01:28:31,24
到我们灰色勇士的行列里去

01:28:31,31 --> 01:28:32,44
可他们在逃跑啊

01:28:32,52 --> 01:28:35,81
不 我想他们会做最后的抵抗的

01:28:35,89 --> 01:28:39,01
那个时候 我要跟他们在一起 虽然晚了一点

01:28:39,09 --> 01:28:40,82
但是晚总比 瑞德 你准是在开玩笑

01:28:41,86 --> 01:28:43,38
你太自私了吧?

01:28:43,46 --> 01:28:47,90
只想着自己 却从来不想着那些崇高的目标

01:28:47,93 --> 01:28:49,19
你怎么能这样对我

01:28:49,27 --> 01:28:52,20
而且为什么现在要走现在我正需要你

01:28:52,27 --> 01:28:53,26
为什么? 为什么?

01:28:53,34 --> 01:28:54,36
为什么?

01:28:54,44 --> 01:28:57,43
因为我一向留恋破灭的理想

01:28:57,51 --> 01:28:58,80
一旦真正破灭的话

01:28:58,88 --> 01:28:59,97
或许是

01:29:01,21 --> 01:29:03,24
我自己感到羞愧

01:29:04,48 --> 01:29:05,47
谁知道呢?

01:29:05,55 --> 01:29:08,95
你应该羞死 把我们仍在这儿 无依无靠

01:29:08,98 --> 01:29:10,19
你无依无靠?

01:29:11,25 --> 01:29:14,02
北方佬要是抓到你他们就得 求上帝保佑啦

01:29:14,56 --> 01:29:18,40
来 说再见吧

01:29:18,43 --> 01:29:18,95
不

01:29:19,56 --> 01:29:21,53
下来

01:29:24,30 --> 01:29:27,63
瑞德 请你别走你不能走

01:29:27,70 --> 01:29:29,43
我永远不会原谅你

01:29:29,51 --> 01:29:34,13
我不求你原谅我我永远也不理解或原谅我自己

01:29:34,16 --> 01:29:38,05
如果子弹打中我那倒好啦 我是个白痴

01:29:38,28 --> 01:29:39,91
我只知道

01:29:39,98 --> 01:29:41,65
我爱你 斯卡莉

01:29:41,68 --> 01:29:45,18
即使这倒霉的世界和我们俩都变成碎片

01:29:45,26 --> 01:29:46,35
我也爱你

01:29:46,42 --> 01:29:48,95
因为我们很相像 我们都够坏啦

01:29:49,33 --> 01:29:51,12
自私而且精明

01:29:51,46 --> 01:29:54,83
但我们能够一眼把事物看清楚

01:29:54,90 --> 01:29:56,80
别这么搂着我

01:29:56,90 --> 01:29:58,73
斯卡莉 看着我

01:29:59,90 --> 01:30:02,34
我爱你胜过爱任何女人

01:30:02,47 --> 01:30:05,70
我等待你的时间比等待任何女人都长

01:30:05,78 --> 01:30:06,97
放开我

01:30:08,14 --> 01:30:10,67
在你面前是一个爱你的南方战士

01:30:10,75 --> 01:30:12,37
期待着你的拥抱

01:30:12,45 --> 01:30:15,65
期待着把和你亲吻的记忆带到战场

01:30:15,68 --> 01:30:17,01
你是在为一个 准备带着美好记忆

01:30:17,09 --> 01:30:20,87
去赴死的战士送行

01:30:21,12 --> 01:30:22,92
斯卡莉 吻我

01:30:24,06 --> 01:30:25,43
就这一次

01:30:30,77 --> 01:30:33,50
你下流 胆小卑鄙的东西

01:30:33,54 --> 01:30:37,80
他们说对啦  人人都说对啦你不是个绅士

01:30:40,11 --> 01:30:42,27
现在这些都无所谓了

01:30:44,08 --> 01:30:45,78
给你

01:30:45,82 --> 01:30:48,11
如果有人要抢这匹马就打他

01:30:48,18 --> 01:30:50,15
可是别弄错了把马给打死

01:30:50,19 --> 01:30:54,32
走吧  走吧  我要你走我希望一颗炮弹把你打中

01:30:54,39 --> 01:30:56,22
把你炸成一百万片

01:30:56,26 --> 01:30:58,79
别再说啦我知道你是怎么想的

01:30:58,83 --> 01:31:01,32
我希望等我为国捐躯的时候

01:31:01,40 --> 01:31:03,73
你的良心能够感到不安

01:31:04,30 --> 01:31:05,73
再见啦 斯卡莉

01:31:31,76 --> 01:31:34,36
来 走吧  我们回家啦

01:32:50,11 --> 01:32:52,96
我可怜的孩子

01:32:54,01 --> 01:32:55,44
别担心 梅妮

01:32:55,68 --> 01:32:57,81
回到家里妈妈会照顾他的

01:32:57,88 --> 01:33:01,36
斯卡莉小姐 我饿极啦

01:33:01,39 --> 01:33:03,53
我们弄点吃的吧

01:33:03,56 --> 01:33:04,42
别说啦

01:33:04,45 --> 01:33:07,45
快到十二橡树啦我们在那儿休息

01:33:08,22 --> 01:33:10,21
快走

01:33:55,70 --> 01:33:59,82
卫约翰 1864年

01:34:14,35 --> 01:34:19,70
艾希礼 艾希礼辛亏你没看到这些

01:34:20,80 --> 01:34:22,49
北方佬

01:34:22,57 --> 01:34:24,50
可恶的北方佬

01:34:39,15 --> 01:34:41,64
普里西 普里西去把牛栓住

01:34:42,15 --> 01:34:44,55
我们不需要牛 斯卡莉小姐

01:34:44,59 --> 01:34:48,22

01:40:23,53 --> 01:40:25,26
问妈妈对

01:40:26,16 --> 01:40:28,72
欧郝纳太太知道该怎么办

01:40:29,83 --> 01:40:31,73
现在别打扰我

01:40:31,80 --> 01:40:33,56
出去骑会儿马

01:40:53,46 --> 01:40:55,01
爸爸

01:40:55,76 --> 01:40:57,85

01:41:19,72 --> 01:41:20,74
斯卡莉小姐

01:41:20,82 --> 01:41:24,75

01:41:28,72 --> 01:41:29,85
我不知道

01:41:29,93 --> 01:41:32,99
菜园子里除了罗卜什么都没有

01:41:33,06 --> 01:41:36,12
斯卡莉小姐休伦小姐和凯琳小姐

01:41:36,20 --> 01:41:38,91
她们要擦擦身子

01:41:39,27 --> 01:41:40,83

01:41:45,88 --> 01:41:50,18
我不能又照顾病人又管孩子

01:41:50,21 --> 01:41:51,74
我只有两只手啊

01:41:52,18 --> 01:41:56,85
谁去挤牛奶啊? 斯卡莉小姐我们都是干屋里活的

01:43:19,57 --> 01:43:21,54
上帝是我的见证

01:43:22,10 --> 01:43:25,40
上帝是我的见证他们别想打垮我

01:43:25,84 --> 01:43:30,83
我要渡过这一时刻等一切都过去我永远不再挨饿

01:43:31,08 --> 01:43:32,74
也不让家里人挨饿

01:43:34,32 --> 01:43:36,88
那怕是说谎 去偷 去骗 或杀人

01:43:38,19 --> 01:43:42,06
上帝是我的见证我绝不再挨饿啦

01:50:01,23 --> 01:50:03,94
狂飙袭卷佐治亚洲

01:50:07,30 --> 01:50:09,07
雪尔曼将军

01:50:22,18 --> 01:50:24,32
为了催垮南方邦联

01:50:24,35 --> 01:50:26,70
使之一败涂地 永远臣服

01:50:27,35 --> 01:50:30,83
这位伟大的入侵者 挥师前进

01:50:31,28 --> 01:50:32,16
在他身后

01:50:32,49 --> 01:50:35,58
留下了一条宽六十英里的北极

01:50:35,59 --> 01:50:38,62
从亚特南大直达海地

01:50:44,64 --> 01:50:47,03
泰拉庄园幸存下来了

01:50:47,07 --> 01:50:49,35
面对饥饿和苦难

01:50:55,51 --> 01:50:57,60
哦  我的腰都要折了

01:50:59,99 --> 01:51:01,72
哦  看我的手

01:51:02,43 --> 01:51:05,87
妈妈说过 看她的手就知道她是不是位小姐

01:51:06,07 --> 01:51:10,13
我看什么手啊小姐以后都无所谓啦

01:51:10,87 --> 01:51:15,14
你歇会吧 休伦你还没有完全好我可以干二个人的活

01:51:15,17 --> 01:51:18,50
斯卡莉德 她真可恶让我干这个 我不想

01:51:18,83 --> 01:51:20,56
这可没办法

01:51:20,90 --> 01:51:24,00
继续干活 我不能把泰拉庄园所有的活都干完

01:51:24,07 --> 01:51:26,80
我才不管泰拉庄园呢我恨泰拉庄园

01:51:30,01 --> 01:51:32,95
看你还敢再说恨泰拉庄园

01:51:33,65 --> 01:51:36,14
那就是恨爸爸和妈妈

01:51:42,86 --> 01:51:45,63
凯蒂・斯卡莉有件事我必须跟你说

01:51:45,70 --> 01:51:46,80
爸爸 什么事?

01:51:46,83 --> 01:51:51,72
我以经跟普里西和妈眯说了我不喜欢你这样对待她们

01:51:51,75 --> 01:51:54,51
对下人是要严格 但态度要温和

01:51:54,54 --> 01:51:55,77
特别是对黑人

01:51:55,84 --> 01:52:00,19
是的 爸爸 我知道可我没让她们做我自己不做的事

01:52:00,23 --> 01:52:04,55
不管怎么说 我不喜欢 我要跟欧郝纳太太说

01:52:18,77 --> 01:52:20,90
你下来干什么? 梅妮

01:52:20,93 --> 01:52:24,13
斯卡莉 我要跟你说

你们都太辛苦了我不能躺在那儿什么也不干

01:52:25,97 --> 01:52:28,50
快回到楼上去 你身体很虚弱

01:52:28,57 --> 01:52:29,84
请让我干吧 斯卡莉

01:52:29,91 --> 01:52:32,21
别逞强了 我的事已经够多了

01:52:32,28 --> 01:52:35,18
你要再病那就永远好不了

01:52:35,25 --> 01:52:37,77
我 我没想到这一点

01:53:33,47 --> 01:53:36,07
谁在那儿? 别动动就开枪了

01:53:42,38 --> 01:53:44,32
你一个人 小媳妇?

01:53:47,15 --> 01:53:49,52
你不太友好 是不是?

01:53:52,53 --> 01:53:55,32
除了这耳环还有别的吗?

01:53:55,40 --> 01:53:57,92
你们北方佬来过这儿了

01:53:58,10 --> 01:54:00,73
你是小泼妇是吧

01:54:01,77 --> 01:54:04,24
手里还藏着什么?

01:54:39,87 --> 01:54:41,84
你把他打死了

01:54:43,01 --> 01:54:44,87
我真高兴

01:54:46,05 --> 01:54:50,00
斯卡莉德 斯卡莉德 出什么事了 斯卡莉德?

01:54:53,85 --> 01:54:57,08
别害怕 孩子们你们的姐姐擦枪走火了

01:54:57,16 --> 01:54:59,72
差点没把她吓死

01:54:59,79 --> 01:55:03,32
哦 谢天谢地还嫌我们吓得不够吗?

01:55:03,35 --> 01:55:05,66
告诉凯蒂・斯卡莉要小心点儿

01:55:08,87 --> 01:55:11,03
你可真会撒谎

01:55:11,07 --> 01:55:14,21
我们得赶快把他弄出去埋掉 斯卡莉德

01:55:14,24 --> 01:55:16,17
如果让北方佬发现了他们就会

01:55:16,24 --> 01:55:19,30
我没看见别的人他大概是逃兵

01:55:19,38 --> 01:55:21,01
那也得把他藏起来

01:55:21,08 --> 01:55:24,85
他们听到风声就 会抓你的

01:55:27,75 --> 01:55:30,38
我可以把他埋在藤箩架小林的角落里

01:55:30,46 --> 01:55:32,92
可是 可我们怎么把弄搬出去呢?

01:55:33,56 --> 01:55:35,19
我们一人拉一条腿

01:55:35,26 --> 01:55:37,02
你连只猫都拉不动

01:55:41,49 --> 01:55:47,17

01:56:21,11 --> 01:56:22,94
翻翻别的口袋

01:56:24,98 --> 01:56:26,41

我们得赶快把他拖出去

01:56:42,26 --> 01:56:45,16
院子里留下血迹我们就瞒不住了

01:56:45,23 --> 01:56:48,24
把你的睡衣给我我要把他的头包上

01:56:48,27 --> 01:56:49,86

01:57:45,86 --> 01:57:47,72
战争结束了

01:57:47,79 --> 01:57:49,32
李将军投降了

01:57:49,40 --> 01:57:51,99
这不可能  那我们为什么要打呢?

01:57:52,06 --> 01:57:54,12
艾希礼要回来了

01:57:54,20 --> 01:57:56,43

明年价钱会升得很高

01:58:02,21 --> 01:58:04,11
衣衫滥缕的骑士们

01:58:04,14 --> 01:58:05,89
从失败的冒险中

01:58:06,00 --> 01:58:07,46
重返家园

01:58:08,24 --> 01:58:12,08
他们步履盘栅的回到曾是富足的沃土

01:58:12,47 --> 01:58:15,08
如今已是满目疮痍

01:58:16,46 --> 01:58:17,46
随之而来的是另一个入侵者  投机商

01:58:17,49 --> 01:58:19,72
当我们进军乔治亚州时

01:58:19,79 --> 01:58:20,48
万岁万岁

01:58:22,66 --> 01:58:24,19
万岁万岁

01:58:24,26 --> 01:58:26,13
使你获自由的旗帜

01:58:26,20 --> 01:58:29,17
从亚特兰大欢呼到海边

01:58:29,37 --> 01:58:32,10
当我们踏上乔治亚洲时

01:58:33,17 --> 01:58:35,27
滚开 别挡道  反派

01:58:35,34 --> 01:58:37,64
能让个快死的人搭一下车吗?

01:58:37,71 --> 01:58:40,37
我这儿没有南方贱民的地方

01:58:40,45 --> 01:58:41,85
o我滚开

01:58:41,91 --> 01:58:44,44
我看他宁愿走也不愿意搭这车

01:58:44,52 --> 01:58:47,15
驾  滚开  你们这些乞丐

01:58:47,29 --> 01:58:49,19
都是他们打胜了

01:58:49,86 --> 01:58:52,59
快把裤子仍给我肯尼迪先生

01:58:52,66 --> 01:58:53,72
快点

01:58:56,00 --> 01:58:59,52
用肥皂把自己好好搓搓别等我动手给你搓

01:58:59,60 --> 01:59:02,66
我要把这些裤子给煮煮

01:59:05,37 --> 01:59:07,81
整个南方军队都让

01:59:07,87 --> 01:59:09,93
虱子和地气折磨苦啦

01:59:10,84 --> 01:59:12,74
你这样对他 让他太难为情啦

01:59:12,81 --> 01:59:17,08
他身上的虱子跑到你身上你就更难为情啦

01:59:18,68 --> 01:59:20,05
过来 波尔

01:59:20,12 --> 01:59:24,39
别缠着这位先生 你看他又累又饿

01:59:24,79 --> 01:59:27,66
没关系 太太又能看见孩子太好啦

01:59:27,73 --> 01:59:29,16
多好的小家伙

01:59:29,20 --> 01:59:32,93
再打两年仗我们就能把他带到科布军团啦

01:59:33,80 --> 01:59:35,29
你是科布军团的?

01:59:35,37 --> 01:59:36,66
是的 太太

01:59:36,74 --> 01:59:39,97
那你一定认识我丈夫卫尔克斯上校啦

01:59:40,04 --> 01:59:41,54
喔  是的 太太

01:59:41,57 --> 01:59:45,46
他好象是 被俘了

01:59:46,21 --> 01:59:48,48
谢天谢地 他还没

01:59:48,55 --> 01:59:51,21
可怜的艾希礼他被送到了监狱里

01:59:51,28 --> 01:59:52,51
梅兰妮

01:59:52,62 --> 01:59:55,38
哦 斯卡莉德 我来了

01:59:55,45 --> 01:59:57,79
我来看着他吧 太太 我们是好朋友啦

01:59:57,86 --> 01:59:59,35
谢谢你

02:00:03,76 --> 02:00:07,22
我从早到晚象奴隶似的干我们才能免强吃饱肚子

02:00:07,30 --> 02:00:09,77
可你却把吃的都给那些饿死鬼

02:00:09,84 --> 02:00:11,80
他们很块都会来的

02:00:11,87 --> 02:00:13,81
请别责怪我了 求求你

02:00:13,87 --> 02:00:16,64
我刚听说艾希礼当了俘虏

02:00:16,71 --> 02:00:18,40
当了俘虏? 是的

02:00:18,48 --> 02:00:22,68
也许 他要是还活着现在正在北方的路上

02:00:23,05 --> 02:00:26,28
如果有那个北方妇人把她的晚饭分给他一口

02:00:26,35 --> 02:00:29,41
帮助我心爱的人回到我身边

02:00:31,36 --> 02:00:32,52
但愿如此 梅妮

02:00:32,59 --> 02:00:34,45
斯卡莉小姐

02:00:37,46 --> 02:00:40,90
斯卡莉小姐我有件事要跟你父亲谈

02:00:40,97 --> 02:00:42,06
可他好象是 也许我能帮你

02:00:42,13 --> 02:00:45,17
我现在是一家之主

02:00:45,20 --> 02:00:46,18
那好

02:00:46,22 --> 02:00:50,10
我 我是来向休伦小姐提亲的

02:00:50,71 --> 02:00:53,01
你是要告诉我 这么多年你还没有提这件事

02:00:53,08 --> 02:00:55,32
她一直在等你

02:00:55,35 --> 02:00:59,11
我实际上 我比她大得多

02:00:59,25 --> 02:01:01,45
而且我现在一文不铭

02:01:01,52 --> 02:01:03,15
如今谁有钱啦?

02:01:03,32 --> 02:01:06,26
斯卡莉小姐 请你放心 我是真诚的爱你妹妹

02:01:06,33 --> 02:01:08,95
我会使她非常幸福的

02:01:09,03 --> 02:01:12,66
如果我们订了婚我可以外出去经商

02:01:12,73 --> 02:01:14,29
等我们有了经济基础我们就

02:01:14,37 --> 02:01:16,86
好的 弗兰克可以跟爸爸答说

02:01:16,87 --> 02:01:18,47
你去问休伦吧

02:01:18,51 --> 02:01:21,68
谢谢 谢谢您斯卡莉德小姐

02:01:24,71 --> 02:01:26,74
对不起 对不起

02:01:29,48 --> 02:01:32,45
斯卡莉 肯尼迪先生好象有什么麻烦事了?

02:01:32,52 --> 02:01:34,48
比他想象的麻烦点

02:01:34,52 --> 02:01:36,42
他终于向休伦求婚了

02:01:36,49 --> 02:01:38,08
真让人高兴可惜他不能马上娶她

02:01:38,16 --> 02:01:42,75
不然我们可以少一张嘴吃饭

02:01:46,20 --> 02:01:47,72
又来一个

02:01:48,30 --> 02:01:49,63
但愿这个不是很饿

02:01:49,70 --> 02:01:50,79
他一定很饿

02:01:50,87 --> 02:01:53,70
让普里西再预备一盘

02:02:05,15 --> 02:02:06,34
艾希礼

02:02:08,49 --> 02:02:09,75
艾希礼

02:02:11,46 --> 02:02:13,00
亲爱的

02:02:22,84 --> 02:02:25,53
斯卡莉德小姐

02:02:25,60 --> 02:02:28,51
别打扰他们放开我 傻瓜 那是艾希礼

02:02:28,57 --> 02:02:30,67
是她的丈夫

02:02:42,89 --> 02:02:45,08
斯卡莉德小姐 我 回来得正好

02:02:45,16 --> 02:02:47,26
马掌钉上了吗? 是的 钉好了

02:02:47,30 --> 02:02:51,86
斯卡莉德小姐 您 马有鞋 人确没有真是新鲜事

02:02:51,93 --> 02:02:54,06
来 搅肥皂是的 小姐斯卡莉小姐

02:02:54,10 --> 02:02:57,50
我想知道你现在还有多少钱 是金币

02:02:57,74 --> 02:02:59,43
十元 怎么?

02:03:00,51 --> 02:03:01,73
那是不够的

02:03:01,81 --> 02:03:04,00
天知道你在说什么呢?

02:03:04,08 --> 02:03:08,52
斯卡莉小姐 我看见了杰纳尔德先生以前雇的监工

02:03:08,55 --> 02:03:11,08
就是那个白人垃圾威克尔森啦

02:03:11,15 --> 02:03:14,55
他现在已经成了真正的北方佬了

02:03:14,82 --> 02:03:20,20
他吹牛说他的北方朋友要把泰拉庄园的税提得比天都高

02:03:20,23 --> 02:03:21,76
我们得交多少?

02:03:21,83 --> 02:03:24,89
我听税务官说要三百元呢

02:03:24,96 --> 02:03:26,30
三百元

02:03:27,77 --> 02:03:30,00
就象是三百万

02:03:30,07 --> 02:03:31,87
我们也得想办法交啊

02:03:31,94 --> 02:03:33,13
是啊

02:03:33,21 --> 02:03:34,23
怎么交?

02:03:36,64 --> 02:03:37,97
我去问问希礼先生

02:03:38,04 --> 02:03:40,38
他可拿不出三百元来

02:03:40,45 --> 02:03:43,24
我可以去问问他

02:03:45,32 --> 02:03:46,91
问他也没什么啊

02:03:56,30 --> 02:03:57,49
艾希礼

02:03:58,76 --> 02:04:02,03
啊听说林肯当初也是劈木桩的

02:04:02,20 --> 02:04:04,67
一但我有了这个才能我也会飞黄腾达

02:04:05,31 --> 02:04:09,14
艾希礼 北方佬还要我们交三百元的税

02:04:10,38 --> 02:04:11,97
我们怎么办?

02:04:12,68 --> 02:04:15,01
我们该怎么办呢?

02:04:15,28 --> 02:04:18,77
文明遭到破坏以后人会变成什么样子呢?

02:04:18,85 --> 02:04:21,82
有头脑和勇气的人可以生存下去

02:04:21,89 --> 02:04:23,55
没有的就会被淘汰

02:04:23,62 --> 02:04:26,92
看在上帝的份上别站在这儿跟我胡说啦

02:04:26,99 --> 02:04:28,86
我们就是要被淘汰的人啦

02:04:28,93 --> 02:04:30,66
你是对的 斯卡莉

02:04:30,73 --> 02:04:33,76
在泰拉庄园面临危机的时候

02:04:33,83 --> 02:04:35,93
我还在这里跟你说这些蠢话

02:04:36,10 --> 02:04:39,47
你找我是需要我帮忙 可我帮不了你

02:04:39,54 --> 02:04:41,20
斯卡莉

02:04:41,27 --> 02:04:42,76
我是个懦夫

02:04:43,54 --> 02:04:45,41
你? 艾希礼? 懦夫?

02:04:46,18 --> 02:04:47,98
你害怕什么呢?

02:04:48,05 --> 02:04:51,54
生活对我变得太现实啦

02:04:52,72 --> 02:04:55,08
我想我倒是不在乎劈木头

02:04:55,52 --> 02:04:59,89
而是在乎失去了我所爱的生活中那种美好的东西

02:05:02,03 --> 02:05:06,52
如果没有战争我可以在十二颗橡树愉快地度过我的一生

02:05:07,13 --> 02:05:09,03
可是战争爆发了

02:05:09,27 --> 02:05:11,93
我看到儿时的朋友被炸死

02:05:12,00 --> 02:05:15,06
看到被我打中的人痛苦地倒下

02:05:15,77 --> 02:05:19,84
现在我发现这个世界对我来说 比死还糟糕

02:05:20,61 --> 02:05:23,41
这个世界里没有我的立足之地

02:05:25,08 --> 02:05:28,99
我无法让你理解其实你不知道什么是害怕

02:05:29,05 --> 02:05:31,49
你从来不害怕面对现实

02:05:32,29 --> 02:05:35,16
你从不像我这样逃避现实

02:05:37,80 --> 02:05:38,99
逃避?

02:05:40,33 --> 02:05:42,10
艾希礼 你错了

02:05:42,50 --> 02:05:44,44
我也是想逃避的

02:05:44,77 --> 02:05:48,91
我对这里太厌倦了我要为吃 为钱而奋斗

02:05:48,94 --> 02:05:53,34
为除草 锄地 摘棉花只到干不动了为止

02:05:53,41 --> 02:05:54,88
南方是完了

02:05:54,92 --> 02:06:00,71
北方佬 投机政客拙萘怂我们什么都没有啦

02:06:02,12 --> 02:06:03,42
艾希礼

02:06:04,26 --> 02:06:05,88
我们走吧

02:06:05,96 --> 02:06:07,15
去墨西哥

02:06:07,23 --> 02:06:10,42
墨西哥军队需要军官我们会幸福的

02:06:10,50 --> 02:06:14,61
我为你干活 为你做任何事你知道你不爱梅兰妮

02:06:14,64 --> 02:06:16,56
那天你在十二颗橡树你说过你爱我

02:06:16,64 --> 02:06:18,57
而且梅兰妮

02:06:18,64 --> 02:06:22,40
米格大夫告诉我她不能再生育了

02:06:22,44 --> 02:06:24,00
可我能给你 我们不能忘掉

02:06:24,04 --> 02:06:27,38
在十二颗橡树那天吗? 你以为我能忘吗? 你能忘吗?

02:06:27,41 --> 02:06:30,11
说真的 你不爱我吗?

02:06:31,12 --> 02:06:33,48
不 我 我不爱你 撒谎就算是撒谎

02:06:33,59 --> 02:06:38,03
你认为我能撇下梅兰妮和孩子伤梅兰妮的心吗?

02:06:38,06 --> 02:06:39,71
你也不能离开你的父亲和妹妹

02:06:39,79 --> 02:06:42,52
我能离开我都烦死啦 厌倦透啦

02:06:42,59 --> 02:06:46,50
是的 你是又烦 又厌倦所以你才这么说

02:06:47,17 --> 02:06:49,36
你为我们负担得太重了

02:06:49,43 --> 02:06:52,73
从现在起我要尽力的帮助你

02:06:52,80 --> 02:06:54,90
只有一个办法你能帮我

02:06:54,97 --> 02:06:56,44
带我走

02:06:56,61 --> 02:06:58,94
这没什么可留恋的

02:06:59,91 --> 02:07:01,17
没有?

02:07:02,88 --> 02:07:04,68
没有 除了尊严

02:07:17,30 --> 02:07:19,03
别这样

02:07:19,10 --> 02:07:21,33
别这样斯卡莉别哭了

02:07:21,53 --> 02:07:22,59
别哭了

02:07:22,67 --> 02:07:25,47
别哭了 我勇敢的斯卡莉

02:07:38,45 --> 02:07:40,71
你是爱我的 你是爱我的

02:07:40,79 --> 02:07:42,65
你说呀   不

02:07:42,69 --> 02:07:44,52
你爱我不 我们不能这样

02:07:44,59 --> 02:07:48,70
我们不能 这事不会再发生了你爱我

02:07:48,73 --> 02:07:50,76
我要带着梅兰妮和孩子走

02:07:50,80 --> 02:07:54,53
好 我说我爱你的勇敢和顽强我太爱了

02:07:54,57 --> 02:07:58,27
因此我刚才 我几乎忘记了我最贤淑的妻子

02:07:58,34 --> 02:08:01,24
斯卡莉 我不会忘记她们

02:08:07,54 --> 02:08:12,88
那 我就什么都没有了

02:08:13,89 --> 02:08:15,94
没为他奋斗

02:08:16,79 --> 02:08:18,72
为他生存了

02:08:21,43 --> 02:08:23,39
有一样东西

02:08:24,33 --> 02:08:26,85
有一样东西你爱他胜过于我

02:08:27,13 --> 02:08:29,23
虽然你还没有意识到

02:08:34,97 --> 02:08:36,10
泰拉庄园

02:08:39,88 --> 02:08:41,44
对 我

02:08:43,22 --> 02:08:44,88
我还有这个

02:08:49,89 --> 02:08:51,41
你们不用走

02:08:52,09 --> 02:08:56,42
我不会让你们去挨饿

02:08:56,46 --> 02:08:59,34
这事不会再发生了只是为了你 卫克斯

02:09:26,39 --> 02:09:28,88
啊是斯卡莉

02:09:28,96 --> 02:09:30,05
不要过来

02:09:30,70 --> 02:09:33,60
没忘你们的老监工吧?

02:09:34,43 --> 02:09:36,33
她现在是爱丽・威克尔森太太了

02:09:36,40 --> 02:09:39,37
别走上台阶  不要脸的  从这儿滚出去

02:09:39,44 --> 02:09:41,27
你不能这样对我太太说话

02:09:41,34 --> 02:09:43,90
太太? 她早该是的

02:09:43,98 --> 02:09:46,67
你害死我母亲之后你再生孩子 谁给他做洗礼?

02:09:46,75 --> 02:09:52,08
我们是来拜访的友好的拜访 还要跟老朋友谈点事

02:09:52,11 --> 02:09:54,35
朋友? 什么时候跟你做过朋友?

02:09:54,39 --> 02:09:58,11
还那么高傲? 是吗? 你们的事 我全知道

02:09:58,14 --> 02:09:59,38
我知道你父亲已经痴呆了

02:09:59,46 --> 02:10:00,95
你交不起税

02:10:01,03 --> 02:10:03,59
我来这儿是想买下这地方

02:10:03,66 --> 02:10:05,39
我能出个好价钱

02:10:05,46 --> 02:10:07,06
爱丽很想住在这儿

02:10:07,13 --> 02:10:08,90
滚开 你这个卑鄙的北方佬

02:10:08,97 --> 02:10:12,33
等你这爱尔兰人为了交税去卖他

02:10:12,40 --> 02:10:14,07
就知道谁是这里的主人啦

02:10:14,14 --> 02:10:17,07
我要买这块地方全部买下 住在这儿

02:10:17,14 --> 02:10:19,54
我等着拍卖呢

02:10:19,61 --> 02:10:22,10
你从泰拉庄园只会得到这个

02:10:23,32 --> 02:10:25,31
你会后悔的

02:10:33,83 --> 02:10:35,12
我们会回来的

02:10:35,19 --> 02:10:37,89
我要你看看谁是泰拉庄园的主人

02:10:43,24 --> 02:10:44,73
爸爸 回来

02:10:47,87 --> 02:10:49,03
爸爸 回来

02:10:49,11 --> 02:10:50,13
爸爸

02:10:51,81 --> 02:10:53,30
胆小的北方佬

02:11:01,25 --> 02:11:02,28
啊

02:11:22,77 --> 02:11:25,87
斯卡莉小姐这是杰纳尔德先生的表啊

02:11:26,14 --> 02:11:29,31
你拿着吧 给你了 爸爸愿意给你

02:11:29,38 --> 02:11:32,71
你现在可得留着这块表

02:11:32,78 --> 02:11:36,22
你需要卖掉所有值钱的东西 去交税

02:11:36,39 --> 02:11:38,79
你会卖爸爸表吗?

02:11:40,06 --> 02:11:41,58
别哭啦

02:11:42,29 --> 02:11:45,06
我不能看你流泪

02:11:48,73 --> 02:11:50,43
妈眯 妈眯

02:11:56,34 --> 02:12:00,74
你一直很勇敢 斯卡莉小姐你还要鼓起勇气来

02:12:00,95 --> 02:12:02,94
想想你爸爸以前的样子

02:12:03,01 --> 02:12:04,85
我不能想爸爸我什么也不能想

02:12:05,08 --> 02:12:07,25
只能想那三百块钱

02:12:07,29 --> 02:12:09,45
想这些有什么用

02:12:09,52 --> 02:12:11,28
谁也没有这么多的钱

02:12:12,29 --> 02:12:15,85
除了北方佬和暴发户谁也没有这么多的钱

02:12:18,03 --> 02:12:19,09
瑞德

02:12:19,16 --> 02:12:20,89
谁? 北方佬吗?

02:12:26,07 --> 02:12:28,97
妈眯 你看我又瘦又苍白

02:12:29,84 --> 02:12:31,71
我还没有衣服

02:12:41,32 --> 02:12:44,45
妈眯 快到搁楼上把妈妈装衣服样子的盒子拿下来

02:12:44,52 --> 02:12:46,32
你要这窗帘干什么?

02:12:46,39 --> 02:12:47,48
给我做件新衣服

02:12:47,56 --> 02:12:50,39
不能用爱伦小姐的窗帘只要就不

02:12:50,46 --> 02:12:53,06
别唆 现在是我的窗帘

02:12:53,13 --> 02:12:56,97
我要到亚特南大弄三百元去我要看起来象个女王

02:12:57,00 --> 02:12:58,96
谁跟你去亚特南大? 我自己去

02:12:59,04 --> 02:13:01,44
那是你这么想的 我跟你去

02:13:01,51 --> 02:13:03,06
我一定跟着你

02:13:03,14 --> 02:13:04,17
哦 好妈眯

02:13:04,24 --> 02:13:06,23
你别这么哄我 小姐

02:13:06,31 --> 02:13:09,01
我给你垫第一块尿布的时候就了解你

02:13:09,08 --> 02:13:11,67
我说跟着你 就一定去

02:13:12,32 --> 02:13:15,48
三个老K 嗯 我可糟了 上校

02:13:15,89 --> 02:13:18,72
可惜我们不能用扑克来决定战争的胜负

02:13:18,79 --> 02:13:21,82
立葛南特将军出的力少 可赢得多

02:13:21,89 --> 02:13:23,02
什么事 下士?

02:13:23,09 --> 02:13:26,83
长官 有一位女士要见巴特勒船长说是他妹妹?

02:13:26,90 --> 02:13:28,42
又一个妹妹

02:13:28,77 --> 02:13:31,13
这是监狱 不是后宫巴特勒船长

02:13:31,20 --> 02:13:33,03
少校 她不象那些人

02:13:33,10 --> 02:13:35,57
她有个保姆跟着

02:13:35,81 --> 02:13:36,97
是吗?

02:13:38,08 --> 02:13:41,34
我倒想见见她 少校可别带保姆

02:13:42,85 --> 02:13:46,15
嗯 我看看这一下午输了多少?

02:13:48,12 --> 02:13:49,71
三百四十块

02:13:49,79 --> 02:13:52,52
我可要债台高筑了是不是 少校

02:13:52,72 --> 02:13:53,95
好吧 下士

02:13:54,03 --> 02:13:56,89
把巴特勒船长的妹妹带到他的牢房

02:13:57,76 --> 02:14:00,49
谢谢你 少校对不起 先生们

02:14:05,07 --> 02:14:08,67
对输了钱还高兴的人不好太严历啦

02:14:10,74 --> 02:14:11,76
瑞德

02:14:11,80 --> 02:14:16,21
斯卡莉 我的小妹妹

02:14:17,18 --> 02:14:21,35
好了 下士我的妹妹没有带挫或锯进来

02:14:26,69 --> 02:14:27,89
现在我可以吻你了吗?

02:14:27,96 --> 02:14:30,09
像大哥哥那样吻一下前额吧

02:14:30,16 --> 02:14:32,86
不 谢谢 我要等将来好好的吻你

02:14:33,67 --> 02:14:36,69
喔 瑞德 听说你被关进监狱我真的难过死了

02:14:36,73 --> 02:14:38,72
我睡不着 一直在想

02:14:38,79 --> 02:14:40,79
他们会绞死你吗?

02:14:40,86 --> 02:14:42,02
你会难过?

02:14:42,13 --> 02:14:43,96
瑞德哦 别担心 斯卡莉

02:14:44,03 --> 02:14:46,00
北方佬给我捏造了一些罪名

02:14:46,07 --> 02:14:47,76
其实是为了我的钱

02:14:47,84 --> 02:14:50,17
好象我把联邦的金库拐走了似的

02:14:50,24 --> 02:14:51,73
喔 你是这样吗?

02:14:51,91 --> 02:14:53,47
别见面就谈这个了

02:14:53,54 --> 02:14:56,03
我们别谈肮脏的钱的事了

02:14:56,11 --> 02:14:59,34
你来看我真是太好了呵 你真是太漂亮了

02:14:59,41 --> 02:15:02,38
瑞德 别拿我这样的乡下姑娘取笑了

02:15:02,45 --> 02:15:05,72
感谢上帝 你没有穿得破破乱乱我真是看够了

02:15:05,79 --> 02:15:07,19
来 转过身去

02:15:07,82 --> 02:15:10,35
真是太漂亮了你吃得不错 生活的很好

02:15:10,43 --> 02:15:12,29
谢谢 我一直很好

02:15:12,33 --> 02:15:14,16
泰拉庄园的每个人都很好只是我太闷了

02:15:14,20 --> 02:15:17,80
想到城里来看看

02:15:17,83 --> 02:15:20,56
你是一个没有心肝的人这也是你的魅力

02:15:20,64 --> 02:15:22,94
他已经超过法律的允许了

02:15:22,97 --> 02:15:25,53
我到这儿来不是谈论我的

02:15:25,61 --> 02:15:28,70
因为我听说你遇到麻烦了非常的难过

02:15:28,78 --> 02:15:31,64
那天晚上你把我仍在路上我气坏啦

02:15:31,71 --> 02:15:33,24
我还没原谅你呢

02:15:33,32 --> 02:15:34,91
喔 别那件事啦

02:15:34,98 --> 02:15:39,02
可要是没有你我可能已经死啦当我想到自己

02:15:39,05 --> 02:15:45,46
我想到自己有了我所希望的一切过着无忧无虑的生活

02:15:45,49 --> 02:15:47,57
而你却在这可怕的牢房里

02:15:47,60 --> 02:15:50,20
简直不是人呆的地方是关马的

02:15:51,63 --> 02:15:54,19
我想说点笑话

02:15:54,27 --> 02:15:56,33
可我真要哭了

02:15:56,47 --> 02:15:58,44
我现在就要哭了

02:16:01,54 --> 02:16:04,38
斯卡莉德 这可能吗?

02:16:05,08 --> 02:16:07,05
你说可能什么? 瑞德

02:16:07,12 --> 02:16:10,61
你以经有了一颗女人的心啦真正女人的心

02:16:10,85 --> 02:16:13,91
我有 瑞德我知道我有

02:16:15,79 --> 02:16:19,59
你知道 听说你这话坐牢也值得

02:16:20,90 --> 02:16:22,63
真是太值得了

02:16:27,14 --> 02:16:29,60
你简直能把月亮给说下来

02:16:29,67 --> 02:16:32,07
泰拉庄园那个地方一切都好 是吗?

02:16:32,14 --> 02:16:33,66
哦 是的你用这双手干什么了?

02:16:33,74 --> 02:16:35,64
不过是上次骑马的时候没戴手套

02:16:35,71 --> 02:16:39,11
这不是小姐的手象是庄稼人干活的手

02:16:39,18 --> 02:16:41,01
你为什么要撒谎? 你为什么要来

02:16:41,08 --> 02:16:43,78
哦 瑞德 我差点相信你真的关心我了

02:16:43,85 --> 02:16:44,94
可我是关心

02:16:45,02 --> 02:16:46,42
还是说实话吧

02:16:46,49 --> 02:16:48,25
你急于找我要什么东西

02:16:48,32 --> 02:16:50,72
所以穿上天鹅绒的衣服来表演

02:16:50,79 --> 02:16:52,19
是什么? 钱?

02:16:53,33 --> 02:16:55,92
我需要三百块钱交泰拉庄园的税

02:16:56,20 --> 02:16:58,93
喔 瑞德 我对说一切都好那是说谎

02:16:59,00 --> 02:17:03,29
情况是糟得不能再糟了而你有的是钱

02:17:03,97 --> 02:17:05,84
你拿什么作抵压?

02:17:05,94 --> 02:17:07,53
我的耳环不感兴趣

02:17:07,61 --> 02:17:09,84
用泰拉庄园我要农场做什么?

02:17:09,88 --> 02:17:12,68
你不会损失的我明年用棉花还给你

02:17:12,75 --> 02:17:15,51
不够好还有更好的吗?

02:17:17,35 --> 02:17:19,48
你说过你爱我

02:17:19,86 --> 02:17:22,05
如果你还爱我

02:17:22,12 --> 02:17:25,32
你是不是忘了我是个不结婚的人

02:17:25,39 --> 02:17:27,69
没有 我没有忘记

02:17:31,34 --> 02:17:35,26
听我说 斯卡莉 你不值三百块钱

02:17:35,78 --> 02:17:38,65
你对男人来说只意味着倒霉

02:17:38,72 --> 02:17:39,78
说啊侮辱我吧

02:17:39,85 --> 02:17:42,02
我不在乎 只要给我钱

02:17:42,09 --> 02:17:45,86
我不能失去泰拉庄园只要还有一口气 就不能失去它

02:17:46,09 --> 02:17:47,15
瑞德

02:17:47,46 --> 02:17:49,59
请你把钱借该我吧

02:17:49,76 --> 02:17:52,13
我想借你 也没办法给你

02:17:52,20 --> 02:17:54,29
我的钱在利物浦不在亚特南大

02:17:54,37 --> 02:17:58,20
如果我签一张支票北方佬会象鸭子见到小虫似的

02:17:58,37 --> 02:18:01,34
所以 亲爱的你白低声下气了

02:18:04,58 --> 02:18:06,33
好啦 好啦 别这样啦

02:18:06,37 --> 02:18:09,28
你想让北方佬见你这个样子吗?

02:18:09,35 --> 02:18:11,18
把手拿开 你这个流氓

02:18:11,29 --> 02:18:13,55
我还没说你就知道我要说什么

02:18:13,62 --> 02:18:17,13
你明知道不会借钱给我可还让我说下去

02:18:17,16 --> 02:18:18,76
我就是想要听听你说什么

02:18:18,83 --> 02:18:21,99
别灰心来看着我上绞架

02:18:22,03 --> 02:18:24,66
我的遗嘱里会有你一份我会来看的

02:18:24,70 --> 02:18:28,33
唯一担心的就是泰拉庄园要交税的时候还没绞死你

02:18:34,13 --> 02:18:36,60
告诉他是贝尔・沃特琳

02:18:36,68 --> 02:18:39,51
最近你去那儿了? 是不是把船长给忘了?

02:18:39,58 --> 02:18:42,28
我很忙 扶我下来

02:18:51,33 --> 02:18:55,43
她是谁? 我从来没有见过这种颜色的头发

02:18:55,46 --> 02:18:57,09
你认识这个人吗?

02:18:57,17 --> 02:19:00,26
我倒希望认识她她能借给我钱

02:19:02,04 --> 02:19:04,44
不管他们在监狱里对你怎么样

02:19:04,51 --> 02:19:07,55
你到监狱里去看那个臭白人

02:19:07,58 --> 02:19:08,70
真是活该

02:19:15,25 --> 02:19:16,44
又新鲜有绿

02:19:17,75 --> 02:19:19,81
今天晚上你干什么朱蒂?

02:19:19,89 --> 02:19:21,55
一个左治亚的美人儿

02:19:21,62 --> 02:19:22,98
在俄亥俄可没有这样的

02:19:23,02 --> 02:19:26,32
你们知道我们要干什么吗? 什么?

02:19:26,39 --> 02:19:29,42
我们要给你们每个人四十一亩地和一头驴子

02:19:29,50 --> 02:19:31,93
还有一头驴子? 四十一亩地和一头驴子

02:19:32,03 --> 02:19:33,16
对

02:19:33,23 --> 02:19:35,00
因为我们是

02:19:35,07 --> 02:19:36,97
你们的朋友

02:19:37,04 --> 02:19:39,30
你们都要选举权了

02:19:41,40 --> 02:19:42,73
你忙什么呢 妹妹?

02:19:42,77 --> 02:19:44,23
这个城市变样了

02:19:44,27 --> 02:19:47,92
北方佬琢炝怂他们拙萘宋颐堑囊磺

02:19:49,99 --> 02:19:51,49
别挡着道 别挡着道

02:19:52,20 --> 02:19:53,24
讨厌 让开 让开

02:19:53,28 --> 02:19:54,49
别挡着道 别挡着

02:20:03,08 --> 02:20:04,75
这不是斯卡莉小姐吗?

02:20:04,79 --> 02:20:06,75
弗南克・肯尼迪还有妈眯

02:20:06,80 --> 02:20:08,76
在这儿见到家乡人真是太好啦

02:20:08,80 --> 02:20:10,34
我不知道你们在亚特南大

02:20:10,38 --> 02:20:11,84
我也不知道你在这儿?

02:20:11,88 --> 02:20:14,10
休伦跟你说过我的店吗?

02:20:14,47 --> 02:20:16,68
她说过吗? 我不记得了 你有个店?

02:20:17,60 --> 02:20:18,44
这个?

02:20:18,47 --> 02:20:20,77
请进来 随便看看

02:20:29,28 --> 02:20:31,95
这不象太太们去的那种店

02:20:31,99 --> 02:20:33,78
可我为它感到骄傲

02:20:34,57 --> 02:20:35,87
你没赚什么钱?

02:20:35,91 --> 02:20:39,08
啊 还算可以我是很有信心的

02:20:39,58 --> 02:20:41,71
人们都说我是个天生的商人

02:20:42,21 --> 02:20:45,08
用不了多久 就可以和休伦小姐结婚啦

02:20:45,38 --> 02:20:47,04
你干得那么好?

02:20:47,09 --> 02:20:48,84
是的 干得不错

02:20:48,88 --> 02:20:50,84
我还不是百万富翁

02:20:50,88 --> 02:20:53,18
但我已经赚了一千多元了

02:20:53,47 --> 02:20:54,64
你经营木材?

02:20:54,68 --> 02:20:55,80
是啊

02:20:56,47 --> 02:20:57,85
这只是附带经营的

02:20:57,89 --> 02:20:59,43
附带经营?

02:20:59,47 --> 02:21:03,46
亚特南大周围有很多的松木很多房屋正在修建

02:21:03,48 --> 02:21:05,98
这都需要钱斯卡莉小姐

02:21:06,98 --> 02:21:09,15
我该准备买房子啦

02:21:09,19 --> 02:21:10,73
你买房子干什么?

02:21:10,78 --> 02:21:12,90
和休伦小姐建立一个家庭

02:21:12,96 --> 02:21:17,03
在亚特南大? 你要把她接到亚特南大 是吗?

02:21:17,70 --> 02:21:19,70
这样对泰拉庄园没什么好处

02:21:20,27 --> 02:21:23,58
嗯 我不明白你的意思? 斯卡莉小姐

02:21:24,08 --> 02:21:25,33
我没什么意思

02:21:25,37 --> 02:21:28,59
弗南克 你愿意送我去碧蒂姑妈家吗?

02:21:29,50 --> 02:21:31,84
我非常愿意 斯卡莉小姐

02:21:31,88 --> 02:21:33,63
你最好留下来吃晚饭

02:21:33,67 --> 02:21:37,14
碧蒂姑妈肯定会同意的我愿意跟你多呆一会

02:21:37,18 --> 02:21:40,12
这太让我兴奋了斯卡莉小姐

02:21:40,97 --> 02:21:42,98
你能告诉我所有的消息吗?

02:21:43,27 --> 02:21:45,10
关于休伦小姐的一切

02:21:47,98 --> 02:21:49,48
怎么了 斯卡莉小姐?

02:21:49,77 --> 02:21:51,44
休伦小姐没生病吧?

02:21:51,48 --> 02:21:52,57
喔 不 不

02:21:53,07 --> 02:21:55,15
我想她一定给你写信了

02:21:55,20 --> 02:21:56,86
她大概没脸给你写信

02:21:56,91 --> 02:21:58,53
她该感到羞愧

02:21:58,57 --> 02:22:01,24
哦 我怎么会这么一个妹妹

02:22:01,29 --> 02:22:05,38
快告诉我 斯卡莉小姐别让我心神不安啦 快点

02:22:05,50 --> 02:22:08,50
喔 下个月她要和一个农村小伙子结婚了

02:22:10,00 --> 02:22:13,63
她等得不耐烦了她怕成为老处女

02:22:13,67 --> 02:22:15,88
我很难过 这事由我来告诉你

02:22:17,18 --> 02:22:19,80
真冷啊  我把手笼忘在家啦

02:22:20,10 --> 02:22:22,97
你不介意我把手放在你的口袋里吧?

02:22:29,77 --> 02:22:31,79
斯卡莉・肯尼迪

02:22:31,90 --> 02:22:39,06
三百元 亚特南大国家银行

02:22:39,24 --> 02:22:41,74
喔 梅兰妮 你不知道她干了什么事

02:22:42,45 --> 02:22:47,01
她跟我的肯尼迪先生结婚啦

02:22:47,04 --> 02:22:49,29
她是为了保住泰拉庄园 你应该理解她 休伦

02:22:49,33 --> 02:22:50,71
我要宰了她

02:22:50,75 --> 02:22:53,96
我恨泰拉庄园 我恨斯卡莉比对泰拉庄园还恨

02:22:58,64 --> 02:22:59,85
都是我的错

02:23:01,14 --> 02:23:04,52
为跟你弄钱交税我应该去拦路抢劫

02:23:04,56 --> 02:23:07,10
我不能让你干这种事

02:23:07,14 --> 02:23:08,73
反正木以成舟了

02:23:08,77 --> 02:23:10,15
是啊是这样

02:23:11,27 --> 02:23:12,90
你不让我干不体面的事情

02:23:12,94 --> 02:23:15,65
可你出卖了自己 嫁给你不爱的人

02:23:16,74 --> 02:23:20,03
你不用再为我这无能的人操心了

02:23:21,37 --> 02:23:22,45
你什么意思?

02:23:22,87 --> 02:23:24,24
我要去纽约

02:23:24,94 --> 02:23:28,00
我已经在银行里找到了一个职位

02:23:28,04 --> 02:23:29,33
可你不能去

02:23:31,46 --> 02:23:34,63
我 我还指望你帮我做木材生意呢 艾希礼

02:23:34,67 --> 02:23:36,80
我 我就指望你了

02:23:36,84 --> 02:23:38,30
我恐怕帮不上你

02:23:38,34 --> 02:23:40,01
斯卡莉 我木材生意是一窍不通的

02:23:40,05 --> 02:23:41,55
这跟你在银行也是一样的

02:23:42,64 --> 02:23:44,77
而且我要把生意都给你一半

02:23:45,64 --> 02:23:47,43
这是你的慷慨 斯卡莉

02:23:48,64 --> 02:23:49,94
可是不能这样

02:23:50,35 --> 02:23:52,56
如果我到亚特南大还要靠你的帮助

02:23:53,57 --> 02:23:56,11
我就永远没有独立生活的希望啦

02:23:56,15 --> 02:23:57,24
好啊就为这个

02:23:57,74 --> 02:24:02,10
你可以逐步买下这个店然后它就是你的了

02:24:03,16 --> 02:24:04,45
不 斯卡莉德

02:24:06,88 --> 02:24:09,74
欧 艾希礼

02:24:17,05 --> 02:24:18,05
艾希礼

02:24:25,76 --> 02:24:26,85
斯卡莉

02:24:28,64 --> 02:24:30,02
斯卡莉 怎么了?

02:24:30,06 --> 02:24:31,65
艾希礼这么冷酷 这么可恨

02:24:32,77 --> 02:24:33,86
你干什么啦?

02:24:35,01 --> 02:24:38,19
她要 我们去亚特南大

02:24:38,24 --> 02:24:42,53
我的木材生意要开业了他连一根手指头都不肯帮我

02:24:42,57 --> 02:24:44,24
你太没有骑士风度了

02:24:44,53 --> 02:24:46,24
想想吧 艾希礼

02:24:46,74 --> 02:24:49,54
如果不是斯卡莉我就死在亚特南大了

02:24:49,57 --> 02:24:52,79
而且 而且可能连小波尔都没有啦

02:24:52,83 --> 02:24:56,30
每当我想到她耕地 摘棉花

02:24:56,33 --> 02:24:58,31
都为了养活我们 而我只能

02:24:58,34 --> 02:24:59,34
喔 亲爱的

02:25:04,26 --> 02:25:05,55
好啦 梅兰妮

02:25:06,14 --> 02:25:07,35
我去亚特南大

02:25:09,27 --> 02:25:10,56
我斗不过你们俩个

02:25:26,62 --> 02:25:27,76
快点走

02:25:30,45 --> 02:25:33,04
啊这都是新来的工人肯尼迪太太

02:25:33,54 --> 02:25:35,75
是从左治亚洲监狱里挑来的最好的

02:25:36,84 --> 02:25:39,13
他们看起来又瘦又弱的样子

02:25:39,17 --> 02:25:39,76
立定

02:25:41,94 --> 02:25:44,31
这是能雇来的最好的犯人啦

02:25:44,34 --> 02:25:47,22
如让你放手让我管

02:25:47,26 --> 02:25:49,35
你要什么 就能干什么

02:25:49,38 --> 02:25:51,06
好吧 你是工头

02:25:51,64 --> 02:25:55,23
要保证木材厂运转即时供应木材

02:25:55,27 --> 02:25:56,81
亚利格听您吩咐 太太

02:25:56,86 --> 02:25:57,94
要记住

02:25:58,27 --> 02:26:00,73
不要过问和干予我的事

02:26:01,23 --> 02:26:03,61
就这么定了 明天一早开工

02:26:03,64 --> 02:26:05,94
好了你们走吧 走啊到那边去

02:26:05,98 --> 02:26:08,24
斯卡莉 这不对 你是知道的

02:26:08,74 --> 02:26:11,12
女人做生意已经很不象样了

02:26:11,16 --> 02:26:12,33
而你 你抱怨什么?

02:26:12,37 --> 02:26:14,83
如果我不管你永远不会有木材厂的

02:26:14,87 --> 02:26:16,63
可我并不想要这个木材厂啊

02:26:16,67 --> 02:26:20,92
如果你不是逼我的朋友还欠我的债我是不会买它的

02:26:20,96 --> 02:26:21,93
你说对吗 艾希礼?

02:26:21,96 --> 02:26:24,22
你在经营慈善机构吗?

02:26:24,26 --> 02:26:26,80
回店里去吧 弗南克然回家吃药

02:26:26,84 --> 02:26:27,93
你的气色不大好

02:26:27,97 --> 02:26:30,22
可是宝贝 你和我一起回家好

02:26:30,26 --> 02:26:33,60
别唆了 别再打扰我也别叫我宝贝

02:26:33,64 --> 02:26:35,56
好吧   好吧

02:26:36,06 --> 02:26:37,56
晚安 艾希礼

02:26:39,56 --> 02:26:42,15
哦 天啦 我从没见过脾气这么大的女人

02:26:43,94 --> 02:26:46,11
斯卡莉 我不想干予

02:26:46,15 --> 02:26:49,62
不过我希望能让我雇用自由黑人来代替那些犯人

02:26:49,66 --> 02:26:50,99
这样将会更好

02:26:51,03 --> 02:26:54,12
黑人的工钱会让我们破产犯人便宜

02:26:54,16 --> 02:26:55,91
我们尽管放手让嘎厉特去做

02:26:55,96 --> 02:26:59,42
放手? 这是什么意识你知道吗?

02:26:59,46 --> 02:27:01,42
他会饿着他们 鞭打他们

02:27:01,46 --> 02:27:03,21
你没看见吗? 有的人病了 吃不饱饭 艾希礼

02:27:03,26 --> 02:27:06,09
你会怎么管理 如果让你管 你会一天三顿给他们吃鸡

02:27:06,13 --> 02:27:08,22
让他们w羽绒被

02:27:08,26 --> 02:27:12,26
我不愿意从那些强迫劳动的可怜的人身上赚钱

02:27:12,35 --> 02:27:14,10
你不是也有过奴隶吗?

02:27:14,14 --> 02:27:16,89
那不一样不是这样对待他们

02:27:16,94 --> 02:27:19,23
即使没有战争

02:27:19,27 --> 02:27:21,27
我也会在父亲去世后让他们自由的

02:27:21,57 --> 02:27:22,86
很遗憾 艾希礼

02:27:23,23 --> 02:27:25,69
你忘了没有钱是什么样了?

02:27:25,74 --> 02:27:28,61
我发现钱是世界上最重要的东西

02:27:28,66 --> 02:27:31,12
我再也不愿意受穷了

02:27:31,16 --> 02:27:34,12
我要赚多多的钱 这样北佬就不能从我手里把泰拉庄园夺走啦

02:27:34,16 --> 02:27:35,62
这是唯一的途径

02:27:35,66 --> 02:27:38,21
并不是我们几个南方人在受苦

02:27:38,25 --> 02:27:42,00
看看我们的朋友他们还保持着尊严和善良

02:27:42,04 --> 02:27:45,80
对 可他们在挨饿 连自己都养活不了有什么用

02:27:45,84 --> 02:27:48,30
我知道他们在说我可我不在乎

02:27:48,34 --> 02:27:50,10
我就是要跟北方人打交道

02:27:50,14 --> 02:27:53,35
按他们的方式战胜他们

02:27:55,77 --> 02:27:58,14
好了 再往那边挪一点

02:27:59,14 --> 02:28:00,73
下午好 肯尼迪太太

02:28:00,77 --> 02:28:01,81
下午好

02:28:01,86 --> 02:28:03,52
生意很幸隆是不是

02:28:03,57 --> 02:28:04,57
挺不错的

02:28:06,15 --> 02:28:09,20
斯卡莉 你跟把些抢劫和折磨过我们

02:28:09,24 --> 02:28:11,82
而且还让我们饥饿的北方佬做生意

02:28:11,87 --> 02:28:13,12
这都过去了

02:28:13,16 --> 02:28:16,66
我要赚钱 那怕跟北方佬共事

02:28:18,66 --> 02:28:22,71
梅姿格灵之太太 你知道吗?

02:28:22,74 --> 02:28:25,13
米格大夫看见她亲自把木材卖给了北方佬

02:28:25,17 --> 02:28:26,21
还不只这些呢

02:28:26,25 --> 02:28:29,22
她对我哥哥艾希礼所干的事真让人吃惊

02:28:29,26 --> 02:28:31,76
她甚至还自己找马车呢

02:28:39,56 --> 02:28:41,31
亲爱的肯尼迪太太

02:28:41,35 --> 02:28:43,06
最亲爱的肯尼迪太太

02:28:43,65 --> 02:28:45,69
你具然还有脸来见我

02:28:45,73 --> 02:28:47,40
我想你只要再多等一下

02:28:47,44 --> 02:28:49,11
就能得到我的钱了

02:28:49,15 --> 02:28:50,86
女人真是善变

02:28:51,24 --> 02:28:53,70
你要干什么? 我还有要紧事呢

02:28:53,74 --> 02:28:58,00
你能不能满足一下我的好奇心我一直感到非常困惑

02:28:58,04 --> 02:28:59,25
是什么? 说

02:28:59,75 --> 02:29:03,17
告诉我 你难道不在乎和一个你不爱的人结婚?

02:29:04,04 --> 02:29:06,96
你怎么从监狱里出来的? 为什么没绞死你?

02:29:07,96 --> 02:29:09,42
没有用钱买不到的东西

02:29:09,46 --> 02:29:11,22
我看连那位高贵的

02:29:11,26 --> 02:29:14,05
卫尔克斯先生也让你买下来了

02:29:14,97 --> 02:29:16,64
这么说 你还恨艾希礼?

02:29:17,26 --> 02:29:19,10
我想你是嫉妒他吧

02:29:19,14 --> 02:29:22,02
你还以为你是这里的美人是吗?

02:29:22,06 --> 02:29:24,10
还以为是一位娇滴滴的小姐

02:29:24,15 --> 02:29:26,32
每个男人见到你都会爱得要死

02:29:26,36 --> 02:29:27,29
让我过去

02:29:27,33 --> 02:29:30,86
别生气 斯卡莉你要去哪儿?

02:29:31,36 --> 02:29:33,20
我去木材厂与你有什么关系

02:29:33,24 --> 02:29:34,70
一个人经过棚户区

02:29:34,74 --> 02:29:38,20
你不知道一个人赶车遇上那些流氓会有多危险

02:29:38,24 --> 02:29:39,83
别为我操心

02:29:39,87 --> 02:29:42,54
需要开枪的时候我会开枪的

02:29:50,26 --> 02:29:51,26
这种女人

02:30:26,67 --> 02:30:28,29
给我二十五分

02:30:28,34 --> 02:30:29,67
放开我的马

02:30:30,83 --> 02:30:33,22
拉住这马  拉住它

02:30:40,84 --> 02:30:42,25
注意 她有枪

02:30:44,14 --> 02:30:45,27
救命

02:30:45,77 --> 02:30:47,15
救命啊

02:30:48,77 --> 02:30:49,86
救命啊

02:31:24,06 --> 02:31:25,35
斯卡莉德小姐

02:31:42,53 --> 02:31:47,02
斯卡莉德小姐 斯卡莉德小姐等等我

02:31:47,46 --> 02:31:48,92
我是大山姆

02:31:48,96 --> 02:31:49,96
大山姆

02:32:19,24 --> 02:32:22,62
斯卡莉 换件衣服晚上到美利德家去

02:32:22,66 --> 02:32:24,49
我去参加一个政治集会

02:32:24,53 --> 02:32:25,83
政治集会

02:32:25,87 --> 02:32:27,41
我今天下午出了事

02:32:27,45 --> 02:32:29,21
你还要参加政治集会?

02:32:29,25 --> 02:32:31,67
哦 宝贝你受了惊吓了

02:32:32,33 --> 02:32:36,64
没有人关心我你们就像没事一样

02:32:58,15 --> 02:33:00,86
男人们总是说要保护我们妇女

02:33:01,15 --> 02:33:04,95
可今天我出了这么大事弗南克倒去参加政集会了

02:33:09,16 --> 02:33:11,08
如果你不难过 英蒂雅

02:33:11,12 --> 02:33:14,92
请告诉我你为什么总是这么看着我?

02:33:14,95 --> 02:33:16,43
难道 我的脸是绿色的吗?

02:33:16,46 --> 02:33:17,46
我并不难过

02:33:18,05 --> 02:33:20,72
今天下午发生的事是你自找的

02:33:20,76 --> 02:33:22,93
如果还有公理的话你应该更倒霉

02:33:22,97 --> 02:33:23,93
英蒂雅 别说了

02:33:23,97 --> 02:33:26,31
喔 让她说 梅兰妮

02:33:26,35 --> 02:33:27,93
自从我把你弟弟查尔斯从她那儿夺走后

02:33:27,97 --> 02:33:30,10
她就一直恨我

02:33:30,14 --> 02:33:31,60
如果有人追她

02:33:31,64 --> 02:33:33,23
她会脱光衣服在街上走的

02:33:33,27 --> 02:33:34,77
我就是恨你

02:33:35,77 --> 02:33:38,94
你的所作所为败坏了我们正经人的名誉

02:33:39,23 --> 02:33:41,82
现在又让男人们去冒生命危险 因为他们的

02:33:41,86 --> 02:33:43,03
英蒂雅

02:33:43,07 --> 02:33:46,66
我想最好都别说了谁也别再多说了

02:33:46,95 --> 02:33:49,66
出什么事啦我怎么什么都不知道?

02:33:55,46 --> 02:33:57,29
嘘 有人走过来了

02:33:57,34 --> 02:33:59,05
不知道是谁

02:33:59,96 --> 02:34:02,34
请把手枪给我 米格太太

02:34:08,85 --> 02:34:10,06
不论是谁

02:34:11,27 --> 02:34:12,56
问你们说什么都不知道

02:34:16,36 --> 02:34:17,52
他们到哪儿去了?

02:34:17,56 --> 02:34:19,82
快告诉我 是生死悠关的事

02:34:19,86 --> 02:34:22,03
什么都不要告诉他他是北方的奸细

02:34:22,07 --> 02:34:24,40
快一点 或许还来得及

02:34:24,45 --> 02:34:25,61
你怎么知道?

02:34:25,66 --> 02:34:27,41
我跟两个北方商人玩牌

02:34:27,45 --> 02:34:28,62
他们知道了晚上要闹事

02:34:28,66 --> 02:34:30,41
已经做好了准备

02:34:30,45 --> 02:34:32,62
你丈夫和他们的朋友要落入圈套了

02:34:32,66 --> 02:34:34,87
别告诉他 他在套你的话

02:34:38,04 --> 02:34:40,84
在得卡德罗夫街老苏利文种植园

02:34:41,34 --> 02:34:43,01
在被烧的房子的地窖里聚会

02:34:43,05 --> 02:34:44,34
我尽力而为

02:34:49,26 --> 02:34:52,27
怎么回事? 你们都不告诉我 我要疯啦

02:34:52,64 --> 02:34:54,10
斯卡莉 我们本来不想告诉你

02:34:54,14 --> 02:34:56,73
艾希礼 弗南克 还有一些别人

02:34:56,77 --> 02:34:58,40
去清除你出事的树林去了

02:34:58,44 --> 02:35:00,02
这就是我们南方男人

02:35:00,07 --> 02:35:01,90
保护我们所做的事

02:35:01,94 --> 02:35:04,86
如果他们被捕 都要被绞死斯卡莉

02:35:05,24 --> 02:35:06,70
这都是你惹的祸

02:35:06,74 --> 02:35:08,70
英蒂雅 你再说一句就请你出去

02:35:08,74 --> 02:35:10,83
郝斯卡莉做的是她应该做的

02:35:10,87 --> 02:35:13,54
男人们也是在尽他们的职责

02:35:14,37 --> 02:35:15,46
弗南克

02:35:16,16 --> 02:35:17,46
艾希礼

02:35:19,75 --> 02:35:21,04
这不可能

02:35:24,97 --> 02:35:27,51
马队 梅妮小姐

02:35:27,55 --> 02:35:29,14
你们做活 别停下来

02:35:34,06 --> 02:35:35,35
妈眯 开门吧

02:35:45,57 --> 02:35:47,36
晚上好 肯尼迪太太

02:35:49,87 --> 02:35:51,41
哪位是卫尔克斯太太?

02:35:51,45 --> 02:35:52,53
我是卫尔克斯太太

02:35:53,37 --> 02:35:55,83
我要跟卫尔克斯先生谈谈可以吗?

02:35:55,87 --> 02:35:56,87
他不在

02:35:57,25 --> 02:35:58,33
真的吗?

02:35:58,37 --> 02:36:00,17
梅妮小姐不会撒谎

02:36:00,46 --> 02:36:02,34
我不是不尊重您卫尔克斯太太

02:36:03,05 --> 02:36:05,71
如果你能保证我就不搜查了

02:36:05,76 --> 02:36:09,59
要搜就搜吧 他有一个政治集会在肯尼迪先生的店里

02:36:09,64 --> 02:36:12,26
他没在那儿今天晚上没有集会

02:36:12,64 --> 02:36:13,97
没有政治集会

02:36:14,35 --> 02:36:16,93
我到外面去等他们回来

02:36:18,44 --> 02:36:21,40
中士包围这所房子堵住所有的们和窗户

02:36:21,44 --> 02:36:22,56
是 队长

02:36:27,15 --> 02:36:28,95
继续做活吧

02:36:29,86 --> 02:36:32,16
我来 我来朗读

02:36:35,66 --> 02:36:38,75
大卫・科伯非尔的生平和经历

02:36:41,83 --> 02:36:42,96
第一章

02:36:43,46 --> 02:36:44,54
我出生了

02:36:49,05 --> 02:36:52,84
我从出生的那天起即是我生命的开始

02:36:52,88 --> 02:36:56,43
第九章我有一个可纪念的生日

02:36:56,47 --> 02:36:58,52
我的生日在三月间来到

02:36:58,56 --> 02:37:01,77
这以前 学校中所发生的一切我都不提了

02:37:02,94 --> 02:37:05,52
除了司帖夫子比以前更让人羡慕以外

02:37:05,57 --> 02:37:06,90
我什么都不记得了

02:37:06,94 --> 02:37:10,44
他就要在年底离开假如不是更早的话

02:37:10,47 --> 02:37:13,94
在我的眼里 他比以前更活泼更能独立

02:37:13,97 --> 02:37:16,33
因而比以前更让人喜欢了

02:37:16,37 --> 02:37:18,37
可是除此之外

02:37:18,41 --> 02:37:20,37
我什么都不记得了

02:37:22,75 --> 02:37:23,96
我什么都不记得了

02:37:28,96 --> 02:37:30,67
梅妮 他们喝醉了

02:37:31,47 --> 02:37:33,09
让我来应付

02:37:33,14 --> 02:37:34,97
请你 什么也别说

02:37:38,47 --> 02:37:39,85
你这蠢货

02:37:42,06 --> 02:37:43,27
安静

02:37:43,85 --> 02:37:45,86
你们不要再唱了安静

02:37:46,36 --> 02:37:47,52
你好 梅妮

02:37:47,57 --> 02:37:50,57
你又把我丈夫灌醉了巴特勒船长

02:37:51,07 --> 02:37:52,11
好 扶他进来吧

02:37:52,15 --> 02:37:54,62
对不起 卫尔克斯太太你丈夫被捕了

02:37:54,66 --> 02:37:56,70
你们如果要逮捕亚特南大的

02:37:56,74 --> 02:37:59,63
那你们的监狱里就住满北方人了喔 对不起 我

02:37:59,66 --> 02:38:03,16
扶他进来吧 巴特勒船长如果你自己还能走的话

02:38:03,65 --> 02:38:04,30
喔 这

02:38:04,33 --> 02:38:07,05
我要给你讲个故事

02:38:07,08 --> 02:38:07,17
大夫 我

02:38:07,46 --> 02:38:08,75
让他坐在椅子上

02:38:12,84 --> 02:38:15,22
巴特勒船长 请你离开我家好吗?

02:38:15,26 --> 02:38:17,85
记住以后再也别来了

02:38:18,26 --> 02:38:21,06
可是我把他从大街上弄回来没让他在那儿丢人

02:38:21,35 --> 02:38:25,29
你就 这样谢我?

02:38:25,32 --> 02:38:25,65
我们进来大家一起唱吧

02:38:26,06 --> 02:38:27,56
米格大夫

02:38:28,27 --> 02:38:30,07
你太我吃惊了

02:38:36,87 --> 02:38:39,16
艾希礼 你怎么能做这种事?

02:38:40,95 --> 02:38:42,66

02:38:43,75 --> 02:38:46,42
扶他进卧室去 妈眯把他扶到床上去

02:38:46,46 --> 02:38:48,13
别动他 他被捕了中士

02:38:48,17 --> 02:38:49,21
汤姆

02:38:49,25 --> 02:38:51,05
你为什么要逮捕他?

02:38:51,34 --> 02:38:53,22
我看见他喝醉了

02:38:53,26 --> 02:38:55,93
也见你喝醉过你也见过我

02:38:55,97 --> 02:38:59,86
他醉倒在沟里我也管不着我不是警察

02:38:59,89 --> 02:39:01,52
可他今天晚山领着人袭击了棚户区

02:39:01,56 --> 02:39:04,32
就是肯尼迪太太出事的地方

02:39:04,35 --> 02:39:07,40
很多屋子被烧了 还打死了人

02:39:07,44 --> 02:39:11,44
应该让你们这些反叛明白不能为所欲为了

02:39:11,48 --> 02:39:14,77
你在笑什么?

02:39:14,86 --> 02:39:16,75

在太太们面前不好说

02:39:31,17 --> 02:39:32,25
你最好说出来

02:39:32,84 --> 02:39:35,13

现在你可以满意了 汤姆?

02:40:02,37 --> 02:40:05,66
明天这俩位太太不会理他们的丈夫

02:40:07,04 --> 02:40:09,17

你要不相信去问贝尔她会告诉你的

你能像位绅士那样想我保证吗?

02:40:21,55 --> 02:40:22,64
象位绅士?

02:40:22,97 --> 02:40:24,26

我赶到那儿他们已经跟北方佬交上了火

02:41:37,17 --> 02:41:40,05
卫尔克斯先生受了伤米格大夫和他在一起

02:41:40,47 --> 02:41:43,76

02:41:43,80 --> 02:41:46,43
所以把他们 带到贝尔那儿去了

02:41:46,47 --> 02:41:47,76

02:42:20,46 --> 02:42:21,55
艾希礼

02:42:23,63 --> 02:42:27,14
你对你自己丈夫的情况一点儿也不感兴趣吗?

02:42:28,81 --> 02:42:32,31
哼  弗南克一跟你去贝尔那儿了吗?

02:42:32,35 --> 02:42:33,44
没有

02:42:34,06 --> 02:42:35,15
那么他在哪儿?

02:42:36,15 --> 02:42:37,94
正躺在得卡斯大路上

02:42:39,07 --> 02:42:40,44
头部中了弹

02:42:41,65 --> 02:42:42,74
他死了

02:42:53,04 --> 02:42:54,16
是哪一位?

02:42:54,54 --> 02:42:55,92
是我 沃特琳太太

02:42:55,96 --> 02:42:58,34
沃特琳太太请到屋里坐会儿吧

02:42:58,96 --> 02:43:01,05
我不能进去 卫尔克斯太太

02:43:02,05 --> 02:43:04,17
你上车来跟我呆一会

02:43:12,56 --> 02:43:14,73
你这么帮助我该怎么谢你呢?

02:43:14,77 --> 02:43:16,52
我怎么谢你才好呢?

02:43:16,56 --> 02:43:19,73
我收到你的便条说你要来拜访我

02:43:19,77 --> 02:43:22,15
向我道谢 卫尔克斯太太

02:43:23,07 --> 02:43:26,70
您大概是糊涂了 所以天刚黑 我就赶过来

02:43:26,73 --> 02:43:30,82
告诉您 您 不应该这样想

02:43:31,03 --> 02:43:32,83
那是很不合适的

02:43:32,87 --> 02:43:36,87
我向一位救了我丈夫命的人去道谢 有什么不合适?

02:43:36,96 --> 02:43:41,25
卫尔克斯太太 全城没有一位太太像您对我这么好

02:43:42,05 --> 02:43:44,55
我是说为医院捐款的事

02:43:44,97 --> 02:43:46,55
我不会忘记的

02:43:46,97 --> 02:43:50,10
我想卫尔克斯先生要是被绞死

02:43:50,14 --> 02:43:51,85
你又成了寡妇 还有一个孩子

02:43:52,47 --> 02:43:55,27
他真是个天真可爱孩子

02:43:56,06 --> 02:43:58,65
我也有个男孩 所以我

02:43:59,27 --> 02:44:01,52
哦 您也有 ? 他住在 ?

02:44:01,57 --> 02:44:03,73
喔 不 他不在亚特南大

02:44:04,94 --> 02:44:06,45
我从来也没有见过他

02:44:06,95 --> 02:44:08,86
他在别处上学

02:44:09,36 --> 02:44:11,37
从小我就没见过他了

02:44:14,37 --> 02:44:18,37
不管怎么说 要是肯尼迪太太的丈夫出了事

02:44:18,67 --> 02:44:22,13
我是连一个手指头也不会帮她的

02:44:22,16 --> 02:44:24,13
就是巴特勒船长说也不行

02:44:24,17 --> 02:44:26,65
她是个冷酷的女人在亚特南大目中无人

02:44:26,69 --> 02:44:29,13
她丈夫等于就是让她杀死的

02:44:29,76 --> 02:44:32,47
请你不要这样说我的弟妹

02:44:35,51 --> 02:44:38,06
哦 请别介意卫尔克斯太太

02:44:38,35 --> 02:44:40,15
我忘了你喜欢她了

02:44:41,36 --> 02:44:45,36
不过您跟她可不是一路人我就是这么看的

02:44:46,15 --> 02:44:48,18
现在我该走了

02:44:48,22 --> 02:44:53,33
我怕在这儿呆久了有人会认出我的马车

02:44:53,36 --> 02:44:55,16
这样对您不好

02:44:56,04 --> 02:44:57,45
还有 卫尔克斯太太

02:44:58,04 --> 02:45:01,25
如果 你在街上遇到了我而不和我说话

02:45:02,04 --> 02:45:03,34
我能理解

02:45:04,17 --> 02:45:07,97
跟您说话 向您道谢我都感到荣辛

02:45:09,26 --> 02:45:10,63
希望能再见面

02:45:11,05 --> 02:45:13,35
啊不 这不太合适

02:45:15,56 --> 02:45:18,59
晚安 卫尔克斯太太晚安 沃特琳太太

02:45:23,77 --> 02:45:25,90
你误解了肯尼迪太太

02:45:25,94 --> 02:45:28,24
她为她丈夫的死很痛心

02:46:12,57 --> 02:46:14,74
是瑞德 真讨厌

02:46:39,92 --> 02:46:43,27
小姐 巴特勒船长来看你

02:46:43,30 --> 02:46:45,77
我告诉他 你现在很伤心

02:46:45,77 --> 02:46:48,44
告诉他 我就下来 妈眯

02:47:19,05 --> 02:47:20,47
她说她就下来

02:47:20,85 --> 02:47:23,23
我不知道她为什么要下来可她马就下来

02:47:23,27 --> 02:47:24,81
你不喜欢我 妈眯

02:47:24,85 --> 02:47:28,15
你不用和我说了 我知道你真不喜欢我

02:47:40,16 --> 02:47:41,66
这样不好 斯卡莉

02:47:42,24 --> 02:47:43,20
什么?

02:47:43,25 --> 02:47:44,25
花露水

02:47:44,75 --> 02:47:46,96
我 不明白你的意思

02:47:47,46 --> 02:47:50,67
我是说你喝酒了 白兰地喝了不少

02:47:51,55 --> 02:47:54,05
喝了怎么样 与你什么相干?

02:47:56,63 --> 02:47:58,43
别一个人喝酒

02:47:58,47 --> 02:48:01,47
人们会知道 斯卡莉这有损你的名誉

02:48:07,94 --> 02:48:09,10
好象

02:48:09,15 --> 02:48:11,06
不仅仅是为了老弗南克?

02:48:11,57 --> 02:48:13,03
瑞德

02:48:13,07 --> 02:48:14,07
我很害怕

02:48:14,44 --> 02:48:17,20
我不信 你从来不会害怕

02:48:17,24 --> 02:48:18,66
我现在很害怕

02:48:18,95 --> 02:48:21,07
害怕死怕下地狱

02:48:22,87 --> 02:48:26,25
你看起来很健康也许就没有地狱

02:48:26,28 --> 02:48:29,17
有的 我知道有从小就知道

02:48:30,04 --> 02:48:33,17
哦 我不会过问你小时候受的教育?

02:48:33,75 --> 02:48:36,47
告诉我 你都干了些什么事情而要下地狱?

02:48:37,35 --> 02:48:40,64
一开始我不该嫁给弗南克

02:48:40,76 --> 02:48:43,26
他是休伦的未婚夫他爱她而不是我

02:48:44,14 --> 02:48:46,85
我让他痛苦 我害死了他

02:48:47,35 --> 02:48:50,18
是的 我害死了他

02:48:51,26 --> 02:48:52,74
瑞德

02:48:52,77 --> 02:48:57,44
这是我第一次为自己做过的事感到难过

02:48:57,95 --> 02:48:59,95
给你 擦擦眼泪

02:49:01,24 --> 02:49:04,20
如果你再做一次你还会是那样

02:49:04,24 --> 02:49:06,83
你就象是一个贼 偷了东西以后一点也不后悔

02:49:06,87 --> 02:49:10,05
而是害怕去蹲监狱

02:49:10,08 --> 02:49:11,96
幸亏妈妈她死了

02:49:12,67 --> 02:49:15,34
幸亏她死了 没看到我这样

02:49:16,34 --> 02:49:19,17
我一直想像她那样安祥 善良

02:49:20,34 --> 02:49:22,84
我一天天令她失望

02:49:24,76 --> 02:49:28,66
斯卡莉 我看你现在快要放声大哭了

02:49:36,28 --> 02:49:39,07
让我们换个话题说说我为什么来这儿

02:49:39,57 --> 02:49:40,95
说吧  说完快走

02:49:42,45 --> 02:49:43,41
要说什么?

02:49:43,45 --> 02:49:45,74
今生今世我再也不能没有你啦

02:49:46,45 --> 02:49:51,59
喔 你真是个最没教养的人这个时候来说这种话斯卡莉

02:49:51,62 --> 02:49:54,97
当我第一次见到你 我就觉得

02:49:55,00 --> 02:49:55,13
你是我所要的唯一的女人

02:49:55,17 --> 02:49:57,42
你现在有木材厂和弗南克的钱

02:49:57,46 --> 02:49:59,92
不会象进监狱那样来求我

02:49:59,97 --> 02:50:01,97
看来现在我该娶你了

02:50:02,76 --> 02:50:04,43
我从来没听过这么粗俗的话

02:50:04,47 --> 02:50:06,93
如果我现在跟你下跪你该相信了吧?

02:50:06,97 --> 02:50:08,81
你这个无赖 你给我出去

02:50:08,85 --> 02:50:11,81
对不起 请你愿谅我我的情感这么激动

02:50:11,85 --> 02:50:14,56
吓着你了 亲爱的 应该说亲爱的肯尼迪太太

02:50:14,86 --> 02:50:16,67
你应该注意到了 这些天

02:50:16,71 --> 02:50:21,40
我对你的友情 已经发展到了 已经发展到了更加深刻的感情

02:50:21,44 --> 02:50:25,31
而且是更加美好 更加纯洁和更加神圣

02:50:26,07 --> 02:50:28,16
这应承说是 爱情了吧?

02:50:28,74 --> 02:50:31,41
你给我起来 我不喜欢这庸俗的玩笑

02:50:31,46 --> 02:50:33,12
这是一种高尚的求婚方式

02:50:33,17 --> 02:50:35,75
这是我认为最适当的时候

02:50:36,84 --> 02:50:39,84
我不能一生总在 你的丈夫中间等着

02:50:40,46 --> 02:50:42,67
你有粗鲁 又自负

02:50:43,63 --> 02:50:46,26
这种话我不想听下去了

02:50:47,14 --> 02:50:49,64
再说 我不会再结婚了

02:50:50,64 --> 02:50:53,14
哦 你会的你会嫁给我的

02:50:53,77 --> 02:50:55,44
你 你 ?

02:50:56,15 --> 02:50:57,56
我不爱你

02:50:58,07 --> 02:51:00,36
而且 而且我喜欢结婚

02:51:01,36 --> 02:51:03,70
你想过为乐趣而结婚吗?

02:51:03,74 --> 02:51:07,93
结婚的乐趣? 别胡说了 那是男人的乐趣

02:51:08,37 --> 02:51:10,12
你要外面都听到吗?

02:51:10,16 --> 02:51:12,37
你先嫁个孩子后又嫁个老头

02:51:12,66 --> 02:51:15,67
为什么不嫁个年纪相当又懂得女人的丈夫呢?

02:51:16,54 --> 02:51:21,66
你是个傻瓜 你知道吗? 我会永远爱着另一个人的

02:51:22,34 --> 02:51:25,63
别说 你现在听见了没有别再说这事

02:51:32,06 --> 02:51:33,52
别 我要晕了

02:51:33,56 --> 02:51:36,40
我就是要你晕 想一想吧

02:51:36,44 --> 02:51:39,23
你的那些傻瓜有过这样的吻? 有吗?

02:51:39,27 --> 02:51:42,39
你的恰尔斯 弗南克还有那个笨艾希礼

02:51:50,45 --> 02:51:54,20
说你要嫁给我说愿意 说愿意

02:51:54,23 --> 02:51:54,87
我愿意

02:51:57,17 --> 02:51:59,63
是真心话吗? 不会说了不算?

02:51:59,67 --> 02:52:00,67
不会

02:52:01,34 --> 02:52:03,46
看着我 跟我说心里话

02:52:04,05 --> 02:52:06,05
说你愿意 是不是为了我的钱?

02:52:06,63 --> 02:52:07,63
哦

02:52:07,97 --> 02:52:09,34
是 也不全是

02:52:10,55 --> 02:52:11,76
不全是?

02:52:12,47 --> 02:52:17,80
你知道 瑞德 钱是有用的当然 我也喜欢你

02:52:17,83 --> 02:52:18,40
喜欢我?

02:52:18,44 --> 02:52:22,02
如果说我疯狂地爱着你那是说谎

02:52:22,07 --> 02:52:23,90
你常说我们有共同之处

02:52:23,94 --> 02:52:25,44
说得对 亲爱的

02:52:25,94 --> 02:52:28,32
你爱我多少 我就爱你多少

02:52:28,36 --> 02:52:30,66
愿上天保佑真正爱你的人

02:52:31,37 --> 02:52:33,33
想要什么样的戒指? 亲爱的

02:52:33,37 --> 02:52:36,62
钻石戒指要买一只特大的 瑞德

02:52:36,66 --> 02:52:39,54
我要给你买亚特南大最大最阔气的戒指

02:52:39,96 --> 02:52:41,92
我还要用我的钱带你到新奥尔良

02:52:41,96 --> 02:52:43,63
度一次最豪华的蜜月

02:52:43,67 --> 02:52:45,05
哦 那真是太好啦

02:52:45,34 --> 02:52:47,42
我还要跟你买很多很多的嫁妆

02:52:47,47 --> 02:52:49,05
哦 瑞德 太好了

02:52:49,84 --> 02:52:51,97
可别告诉任何人

02:52:52,47 --> 02:52:53,97
还是个小伪君子

02:52:56,64 --> 02:52:58,81
瑞德 不和我吻别吗?

02:52:58,85 --> 02:53:01,61
怎么 亲爱的 这一下午还没有亲够吗?

02:53:01,65 --> 02:53:02,73
哦 你真讨厌

02:53:02,77 --> 02:53:05,19
走吧我不在乎 你别再回来

02:53:05,23 --> 02:53:06,57
可是我要回来的

02:53:21,54 --> 02:53:23,71
你想什么呢 斯卡莉德?

02:53:23,75 --> 02:53:25,67
我想我们多阔啊

02:53:27,67 --> 02:53:29,93
哦 瑞德我还能继续经营木材厂吗?

02:53:29,97 --> 02:53:32,43
当然了 如果你愿意

02:53:32,47 --> 02:53:35,10
现在你阔了 象你常说的那样

02:53:35,14 --> 02:53:36,56
可以让任何人见鬼去了

02:53:37,06 --> 02:53:39,56
那你就是第一个去见鬼的了

02:53:57,37 --> 02:54:00,87
不要刮盘子 斯卡莉橱房里还多的是呢

02:54:01,16 --> 02:54:04,67
哦 瑞德 我能再要一块巧克力菜吗?

02:54:05,17 --> 02:54:08,51
你要是再这样贪吃的话会胖得象妈眯

02:54:08,55 --> 02:54:09,97
那我可要离婚了

02:54:10,76 --> 02:54:13,51
该给妈眯买点礼物吧?

02:54:13,55 --> 02:54:17,15
为什么给她买礼物? 她说我们是一对骡子

02:54:17,35 --> 02:54:18,64
骡子? 为什么?

02:54:18,97 --> 02:54:23,77
喔 她说我们摆阔气把自己打扮得象赛马那么漂亮

02:54:23,80 --> 02:54:25,68
其实是戴着马具的骡子

02:54:25,71 --> 02:54:26,86
这骗不了人的

02:54:26,94 --> 02:54:30,51
我从来没有听过这样的大实话

02:54:30,54 --> 02:54:31,54
妈眯是个聪明的老人

02:54:31,57 --> 02:54:34,87
我愿意受到象她这样的人尊敬

02:54:36,07 --> 02:54:37,83
我什么也不给她 不给她

02:54:37,87 --> 02:54:39,70
我要送给她一条衬裙

02:54:39,75 --> 02:54:42,00
我记得我奶奶说过 当她升天堂的时候

02:54:42,04 --> 02:54:45,96
她要穿一条很挺的红绸子衬裙

02:54:46,25 --> 02:54:49,79
走路时习习沙沙地响上帝会以为是天使翅膀做的呢

02:54:49,82 --> 02:54:52,51
她不会要你的她死都不会穿的

02:54:52,55 --> 02:54:55,34
也许吧 可我还是要表示一下

02:54:58,40 --> 02:55:02,82
醒醒 醒醒 斯卡莉 醒醒

02:55:04,06 --> 02:55:05,94
啊 你又在作恶梦了

02:55:07,27 --> 02:55:08,27
哦 瑞德

02:55:08,65 --> 02:55:10,90
我当时又冷 又饿

02:55:10,94 --> 02:55:12,44
又累

02:55:13,07 --> 02:55:17,07
我找不到 我找不到我在屋里跑 可我找不到

02:55:17,87 --> 02:55:19,87
找什么呢? 亲爱的哦 我不知道

02:55:20,66 --> 02:55:23,16
我总作同样的梦可我不知道

02:55:23,75 --> 02:55:25,83
好象是藏在雾里

02:55:25,87 --> 02:55:26,96
喔 亲爱的

02:55:28,25 --> 02:55:32,26
你认为我会在梦里找到它吗? 找到了我就安全了

02:55:33,76 --> 02:55:37,76
梦不会这样的 不过 当你有了温暖和安全的感觉

02:55:38,26 --> 02:55:40,26
你就不会作这样的恶梦了

02:55:40,64 --> 02:55:43,64
斯卡莉 我会让你感到安全的

02:55:47,94 --> 02:55:50,27
瑞德 我求你一件事你能答应吗?

02:55:50,65 --> 02:55:51,86
你知道我能

02:55:53,15 --> 02:55:55,45
你愿意带我离开这儿吗?

02:55:55,74 --> 02:55:57,32
你不喜欢新奥尔良?

02:55:57,36 --> 02:56:01,59

02:56:02,24 --> 02:56:03,75

02:56:04,66 --> 02:56:09,71
好吧 斯卡莉 我当然愿意我们明天就走

02:56:12,46 --> 02:56:15,30
你的力量是从这儿来的 泰拉庄园的红土

02:56:15,34 --> 02:56:17,43
你是它的一部分它也是你的一部分

02:56:17,47 --> 02:56:21,43
我要尽一切可能把泰拉庄园恢复成战前的样子

02:56:21,46 --> 02:56:24,73
是吗? 那你就去做吧

02:56:24,77 --> 02:56:28,78
花多少钱都没行能成为和过去一样好的种植园

02:56:28,81 --> 02:56:30,15

02:56:58,26 --> 02:57:00,84

02:57:01,35 --> 02:57:02,97

不再是戴马具的骡子了吧?

02:58:25,76 --> 02:58:28,77
先生 斯卡莉小姐不该告诉你这个

02:58:29,06 --> 02:58:31,64
你不会记恨我吧?

02:58:32,06 --> 02:58:34,90
不 怎么能记恨你呢?

02:58:34,94 --> 02:58:37,90

我盼望 妈眯 她真漂亮

02:58:57,25 --> 02:59:00,42
他们会给她取什么名字?

02:59:00,46 --> 02:59:02,42
斯卡莉小姐对我说

02:59:02,46 --> 02:59:06,60
要是生个女孩就叫玉季尼亚维克多利亚

02:59:06,97 --> 02:59:07,97
是啊

02:59:08,26 --> 02:59:10,14
她是个漂亮的娃娃

02:59:10,97 --> 02:59:13,35
最漂亮的娃娃

02:59:14,35 --> 02:59:15,56

02:59:17,15 --> 02:59:19,44
你知道你的生日吗?

02:59:20,15 --> 02:59:22,36
你已经一个星期大了

02:59:22,95 --> 02:59:28,16

对 她会受大南方最好的家庭的欢迎

02:59:37,33 --> 02:59:39,80
当她结婚的时候

02:59:39,84 --> 02:59:42,84
她会象一个小公主

02:59:43,76 --> 02:59:45,93
我看你是在自说自话了

02:59:45,97 --> 02:59:47,26
为什么不呢?

02:59:48,26 --> 02:59:51,27
她是第一个完全属于我的人

02:59:52,56 --> 02:59:54,31
你别得意了

02:59:54,35 --> 02:59:55,85
孩子是我生的不是吗?

02:59:56,85 --> 02:59:58,40

02:59:58,44 --> 02:59:59,73
请进来 梅妮

02:59:59,77 --> 03:00:03,07
是啊进来看看我女儿漂亮的蓝眼睛

03:00:05,36 --> 03:00:08,32
可是大多数孩子生下来眼睛都是蓝的

03:00:08,37 --> 03:00:11,33
别告诉他 梅妮他对孩子的事什么都不懂

03:00:11,37 --> 03:00:14,62
不管怎么说 她的眼睛都是蓝的而且永远是蓝的

03:00:14,66 --> 03:00:16,54
像我们漂亮的蓝旗

03:00:17,54 --> 03:00:20,00
太对了 漂亮的蓝旗 我们就叫她

03:00:20,04 --> 03:00:21,25
邦蒂卜露巴特

03:00:30,05 --> 03:00:31,26
好了 再试试 妈眯

03:00:39,27 --> 03:00:40,36
二十英寸

03:00:40,94 --> 03:00:43,91
二十英寸胖得像碧蒂姑妈了

03:00:44,57 --> 03:00:47,03
你一定帮我勒到十八寸半妈眯

03:00:47,07 --> 03:00:48,70
你生过孩子了 小姐

03:00:48,74 --> 03:00:51,12
你永远也不能到十八寸半了

03:00:51,16 --> 03:00:53,54
永远  我没办法

03:00:54,08 --> 03:00:56,91
我会有办法的

03:00:56,96 --> 03:00:59,54
我不能现在就发胖 变老

03:01:00,67 --> 03:01:02,67
我不能再生孩子了

03:01:03,55 --> 03:01:06,67
瑞德先生说他明年还想要个儿子呢

03:01:07,34 --> 03:01:10,22
告诉巴特勒船长我决定不出去了

03:01:10,26 --> 03:01:11,97
晚餐我在屋里吃

03:01:32,57 --> 03:01:36,98
我听说了我让他们把我的晚餐也送到这儿来

03:01:43,34 --> 03:01:45,13
你不会反对吧?

03:01:45,17 --> 03:01:46,25
哦 不

03:01:47,46 --> 03:01:48,47
是的 我

03:01:49,87 --> 03:01:52,84
我是说你在哪儿吃晚餐都可以

03:01:55,64 --> 03:01:57,12
瑞德

03:01:57,15 --> 03:01:58,60
什么?

03:01:58,64 --> 03:01:59,64
你知道

03:02:00,27 --> 03:02:01,85
我  我决定

03:02:04,15 --> 03:02:06,44
我希望以后不再生孩子了

03:02:19,25 --> 03:02:22,17
亲爱的 邦妮出生之前我就说过

03:02:23,04 --> 03:02:26,13
你生一个还是二十个对我没什么

03:02:26,17 --> 03:02:27,67
可你知道

03:02:28,34 --> 03:02:30,01
你明白我的意思吗?

03:02:30,05 --> 03:02:33,51
喔 明白但我为这事可以提出离婚

03:02:34,34 --> 03:02:36,60
你就是这么低级总想那种事

03:02:36,64 --> 03:02:40,52
如果你还有点骑士风度看看人家艾希礼

03:02:40,55 --> 03:02:44,16
梅兰妮不能再生孩子可是他 他

03:02:45,44 --> 03:02:48,23
今天下午你去木材厂了? 是吗?

03:02:48,27 --> 03:02:49,86
这又有什么关系?

03:02:50,90 --> 03:02:54,91
卫希礼可真是个正人君子 请说下去 巴特勒太太

03:02:54,95 --> 03:02:57,24
说也没用 你不能理解

03:02:58,54 --> 03:03:00,50
斯卡莉 你知道我为你难过

03:03:00,54 --> 03:03:01,83
为我难过?

03:03:01,87 --> 03:03:05,50
对 为你难过 因为你用双手把辛福仍掉了

03:03:05,54 --> 03:03:08,00
而你所追求的却不会使你幸福

03:03:08,05 --> 03:03:09,71
我不懂你说的是什么

03:03:09,76 --> 03:03:12,72
即使你是单身而梅妮小姐又死了

03:03:12,76 --> 03:03:15,64
你得到了你的卫希礼 你会辛福吗?

03:03:16,97 --> 03:03:19,85
你不会了解的也不知道他在想什么

03:03:20,64 --> 03:03:23,56
你什么也不会知道的除了金钱

03:03:23,94 --> 03:03:25,90
别跟我说这些了  我要知道的是

03:03:25,94 --> 03:03:29,44
你可以守你的贞节 这样做对我没什么

03:03:30,36 --> 03:03:31,90
你是说你不在乎?

03:03:31,94 --> 03:03:35,83
世界上有很多东西有那么多人我不会寂寞的

03:03:36,24 --> 03:03:37,74
我可以在别处找到安慰

03:03:38,24 --> 03:03:39,50
太好了

03:03:39,54 --> 03:03:43,50
不过我提醒你 要是你又变卦了我可把门锁上

03:03:43,54 --> 03:03:46,96
锁上? 我要走进来什么锁也挡不住

03:04:05,10 --> 03:04:09,02
我一直认为大多数女人都狡诈 虚伪 无情

03:04:09,06 --> 03:04:09,93
可这个女人

03:04:09,97 --> 03:04:14,53
哦 瑞德 这有什么用什么意思? 我是说你被她迷住了

03:04:14,57 --> 03:04:17,91
不管她怎么对你可你仍然爱她

03:04:17,95 --> 03:04:19,91
不要以为你不说出来我就高兴 也许是

03:04:19,95 --> 03:04:22,91
不过我跟她算完了我告诉你 完了

03:04:22,95 --> 03:04:26,16
你要为孩子想孩子胜过十个母亲

03:04:32,84 --> 03:04:36,58
你是个聪明的人 贝尔是个非常好的人

03:04:37,76 --> 03:04:38,80
是吗 瑞德?

03:04:38,84 --> 03:04:41,76
我在想你们俩有什么不同

03:04:42,47 --> 03:04:46,02
你们都是精明的女人你们俩都取得了成功

03:04:46,06 --> 03:04:49,40
可是你有一颗善良的心

03:04:49,77 --> 03:04:51,06
你很诚实

03:04:53,86 --> 03:04:54,94
再见 瑞德

03:04:56,24 --> 03:04:57,57
再见

03:05:11,38 --> 03:05:13,86
她一定会是一名出色的女骑手

03:05:13,90 --> 03:05:17,84
瞧她的手 她的屁股喔 别胡说了

03:05:18,18 --> 03:05:19,51
哦

03:05:19,55 --> 03:05:22,51
为什么要自己推着贝比出来家里有很多的佣人

03:05:22,55 --> 03:05:23,72
早上好 威尔韦格尔太太

03:05:23,76 --> 03:05:25,31
早上好 巴特勒船长

03:05:25,35 --> 03:05:26,73
早上好 斯卡莉

03:05:26,77 --> 03:05:29,73
跟在这些老太太装什么样?

03:05:29,77 --> 03:05:32,73
如果你想想你过去的地位你就会这么做了

03:05:32,77 --> 03:05:36,74
不过我要赢得这个城市里每一位孤寡老太婆们的好感

03:05:37,95 --> 03:05:39,32
早上好 怀亭太太

03:05:39,36 --> 03:05:42,74
早上好 巴特勒船长早上好 斯卡莉

03:05:43,45 --> 03:05:46,24
这一下大投机商就变得受人尊敬了?

03:05:46,87 --> 03:05:49,12
多少钱也买不来我对邦妮的期望

03:05:49,16 --> 03:05:51,42
我承认我有缺点

03:05:51,46 --> 03:05:53,92
可邦妮需要到正派人的圈子里

03:05:53,96 --> 03:05:57,46
那怕我们要对每个老北毛低声下气

03:05:58,47 --> 03:06:00,18
早上好 梅格太太

03:06:00,47 --> 03:06:03,14
早上好 巴特勒船长早上好 斯卡莉

03:06:09,64 --> 03:06:12,60
梅利威格尔太太我一直佩服您丰富的知识

03:06:12,65 --> 03:06:14,40
我想向您请教一点事可以吗?

03:06:14,44 --> 03:06:15,52
当然可以

03:06:15,57 --> 03:06:17,82
邦妮爱吃大拇指我没法至止她

03:06:17,86 --> 03:06:20,32
不能让她这样嘴会变型的

03:06:20,36 --> 03:06:21,53
我知道 我知道

03:06:21,57 --> 03:06:25,20
她的小嘴长得多好看那我往她的手指上涂过肥皂

03:06:25,24 --> 03:06:26,41
肥皂?

03:06:26,45 --> 03:06:29,87
往手指上涂点奎宁 她很快就不吃了

03:06:30,16 --> 03:06:32,67
奎宁? 我怎么就没有想到呢

03:06:33,17 --> 03:06:35,21
真是太感谢您了威利威德尔太太

03:06:35,25 --> 03:06:38,46
这样一来 我就不用担心了早上好

03:06:42,18 --> 03:06:43,51
早上好 朵丽

03:06:43,55 --> 03:06:45,22
那不是巴特勒船长吗?

03:06:45,26 --> 03:06:47,76
早上好 卡洛琳我正在想

03:06:48,27 --> 03:06:52,27
一个这么爱孩子的男人他身上一定有很多优点

03:06:52,35 --> 03:06:54,23
当然是的

03:06:54,27 --> 03:06:58,11
喔 我没有告诉过你吗? 范倪告诉米格大夫说

03:06:58,15 --> 03:07:00,90
巴特勒船长承认他参加了弗兰克林战役

03:07:00,94 --> 03:07:03,11
还受到了联邦议会的嘉奖

03:07:03,16 --> 03:07:06,70
没有? 我没告诉过你吧

03:07:06,74 --> 03:07:09,91
巴特勒船长还为美化阵亡将士的公墓

03:07:09,95 --> 03:07:11,91
捐了一大笔钱呢

03:07:11,96 --> 03:07:12,96
没有?

03:07:13,75 --> 03:07:17,63
我的小孙子下星期要为邦妮・巴特勒开个派提

03:07:17,67 --> 03:07:20,42
哦 你明知道是我先想的

03:07:20,46 --> 03:07:21,92
我要为邦妮・巴特勒开派提

03:07:21,97 --> 03:07:23,66
卡洛琳米达 你怎么能这么做呢?

03:07:25,74 --> 03:07:26,96
我的小孙子 是我提议的

03:07:27,02 --> 03:07:30,67
应该我先请 应该我先请

03:07:32,56 --> 03:07:35,44
看  爸爸教你的小马跳栏邦妮 注意看 欧

03:07:38,65 --> 03:07:41,11
哦 好棒 让我来 让我来吗

03:07:41,15 --> 03:07:43,45
好吧 宝贝波克 把她抱上来

03:07:47,16 --> 03:07:48,37
上来吧

03:07:48,66 --> 03:07:49,95
对 就这样

03:07:50,24 --> 03:07:52,83
我的老天那 又来了

03:07:52,87 --> 03:07:56,21
两腿夹紧 骑稳了 向前探身一定要顺着它的步子

03:07:56,25 --> 03:07:59,04
抓紧缰绳 提起来

03:08:00,17 --> 03:08:02,46
太好了 我知道你能跳过去

03:08:02,76 --> 03:08:05,72
等你长大一点我带你去肯塔几和弗吉尼亚

03:08:05,76 --> 03:08:09,14
你会成为南方最好的女骑手让爸爸亲一下

03:08:10,26 --> 03:08:11,56
瑞德先生  瑞德先生

03:08:12,77 --> 03:08:13,77
瑞德先生

03:08:14,77 --> 03:08:17,06
看见了吗 妈眯? 她多了不起啊?

03:08:17,44 --> 03:08:21,40
瑞德先生 我告诉过你一个女孩子跨着骑马

03:08:21,44 --> 03:08:24,70
裙子都吹起来 是很不合适的

03:08:24,74 --> 03:08:27,11
那好吧 把我就教她侧骑吧

03:08:27,16 --> 03:08:30,41
我要给她买一身蓝天鹅绒的马服 她会喜欢的

03:08:30,45 --> 03:08:32,83
小姑娘穿黑呢子的就行了

03:08:32,87 --> 03:08:34,96
好了 好了 妈眯 别再说了

03:08:35,46 --> 03:08:37,67
反正 我觉得不合适

03:08:39,67 --> 03:08:41,84
不合适 就是不合适

03:08:43,55 --> 03:08:44,97
不合适

03:08:55,06 --> 03:08:56,35
哦 斯卡莉

03:08:57,06 --> 03:08:59,10
你这时候进城干什么来啦?

03:08:59,15 --> 03:09:00,23
啊艾希礼 我刚

03:09:00,27 --> 03:09:03,77
你怎么没帮梅妮准备我的生日宴会去呢?

03:09:03,86 --> 03:09:07,15
喔 艾希礼我还以为你不知道呢

03:09:07,19 --> 03:09:10,32
你要不作出惊喜的样子她会失望的

03:09:10,37 --> 03:09:13,54
我知道 到时候我一定象亚特南大最惊喜人

03:09:14,75 --> 03:09:16,91
好了 你来了让我把帐本给你看看

03:09:16,96 --> 03:09:19,71
你就能看到我是多么无能的生意人了

03:09:19,75 --> 03:09:21,96
今天我们不谈这没意思的事

03:09:22,25 --> 03:09:24,92
在我戴上这顶新帽子的时候

03:09:24,96 --> 03:09:26,64
帐目在我脑子里就不存在了

03:09:26,67 --> 03:09:29,97
戴上这么漂亮的帽子当然什么也不想了

03:09:30,47 --> 03:09:33,35
斯卡莉 你越来越漂亮了

03:09:34,35 --> 03:09:39,09
一点也没变记得在十二颗橡树最后一次夜餐会上

03:09:39,12 --> 03:09:41,65
你坐在一颗树下一群男孩子围着你

03:09:43,77 --> 03:09:46,15
那时的我已经不存在了

03:09:46,65 --> 03:09:49,24
没有一件事象我期望的那样

03:09:49,57 --> 03:09:50,66
没有

03:09:50,87 --> 03:09:55,16
是的 从那以后我们都走过了一段漫长地路

03:09:55,74 --> 03:09:57,50
哎 那优闲的日子

03:09:57,54 --> 03:09:59,75
那乡间温暖的黄昏

03:10:01,04 --> 03:10:03,67
黑人们的欢笑从他们的住处传来

03:10:04,84 --> 03:10:08,17
那温馨宁静的美好时光

03:10:10,34 --> 03:10:11,84
不要回忆过去了

03:10:12,55 --> 03:10:13,76
不要回忆了

03:10:15,85 --> 03:10:20,56
他只能揪住你的心什么事也干不成

03:10:25,65 --> 03:10:27,86
我不该惹你伤心亲爱的

03:10:29,07 --> 03:10:32,07
我唯一希望就是你能过得幸福

03:10:52,55 --> 03:10:53,55
艾希礼

03:10:56,14 --> 03:10:57,22
谁呀?

03:10:57,26 --> 03:10:58,47
你丈夫

03:10:59,56 --> 03:11:00,35
哦 进来

03:11:01,64 --> 03:11:04,33
我真的被邀请进入圣殿了?

03:11:05,65 --> 03:11:07,57
你不去参加梅兰妮的宴会吗?

03:11:08,07 --> 03:11:09,69
我有点头痛 瑞德

03:11:09,74 --> 03:11:12,15
你自己去吧替我向梅兰妮道歉

03:11:14,16 --> 03:11:16,66
你真是一个怯懦的胆小鬼

03:11:17,16 --> 03:11:19,75
起来 你必须参加宴会得快点

03:11:20,16 --> 03:11:22,12
英蒂雅她真的 是的 英蒂雅是说了

03:11:22,16 --> 03:11:24,12
城里的男人女人都已经知道了

03:11:24,17 --> 03:11:25,63
应该杀了他们 散岩パ晕矣懈龉制⑵

03:11:25,67 --> 03:11:28,42
从不杀说实话的人

03:11:28,46 --> 03:11:29,80
现在没时间争论 起来

03:11:29,84 --> 03:11:33,01
我不去 我不能去是她把误会澄清了

03:11:33,05 --> 03:11:35,72
你难道是怕梅妮小姐

03:11:35,76 --> 03:11:37,22
当着众人的面对你下逐客令吗?

03:11:37,26 --> 03:11:39,01
我没做错什么错事英蒂雅恨我

03:11:39,06 --> 03:11:41,02
我不能去 我应付不了

03:11:41,06 --> 03:11:44,52
你今天晚上不露面你这一辈子也别想在这个城市露面了

03:11:44,56 --> 03:11:47,52
这对我倒无所谓你不能毁了邦妮的前途

03:11:47,56 --> 03:11:50,86
今天为了她 你也应该参加这个宴会 快穿衣服

03:12:04,46 --> 03:12:07,83
穿这件 这种场合用不了穿得太朴素

03:12:08,34 --> 03:12:11,34
多擦一点烟脂象个赴宴的样子

03:12:18,64 --> 03:12:27,72
他是一个快乐的好人

03:12:27,75 --> 03:12:34,77
每个人都不能否认

03:12:34,80 --> 03:12:36,36
他是一个快乐的好人

03:12:38,07 --> 03:12:40,62
再见 斯卡莉-瑞德 你不能

03:12:40,66 --> 03:12:43,83
你一个人进去吧饥饿的狮子正在等着你呢

03:12:43,87 --> 03:12:45,50
瑞德 别离开我 别

03:12:45,54 --> 03:12:46,83
不用

03:12:46,87 --> 03:12:49,13
每个人都不能否认

03:12:49,17 --> 03:12:53,71
他是一个快乐的好人

03:12:53,76 --> 03:12:59,05
他是一个快乐的好人

03:13:13,57 --> 03:13:15,57
斯卡莉 亲爱的这件衣服可真漂亮

03:13:15,94 --> 03:13:17,96
今天晚上英蒂雅不能来

03:13:17,99 --> 03:13:18,91
你帮帮我吧

03:13:18,95 --> 03:13:22,42
我真需要你帮我招待客人

03:13:25,25 --> 03:13:26,66
米格太太

03:13:26,96 --> 03:13:28,54
我们的斯卡莉来了

03:13:30,67 --> 03:13:32,84
晚上好

03:13:33,17 --> 03:13:34,17
晚上好斯卡莉

03:13:34,24 --> 03:13:37,84
晚上好巴特勒太太

03:13:38,55 --> 03:13:41,76
艾希礼 给我们的斯卡莉倒杯酒来 好吗?

03:13:49,65 --> 03:13:52,61
你在梅妮小姐的宴会上玩得高兴吗? 孩子

03:13:52,65 --> 03:13:53,73
高兴

03:13:53,77 --> 03:13:55,73
哦 妈眯 千万记住

03:13:55,78 --> 03:13:58,86
巴特勒船长回来就说我睡了

03:13:59,15 --> 03:14:00,16
好吧

03:14:29,56 --> 03:14:30,94
请进来 巴特勒太太

03:14:40,45 --> 03:14:41,57
到这儿来

03:14:57,46 --> 03:14:58,46
坐下

03:15:01,17 --> 03:15:04,93
你要喝睡前酒我在这儿也不妨碍你

03:15:04,97 --> 03:15:07,10
我并不想喝酒我听到要声音才

03:15:07,14 --> 03:15:08,97
你什么也没听见

03:15:09,47 --> 03:15:12,31
你要是知道我在这儿你就不会下来了

03:15:12,35 --> 03:15:14,61
你现在很想喝酒我不想喝

03:15:14,65 --> 03:15:17,52
拿着 别装腔作势了

03:15:17,57 --> 03:15:20,57
我知道你偷偷喝酒 我也知道你的酒量

03:15:21,07 --> 03:15:23,36
你以为我在乎你喝白兰地吗?

03:15:30,45 --> 03:15:31,83
你喝醉了 我要去睡了

03:15:31,87 --> 03:15:33,37
我是醉了

03:15:33,67 --> 03:15:36,96
可是我今天夜里还要喝得更醉

03:15:37,67 --> 03:15:40,34
你别去睡觉还早呢

03:15:41,67 --> 03:15:42,76
坐下

03:15:45,97 --> 03:15:47,97
她帮了你你有什么感想?

03:15:49,14 --> 03:15:52,77
你对她做了亏心事而她为你遮掩

03:15:54,44 --> 03:15:57,15
你在想她是不是知道你和艾希礼的事

03:15:57,65 --> 03:16:00,28
你以为她这么做是为了保全自己的面子?

03:16:00,86 --> 03:16:04,53
你认为她为你遮掩这样做 是个十足的傻瓜

03:16:04,57 --> 03:16:06,74
我不想听你要听

03:16:07,87 --> 03:16:10,24
梅妮小姐可不是你想象的那样

03:16:11,16 --> 03:16:14,33
因为她心的太高尚了

03:16:14,37 --> 03:16:15,96
她不往坏处想她所爱的任何人

03:16:16,88 --> 03:16:18,17
她是那样的爱你

03:16:18,96 --> 03:16:21,76
我真弄不明白她为什么要爱你

03:16:22,97 --> 03:16:26,26
你要不是喝醉了还侮辱我我会解释的

03:16:26,64 --> 03:16:29,55
虽然 如果你再从这椅子上站起来

03:16:33,98 --> 03:16:38,56
当然这其中最可笑的人物

03:16:39,65 --> 03:16:42,73
卫尔克斯先生在精神上不能忠于他妻子

03:16:42,78 --> 03:16:45,24
而表面上又不愿意不忠于她

03:16:46,95 --> 03:16:48,82
他怎么就拿不定主意呢?

03:16:48,87 --> 03:16:49,87
瑞德 你

03:16:53,37 --> 03:16:55,75
看我的手 亲爱的

03:16:56,75 --> 03:16:59,17
我可以把你撕裂成碎片

03:16:59,84 --> 03:17:03,34
要是能把卫艾希礼从你头脑里永远除去就好了

03:17:04,46 --> 03:17:06,05
可他不行

03:17:06,84 --> 03:17:10,64
所以要这样把他从你脑子里除去

03:17:11,85 --> 03:17:13,97
我要用两只手

03:17:14,77 --> 03:17:16,94
夹着你的头

03:17:17,94 --> 03:17:21,94
把你的头像夹核桃一样夹碎

03:17:22,77 --> 03:17:25,07
把他挤出去

03:17:26,36 --> 03:17:29,07
快把手拿开 你这醉鬼

03:17:34,24 --> 03:17:37,54
我一直佩服你这种精神亲爱的

03:17:38,46 --> 03:17:40,75
特别是你在陷入绝境的时候

03:17:41,96 --> 03:17:43,17
我没有陷入绝境

03:17:43,46 --> 03:17:46,21
永远不会 别想吓唬我

03:17:46,26 --> 03:17:49,47
你长期过着下流的生活你什么也不懂

03:17:49,84 --> 03:17:53,56
就知道嫉妒晚安

03:17:56,14 --> 03:17:57,60
我嫉妒? 是吗

03:17:57,64 --> 03:17:59,14
对 也许是

03:18:00,06 --> 03:18:03,07
我知道你还没有做出对不起我的事

03:18:03,65 --> 03:18:05,03
因为我了解

03:18:05,07 --> 03:18:08,15
艾希礼・卫尔克斯和他那高尚的借口

03:18:08,86 --> 03:18:09,86
他是正人君子

03:18:10,57 --> 03:18:13,16
而这一点比你我都强

03:18:14,16 --> 03:18:17,75
我们不是 而且你名声不好对吗?

03:18:27,34 --> 03:18:29,47
没那么容易的 斯卡莉

03:18:33,85 --> 03:18:35,81
你把我赶出处去见艾希礼・卫尔克斯

03:18:35,85 --> 03:18:37,72
你梦想着他

03:18:37,77 --> 03:18:39,94
今天晚上你敢不跟我

03:19:08,46 --> 03:19:10,63
今天早上觉得好点吗 妈眯?

03:19:10,67 --> 03:19:14,55
我的后背还有点痛

03:19:17,47 --> 03:19:20,10
你今天早上显得挺高兴小姐

03:19:20,14 --> 03:19:21,64
是的 妈眯是的

03:19:28,78 --> 03:19:33,57
当他对她微笑她喜极而泣

03:19:34,07 --> 03:19:38,66
看到他皱眉就害怕得发抖

03:19:55,55 --> 03:19:56,55
你好 我

03:19:59,47 --> 03:20:03,23
我要为我昨天晚上的行为向你歉

03:20:03,27 --> 03:20:04,56
哦 可是瑞德

03:20:05,06 --> 03:20:06,23
我当时喝醉了

03:20:06,27 --> 03:20:09,57
而你又是那么的迷人 所以我有点儿情不自禁 难以控制

03:20:11,86 --> 03:20:15,36
你不必向我道歉你做什么事我都不会觉得吃惊的

03:20:16,07 --> 03:20:18,91
斯卡莉 我一直在考虑如果我们都承认

03:20:18,95 --> 03:20:20,49
我们错了

03:20:20,54 --> 03:20:23,41
还是离婚吧 我相信这对我们俩个人都好

03:20:23,46 --> 03:20:24,75
离婚? 对

03:20:25,25 --> 03:20:27,92
没有必要把俩个人栓在一起

03:20:27,96 --> 03:20:30,50
我保证你过富裕的生活你可以提出要求

03:20:30,55 --> 03:20:33,42
只要邦妮归我你要什么我都同意

03:20:33,47 --> 03:20:34,42
谢谢你了

03:20:34,47 --> 03:20:37,55
离婚这种败坏门风的事 我可不干

03:20:38,26 --> 03:20:40,81
如果艾希礼是自由的

03:20:40,85 --> 03:20:43,85
你真是巴不得越早离婚越好呢

03:20:44,94 --> 03:20:46,35
离不离 斯卡莉?

03:20:47,77 --> 03:20:49,11
快回答我

03:20:49,15 --> 03:20:50,23
离不离?

03:20:50,27 --> 03:20:52,44
请你走吧 让我清静一会儿

03:20:53,94 --> 03:20:56,36
我是要走我就是来告诉你的

03:20:57,36 --> 03:21:00,74
我要作一段长时间的旅行 去伦敦 今天就走

03:21:02,04 --> 03:21:03,83
我要带邦妮去

03:21:03,87 --> 03:21:06,33
请她马上把她的衣服收拾好

03:21:06,37 --> 03:21:08,54
你别想把我的孩子带走

03:21:08,96 --> 03:21:10,92
她也是我的孩子

03:21:10,96 --> 03:21:13,13
你以为我会把她留在一个

03:21:13,17 --> 03:21:15,80
毫不顾惜自己名誉的母亲身边 那样的话你就错了

03:21:15,84 --> 03:21:17,26
你多会说呀

03:21:17,84 --> 03:21:19,30
你以为我会让你把孩子带到

03:21:19,34 --> 03:21:23,02
像贝儿那种人那儿去吗? 绝不可能

03:21:23,06 --> 03:21:25,48
你要是个男人我会扭断你的颈子

03:21:25,85 --> 03:21:28,02
谢谢你别再说那种话了

03:21:28,06 --> 03:21:31,02
你倒摆出一副做母亲的神气来了

03:21:31,06 --> 03:21:33,32
一只猫做母亲都会比你强

03:21:33,36 --> 03:21:36,32
一小时之内给她准备好行装 我警告你

03:21:36,36 --> 03:21:40,24
我常常想用马鞭子抽你一顿

03:21:45,66 --> 03:21:46,96
对不起 瑞德先生

03:21:48,04 --> 03:21:49,12
您好 瑞德叔叔

03:21:49,17 --> 03:21:50,63
啊你好  爸爸

03:21:50,67 --> 03:21:51,96
爸爸

03:21:52,34 --> 03:21:55,67
你到哪儿去了? 我等你一早晨我打兔子去了

03:21:55,96 --> 03:21:59,64
用它的皮把小邦妮裹起来

03:21:59,68 --> 03:22:01,55
来 亲我一下

03:22:04,97 --> 03:22:08,06
邦妮 我要带你去漫游仙境 去旅行

03:22:09,06 --> 03:22:10,35
去哪儿? 去哪儿?

03:22:10,77 --> 03:22:14,36
我带你看伦敦塔小王子们呆的地方

03:22:14,78 --> 03:22:16,07
还有伦敦桥

03:22:16,74 --> 03:22:18,20
伦敦桥?

03:22:18,24 --> 03:22:20,07
它不会塌下来吗?

03:22:21,57 --> 03:22:23,87
你想要它塌 它就塌

03:22:26,37 --> 03:22:28,46
爸爸 黑

03:22:29,87 --> 03:22:31,50
黑

03:22:31,54 --> 03:22:32,54
爸爸 好黑

03:22:34,54 --> 03:22:37,42
邦妮  邦妮  邦妮别怕 邦妮谁把灯熄灭了? 保姆  保姆

03:22:37,46 --> 03:22:38,84
爸爸 好黑

03:22:40,18 --> 03:22:41,22
爸爸 好黑

03:22:41,26 --> 03:22:42,97
啊 啊 我的小邦妮怎么了?

03:22:43,55 --> 03:22:45,43
嗯 怎么啦  根爸爸说

03:22:45,47 --> 03:22:46,77
一只熊

03:22:47,27 --> 03:22:49,56
哦 一只熊? 是只大熊吗?

03:22:49,98 --> 03:22:52,90
大极了 坐在我的胸口上哦 好了 好了

03:22:52,94 --> 03:22:56,28
我在这儿 它再来 我就打死它

03:23:11,46 --> 03:23:13,17
晚上好 巴特勒先生

03:23:16,34 --> 03:23:19,13
我告诉过你 不要把她一个人呆在黑屋子里

03:23:19,17 --> 03:23:23,14
对不起 先生 孩子们常常怕黑 不过会习惯的

03:23:23,18 --> 03:23:24,93
让她夜里喊一 两次

03:23:24,97 --> 03:23:28,93
让她喊? 你如果不是傻瓜就是个没有人性的人

03:23:28,97 --> 03:23:31,60
如果你想让她长大了成为一个胆小鬼

03:23:31,64 --> 03:23:32,81
胆小鬼

03:23:32,85 --> 03:23:36,27
她身上没有一根胆小的骨头  你被解雇了

03:23:37,15 --> 03:23:38,28
随你便吧 先生

03:23:55,38 --> 03:23:56,84
妈妈在哪儿呢?

03:24:03,34 --> 03:24:05,47
跟我在伦敦不快乐吗?

03:24:06,14 --> 03:24:08,64
我要回家

03:24:20,86 --> 03:24:22,24
邦妮小姐

03:24:22,57 --> 03:24:24,36
是巴特勒船长

03:24:24,74 --> 03:24:26,57
斯卡莉小姐你好  妈眯

03:24:26,87 --> 03:24:28,08
乖宝贝

03:24:29,45 --> 03:24:32,41
妈妈 斯卡莉小姐他们回来了

03:24:32,45 --> 03:24:33,46
邦妮

03:24:34,54 --> 03:24:36,46
邦妮 邦妮宝贝

03:24:36,88 --> 03:24:38,13
乖宝贝

03:24:38,17 --> 03:24:39,63
回家高兴吗?

03:24:39,67 --> 03:24:41,21
爸爸给了我只小猫

03:24:41,26 --> 03:24:44,55
小猫迷 好可爱的-伦敦挺可怕的

03:24:45,05 --> 03:24:47,51
乖宝贝-我的小马呢?

03:24:47,55 --> 03:24:50,76
小马在呢-我的小马呢? 我要去看我的小马

03:25:00,27 --> 03:25:01,36
我的小马呢?

03:25:02,86 --> 03:25:04,65
我要去看我的小马

03:25:05,36 --> 03:25:07,11
跟妈眯去吧

03:25:07,16 --> 03:25:08,70
来吧 乖宝贝跟妈眯去

03:25:08,74 --> 03:25:10,74
妈眯可想你啦 宝贝

03:25:12,87 --> 03:25:14,37
巴特勒太太

03:25:15,37 --> 03:25:16,87
妈眯说你回来了

03:25:18,38 --> 03:25:19,92
我来送邦妮

03:25:19,96 --> 03:25:23,34
对孩子来说一个坏妈妈也比没有妈妈好

03:25:24,17 --> 03:25:25,97
这么说你还要走?

03:25:26,26 --> 03:25:27,84
你猜得真准 巴特勒太太

03:25:28,26 --> 03:25:29,43
这就走

03:25:29,47 --> 03:25:31,47
我的行李都放在车站了

03:25:33,64 --> 03:25:36,48
你的脸色很苍白是不是没有胭脂擦了?

03:25:36,94 --> 03:25:39,35
还是因为心里我想的才会这样?

03:25:40,27 --> 03:25:41,90
这都怨你

03:25:41,94 --> 03:25:44,36
不是因为想你而是因为

03:25:48,66 --> 03:25:50,24
接着说下去

03:25:51,45 --> 03:25:53,66
是因为我怀孕了

03:25:59,75 --> 03:26:00,75
真的?

03:26:01,25 --> 03:26:02,96
谁是那辛运的父亲?

03:26:03,75 --> 03:26:05,05
你知那是你的

03:26:05,34 --> 03:26:07,22
我跟本不想要孩子

03:26:07,26 --> 03:26:09,43
没有那个女人愿意跟你这样的无赖生孩子

03:26:09,47 --> 03:26:12,14
我倒希望不要是你的

03:26:14,14 --> 03:26:16,48
高兴点 说不定会小产

03:26:31,07 --> 03:26:32,24
她好点儿了吗?

03:26:36,87 --> 03:26:38,33
哈太太 她问起我了吗?

03:26:38,37 --> 03:26:40,37
难道你不明白她在说胡话

03:26:41,96 --> 03:26:43,75
瑞德

03:26:44,96 --> 03:26:46,67
我要瑞德

03:26:50,97 --> 03:26:54,30
怎么啦 宝贝? 你叫谁呢 孩子?

03:26:54,35 --> 03:26:55,85
没有用

03:26:57,06 --> 03:26:58,48
没用

03:27:20,46 --> 03:27:21,67
米格大夫走了

03:27:23,04 --> 03:27:24,42
斯卡莉死了?

03:27:24,46 --> 03:27:26,17
喔 不 她好多了

03:27:26,75 --> 03:27:27,84
真的好多了

03:27:44,86 --> 03:27:47,44
好了 巴特勒船长你已经急昏了头啦

03:27:48,07 --> 03:27:50,32
她很快就会好起来我保证

03:27:50,36 --> 03:27:53,41
不 不 你不知道她并不想要这孩子

03:27:53,45 --> 03:27:56,03
不想要孩子? 女人都想要孩子

03:27:56,07 --> 03:27:58,87
是 你想要孩子 可她不要不想要我的孩子

03:27:59,37 --> 03:28:01,50
她说她不再要孩子了

03:28:01,54 --> 03:28:03,62
我是要伤害她 因为她伤害我

03:28:03,67 --> 03:28:05,00
而且我这样做了

03:28:05,04 --> 03:28:08,21
别说了你不该跟我说这些事这不合适

03:28:08,25 --> 03:28:11,13
直到那天她摔下来我才知道她怀孕了

03:28:11,17 --> 03:28:14,22
如果我知道我会立刻回来不管她要不要我回来

03:28:14,26 --> 03:28:15,93
你当然会回来

03:28:15,97 --> 03:28:19,26
可是那一天 她在楼梯上告诉我

03:28:19,85 --> 03:28:22,73
我说了什么? 我大叫着对她说

03:28:22,77 --> 03:28:25,27
可是我知道你不是有意的

03:28:26,15 --> 03:28:28,57
我是有意的我嫉妒得发狂

03:28:28,94 --> 03:28:32,57
她从没爱过我 我本以为她能 可是不行

03:28:34,57 --> 03:28:35,74
你想错了

03:28:36,16 --> 03:28:39,45
斯卡莉非常爱你只是她自己没意识到

03:28:41,16 --> 03:28:43,12
如果是这样 我可以等

03:28:43,16 --> 03:28:45,42
如果她能原谅我忘掉这一切

03:28:45,46 --> 03:28:46,38
她会的

03:28:46,88 --> 03:28:48,46
你要有耐心

03:28:50,84 --> 03:28:52,26
不 这是不可能的

03:28:52,67 --> 03:28:55,68
你不明白 假如你知道她真正爱的是

03:28:56,76 --> 03:28:58,35
你不会相信的

03:29:01,64 --> 03:29:04,23
你千万不要听信那些流言飞语

03:29:04,27 --> 03:29:06,77
我反正不相信

03:29:08,86 --> 03:29:13,28
好了 好了 斯卡莉会好起来的孩子还会再有的

03:29:13,57 --> 03:29:17,32
不 她不会的 即使她想要经过这一次她也不会

03:29:17,36 --> 03:29:19,37
她当然会要的

03:29:19,87 --> 03:29:21,24
我也要有了

03:29:24,16 --> 03:29:27,37
不 不 梅妮小姐你可别冒这个险太危险了

03:29:27,87 --> 03:29:30,46
孩子使生活焕然一新巴特勒船长

03:29:30,96 --> 03:29:34,46
如果能有这样的生活那危险就不重要了

03:29:37,68 --> 03:29:40,35
我以前从未见过一位真正勇敢的人

03:29:41,47 --> 03:29:43,97
我祈求上帝保佑你梅妮小姐

03:29:44,56 --> 03:29:48,06
我要感谢你为我和斯卡莉所做的一切

03:29:49,56 --> 03:29:51,27
我从心里感激你

03:29:58,36 --> 03:30:00,95
斯卡莉小姐觉得今天好多了瑞德先生

03:30:01,66 --> 03:30:02,87
谢谢

03:30:10,38 --> 03:30:12,34
斯卡莉 我来求你原谅的

03:30:12,67 --> 03:30:15,63
希望能再给我们的共同生活一次机会

03:30:15,67 --> 03:30:16,84
共同生活?

03:30:17,34 --> 03:30:19,47
我们什么时候有过?

03:30:20,76 --> 03:30:21,97
说得对

03:30:22,85 --> 03:30:26,35
如果我们能再试一次的话 我们会辛福的

03:30:27,06 --> 03:30:29,35
还有什么能让我们辛福的呢?

03:30:30,27 --> 03:30:32,44
还有 还有邦妮

03:30:33,44 --> 03:30:35,07
而且我爱你 斯卡莉

03:30:35,78 --> 03:30:37,53
你什么时候发现的?

03:30:37,57 --> 03:30:40,95
我一直爱你可你从没给我机会来证明

03:30:42,66 --> 03:30:45,16
那好 你想让我干什么?

03:30:46,95 --> 03:30:49,16
首先 别管那个木材厂了

03:30:49,96 --> 03:30:51,12
我们离开这儿

03:30:51,17 --> 03:30:53,34
我们带着邦妮再渡一次蜜月

03:30:53,38 --> 03:30:56,21
放弃它? 可它比任何时候都赚钱啦

03:30:56,26 --> 03:30:58,22
我知道 可我们不需要它

03:30:58,26 --> 03:31:00,76
卖掉吧  或者干脆送给艾希礼

03:31:01,47 --> 03:31:03,22
梅兰妮一直对我们这么好

03:31:03,26 --> 03:31:05,93
梅兰妮 总是梅兰妮如果你能多我为想

03:31:05,97 --> 03:31:07,35
我是想着你

03:31:08,48 --> 03:31:10,27
我想

03:31:10,56 --> 03:31:13,77
或许是那个木材厂

03:31:14,15 --> 03:31:15,52
使你跟我和邦妮疏远了

03:31:15,57 --> 03:31:18,40
我知道你想的是什么 别把邦妮扯进来

03:31:18,44 --> 03:31:20,11
是你使邦妮跟我疏远了

03:31:20,15 --> 03:31:21,32
可她是爱你的

03:31:21,36 --> 03:31:23,82
你想方设法让她爱你而不爱我

03:31:23,87 --> 03:31:25,20
看你把她给惯的

03:31:25,24 --> 03:31:26,58
妈妈 爸爸

03:31:26,95 --> 03:31:27,95
看着我

03:31:28,54 --> 03:31:29,54
我们看着呢  宝贝

03:31:30,37 --> 03:31:32,33
你真漂亮 宝贝

03:31:32,37 --> 03:31:33,67
你也漂亮

03:31:34,04 --> 03:31:36,67
我要跳了看着我呀 爸爸

03:31:37,46 --> 03:31:40,13
听着 亲爱的邦妮你不要总是跳栏

03:31:40,17 --> 03:31:42,63
别忘了你刚刚学会的侧骑

03:31:42,68 --> 03:31:44,01
我要这么跳

03:31:44,05 --> 03:31:46,56
我能跳得比以前更好因为我长大了

03:31:46,97 --> 03:31:48,60
我要把栏杆升高一点

03:31:48,64 --> 03:31:50,06
别让她跳 瑞德

03:31:50,56 --> 03:31:54,56
不 邦妮 别跳你要是摔下来可别哭找我

03:31:55,65 --> 03:31:57,07
瑞德 别让她跳

03:31:59,07 --> 03:32:00,28
邦妮

03:32:01,07 --> 03:32:02,07
邦妮

03:32:03,36 --> 03:32:04,57
就像爸爸

03:32:08,37 --> 03:32:09,45
爸爸

03:32:11,16 --> 03:32:12,16
邦妮

03:32:20,76 --> 03:32:21,76
邦妮

03:32:22,55 --> 03:32:23,47
邦妮

03:32:40,37 --> 03:32:43,37
梅妮小姐 你来了太好了

03:32:45,96 --> 03:32:48,83
喔 妈眯 没有了邦妮家里可真不一样了

03:32:48,88 --> 03:32:50,54
斯卡莉怎么受得了啊?

03:32:50,88 --> 03:32:53,67
梅妮小姐她伤心极了

03:32:54,46 --> 03:32:57,01
可我请你来不是为了她

03:32:57,05 --> 03:33:01,05
主给了她力量使她挺住了

03:33:02,76 --> 03:33:04,77
我担心的是瑞德先生

03:33:08,56 --> 03:33:11,11
这两天 他都快疯了

03:33:11,15 --> 03:33:12,65
不 妈眯 不会的

03:33:13,07 --> 03:33:17,07
我从没要见过一个男人会这么爱孩子

03:33:17,86 --> 03:33:19,95
米格大夫说她脖子断了

03:33:20,37 --> 03:33:23,95
瑞德先生抓起手枪就去把小马打死了

03:33:24,95 --> 03:33:28,00
当时 我真怕他把自己打死

03:33:28,04 --> 03:33:29,83
可怜的巴特勒船长

03:33:29,87 --> 03:33:34,67
是啊斯卡莉小姐说他是凶手教孩子跳栏

03:33:35,17 --> 03:33:37,55
她说 你还我孩子是你杀了她

03:33:37,97 --> 03:33:41,76
他说斯卡莉小姐从来没这么关心过邦妮

03:33:42,26 --> 03:33:46,27
他们就这样吵来吵去我的血都凉了

03:33:46,77 --> 03:33:48,85
喔 妈眯 别再说了

03:33:52,06 --> 03:33:53,86
那天晚上

03:33:54,86 --> 03:33:58,24
瑞德先生把自己锁在保育室里配着邦妮

03:33:59,45 --> 03:34:01,03
斯卡莉小姐来敲门

03:34:01,07 --> 03:34:03,33
他理也不理

03:34:03,37 --> 03:34:05,70
就这样已经整整两天了

03:34:05,74 --> 03:34:06,87
妈眯

03:34:08,25 --> 03:34:11,37
今天晚上 斯卡莉小姐隔着门对他说

03:34:11,67 --> 03:34:13,92
明天早上就要下葬了

03:34:13,96 --> 03:34:16,76
可是他说  你要是敢来我就把你杀了

03:34:17,05 --> 03:34:19,67
你想我能把我的孩子

03:34:20,05 --> 03:34:21,97
放进坟墓吗? 她最怕黑了

03:34:22,47 --> 03:34:25,22
妈眯 妈眯 他真是疯了

03:34:25,26 --> 03:34:28,93
是啊真是这样他不让孩子下葬

03:34:28,98 --> 03:34:30,64
劝劝他吧

03:34:31,06 --> 03:34:32,73
可我不好管

03:34:32,77 --> 03:34:34,77
你不能管 谁能管呢?

03:34:35,07 --> 03:34:37,65
瑞德先生最尊重你的意见

03:34:40,15 --> 03:34:41,36
求求你了 梅妮小姐

03:34:43,57 --> 03:34:45,45
我尽力去做吧

03:34:52,17 --> 03:34:54,25
走开 让我们安静地待着

03:34:54,67 --> 03:34:56,34
我是卫尔克斯太太巴特勒船长

03:34:56,67 --> 03:34:58,30
请让我进来

03:34:58,34 --> 03:34:59,97
我看邦妮来了

03:35:21,36 --> 03:35:22,36
哦 主啊

03:35:23,15 --> 03:35:25,66
瑞德先生这么伤心 请帮助他吧

03:35:38,17 --> 03:35:41,17
妈眯 你去烧点儿浓咖啡来

03:35:41,46 --> 03:35:44,97
给巴特勒船长送去 我去看斯卡莉小姐

03:35:45,47 --> 03:35:46,34
哦 可是

03:35:46,85 --> 03:35:50,22
巴特勒船长同意举行葬礼了

03:35:50,27 --> 03:35:51,43
明天早晨

03:35:51,47 --> 03:35:56,27
阿利路亚 我知道天使会帮助你的 阿利路亚

03:35:57,56 --> 03:35:59,15
梅妮小姐梅妮小姐

03:36:00,07 --> 03:36:01,03
梅妮小姐

03:36:01,07 --> 03:36:02,65
梅妮小姐 梅妮小姐

03:36:04,36 --> 03:36:06,36
去请米格大夫

03:36:07,07 --> 03:36:08,33
来

03:36:08,37 --> 03:36:10,08
送我回家

03:36:11,75 --> 03:36:13,37
梅妮小姐 梅妮小姐

03:36:21,17 --> 03:36:23,72
好啦我妈妈要到哪儿去呀?

03:36:23,76 --> 03:36:26,68
为什么我不能跟着去呀?

03:36:27,26 --> 03:36:30,56
有很多事情 不是想干就干的

03:36:32,27 --> 03:36:34,06
我们去睡觉了 孩子

03:36:35,06 --> 03:36:38,27
瑞德 她不能死她不能死

03:36:39,06 --> 03:36:40,40
她和你不一样

03:36:40,44 --> 03:36:43,78
她没有那种力量只有一颗善良的心

03:36:44,28 --> 03:36:45,70
你也了解她?

03:36:45,74 --> 03:36:48,57
我为什么要去睡觉? 现在是早晨

03:36:49,37 --> 03:36:51,37
好那 还不到早晨呢

03:36:57,54 --> 03:36:59,33
你可以进去了 斯卡莉小姐

03:36:59,38 --> 03:37:00,84
米格大夫 请让我去看看她吧

03:37:00,88 --> 03:37:04,46
我等了整整两天了 我想告诉她

03:37:04,97 --> 03:37:06,63
有件事是我错了 她知道你知错了

03:37:06,68 --> 03:37:09,26
她要见斯卡莉

03:37:13,27 --> 03:37:15,23
要让梅妮小姐平静地死去

03:37:15,27 --> 03:37:17,60
希望你别跟她说些不相干的话

03:37:17,64 --> 03:37:20,06
来减轻你良心的负担明白了吗?

03:37:35,16 --> 03:37:36,25
是我 梅妮

03:37:38,16 --> 03:37:39,25
答应我吗?

03:37:40,38 --> 03:37:41,38

03:37:42,67 --> 03:37:44,34
照看我的小儿子

03:37:45,76 --> 03:37:48,05
我曾把他托付给过你

03:37:49,18 --> 03:37:50,68
记得吗?

03:37:51,47 --> 03:37:52,85
他出生的那天

03:37:53,47 --> 03:37:56,77
梅妮 别这么说 我知道你会好起来的

03:37:57,56 --> 03:37:58,56
答应我

03:37:59,48 --> 03:38:00,60

03:38:05,94 --> 03:38:07,28

03:38:07,65 --> 03:38:08,57
艾希礼

03:38:10,66 --> 03:38:11,87
艾希礼和你

03:38:14,45 --> 03:38:17,25
关于 艾希礼 ?

03:38:18,75 --> 03:38:20,96
替我照顾艾希礼

03:38:21,67 --> 03:38:22,96
就像你

03:38:24,38 --> 03:38:25,96
替他照顾我 一样

03:38:29,97 --> 03:38:30,97
我会的

03:38:32,68 --> 03:38:34,93
照顾他

03:38:34,97 --> 03:38:37,97
可 别让他知道

03:38:48,07 --> 03:38:49,07
晚安

03:38:50,95 --> 03:38:51,95
答应啦

03:38:53,66 --> 03:38:54,87
还有什么 梅妮?

03:38:56,08 --> 03:38:57,87
巴特勒船长

03:38:59,25 --> 03:39:00,75
要对他好一点

03:39:01,46 --> 03:39:02,46
瑞德?

03:39:03,25 --> 03:39:04,96
他是那么爱你

03:39:09,05 --> 03:39:10,17
是的 梅妮

03:39:13,34 --> 03:39:14,47
再见

03:39:16,05 --> 03:39:17,06
再见了

03:39:33,24 --> 03:39:34,86
女士们 可以进去了

03:39:37,88 --> 03:39:38,79
艾希礼

03:39:40,87 --> 03:39:42,16
艾希礼

03:39:43,04 --> 03:39:45,67
我不知道那一只在哪儿?

03:39:46,54 --> 03:39:48,17
她一定把它放在哪儿了

03:39:49,34 --> 03:39:50,76
别这样

03:39:51,34 --> 03:39:52,47
搂住我

03:39:52,84 --> 03:39:54,47
我害怕

03:39:56,26 --> 03:39:57,76
我害怕极了

03:40:02,85 --> 03:40:06,35
斯卡莉 我怎么办呢? 没有她我怎么活呢?

03:40:08,06 --> 03:40:09,44
我所有的一切

03:40:09,94 --> 03:40:11,44
都跟着她去了

03:40:12,65 --> 03:40:13,95
艾希礼

03:40:15,45 --> 03:40:17,37
你真的很爱她 是不是?

03:40:18,16 --> 03:40:22,87
她是我在现实面前唯一没有破灭的梦

03:40:23,75 --> 03:40:26,75
梦 你总是在梦想从没清醒过

03:40:27,04 --> 03:40:29,54
哦 斯卡莉 你不知道我经受的痛苦

03:40:31,17 --> 03:40:34,97
你早就该告诉我 你爱的是她 而不是我

03:40:35,34 --> 03:40:38,30
你不该用那些借口使我存在幻想

03:40:38,35 --> 03:40:41,56
现在梅妮要死了

03:40:42,47 --> 03:40:45,48
才让我明白 我对你没有一点意义

03:40:45,98 --> 03:40:48,06
就像贝尔对瑞德一样

03:40:50,44 --> 03:40:52,28
我所爱的实际是

03:40:53,15 --> 03:40:55,07
是不存在的

03:40:57,74 --> 03:40:58,95
不过

03:41:00,37 --> 03:41:01,66
我不在乎

03:41:03,16 --> 03:41:04,87
这没关紧

03:41:07,04 --> 03:41:08,67
一点儿没关系

03:41:13,76 --> 03:41:15,26
哦 艾希礼 艾希礼原谅我

03:41:15,97 --> 03:41:18,97
别哭了 不能让她看出你哭过

03:41:19,47 --> 03:41:20,55
艾希礼

03:41:24,14 --> 03:41:25,48
梅妮

03:41:27,27 --> 03:41:28,65
梅妮

03:41:33,07 --> 03:41:35,07
瑞德

03:41:38,57 --> 03:41:39,86
瑞德 你在哪儿?

03:41:44,37 --> 03:41:45,87
瑞德 等等我

03:41:50,88 --> 03:41:52,38
瑞德 等等我

03:42:19,65 --> 03:42:20,86
瑞德

03:42:24,08 --> 03:42:25,16
进来

03:42:33,17 --> 03:42:34,17
瑞德

03:42:34,88 --> 03:42:36,46
梅兰妮 她

03:42:40,18 --> 03:42:41,34
上帝让她安息了

03:42:42,05 --> 03:42:44,97
她是我所见过的唯一完美的人

03:42:45,97 --> 03:42:47,27
伟大的女性

03:42:47,77 --> 03:42:48,98
非常伟大的女性

03:42:51,77 --> 03:42:55,15
可她死了 对你是件好事不是吗?

03:42:56,15 --> 03:42:59,86
你怎么能这么说呢? 你知道我是多么的爱她

03:43:01,24 --> 03:43:02,74
不 这我可不知道

03:43:03,24 --> 03:43:06,53
至少对你来说 你最后还应该感激她

03:43:06,58 --> 03:43:09,87
我当然感激她 她心里只想着别人

03:43:11,16 --> 03:43:12,96
最后还提到你

03:43:14,17 --> 03:43:15,38
她说什么了?

03:43:15,67 --> 03:43:16,75
她说

03:43:17,17 --> 03:43:19,76
要对巴特勒船长好一点他这么爱你

03:43:25,97 --> 03:43:27,10
她还说什么?

03:43:27,14 --> 03:43:28,64
她说

03:43:29,27 --> 03:43:31,64
她还要我照顾好艾希礼

03:43:34,06 --> 03:43:37,07
得到前妻的允准这样就方便多了

03:43:39,44 --> 03:43:40,65
你这是什么意思?

03:43:43,57 --> 03:43:44,74
你要干什么吗?

03:43:45,24 --> 03:43:46,74
我要走了 亲爱的

03:43:47,16 --> 03:43:50,75
你现在需要的就是离婚你对艾希礼的梦想就要变成现实了

03:43:54,17 --> 03:43:55,67
哦 不

03:43:56,38 --> 03:43:58,80
不 你错了 大错特错了

03:43:58,84 --> 03:44:02,13
不 我不要离婚瑞德 今天夜里

03:44:02,17 --> 03:44:04,72
我明白了我是爱你的我就跑回家来告诉你

03:44:04,76 --> 03:44:06,80
亲爱的

03:44:06,85 --> 03:44:08,43
别来这套了 好吗?

03:44:08,47 --> 03:44:12,10
给我们的结合留下最后一点可以回忆的尊严吧

03:44:12,14 --> 03:44:13,27
最后 ?

03:44:13,64 --> 03:44:15,40
瑞德听我说

03:44:15,44 --> 03:44:19,32
我肯定多年来我一直爱着你只是 我是这么愚蠢自己并没有意识到

03:44:19,36 --> 03:44:21,78
请相信我 你也爱我

03:44:22,28 --> 03:44:23,57
梅妮说过的

03:44:24,15 --> 03:44:26,66
我相信你可艾希礼怎么办?

03:44:27,87 --> 03:44:29,58
我 我从没真正爱过他

03:44:30,66 --> 03:44:33,87
你装得可真像一只到今天早晨

03:44:35,17 --> 03:44:37,38
不 我尽了 一切努力

03:44:37,88 --> 03:44:40,80
当我从伦敦回来的时候那怕你对我有半点表示

03:44:40,84 --> 03:44:44,63
我当时见了你多高兴啊真的可你那么气人

03:44:44,67 --> 03:44:47,47
我让你病了 那是我的错

03:44:47,97 --> 03:44:50,81
我盼那 盼着你要见我可你没有

03:44:50,85 --> 03:44:55,14
我是要你的 非常想要你可我以为你不要我了

03:44:56,56 --> 03:45:00,57
看来我们彼此误解了现在没用了

03:45:01,78 --> 03:45:04,86
如果邦妮还活着也许会使我们幸福

03:45:05,36 --> 03:45:07,20
我总爱把邦妮当作你

03:45:07,24 --> 03:45:10,74
没有经历战争和贫困之前的那个小姑娘

03:45:11,66 --> 03:45:16,16
她是那么像你所以我宠她 娇惯她就像娇惯你一样

03:45:18,25 --> 03:45:20,46
可她走了 带走了一切

03:45:20,75 --> 03:45:21,75
瑞德

03:45:22,34 --> 03:45:24,21
瑞德别说这些了

03:45:24,26 --> 03:45:26,97
我很抱歉抱歉我所做的一切

03:45:29,26 --> 03:45:30,85
你真是个孩子 亲爱的

03:45:31,76 --> 03:45:35,48
你以为说一声抱歉就能把过去都改过来吗?

03:45:38,44 --> 03:45:40,44
给你 我的手绢

03:45:41,06 --> 03:45:44,57
在你一身中任何危难时刻我从未见你带过手绢

03:45:50,45 --> 03:45:52,33
瑞德 瑞德 你要去哪儿?

03:45:52,37 --> 03:45:54,54
我要回查尔斯 我的家乡

03:45:54,58 --> 03:45:56,45
瑞德 请带我一起去吧

03:45:57,54 --> 03:46:00,04
不 这里的一切对我已经结束了

03:46:00,88 --> 03:46:02,63
我需要清静

03:46:02,67 --> 03:46:06,55
我要去寻找有什么地方

03:46:07,67 --> 03:46:11,18

03:46:12,05 --> 03:46:13,64

03:47:35,47 --> 03:47:39,47
土地对你毫无意义可是只有土地才是最重要的

03:47:39,85 --> 03:47:42,23
只是土地才是永恒的

03:47:42,27 --> 03:47:46,02
有一样东西你爱它胜过于我虽然你没有意识到那就是泰拉庄园

03:47:46,06 --> 03:47:49,44

03:47:49,78 --> 03:47:53,61
