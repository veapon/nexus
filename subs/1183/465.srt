1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,007
解散监管机构并非我们的初衷
We have no intention of dismantling the regulatory agencies.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,929
但实际上 我们整天被这些低效繁琐的规则所纠缠
However, we must come to grips with inefficient and burdensome regulations.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,724
我们要裁撤那些毫无效益非必要的部门
We will eliminate those that are unproductive and unnecessary.

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,020
取消那些过时的规章制度 授予银行全新的职权
Tearing down these antiquated walls and granting banks significant new authority.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,648
银行业迎来利好消息
In a victory for the banking industry,

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,608
国会通过了立法
Congress has approved legislation

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,902
准许商业银行和投资银行进行合并

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,365
形成史上最大的 业务覆盖全球的金融机构
to merge and form institutions of unprecedented size and global reach.

9
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:35,365
大而不倒

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:41,833
我认为我们没有必要为了防范管制风险而去增加管制
I think it's very important for us not to introduce regulation for regulation's sake.

11
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,918
我一直坚信着美国梦
I do believe in the American dream.

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,005
而拥有自己的房产则是梦开始的地方
Owning a home is a part of that dream.

13

We are taking action to bring many thousands of Americans closer to owning a home.

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,892
这项计划不仅有利于全体公民
This project not only is good for the soul of the country,

16
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,019
同时也能带动国家经济的发展
it's good for the pocketbook of the country as well.

17
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,440
房地产市场已经近乎疯狂
The housing market has reached frantic proportions.

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,484
大家似乎都在忙着盖房子 然后进行买卖
It seems that everybody is building, buying or selling.

19
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,404
道琼斯和标普指数双双创出新高

Hotshot traders and bankers can expect to take home 10, 25,

22
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,790
2500万 甚至是5000万
and in some cases, $50 million.

23
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,918
这一切好得近乎天方夜谭了
Things that are too good to be true, are.

24
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,837
当你看到其中的...
When you see something coming...

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,921
房地产业的泡沫...
The real estate bubble...

26
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:29,964
- 房地产泡沫  - 泡沫
- Housing bubble.  - Bubble.

27
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,758
切不可视而不见
don't put it off.

28
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,593
要立即采取行动
Take action immediately.

29
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,220
泡沫会逐渐缓解 还是只能等到破灭?
Will there be a soft landing, or will the bubble burst?

30

最新消息 次贷市场开始分崩离析

32
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,772
由于次贷危机的发生 今天上午的最新数字表明
This morning in the mortgage meltdown, new numbers showing

33
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,775
失去住所的美国人数又创新高
that a record number of Americans are losing their homes.

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,445
在过去几个月的时间里 美国有70多家从事次贷业务的公司纷纷倒闭
More than 70 mortgage companies have failed in the last few months in America,

35
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,866
而现在贝尔斯登 以及大银行等大型企业
and now the biggest of the big companies, the Bear Stearns, the big banks,

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,576
要开始承担这一后果了
are caught holding the bag.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,208
贝尔斯登 这家国内排名第五的投资银行
The fifth largest investment bank in the country, Bear Stearns,

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,836
以每股2美金的股价出售给了摩根大通银行
is being sold for just $2 a share to JPMorgan.

39
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,131
这宗交易是在政府的协助下进行的 目的是为了保全
It's being assisted by the government, which is stepping in to guarantee

40
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:16,761
贝尔斯登帐下的300亿美金的不良房地产资产
some $30 billion in Bear's toxic real estate assets.

41
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,976
你一定能想象得出来 Hank Paulson被布什总统任命为财政部长的时候
You've got to imagine that Hank Paulson didn't think he signed up for this

42
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,605
不会想到有一天会去签署这样一份文件
when President Bush picked him to become Treasury Secretary.

43
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,901
现在Hank Paulson可能不得不取消一些撤销管制的规定
Hank Paulson may now have to undo some of the deregulation measures

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,863
而这些措施恰恰是在他主管高盛集团时与华尔街上的同行们一直努力倡导的
that he and his peers on Wall Street pushed through when he ran Goldman.

45
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,827
Hank Paulson财长今天上午对Matt Lauer说
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson telling Matt Lauer this morning,

46
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,622
"我们已经克服了一切困难 我对我们的市场充满信心
"We're all over it. I've got great confidence in our markets.

47
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,290
它们是富有弹性和可塑性的"
They're resilient. They're flexible."

48
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,087
Ali 事实上贝尔斯登的收购事件只是掀开了冰山一角
Ali, the truth is that Bear Stearns is only a very small fraction of this story.

49
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,633
我们的经济很可能会大幅衰退
Our economy could face far worse than a recession.

50
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,806
受贝尔斯登倒闭的影响 雷曼兄弟忙于
In the wake of Bear's collapse, Lehman Brothers is scrambling

51
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:06,185
说服投资者相信 次贷危机不会对雷曼兄弟的资产造成太大影响
to reassure investors about the impact of the mortgage crisis on its own assets.

52
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,021
今天上午雷曼兄弟的保证人遭受了一系列的压力
Insurers of the firm under a great deal of pressure this morning.

53
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,858
Dick Fuld 在雷曼工作了39年
Dick Fuld, a 39-year veteran of Lehman

54
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,444
并且是华尔街上大型投资银行中任职最久的首席执行官
and the longest-running CEO of a major investment bank on Wall Street,

55
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,906
曾多次让公司在危机中起死回生
has pulled the firm back from the brink during other crises,

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,662
Richard Fuld 雷曼兄弟主席兼首席执行官

57
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,662
但是今天 我第一次听到了投资者们对他的领导能力的质疑声
but today, for the first time that I'm hearing it, investors are questioning his leadership.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,038
- 混蛋  - 投资者们
- Motherfucker.  - One key question

59
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,748
对雷曼兄弟最关注的一个问题就是
investors have for Lehman Brothers,

60
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,835
"这家投资银行的盈利能力到底如何?"
"What's the true earnings power of this investment bank's business?"

61
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,387
Joe Gregory 雷曼兄弟总裁兼首席运营官

62
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,387
- 嘿  - 赶紧到我这儿来
- Hey.  - Get up here.

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,306
我们得去搬救兵了
We gotta start stacking sand bags.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,599
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:49,770
我们的股价暴跌了21% 从市价上看 我个人就损失了9000万
We're down 21%. On paper, I just lost $90 million, personally.

66
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,691
随着投资者不断抛售雷曼兄弟的股票
With investors pummeling Lehman shares,

67
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,443
今天上午最大的一个疑问就是
the big question this morning is,

68
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,528
"Fuld还有何退路?"
"What options does Fuld have?"

69
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,947
截至目前 他还没能够筹措到新的投资
So far, he has failed to raise new capital

70
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,783
而事实上他的竞争对手们已经拿到了
while virtually all of his rivals have already done so.

71
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,783
财政部长 高盛前董事会主席兼首席执行官

72
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,330
现在 对冲基金经理David Einhorn已经在公开质疑公布数字的准确性了
And now, hedge fund manager David Einhorn is publicly questioning the accuracy of the fund numbers

73
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,497
有什么好消息吗?
Anything good?

74
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,002
这是一只红尾鹰 今年头回看到
It's a red-tailed hawk, first one this year.

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
Dick Fuld在1号线上等着
Dick Fuld's on one.

76
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,756
提供可信的答案
to provide credible answers.

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,591
让我们来一起分析一下这些 呃
So let's go through a couple of those, uh,

78
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,718
被你称为差异的东西 因为...
what you call discrepancies, because...

79
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,516
- 上午的日子不好过吧?  - 我们有高收益
- Tough morning?  - We show top-quality earnings,

80
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,852
- 粉碎了所有之前的预测  - 没错
- we beat every prediction.  - Yeah.

81
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,731
这是做空者的行为 你也知道他们的一贯伎俩 先做空 然后弯曲事实
It's the damn short-sellers. You know the game, short and distort.

82
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,858
他们善于散布谣言 然后从中大赚一笔
They're rumormongers and they're making a killing.

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,944
你对于筹集资金有什么计划?
What are your plans for a capital raise?

84
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,529
我们想的比你更远 让我把话再讲得明白些
We're way ahead of you. Now, let me be clear,

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,533
我们不需要现金
we don't need the cash.

86
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,037
这是一种直觉
You know, it's about perception.

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,747
快说巴菲特
Buffett, Buffett.

88
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,709
我们正在考虑同沃伦・巴菲特进行接洽
We're thinking of reaching out to Warren Buffett.

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,794
很好
Great.

90
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,214
你和巴菲特有过交情 对吧?
You and Buffett go back, right?

91
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,676
帮帮我 给他打个电话
Do me a favor and call him.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,344
告诉他雷曼兄弟有着很坚实的基础
Tell him Lehman is rock solid.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,139
作为财政部长 我不能鼓动他去进行某一项的投资
As Treasury Secretary, I can't advocate for a specific investment.

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,727
Erin Callan 雷曼兄弟首席财务官

95
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,897
Hank 你想不想让我筹集到资金?
Hank, you want me to raise capital or not?

96
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,902
2008年5月24日 星期六

97
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,484
雷曼兄弟的规模要比贝尔斯登大得多
Lehman Brothers is a hell of a lot bigger than Bear Stearns.

98
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,902
市场开始恐慌了
The market is terrified.

99
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,239
我在高盛集团主政期间 从来没有想过要去
When I was running Goldman, I never even conceived

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,783
请求财长为我促成一笔交易
of asking the Treasury Secretary to cut a deal for me.

101
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,284
没错 但是对贝尔斯登的紧急援助造成了...
Yeah, but the Bear bailout created...

102
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,619
不要把它说成是紧急援助
Please don't call it a bailout.

103
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:33,040
好吧 对贝尔斯登的一揽子大规模收购援助政策
Okay, the very large Bear Stearns purchase assistance package

104
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,834
使公众产生了一种预期
created an expectation.

105
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,585
Fuld正期待您的直接介入
Fuld's counting on direct intervention from you.

106
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,088
巴菲特可以轻而易举地解决这个问题
Buffett's a simple solution.

107
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,757
Jim Wilkinson 财政部参谋长

108
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,091
我觉得您应该去给他打这个电话
I think you make the call.

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,179
以什么身份呢? 他的朋友? 以前为他提供服务的人? 还是以财长的身份?
As what? Warren's friend? His former banker? The Treasury Secretary?

110
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,432
不 还是让Fuld自己去打给他吧
No. Fuld's calling him.

111
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,308
希望他能介入进来 这样大家都能安心了
Hopefully he'll jump in and we can all relax.

112
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,354
安心? 我们刚刚处理了一家投资银行 这会儿又有另一家在苟延残喘
Relax? We just buried one investment bank, we got another one that's barely breathing.

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,190
这是一场关乎信心的博弈 如果人们对雷曼兄弟失去了信心
This is a confidence game. People lose faith in Lehman,

114
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,026
那后面的银行就会像多米诺骨牌一样成片地倒下
these banks are gonna drop like dominoes,

115
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,487
而我也无法为此再做出什么了
and I don't have the authority to do a thing about it.

116
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,116
已经晚了 一切都已经太晚了
We're late. We've been late on everything.

117
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,288
Neel Kashkari 部长助理 处理国际事务

118
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,369
Neel的团队正在研究这样灾难即将带来的后果
Neel's team is working on some kind of a disaster scenario.

119
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,288
我们把它称为"破杯"计划
We're calling it the "Break the Glass" plan,

120
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,498
当您走投无路的时候就可以要求国会执行这项计划
what to ask Congress for if your back's against the wall.

121
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
钱呗
Money.

122
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,837
就是向他们要钱呗
Is what you ask them for.

123
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:26,635
Michele Davis 部长助理 处理公共事务

124
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,134
问题在于 除非我们已经撞上了冰山 否则国会不会采取举措
The problem is, Congress won't move until we've already hit the iceberg,

125
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,635
而到那时 一切都已经太晚了
and at that point, it may be too late.

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,599
你的意思是说 我掌管着美国财政部
So you're saying, with the full weight of the United States Treasury behind me,

127
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,935
而我能做的就是去找巴菲特求助?
all I can do is call Warren Buffett?

128
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,773
嗨 巴菲特 我是Hank
Hi, Warren. It's Hank.

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,567
我知道你和Dick Fuld已经谈过了
I understand you've been talking to Dick Fuld.

130
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,406
华伦・巴菲特 世上最富有的人

131
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,406
Hank 你也知道我对那些投资银行的担忧
You know my misgivings, Hank, about investment banks.

132
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,367
他们一旦开始为自己进行交易时
As soon as they started trading for themselves,

133
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,078
那些风险经理就都失控了
the risk managers lost control.

134
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,663
我和所罗门兄弟公司有过一次不太愉快的合作经历
I had a very unpleasant time with Salomon Brothers.

135
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,832
你说得有道理
That's fair enough.

136
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,213
但我们都知道投资银行向来都是一个有利可图的行业
But we both know that investment banking is a profitable business.

137
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,841
我猜它大概已经为你赚了数十亿美金了吧?
I figure it made you a billion or so, huh?

138
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:10,012
我相信如果他们出价合理的话 你也不会袖手旁观吧
I gotta believe that if the price was right, you wouldn't just walk away.

139
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,683
在事实面前才算数 你觉得呢?
You know a good deal when you see one. What say you?

140
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,561
还是你自己来判断吧
I gotta leave that to your judgment.

141
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,981
大家的反应就好像我们是奸商一样
People act like we're crack dealers.

142
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,817
没人拿着枪去指向某人说
Nobody put a gun to anybody's head and said,

143
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,320
"嘿 猎人 买下这栋你偿还不起的房子吧 等你住进去以后
"Hey, nimrod, buy a house you can't afford. And you know what? While you're at it,

144
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,447
再用它申请信用额度 这件就可以再买一艘船了"
put a line of credit on that baby and buy yourself a boat."

145
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,950
巴菲特给你回复了吗?
You heard anything from Buffett?

146
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,496
他要求获得股价为40美金的优先股 分红为9%
He's asking for preferred shares at 40 with a dividend of 9%.

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,998
股价刚还在66块呢 搞什么鬼啊?
We were just at 66. What the fuck?

148
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,042
或许这只是游戏的序幕吧 Dick
Maybe it's just an opening gambit, Dick.

149
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,710
听上去更像是一种侮辱
Sounds more like a goddamn insult.

150
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,212
- 我来帮你弄吧 Dick  - 谢谢
- Let me get that, Dick.  - Thank you.

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,339
我们的股价已经跌到了36块
We're at 36 right now.

152
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,759
这几个月以来我们从未到过66快附近
We haven't been anywhere near 66 in months.

153
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,761
市场喜欢巴菲特
The markets like Buffett.

154
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,639
- 他的名字会在一夜之间推动股价上升  - 我才不在乎他是谁
- His name will push the price up overnight.  - I don't care who he is,

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,811
我不会用1年花费3亿6000万的代价去取悦他以谋求合作
I am not spending $360 million a year for the pleasure of doing business with him.

156
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,020
房地产市场会重新振作起来的
Real estate will come back.

157
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,647
韩国人有意介入
Koreans have been sniffing around.

158
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,524
这不好了 他们不会漫天要价
There you go. And they won't steal us blind.

159
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,360
这种场面以前我也经历过 首席执行官们开始恐慌 然后廉价卖掉自己的股票
I've seen this before. CEOs panic and they sell out cheap.

160
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,446
现在 整条华尔街都认为已经到了火烧眉毛的时候
Right now, the Street's running around with its hair on fire,

161
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,407
但暴风雨总会过去的
but the storm always passes.

162
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:16,120
我们要充满信心 然后 去参加高盛举办的午宴
We stand strong, and on the other side, we'll eat Goldman's lunch.

163
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,915
那我们该如何回复巴菲特呢?
So, what do we do about Buffett?

164
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,627
去他妈的巴菲特
Screw Warren Buffett.

165
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,423
每周早餐会议

166
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,423
- 他拒绝了?  - 雷曼兄弟的股价
- He passed?  - Lehman dropped

167
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,758
在今天上午已经跌到了28块半 他到底是怎么想的啊?
to 28 and a half this morning. What in the world is he thinking?

168
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,846
他根本没有思考 他是在妄想 他认为巴菲特的开价太高了
He's not thinking. He's delusional. He thought the ask was too high.

169
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:38,601
Ben Bernanke 联邦储蓄主席

170
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,682
他得去筹措资金啊
He's gotta raise cash.

171
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,601
我也是这么跟他说的
I told him that.

172
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,104
- 我找格林斯潘谈过了  - 真的吗?
- I spoke to Greenspan.  - Really?

173
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:47,568
他说住房市场供过于求 这就是问题所在
He says there's too much housing supply. That's the problem.

174
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,449
所以我们应该买下所有闲置房屋 不让它们流入市场
So we should buy up all the vacant houses and burn them.

175
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,959
Dick需要一个能认清现状的买家
Dick needs a buyer, someone with a grip on reality.

176
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,295
几个月前巴克莱银行曾表示过些许兴趣
Barclays expressed some interest a couple of months ago,

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,130
但我觉得现在的股价还没有降到他们的心理价位
but I don't think the price is low enough for them.

178
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,217
- 美国银行呢?  - 有这个可能
- Bank of America?  - Possible.

179
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,177
Dick之前也试探过他们
Dick's put out feelers there before.

180
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,846
不过我们得保持低调
We have to keep it quiet, though.

181
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,932
因为一旦有人获悉他们准备出售
'Cause if anyone hears that they're trying to sell

182
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,976
雷曼兄弟将瞬间完蛋
Lehman'll be dead within the hour.

183
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,398
2008年6月11日 雷曼兄弟高管紧急决策会议

184
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,479
在房地产业务上的投资正在毁掉整个公司
The real estate investments are killing the firm.

185
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,398
我们得公开承认我们犯了一些错误
We have to admit publically we've made some mistakes.

186
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,525
我们需要对高管层进行更替
We need to make a senior management change,

187
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,694
从而向市场表明我们的立场
signal to the market that we get it.

188
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,407
- 你们指的是谁?  - Joe Gregory
- Meaning what?  - Meaning Joe Gregory.

189
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
别扯淡了
Get the fuck out of here.

190
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,830
还轮不到你们来告诉我该如何来运营我的公司
You are not gonna tell me how to run my company.

191
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,917
Joe在这场危机中没有站在你这边 这是人所共知的
Joe hasn't had your back on risk, and everyone knows it.

192
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,337
Erin Callan也得走人 整条华尔街都知道她就是个笑话
Erin Callan's gotta go, too. As far as the Street's concerned, she's a joke.

193
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,341
Joe Gregory和我共事了30多年
Joe Gregory has been with me for 30 years.

194
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,012
我们只是遇到了暂时性的困难 你们就想让我把他撵走?
And you want me to kick him to the curb because we had a bad quarter?

195
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,639
这不是暂时性的困难
It's not just a bad quarter.

196
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,683
股价已经跌到23块了
Stock hit 23.

197
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:07,311
Skip McGee 雷曼兄弟投行部 全球区总裁

198
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,311
23块啊 公司大部分员工分到的股票都是在数年内无法进行买卖的
Twenty-three. Most of our guys are paid in stock they can't sell for years.

199
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,022
他们损失的是过去六个月里赚的净利润
They've lost most of their net worth over the last six months.

200
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,068
如果你不稳住股价 你的那些交易员们只能跑路了
You don't stabilize the price, your traders are gonna jump ship.

201
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,028
一群自私鬼
Selfish fucks.

202
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,991
Dick 不仅是银行家和交易员们 连客户都会抽走他们的资金
It's not just bankers and traders, Dick. Clients are pulling their money.

203
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,785
公司将遭遇到连锁反应
There's gonna be a run on this bank.

204
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,541
消息灵通人士对财经频道透露
Sources tell CNBC that both

205
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,253
雷曼兄弟的Erin Callan和Joseph Gregory已经离任
Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory are out at Lehman Brothers.

206
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,755
公司的主席Dick Fuld在一份声明中称
In a statement, the company's chairman, Dick Fuld, said

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,858
2008年8月4日

208
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,758
将由48岁的Bart McDade代替Gregory的位子
replacing Gregory with 48-year-old Bart McDade

209
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:38,095
Bart McDade 雷曼兄弟新总裁兼首席运营官

210
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,095
这是他所做过的最艰难的一个决定
has been one of the most difficult decisions he's had to make.

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,558
Dick 韩国人刚刚到达Sullivan
Dick, the Koreans just arrived at Sullivan.

212
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,852
我们一定要抓住这次机会
Let's go make this happen.

213
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,730
我觉得这会儿你最好就待在这里
My take is you'd be better off staying here for now.

214
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,358
我们要把你打造成为"幕后人士"
We need you to be our "missing man."

215
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,320
由我们去谈 尽最大努力去促成这笔交易
We'll go in and push the deal as far as we can,

216
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,990
最后再由你出面来达成这笔交易
and then we'll bring you in at the end to top it off.

217
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,408
好吧 听你的
All right, fine.

218
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,328
很好
Okay. Okay.

219
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,544
我们如期来到了纽约
We are committed to our presence in New York.

220
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,924
但我们需要知道确切的数字
But we need to know that the underlying numbers make sense.

221
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,930
我们也看到了事情的发展情况
We realize how things look.

222
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,224
但我们的股价只是被一些做空者暂时挫伤
But our stock is getting hammered by the shorts.

223
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,101
它的真实价值依旧没变
The value is still there.

224
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,565
我们刚刚开始谈 Min还是很兴奋的 但他们还没有给出具体的数字
We just started. Min's excited, but we haven't heard the terms.

225
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,234
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

226
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,944
我刚走出会议室来接你的电话啊
I just stepped out to take the call.

227
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,489
快回去 要有礼貌啊
Get back in there. Don't be rude.

228
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,575
好的
Okay.

229
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,495
我们只是将你们不感兴趣的那一部分资产
We simply take the assets you don't find appealing,

230
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,664
拆分成一个独立的公司
spin them off into a separate company.

231
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,419
- 你不必买下整家银行  - 抱歉
- You don't buy that bank.  - I'm very sorry.

232
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,421
你只需买下这家运营良好的银行就行了
You buy the good bank.

233
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,717
他们对房地产不感兴趣
Look, they don't like the real estate.

234
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,135
什么叫他们不感兴趣?
What do you mean, they don't like it?

235
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,972
Dick 我们终于有些进展了 暂时不要打扰我了
Dick, we're making real progress here, okay? Let me stay on it for now.

236
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,157
Min 你好
Min, how are you?

237
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,576
很高兴见到你
Great to see you.

238
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,121
希望没有打扰到你们
I don't want to interrupt.

239
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,540
Dick 你来得正是时候
Dick, great timing.

240
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,167
看起来双方对合同的大致框架都很满意
We seem to be in sync on the broad strokes of the deal.

241
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,711
我们可以回到意向书上来了吗?
Shall we get back to the letter of intent?

242
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,675
Min 我不得不告诉你 我觉得你正在犯一个大错
Min, I have to tell you, I think you're making a big mistake here.

243
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,344
房地产资产价值巨大
There's great value in the real estate assets.

244
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,514
要不通过仔细分析投资组合
How about we walk through the portfolio

245
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
我来向你展示这一点如何?
and I'll show you?

246
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,354
我们已经仔细看过了
We have looked at them.

247
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,024
有些地方你肯定没看懂
Then you must have looked at them in the wrong way.

248
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,653
我不想看你做出错误的决定
See, I just don't wanna see you leave money on the table.

249
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,364
或许我们应该休息一下
Perhaps we should take a break.

250
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,456
Min 非常抱歉
Min, I'm so sorry.

251
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,668
我们一直在真心实意地进行谈判 突然就这么回到原点了?
We have negotiated in good faith. Now all of a sudden we are going backward?

252
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,295
我们同意你给出的报价
We can work with you on the price.

253
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,213
这与报价无关
It is not about the price.

254
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,009
我说的是你们处理事情的方式
It is about the way you have conducted this.

255
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,642
非常感谢大家
I'd like to thank you, all of you,

256
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,229
但我觉得已经没有继续谈下去的基础了
but I don't think we have a structure that works.

257
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,653
什么 就这么结束了?
What, that's it?

258
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,530
你们就打算这么打道回府了?
You're just gonna pack up and go back to Korea?

259
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,463
- 你好  - Neel 我是Dick Fuld
- Hello?  - Neel, it's Dick Fuld.

260
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,718
听着 如果Hank想让我找到买家
Listen, you know, if Hank wants me to find a buyer,

261
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,261
你们得出面帮我一把啊
you guys need to step up and help.

262
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,931
韩国人刚刚退出交易了
The Koreans just walked out, okay?

263
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,641
我只是表达一下自己的观点
Look, I'm just speaking for myself here,

264
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,060
但我认为你应该做一些有利于公司的事情
but I think you need to do what's right for the firm.

265
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,853
什么叫有利于?
Do what's right?

266
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,438
这话是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

267
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,690
如果股价继续下跌
If your stock price keeps sliding,

268
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,235
你也许会得到一个令人失望的报价
you may get an offer at a price that doesn't look all that compelling,

269
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,279
但为了公司的持续经营 你必须接受它
but you may have to take it just to keep the company intact.

270
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,031
你指什么样的买价?
What kind of price are you talking about?

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,699
可能会...
Could be...

272
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,077
我指 股价可能在个位数
I mean, it might be low single digits.

273
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,333
二月份 我们公司每股66美元
Last February, we were at 66 a share.

274
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:42,589
雷曼兄弟可不是贝尔斯登
Lehman Brothers is not Bear Stearns.

275
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,134
我们业绩很好的 房地产会复苏的
We've got a great business. Real estate's gonna come back.

276
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,263
我他妈不会把这公司送人的!
I am not fucking giving this company away!

277
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,008
在雷曼兄弟股价因其
While the real estate market has put

278
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,558
房地产业务而备受压力时
put Lehman Brothers shares under pressure,

279
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,726
房贷巨头房利美和房地美两公司传出报道说
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks

280
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,105
需要筹资750亿美元才能偿付其债务 
are suddenly plummeting this morning, after reports the companies

281
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,067
此后 这两家公司的股价急剧下跌
may need to raise $75 billion just to remain solvent.

282
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,403
因为这两家公司几乎担保了
Because they guarantee such an enormous percentage 

283
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,904
全国大部分的次级贷款
of the nation's mortgages,

284
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,739
有关人士预测政府将会介入
there is renewed speculation that the government

285
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,825
该事态中 收购两家公司
may have to step in and take them over,

286
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,620
政府介入的可能性也从奥巴马的竞选演讲中得到证实
a possibility Barack Obama has now raised on the campaign trail.

287
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,415
若房利美和房地美倒闭了
If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed,

288
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,588
那么将会给整个金融界带来
then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow

289
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,173
灾难性的动荡
that it could be disastrous.

290
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,511
房地美下跌了8% 房利美下跌5%
Freddie just dropped another 8%. Fannie's down 5%.

291
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:34,511
Timothy Geithner 纽约联邦储备银行行长

292
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,808
下跌趋势迅猛 我们得采取措施了 立刻
There's no bottom here. We need to do something. Now.

293
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,936
我们正向国会提议
We're working on a proposal for Congress,

294
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,731
看能否批准我们向市场注资救市
see if we can get the authority to put some money in.

295
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,985
我本不想这么做的 但若情况特别糟糕的话...
I'd rather not go that way, but if we get there...

296
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,779
我想事态已经很糟糕了
I think we're already there.

297
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,618
- 你能要到多少?  - 一张空白支票
- How much are you gonna ask for?  - A blank check.

298
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,705
投资资金必须足以让我们挽救市场
It has to be enough of a statement to reassure the market.

299
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,500
得让市场觉得 我拥有决定性武器
They need to think I've got a bazooka in my pocket.

300
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,671
不是说我们真的会注资 只是如果我们得到了国会的许可
I'm not saying that we use it, but if we have the authority,

301
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,508
那么 所有疯狂抛售股票的人会逐渐冷静下来 重新参与
everyone who's dumping their shares will calm down, back off.

302
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,054
行 若你在国会 你也可以顺便提议资助那些投资银行 是吧?
Okay, if you're going to Congress, why don't we give to the banks, too?

303
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,389
因为雷曼兄弟眼看活不成了 美林也离破产不远了
'Cause Lehman's looking like shit and Merrill's not far behind.

304
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,225
光说服他们愿意接管房利美和房地美就够走运了
We'll be lucky to get them to move on Fannie and Freddie.

305
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,686
我们只能说试试看
We do what we can do.

306
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,686
北京奥运会开幕式 2008年8月8日

307
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,367
部长先生 部长夫人 请看这边
Secretary, Mrs. Paulson, over here.

308
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,285
请看这边 谢谢
Over here, please.

309
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,956
Paulson部长 请看这边 谢谢
Secretary Paulson, over here, please.

310
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,833
Paulson夫人 谢谢
Mrs. Paulson. Thank you.

311
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,546
Paulson夫人
Mr. Paulson.

312
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,132
Paulson部长 夫人 请看这边 谢谢
Mr. and Mrs. Paulson, this way, please.

313
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,306
- 我来抱着  - 带她先去一边
- I've got her.  - You should take her.

314
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,768
请看这边 Paulson部长 谢谢
Right over here, Secretary Paulson, please.

315
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,104
请笑一笑 谢谢
Big smile. Thank you.

316
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,189
这正是我需要的
That's just what I need.

317
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,317
新闻媒体拍到美国财政部长居然挥舞着中国国旗
Press photos of the Treasury Secretary waving the Chinese flag.

318
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:12,447
Paulson竟然是共产党员 你当时脸上的表情很精彩的
Paulson the Communist. The look on your face was priceless.

319
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,160
Hank 关于房利美和房地美 我有问题要问
Hank, I must ask you about Fannie and Freddie.

320
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,168
我们在"两房"公司投资了数十亿美元
We have hundreds of billions invested.

321
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,168
你和我保证过投资是安全的
You've assured us the investment is safe.

322
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,046
是的 绝对安全
And it is, absolutely.

323
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,551
可我们发现 近期损失了很大一笔数额
We're watching a great deal of our money disappear.

324
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,722
两个月内 股价竟然跌了60%
Share prices have dropped 60% in the last two months.

325
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,307
光到处宣扬你有决定性武器可以救市是不够的
Carrying your bazooka around has not helped matters.

326
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,562
国会给了你权利 也许是时候使用这项权利了
Congress gave you the power. Perhaps it is time to use it.

327
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,399
市场会稳定下来的 需要的只是时间而已
The market will stabilize. We just have to give it some time.

328
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,361
俄罗斯上个月和我们联系
There was an approach last month from Russia.

329
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,240
他们也持有大量房利美和房地美的的债券
They have considerable holdings in Fannie and Freddie as well.

330
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,910
俄罗斯建议我和他们合作 搞一次突击 
They suggested we coordinate, and without warning,

331
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,614
向市场大量抛售房利美
dump hundreds of billions of Fannie

332
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,414
和房地美的债卷
and Freddie's bonds onto the market.

333
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,878
- 那市场就会...  - 一片混乱
- That would be...  - Chaos.

334
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,002
贵国发售过多的债卷
The amount of debt your country carries

335
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,383
是你们一处致命的弱点
is a terrible vulnerability.

336
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,768
- 但你们...  - 我们很客气地拒绝了
- But you...  - We declined, respectfully.

337
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,606
即使是在美国
Even in the US, it seems

338
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,560
你们政府和非国营企业
the relationship between the government

339
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,360
的关系似乎也是挺复杂的
and private industry isn't so simple.

340
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,241
他在威胁我们?
Was it a threat?

341
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,953
不 不是 只能算一个友情提示
No, no, it was a friendly reminder

342
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,001
提示我们 只要他们给莫斯科打一个电话
that with a single phone call to Moscow,

343
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,999
我们美国经济就会全面崩溃
they can take down the entire US economy.

344
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:58,470
从账面来看 房利美和房地美简直就是一团糟
The book says Fannie and Freddie are a nightmare.

345
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,223
负债缺口至少有数百亿美元
They are in the hole easily tens of billions of dollars.

346
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,558
过不了几周 他们就无法偿还债务了
Another few weeks, they're gonna start defaulting on their debts.

347
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,862
政府得介入干预此事了
We're gonna have to step in. 

348
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:07,562
我不明白该怎么做
I don't see how we can avoid it.

349
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,568
看来武器不开一枪是震慑不住市场的
Turns out a bazooka's not that useful unless you fire it.

350
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,697
雷曼兄弟股价又跌了10%
Lehman's down another 10%.

351
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,325
你就不让我安心地咬一口面包 是吧?
You are not gonna let me get down a single bite, are you?

352
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,618
所以我早餐吃燕麦粥
This is why I have oatmeal.

353
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,329
Dick现在正满世界地乞求援助
Dick is trotting around the world with his hat in his hands,

354
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,164
但就是没人给他钱
no one will give him any money.

355
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,333
韩国老板放弃了他 墨西哥人叫他别管了
Korea walked out on him. Mexico told him to shove it.

356
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,544
没人对他公司感兴趣 所有能忽悠到的融资早就入股了
No one's interested. All the dumb money's already in.

357
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,420
那找美国银行如何? 他们还有兴趣吧?
What about B of A? Are they still in the mix?

358
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,175
巴克莱银行也开始蠢蠢欲动了
And Barclays is sniffing around again,

359
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,675
他们认为此时是买入的好时机
now that they think it's a fire sale.

360
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,552
- 这倒不错  - 鬼知道
- That's promising.  - I don't know.

361
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,347
那些英国佬光会说说 从未付诸行动(巴克莱银行是英国最大商业银行之一)
The British, they do a lot of talking. They never close.

362
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,310
- 美国银行是目前最好的收购者了  - 雷曼不能步贝尔斯登后尘
- B of A is still our best bet.  - This can't be another Bear.

363
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,355
不会的 他们会认购雷曼的全部股份
Absolutely not. They want Lehman, they buy it outright.

364
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,107
但他们需要我们经济上的帮助
But they may need a little hand-holding, though.

365
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,651
因为他们才收购了美国国家金融服务公司 所以口袋里有点紧
They just bought Countrywide. They're spread a little thin.

366
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,280
央行对美国银行资本充足率要求得暂时松一松
You may have to give them a break with the capital requirements.

367
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,741
你想让我允许美国银行提高他们的杠杆比率(偿还财务能力比率)
You want me to allow them to raise their leverage

368
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,287
这样他们就能收购另一家
so they can buy a bank that's about

369
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:05,287
因杠杆比率过高而即将破产的银行?
to fail because it was overleveraged?

370
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,957
你有更好意见?
You got a better idea?

371
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,460
突发新闻刚刚传来 财经频道刚刚收到消息
Breaking news just coming in. Sources telling CNBC

372
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,578
政府最近宣布接管
that the government has just taken

373
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,840
房利美和房地美公司
control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

374
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,884
然而在七月份 您可能会记起 Hank Paulson曾说过 
Back in July, you remember, Hank Paulson said

375
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,521
他想让通过此举来介入
that he wanted the power to step in,

376
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:22,721
但他可能不会采取行动
but he probably wouldn't use it.

377
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,349
现在看来Paulson
It certainly sounds like Paulson

378
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,349
不得不用起他手里的武器了
just pulled the trigger on that bazooka.

379
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,435
虽然房利美和房地美公司正在进行国有化
Despite the move to nationalize Fannie and Freddie,

380
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:35,025
2008年9月11号 纽约市区

381
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,771
但股市仍然全盘处于下跌状态
the market is still in negative territory across the board.

382
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,025
投资者们现在正关注雷曼兄弟的命运
Investors now focusing their attention on Lehman Brothers,

383
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,886
尤其是有传言说 这家美国
amid fresh reports that the nation's

384
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,486
第四大投资银行
fourth-largest investment bank

385
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,280
正处于破产边缘
may be on the brink of bankruptcy.

386
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
嘿 Rodge
Rodge.

387
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,491
你好 Chris
Chris.

388
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,035
今天带钱来了 对吧?
Bring your money today, huh?

389
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,035
Chris Flowers 银行收购专家

390
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,291
别让Fuld再隐藏什么对公司不好的消息了
Make sure Fuld's not keeping any bad news out of the mix.

391
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,336
用Dick的话来说就是"大白于天下"
It's "open kimono," to quote Dick.

392
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,669
Rodgin Cohen 雷曼兄弟辩护律师

393
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
他让人讨厌
There's a revolting image.

394
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,469
你研究他们的数据了吗?
Did, uh, you get a look at the numbers?

395
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,972
房地产资产是个问题 他们对其定价300亿美元
The real estate's the issue. They got it marked at 30 billion.

396
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,060
估计高估了一半 别这么紧张
It's worth maybe half of that. Don't look so nervous.

397
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,655
你们只需要花买一个热狗的钱
You're about to get a Wall Street

398
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:13,355
就能买到这家华尔街的投资银行
bank for the price of a hot dog.

399
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:20,983
Greg Curl 美国银行策划部部长 

400
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,583
我知道Paulson和Ken Lewis(美国银行首席执行官)
I know that Paulson told Ken Lewis

401
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:16,983
说过他不会介入此收购的
that he's not gonna pay for this.

402
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,610
若政府不出面接管一些不良资产的话
And I don't see how we can do it

403
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,570
我想我们还是无法收购雷曼的
unless the government takes some of the downside.

404
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,656
Paulson只是故作姿态
Paulson is posturing.

405
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,784
他会给你支票的 就像他曾让摩根大通
He'll write a check just like he did 

406
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,784
收购贝尔斯登时一样
for Jamie Dimon on the Bear deal.

407
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,588
他必须这么做
He has to.

408
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,788
他可不能在总统竞选年度再损失一家大型投行了
He can't lose another major bank in an election year.

409
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,592
而且 那家伙在高盛的时候
Besides, the guy made, like, a half

410
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:34,292
最起码赚了五亿美元
a billion bucks at Goldman Sachs.

411
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,253
他让雷曼兄弟倒闭? 让高盛最强的竞争对手倒闭?
He lets Lehman die? Goldman's biggest competitor?

412
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,005
那会让人怀疑他还是高盛的人呢
Makes him look like he's still working for Goldman.

413
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,883
我估计他这会儿正在财政部写支票呢
He's just doing it out of a desk at Treasury.

414
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,096
甜甜圈在哪?
Where are the donuts?

415
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,557
就是如此 若你是他们这些金融企业的首席执行官
Exactly. If you're the CEO of one of these financial firms,

416
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,227
你早就注意到政府愿意支援你收购的话
you've already seen what the government was willing to do.

417
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,771
那你可以堂而皇之地说
Why wouldn't you play chicken with them and say,

418
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,108
"当然 我们愿意协助你们 可你得给我点好处吧?
"Sure, I'll help you out. But you gotta throw in a sweetener,

419
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,943
就像你援助别人收购时所作的"
just like you did for those guys"?

420
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,531
公众以为我们会资助Dick Fuld
They just assume I'm gonna bail out Dick Fuld,

421
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,575
以为我是那个为他们业绩不好擦屁股的人
like I'm the guy behind the elephant with the shovel.

422
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,454
公众认为雷曼兄弟这次被收购就像
They're all drawing a line from Bear

423
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,454
贝尔斯登 房利美和房地美一样
and Fannie and Freddie right to Lehman.

424
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,373
不会有纳税人再愿意支持资助另一家破产银行了
There's no way the taxpayers are gonna go for another bailout.

425
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,084
一揽子大规模收购援助政策
Very large purchase assistance package.

426
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,337
这次必须让他们自己去解决了
We need to come up with a private-sector solution,

427
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,423
让他们投行自己去弥补负债缺口
get the investment banks to bridge the gap.

428
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,445
可以 但除非他们确信您不会再
Okay, but that's never gonna work

429
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,260
支援该收购行动 否则行不通
unless they believe that you've drawn a line.

430
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,430
我知道您不喜欢向公众泄露消息 让我们和媒体交流
I know you don't like leaking, but let us reach out to the press.

431
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,979
好
Okay.

432
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,693
Flowers先生 您有电话
Mr. Flowers, there's a call for you.

433
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,780
是美国国际集团的Bob Willumstad 他坚持一定要与您通话
Bob Willumstad from AIG. He's very insistent.

434
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:55,780
Robert Willumstad 美国国际集团首席执行官

435
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,622
Flowers先生 我的人说你是这方面的专家
Mr. Flowers. My people tell me you're the man to talk to.

436
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
我们公司面临一个大问题
We've got a real problem here.

437
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,126
嗯? 什么样的问题?
Yeah? What kind of problem?

438
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,296
似乎我们的现金流就快断了
It looks very much like we are about to run out of cash.

439
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,797
美国国际集团?
AIG?

440
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,883
我们给您发了一份文件 是一份电子表格
We've sent over a document. It's a spreadsheet.

441
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,802
当然 这是一份机密文件 但会让您了解我们的困境的
It's confidential, of course, but it might give you some insight.

442
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,472
我正在处理雷曼兄弟的事情 美国银行要收购他们
I'm in the middle of Lehman. I'm working with B of A.

443
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,475
那您明天能过来一下吗?
Is there any way you could come over tomorrow?

444
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:17,395
我会研究下这张表 然后再说吧
I'll take a look at the numbers and we'll talk.

445
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,236
Flowers先生
Mr. Flowers.

446
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,116
谁去开下电视
Somebody put the TV on.

447
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,869
财经频道在说雷曼兄弟
CNBC's talking about Lehman.

448
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,504
一位熟悉Paulson的...
A person familiar with Paulson's...

449
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:42,504
一位了解财政部长Hank Paulson想法的人透露
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's thinking,

450
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,298
在目前这种经济环境下
and he is saying there will be no government money

451
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,759
政府不会资助美国银行收购雷曼兄弟
in the resolution of this situation.

452
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,178
他们说雷曼兄弟被收购和贝尔斯登的情况有两处不同
They're saying two things make the Lehman deal different.

453
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,764
雷曼兄弟收购是市场早已预料到的 并有半年时间
The market's been aware and had time to prepare

454
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,058
可以准备 第二点是...
for over six months. And the second is...

455
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,769
只是电视台在胡扯?
Is that just TV bullshit?

456
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,939
还是Paulson想给我们传递的信息?
Or is that Paulson sending us a message?

457
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,774
喂 Chris?
Chris?

458
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,533
什么? 不好意思
Yeah? Sorry.

459
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,156
"一位财政部部长的朋友"
What exactly does "a person familiar

460
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,456
这到底是什么意思?
with the Treasury Secretary" mean?

461
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,708
可能有很多的含义
That could mean a lot of things.

462
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,460
是你的某位员工胡言乱语吧?
Did one of your staffers do this?

463
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,546
一定是你十分钟前解雇了谁吧
Please tell me someone got fired 10 minutes ago.

464
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,464
那是我的意思
The leak came from me.

465
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,387
Hank 你那种公众宣言
Hank, a public statement like that

466
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,387
可能会引起很多想象不到的灾难
can have a lot of unintended consequences.

467
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,148
我们得提醒别的银行
We had to send a message to the other banks.

468
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,348
让他们自己解决了
They need to step up.

469
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,392
我的帽子里再也变不出兔子来了
I don't have another rabbit I can pull out of my hat.

470
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,105
Rodgin Cohen刚打电话给我
Rodgin Cohen just called me.

471
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,441
他说美国银行的收购团现在
The B of A team is sitting there

472
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:44,941
坐在那边在手机上玩打砖块
playing Brickbreaker on their phones.

473
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,234
他们不想收购了
They don't want this deal.

474
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,008
收购暂停是因为
The deal is hanging by a thread because

475
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,488
他们对雷曼调查得越仔细
the closer they get to Lehman,

476
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,866
就越觉得 这其实是一个废料排放场
the more it looks like a toxic waste dump.

477
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,452
所以我们得为他们收购做风险上的补偿
Which is why at the end of the day we may have to help them,

478
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,039
若您不作出那种公众宣言的话 这场收购本该是很顺利的...
which would be a lot easier if we didn't publicly state that...

479
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,167
我们不能 Tim! 那样做不合法!
We can't, Tim! Legally, we can't!

480
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:07,589
若要合法地做 那这场灾难我们也没办法阻止
Legally, we haven't figured out how yet.

481
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,510
我很担心
I am concerned

482
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,349
因为我们现在还有几种挽救措施 但我们正在
we are limiting our options at a time when we have very few,

483
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,101
浪费他们
if any, available.

484
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:28,735
我想让那些首席执行官聚集到一起 给他们一个周末的时间
I want all the CEOs in a room. We've got the weekend.

485
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,904
把他们关在美联储
We lock them in a room at the Fed

486
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,574
在他们自己解决雷曼兄弟这烂摊子之前 不放他们出来
and we don't let them out until they have a solution on Lehman.

487
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,534
你的燕麦粥快凉了
Your oatmeal's getting cold.

488
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,621
他们会明白事态严重性的 他们自己会掏钱的
They'll figure it out. They'll all throw in some money.

489
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,193
Tim强烈建议我们
Tim is advocating strongly that we

490
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,293
央行出面提供一些支援
reconsider some kind of Fed support.

491
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,714
他想让我们资助所有人
Tim wants us to pick up the tab on everyone.

492
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,714
我可不想做"破产救援大使"
I can't be Mr. Bailout.

493
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,010
而且雷曼兄弟的亏损是贝尔斯登的两倍
The Lehman hole is twice what Bear's was.

494
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,546
而且投资者正急着从中抽身出来
Investors are pulling their accounts.

495
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:56,638
你想长期借贷给他们吗?
You want to lend into a run?

496
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,475
那巴克莱银行呢? 他们仍想收购雷曼吗?
What about Barclays? Are they still interested?

497
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,311
他们在对待风险上比美国银行更加保守
They can't afford the risk any more than B of A can.

498
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,814
我相信你一定能够说服任何人掏出钱
I don't doubt your ability to talk anybody into submission,

499
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,567
但是这风险确实很大
but it is still a long shot.

500
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,862
而且雷曼兄弟很可能会破产
And there's a very real possibility that Lehman goes under.

501
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,198
这周将会有场收购谈判
There's a deal to be made here.

502
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,993
这场谈判一定会成功的
I'm gonna make the deal.

503
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,830
在收盘前不到一小时
With just a little more than an hour left until the market 

504
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,416
雷曼兄弟的股价又猛跌了一把
closes, shares of Lehman Brothers have taken another tumble.

505
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,587
股价跌到新低 每股4美元都不到了
The stock is now trading at a new low, under $4 a share.

506
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,988
而且从卖方形势来看
And judging from the selling,

507
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,300
这种下跌趋势仍会继续
there doesn't appear to be a bottom in sight.

508
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,139
除了Blankfein(高盛首席执行官)说他有一场演讲 会尽量赶过来的
So, Blankfein has a speech he's trying to get out of,

509
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,266
其他的人都同意了
but the rest have confirmed.

510
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,559
- 告诉他必须来参加  - 好的
- Tell him it's not optional.  - Yeah.

511
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,104
Christopher Cox 美国证交会主席

512
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,104
下午好 主席 欢迎来参加该次会议
Good afternoon, Chairman. Thank you so much for joining us.

513
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,275
- 这架是谁的飞机?  - 呃 这是租来的
- Whose plane is this?  - Uh, that's a rental.

514
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,985
Hank自己掏钱的
Hank put it on his card.

515
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,029
先生 你认识Neel 这是Michele Davis负责公众事务
Sir, you know Neel and Michele Davis, Public Affairs.

516
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,155
嗨 很高兴见面
Hi. Pleasure.

517
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,449
- 这位是Dan Jester 我们团队的新人  - 你好
- This is Dan Jester, our new numbers guy.  - Hi.

518
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,285
是我劝他退休后继续出来工作的
I talked him into coming out of retirement.

519
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,870
- 什么? 退休?  - 我们以前在高盛是同事
- Excuse me? Retirement?  - He was with us at Goldman.

520
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,248
财政部还有没有员工不是从高盛过来的?
Got anybody at Treasury who wasn't at Goldman?

521
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,202
主席 有一点必须澄清一下
Chairman, just to be clear,

522
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:09,002
我们财政部和高盛之间没有任何利益冲突
there's no question of conflict of interest.

523
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,796
Hank在任职前就将高盛所有的股份抛售了
Hank sold all of his Goldman stock before he took office.

524
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,215
- 我什么也没暗示  - 不好意思
- I wasn't implying anything.  - Sorry.

525
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,385
我们对外面所传的"高盛政府"的谣言比较敏感
We're a little touchy about the whole "Government Sachs" thing.

526
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,846
我们走吧?
Shall we?

527
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,512
美国银行发现雷曼的不良资产越来越多
B of A keeps finding more toxic assets.

528
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,812
他们需要政府介入模仿之前摩根大通的收购
They want you to reconsider a Jamie deal.

529
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,482
他们会承担10亿元的损失
They'll split the first billion in losses,

530
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,482
剩余的40亿损失的由政府提供担保
but they want you on the hook for the next 40.

531
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,859
就像你对贝尔斯登收购做的一样
You did it for Bear.

532
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,945
Greg 我过会打给你
Greg, let me get back to you.

533
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,691
难道我得在我额头上纹个字才行吗?
What, do I have to tattoo it on my forehead?

534
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,991
我们不会对雷曼兄弟收购提供一分钱
We are not bailing out Lehman.

535
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,659
这是华尔街自己赌博失败
Wall Street has a gambling problem.

536
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,530
若老是让政府为他们擦屁股
If government keeps covering their losses,

537
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,830
他们永远也得不到教训
they never learn anything.

538
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,459
- 怎么了?  - 我不知道您是想继续
- What?  - I didn't know if you wanted

539
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,538
教导我道德危机
to keep lecturing me on moral hazard

540
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,838
还是想让我拒绝美国银行提议
or if I should just call B of A back.

541
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,559
我们只能让他们都坐在一起 进行讨论
We need to keep them at the table

542
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,759
直到这些企业找到自己的解决方法
until they come up with a private-sector solution.

543
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,427
告诉他们最好照我说的做
Tell them to stay with us.

544
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,889
- Alistair 你好啊  - 你好 Henry
- Alistair, hello.  - Hello, Henry.

545
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,099
请等一下
Hold on one second.

546
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,561
英国财政大臣打来的
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

547
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,023
我了解到巴克莱银行想收购雷曼兄弟
I understand Barclays is one of your potential buyers for Lehman.

548
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,817
但我国的银行最近的资金压力也很大
My banks are already under a great deal of stress.

549
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,611
我可不想承担过多义务
I don't want to become overextended.

550
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,155
雷曼兄弟虽然最近出了问题 但还是有价值的
Lehman is problematic, but there's value there.

551
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,451
我们会让他能够盈利的 继续保持合作吧
We will find a way to make it attractive. Just stay with us.

552
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,119
那再说吧
Talk soon then.

553
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,454
再见
Bye.

554
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:33,167
2008年9月18日 星期五

555
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:31,167
我们不会拒绝巴克莱银行 但最好还是由美国银行来收购
We'll keep Barclays in the mix, but B of A is still our best bet.

556
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,213
我们今晚会召集所有主要银行的首席执行官过来开会
We've got the CEOs of every major bank coming here tonight.

557
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,341
我们得明白地告诉他们 这是他们自己捅的篓子
We have to make it clear that this is their problem,

558
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,844
我们政府可以做顾问或是盟友
that we are their advisors and their allies,

559
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,973
但我们不是他们的保险箱
but we are not their safety net.

560
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,476
对这些人 我们还能指望什么呢?
What should we expect from these guys?

561
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:54,300
纽约 美联储

562
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,239
Jamie很聪明
Jamie is smart.

563
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,450
他买下贝尔斯登后 手头可运作的资金就不多了
He doesn't have as much cash to work with since he bought Bear.

564
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,450
Jamie Dimon 摩根大通主席兼首席执行官

565
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,746
Lloyd是巨星
Lloyd's a superstar.

566
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,707
高盛是华尔街上最精明的一家
Goldman's the smartest shop on the Block.

567
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,169
虽然我之前当过他老板 但那并不表示 他就会听我的了
And just because I used to be his boss, it doesn't mean he's gonna listen to me.

568
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,600
Lloyd Blackfein 高盛主席兼首席执行官

569
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,091
John Mack 他过去常常满楼层东奔西跑 大呼小叫
John Mack, he used to run around the floor screaming,

570
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,511
"水里有血啊! 我们杀啊!"
"There's blood in the water! Let's go kill someone!"

571
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,347
他是好战分子
He's a fighter.

572
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,000
John Mack 摩根士丹利主席兼首席执行官

573
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:32,019
Thain是我在高盛的副手 他很自私 是个实用主义者
Thain was my number two at Goldman. He's selfish. He's a pragmatist.

574
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,356
他知道 如果雷曼兄弟倒了 下一个就轮到美林证券了
He knows if Lehman goes, Merrill's next.

575
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,300
John Thain 美林证券主席兼首席执行官

576
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,361
Vikram Pandit刚入职花旗
Vikram Pandit is the new guy at Citigroup.

577
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,533
没人知道 是他在运作花旗 还是花旗在运作他
No one knows if he's running Citi or if Citi's running him.

578
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,000
Vikram Pandit 花旗集团首席执行官

579
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,893
感谢各位匆忙之中赶来这里
Thanks for coming down here on such short notice.

580
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,606
下周一早上 雷曼兄弟将无法偿付其债务
Monday morning, Lehman will no longer be able to honor its obligations.

581
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,236
有两家有意购买 美国银行和巴克莱银行
We have two potential buyers. B of A and Barclays.

582
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,824
但如果没有第三方融资 它们都无法完成收购
Neither will take the company unless someone else finances part of the deal.

583
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,203
政府不会进行干预
The government is not in a position to step in.

584
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,582
上一次是最后一次 这次就由你们完成了
I did the last one. You're gonna do this one.

585
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,042
Dick Fuld在哪儿?
Where's Dick Fuld?

586
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,377
Dick不适合再做决定了
Dick's in no condition to make any decisions.

587
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,464
我们将各位分成三组
We're breaking you into three groups.

588
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:46,385
第一组 评估雷曼兄弟的不良资产
The first one will try to value Lehman's toxic assets.

589
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,972
第二组 设计投资架构 让大家都可以投资雷曼
The second one will work on some sort of structure for you all to invest in Lehman.

590
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,018
第三组 制定熄灯计划
And the third one works on the lights-out plan.

591
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,604
如果雷曼兄弟申请破产 我们需要考虑
If Lehman files for bankruptcy, we need to figure out

592
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,898
如何遏制对各家的损害
how to contain the damage to the rest of you.

593
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,274
天呐
Christ.

594
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,151
我们早就预见到会出现这种状况
We've all seen this coming for miles.

595
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:05,363
我认为 雷曼兄弟即使破产 也不会给我们公司带来太大影响
I don't think a Lehman bankruptcy takes down our firms.

596
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,949
所以呢 我们就只能祝福雷曼了吗?
What, are we crossing our fingers?

597
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:13,120
这是要求我们挽救竞争对手 别表现得好像在帮我们一样
You're asking us to save a competitor. Let's not act like you're doing us a favor.

598
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,375
各位 各位 大家都是伟大的美国人
Gentlemen, gentlemen, you are great Americans

599
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,335
这是承担我们的爱国责任
undertaking a patriotic duty.

600
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,964
各位的努力将为自身赢得
Your travail will earn you the love

601
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,466
举国的爱戴和感激
and gratitude of your country.

602
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,802
我记得 Thomas Paine(激进民主主义者)曾经说过 "这些..."
I think it was Thomas Paine who said, "These are..."

603
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,096
雷曼兄弟是在座各家银行的合作伙伴
Lehman is a trading partner for every bank in this room.

604
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,890
它的破产将对大家都有很大冲击
Their failure will be a massive blow to all of you.

605
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,517
这就是重点
This is your problem.

606
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,562
我们可以好好说说 为何会到如此地步
We can all argue about how we got here.

607
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,232
放松管制 衍生品 Dick Fuld决策不利
Deregulation, derivatives, Dick Fuld made bad decisions.

608
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,819
我们都有责任 这是灾难性的动荡
We're all responsible. It's a catastrophic mess.

609
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,656
政府已经竭尽所能 现在全靠你们了
The government's done whatever it can do. It's on you now.

610
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,492
各位该解决问题 付出代价了
You need to fix it and you need to pay for it.

611
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,703
我就直说了
Let me be clear.

612
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:59,500
没出力的人 我们会记下的
We will remember anyone who is not helpful.

613
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:16,000
2008年9月13日 星期六

614
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,109
你注意到这其中的小规律了吗?
Do you notice a little pattern here?

615
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,945
不见棺材不掉泪
We don't deal with things until there's some kind of emergency on the table.

616
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,114
是啊 不到最后一刻 没人会去处理的
Yeah, we don't deal with things until Friday.

617
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,324
现在一只脚已经踏进去了
Some kind of a weekend thing.

618
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,450
我们什么时候才能
When were we gonna figure out

619
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,619
找到解决投资银行的破产问题的好方法?
exactly how to handle the failure of an investment bank?

620
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,329
周末搞定吧
Let's do it over a weekend.

621
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,790
我刚刚跟一位密切关注现状的专家谈过
I talked to a person who is monitoring the situation out there,

622
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,003
他说 业界人士都期望 他们能和Jamie Dimon一样 得到政府的自助
and the person said they all want the same deal Jamie Dimon got,

623
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,130
但预计期望会落空
and they're not going to get it.

624
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,383
提醒一句 Chris Flowers正在大厅
Just a heads up, Chris Flowers is in the lobby.

625
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,386
他是美国银行收购雷曼案的顾问
He's consulting for B of A on Lehman.

626
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,182
Hank之前将Flowers挤出了高盛
Hank pushed Flowers out of Goldman.

627
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,894
昨天我们还认为雷曼的不良资产仅300亿 今天就涨到了700亿
Yesterday, we thought Lehman was holding 30 billion in crap. Today it's 70.

628
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,397
700亿不良资产 这还只是随机抽样
$70 billion in assets that we're valuing with a dartboard.

629
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,732
没事 我们会解决这个问题
No, we're gonna work this out.

630
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,318
除非政府干预 不然我们就停手
Unless you step in, we're ending this.

631
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,694
别忘了Dick
Don't forget about Dick.

632
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,740
好了 Dick Fuld不停打来电话 不停要求我们提高价格
Yeah, Dick Fuld keeps calling, hammering us to raise the price.

633
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,869
抱歉
Excuse me.

634
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:25,378
700亿不良资产 还无担保?
70 fucking billion and no collateral?

635
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,590
如果雷曼兄弟本周末破产
If Lehman Brothers fails this weekend,

636
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,928
专家们毫不怀疑 下一个将是美林证券
there's little doubt amongst the people I speak to that Merrill Lynch will be next.

637
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,180
信心是非常脆弱的
Confidence is a very fragile thing.

638
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,934
在金融市场里 信心的流失速度非常快
And in our financial markets, it is eroding very quickly.

639
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:45,106
雷曼撑不下去了 我们就是下一个 必须立刻采取措施了
Lehman's not gonna make it. We're next. We need to do something right now.

640
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,776
只有美国银行能救我们了 我可以打个电话看看
B of A's the only one out there. I can put in a call.

641
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,945
- 虽然这样会毁了雷曼 不过...  - 雷曼是自食其果
- It screws Lehman, but...  - Lehman screwed themselves.

642
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,534
Paulson已经划定了底线 雷曼完了 打电话吧
Paulson has drawn a line in the sand. Lehman is dead. Make the call.

643
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,124
你们考虑一下收购美林的股份吧
We'd like you guys to look at taking a stake in Merrill,

644
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,960
有约10%的利润
something in the neighborhood of 10%.

645
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,797
我不知道能否拿到10%的利润
I don't know if I can generate any interest in 10%,

646
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,592
不过如果是收购整家公司的话
but if the whole company's in play,

647
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,803
我们肯定是愿意考虑一下的
I bet that's something that we'd consider.

648
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,930
我们和雷曼?
Us and Lehman?

649
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,725
这种规模的收购 我们只能完成一家
Deal this size, there's only room for one.

650
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:32,486
毫无疑问 风险很大 但是只要各位不中途退出
It is a lot of risk, no question, but if you stay in the game,

651
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,989
- 就都能找到各自的解决之道  - 当然了
- we all will find a private solution.  - Absolutely.

652
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:41,662
别被这些数字吓到了 我们会解决的 雷曼是值得收购的
Don't get scared by the numbers. We'll figure it out. Lehman is worth owning.

653
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,457
各位 有空吗?
Guys, you got a second?

654
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,920
我昨天去过了美国国际集团
I was at AIG yesterday.

655
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,592
下周三 他们将有至少50亿的缺口
Next Wednesday, they got a $5 billion hole, minimum.

656
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,513
我跟沃伦・巴菲特联系过了 他表示绝对不会帮忙
I called Warren Buffett. He wouldn't touch it with a stick.

657
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,932
我们会调查清楚
We're looking into it.

658
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,976
这是一家非常大的公司
It's a very big company.

659
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,357
谢了 Chris 感谢你所有的帮助
Thanks, Chris. I appreciate all your help.

660
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,533
他们根本不了解状况
They're not on top of it.

661
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,375
看看这个
Look at this.

662
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,423
这可能吗?
Is this even possible?

663
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,258
美国国际集团?
AIG?

664
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,593
该死的
Holy shit.

665
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,138
调查清楚
Get into this.

666
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,517
嘿 John
John.

667
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,775
你明白现在的状况吗?
Do you see what's happening here?

668
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,444
你想好怎么为自己打算了吗?
Are you watching out for yourself?

669
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:59,990
我不笨 我正在采取行动
I'm not thick. I'm working on something.

670
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,996
你想去找美国银行
You're talking to B of A.

671
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,333
抱歉
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,920
我知道 这样对雷曼不好 但是我必须先顾好美林
I know it's not good for Lehman, but I have to take care of Merrill.

673
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,464
把雷曼扔给我来操心
Let me worry about Lehman.

674
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,134
巴克莱还没有退出
Barclays is still in the game.

675
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,596
你去搞定吧
Just get it done.

676
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,361
美国银行将收购美林
B of A is gonna buy Merrill.

677
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,699
我们必须让巴克莱出手
We need to make Barclays work.

678
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,327
我记得你说过 英国佬只说不做的
I thought you said the British never close.

679
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,915
他们就在外面 似乎真的很想收购
They're here. They seem to really want it.

680
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,210
只要我们主动一点 他们就会收购的
If we hold their hands, they'll close.

681
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:58,674
Rodgin 怎么回事? Geithner不接电话 Paulson也不接电话
Rodgin, what the fuck? I can't get Geithner. I can't get Paulson.

682
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,594
连我的手下现在也不接电话了
I can't even get my own goddamn employees to pick up the phone.

683
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,637
Dick 大家都太忙了
There's a lot happening down here, Dick.

684
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,139
噢 该死
Oh, fuck.

685
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,933
给我听好 你去告诉Geithner
You know what? You tell Geithner,

686
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,061
他要是不帮我把这事解决了 下一个就轮到美林了
he doesn't pull my ass out of the fire, Merrill's gonna be next.

687
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,313
他知道
He knows that.

688
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,775
Dick 他刚告诉我 他们正在为美林寻找出路
Dick, he just told me they're working on a solution for Merrill.

689
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,156
那群混蛋要去帮美林?
Those cocksuckers are gonna bail out Merrill?

690
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,824
不 不是美联储
No, no, not the Fed.

691
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,870
没有私营买家了 只有美国银行和...
There's no private buyers. There's just B of A and...

692
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,498
他们想让美国银行收购美林?
They're gonna put B of A together with Merrill?

693
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,084
还有巴克莱银行 Hank觉得...
We still have Barclays. Hank feels that...

694
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,963
联邦政府竟然给我帮倒忙?
The federal government is snaking my deal?

695
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,800
我简直不敢相信!
I cannot fucking believe this shit!

696
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,221
美国银行和美林达成协议了?
B of A made a deal with Merrill?

697
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,307
对 雷曼的问题还是没解决
Yeah, Lehman's still our problem.

698
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,000
2008年9月14日

699
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,143
再来这么一次 我可受不了了
I don't think I can take another day of this.

700
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,521
你是刚下梅赛德斯 来到纽约美联储
You're getting out of a Mercedes to go to the New York Federal Reserve.

701
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,316
可不是奥马哈海滩的希金斯快艇
It's not a Higgins boat on Omaha Beach.

702
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,786
好了 好了 时间已经够长了
Okay, okay, we've been here a long time.

703
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,122
别废话了
Let's stop fucking around.

704
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,125
政府想让华尔街付账
Main Street wants Wall Street to pay.

705
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,045
他们觉得 我们就是有钱的笨蛋
They think we're overpaid assholes.

706
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,590
没有哪条政策规定 一定要参与紧急援助
There's no politician who's gonna sign off on a bailout.

707
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,594
那为什么不去资助那些赚钱的人呢?
Why would you bail out people whose sole job is to make money?

708
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,598
简单点说一下现在的状况吧
So, let's make this real simple.

709
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,478
Hank认为 他可以把雷曼好的资产出售给巴克莱银行
Hank thinks he can sell the good parts of Lehman to Barclays,

710
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,899
但这样就得有人把拖垮这家公司的抵押房产接手下来
but someone has to take the real estate crap that's weighing down the company.

711
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,734
谁都不知道这些不良资产的价值
Nobody knows how much this shit is worth,

712
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,945
但我们很清楚 一定得有人买下这批资产 以完成收购
but we know somebody has to buy it to make a deal.

713
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:47,282
我不喜欢这样 没人喜欢这样
I don't like it. Nobody likes it.

714
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,244
那就别抱怨了 去做吧
Let's just suck it up and do it.

715
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,000
有多少人可以投个10亿元 阻止雷曼的颓势?
How many of you can kick in a billion dollars to stop Lehman from going down?

716
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,505
我投 10亿
I'm in. One billion.

717
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,186
好
Okay.

718
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,236
高盛投10亿
Goldman's in for a billion.

719
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,995
John 你呢?
John?

720
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,414
喂?
Yeah?

721
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,463
是
Yes.

722
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,133
好
Yeah.

723
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,304
是
Yes.

724
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,895
成功了 巴克莱银行愿意购买
We did it. Barclays came through.

725
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,813
太棒了!
Too goddamn right!

726
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,443
巴克莱不愿意要不动产资产 但是其他银行同意收购这部分了
Barclays won't touch the real estate assets, but the other banks agreed to cover those.

727
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:10,324
通知董事会 把大家都喊来 我们有交易要谈了
Call the board. Get everybody here. We got a deal to make.

728
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,700
好的
Okay.

729
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
晚上9点 伦敦

730
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,003
找到他了吗?
Did you get him?

731
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,506
Geithner不回我电话
Geithner doesn't return my calls.

732
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,966
我们一个人都找不到
We can't get hold of any of those people.

733
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,928
今天之前 没有我们发话 他们是签不了协议的
At the end of the day, they can't sign the deal without our say-so.

734
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,138
对 但是他们知道吗?
Yes, but do they know that?

735
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,893
对
Yes.

736
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:42,893
Callum McCarthy爵士 英国银监会主席

737
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,689
嗯 一定 既然他屈尊来电 那就放他一马吧
Yes, by all means, now that he deigns to call, put him through.

738
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,692
Callum爵士 抱歉没能回电
Sir Callum, sorry I haven't gotten back to you.

739
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,363
我们在处理巴克莱银行收购雷曼的事宜
We're just sorting through this Barclays deal for Lehman.

740
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,491
身为巴克莱银行的监管方
As Barclays' regulator,

741
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,494
我们非常关注这桩计划中的交易
we have serious concerns about this proposed arrangement.

742
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,456
什么? 你是说你不同意这桩交易?
What? Are you saying you won't approve the deal?

743
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,001
就算我们同意这桩交易 事实上并非如此
Even if we were comfortable with the agreement, which we are not,

744
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,089
巴克莱银行也需要至少提前30天征得股东同意
Barclays would need at least 30 days for shareholder approval.

745
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,885
不 不 不 他不能 他不能这样做
No, no, no, no, no, no. He can't. He can't do this.

746
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,638
- 他们能阻止交易吗?  - 是的 当然可以了
- Can they stop the deal?  - Yeah, of course they can stop the deal.

747
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,640
不过就算他们阻止不了 光是耽搁一下 雷曼也完了
But even if they don't stop it, the delay will kill it.

748
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,185
立刻给英国财政大臣打电话
Let's call the Chancellor of the Exchequer right now.

749
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:25,190
巴克莱银行绝对不会接受任何不良资产
None of those assets would be part of Barclays.

750
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,529
是 但是如果英国金融服务管理局要...
Yes, but if the FSA were to...

751
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,281
我们需要稳定的局势
We need stability.

752
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,075
当然
Of course.

753
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,036
对英国金融系统而言 它也是 你们肯定发现了
must be to the British financial system. Surely you see that.

754
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,246
当然
Yeah.

755
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,249
晚安 好运
I wish you good night and good luck.

756
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,586
晚安
Good night to you, too.

757
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,762
"我们不会引入你们的癌症"
"We don't want to import your cancer."

758
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,776
各位
Those of you

759
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,364
不想帮助巴克莱收购案的人
who didn't want to assist the Barclays deal,

760
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,117
现在可以松一口气了
you can breathe a sigh of relief.

761
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,411
交易取消
The deal's not gonna happen.

762
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,747
- 嘿 我们筹到钱了  - 交易没了
- Hey, we have the money.  - Deal's dead.

763
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,125
巴克莱的监管方不愿签字
British regulator won't sign off.

764
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,793
你们可以施压啊
There must be some pressure you can exert.

765
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,463
相信我 我已经尽力了
Trust me, I've done everything I can.

766
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,215
英国佬
The British,

767
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,260
耍了我们
they grin-fucked us.

768
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,226
Paulson有10万雇员 Geithner有200名律师
Paulson's got 100,000 employees. Geithner has 200 lawyers.

769
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,728
该死的Chris Cox有3千手下
Frigging Chris Cox has 3,000 people.

770
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,522
这群混蛋就没一个人拿起话筒
Not a single one of those assholes could pick up a phone,

771
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,108
给英国佬打电话 趁他们还没在周末剥削完我们的资金前
call the British, find out if there was a deal to be made

772
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,862
看看能不能搞定这桩交易?
before they spend the weekend sweating us for cash?

773
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,280
有人失误了
Somebody dropped the ball.

774
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,199
他们不是失误
They didn't drop the ball.

775
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,076
是有意犯错 激怒高管
They dropped the ball, kicked the coach in the nuts

776
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,203
故意把事情搞得一团糟
and took a crap in the quarterback's mouth.

777
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,829
当然
Of course.

778
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,918
联邦政府会有所行动
The Fed will do something.

779
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,295
必须的
They have to.

780
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,135
我们要马上对外宣布 雷曼破产的消息
We've got to announce the Lehman bankruptcy now.

781
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,847
如果亚洲股市开盘 收购案还没敲定 大家都要做最坏的打算
If Asia opens and this isn't locked down, everyone's gonna assume the worst.

782
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,141
证券跌价会导致美国银行收购美林的失败
The sell-off will kill the Merrill-B of A deal.

783
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,602
- 谁去发布公告?  - 我想应该有美国证监会来
- Who's gonna make the announcement?  - I think it's gotta be SEC.

784
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,812
对
Yeah.

785
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,856
好
Okay.

786
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,320
那就决定了 什么时候开始行动?
Let's do it here. How soon can we set that up?

787
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,738
现在
Right away.

788
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,533
我们可以用主楼层 门厅那里
We could use the main floor, the entrance hall.

789
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,160
我后面还能有雕像? 很棒
With the statue behind me? Excellent.

790
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,875
雷曼真的同意申请破产了?
Did Lehman actually agree to file?

791
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,261
Chris 给雷曼打电话
Chris, call Lehman.

792
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,929
确保他们马上申请
Make sure they file right now.

793
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,681
一定
Absolutely.

794
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,862
美国国际集团是个大麻烦
AIG's a huge problem.

795
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,656
账目一团乱 不过我现在可以告诉你
The books are a mess. But from what I can tell,

796
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,659
世界上一半的银行和这群家伙有关联
half the banks in the world are in bed with these guys.

797
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,911
所有做过按揭抵押的银行
Everyone who had a piece-of-crap mortgage security

798
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,415
都在美国国际集团为其风险投过保 我是说所有
bought insurance on their risk from AIG, and I mean everyone.

799
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,834
他们怎么能让这种事发生?
How could they let this happen?

800
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,963
他们肯定是觉得 房地产市场不会崩塌 绝不会
They must have figured real estate would never go down, ever.

801
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,632
Hank 雷曼还没申请
Hank, Lehman still hasn't filed.

802
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,930
Cox必须要发布公告了 亚洲股市要开盘了
Cox has to make his announcement. Asia's opening.

803
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,182
他和他们谈过了吗?
Has he talked to them?

804
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,476
他根本还没打
He hasn't even called yet.

805
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,145
我们把巴克莱的事告诉了Fuld 我们说Cox会打电话给他
We told Fuld about Barclays. We said Cox was gonna call.

806
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,398
他就让所有股东坐在那里 不许接电话
He's got his entire board sitting there, no call.

807
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,233
Cox拒不开口
Cox is like a deer in the headlights.

808
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,944
混账!
Son of a bitch!

809
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,746
你是他们的监管方 马上给雷曼董事会打电话
You are their regulator. Call the Lehman board now.

810
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,415
Hank 现在的情况非常复杂...
Hank, it's a complicated situation where...

811
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,417
亚洲要开盘了
Asia's opening.

812
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,252
他们不公告 市场就完了
They don't announce, the market goes in the toilet.

813
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,381
我们必须考虑政府在其中扮演何种角色才比较恰当
We have to consider the appropriate role of government here.

814
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,549
我身为证监会主席 能否提议...
Can I, as Chairman of SEC, move forward and...

815
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,052
你们就像是不能出面的幕后人
You guys are like the gang that can't shoot straight.

816
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,804
这就是你们的工作
This is your job.

817
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,974
赶紧去打电话
Make the damn phone call.

818
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,025
Chris 我是Dick Fuld
Chris, this is Dick Fuld.

819
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,780
董事会成员正在开会 大家都到齐了 所有的股东和公司的法律顾问
The board is in session. Everyone is here. All the directors and the firm's counsel.

820
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,242
我们明白和巴克莱的谈判已经失败
We understand the Barclays deal has imploded.

821
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:52,416
我们在想你们有没有我们还没想到的解决方案
We were hoping you might have some option that we haven't thought of yet.

822
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:56,461
你知道 市场现在处于一团乱的状态
Um, the markets are in turmoil, as you know.

823
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,214
我相信 雷曼兄弟的破产
A Lehman bankruptcy will help

824
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,050
有助于消除不稳定性因素 起到稳定市场的作用
settle that uncertainty and, we believe, calm the market.

825
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:04,886
不管是联邦政府还是证监会都同意了
Both the Fed and SEC are in agreement about this.

826
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,807
让我...  不好意思 我来说说看看我是不是理解了
Let me... I'm sorry, let me see if I understand this.

827
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,686
你是想命令我们使雷曼兄弟破产吗?
Are you directing us to put Lehman into bankruptcy?

828
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,563
给我们几分钟
Give us a moment.

829
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,732
- 他们静音了  - 这是怎么回事?
- He's muted.  - What the hell was that?

830
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,904
让他们去申请破产
Tell them to file.

831
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,074
任何在本次会议上的发言会被作为公共记录
Everything said in that meeting is or will be public record.

832
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,285
我不能命令一家私人公司申请破产
I can't tell a private company to file for bankruptcy.

833
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,538
我没这权利的吧?
I don't have that power. Do I?

834
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,043
去做
Do it.

835
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:55,061
董事会需要做出一个决定 提出破产保护的申请
The decision to file for bankruptcy protection is one the board needs to make.

836
00:46:56,022 --> 00:47:00,358
这并非政府的决定 但我们相信
It is not the government's decision. But we do believe

837
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,696
必须有人来解决问题
that the situation should be resolved.

838
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,365
所以你不是在命令我们申请?
So you're not directing us to file?

839
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,661
我要说的就这么多了 谢谢
I'm not saying anything more than I've just said. Thank you.

840
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,760

P?

856
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,484
- 雷曼完蛋了  - 哦 亲爱的
- Lehman's gone.  - Oh, honey.

857
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,236
我本该料到英国那边会出问题的
I should have known the British were gonna be a problem.

858
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,863
两天前我和他们谈过 那时我应该察觉出言下之意的
I spoke to them two days ago. I should have read between the lines.

859
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:37,414
你不能独自承受一切 这件事涉及了太多人
You can't take all this on. There's a lot of other people involved.

860
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,417
是我的问题 因为我是财政部长
It's on me. I'm Treasury Secretary

861
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,961
在我的监管下 我国第四大投资银行
and the fourth-largest investment bank in the country

862
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,796
倒闭了
failed on my watch.

863
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,382
我是说...
I mean...

864
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,012
我不知道将来会发生什么
I don't know what's gonna happen.

865
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,266
我也想你
Miss you, too.

866
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:05,830
2008年9月15日 周一  早上6:30

867
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,230
哟 出租车!
Yo, taxi!

868
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,246
亚洲股市大幅下跌收市 

869
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:54,246
专家称:"Paulson终于让华尔街变得一文不值"

870
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,246
Jim 我现在在市中心
Jim, I'm in midtown.

871
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,916
电子指示器在...
The ticker is...

872
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,960
我看到的究竟是什么?
What the hell am I looking at?

873
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,380
Hank 没事
Hank, it's good.

874
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,220
"财政部和联邦储备局
"It is oddly reassuring

875
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,014
放弃雷曼兄弟的决定
"that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve

876
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,516
意想不到地让人感到舒心"
let Lehman Brothers fail."

877
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,643
好的 这条 这条
Okay, here it is. Here it is.

878
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,020
"政府的介入会被解读成
"Government intervention would have been seen

879
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,774
全球金融体系正处于极度动荡中
"as a sign of extreme peril in the global financial system

880
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,694
或是联邦管理当局的监管不力的标志
"or extreme weakness on the part of federal regulators."

881
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,071
该死的纽约时报
The New York fucking Times.

882
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,157
是啊 不仅是他们 每个人都这么说
Yeah, and it's not just them. It's everybody.

883
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,618
谢谢 议员 很感激你
Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it.

884
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,372
议会很喜欢
Congress is liking it.

885
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,207
我倒是不太确定他们是不是真这么高兴
I'm not sure they should be so happy about this,

886
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,377
不过他们觉得我们让雷曼退出是对的
but they like that we let Lehman go.

887
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:52,674
你态度强硬 你果敢 在这种时候 人们需要的就是这种态度
You stood strong. You've got brass balls. It's what people need at a time like this.

888
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,759
市场反应怎么样?
What is the market doing?

889
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,346
欧洲股指只出现小幅下跌 道琼斯指数也小幅下探了3%
Europe's only down a little. Dow Jones futures only off 3 %.

890
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,432
那你就得在新闻发布会上强调这点
So you need to build on this at the press conference.

891
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,810
你要告诉大家我们已经为雷曼兄弟做了我们能做的一切
The story is we did everything we could for Lehman.

892
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,562
- 我们的确做了  - 但是放弃的理由是...
- We did.  - And the takeaway is...

893
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,272
没有援助资金了
No more bailouts.

894
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,024
部长先生
Mr. Secretary.

895
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,818
我们应该如何解读发生在雷曼兄弟身上的事件?
How should we read what happened with Lehman?

896
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:16,573
解读成我认为维护市场的稳定和金融系统的有序
Read it as I think it's important to maintain the stability

897
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:20,243
是至关重要的
and orderliness of our financial system,

898
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,788
还有 呃 就是
and, um, the

899
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,585
我非常重视道德风险
moral hazard is something I don't take lightly.

900
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,837
- Paulson先生  - 部长 先生
- Mr. Paulson.  - Mr. Secretary, sir.

901
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,424
你认为现在的银行体系是否健全?
How do you see the health of the banking system today?

902
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,092
当今市场的运行
The way the markets are performing today,

903
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,595
是对于验证在极端情况下
it's a testament to how the financial industry has come together

904
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,473
整个金融行业是否能同心协力渡过难关的考验
in an extraordinary set of circumstances.

905
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,769
美国民众应该对金融系统的稳健和韧性
The American people can remain confident in the soundness and the resilience

906
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,439

908
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,194
怎么了?

909
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,322
道琼斯大幅下挫 已经下跌了400点了
Dow is falling off a cliff. Four hundred points already.

910

整个信贷市场也处于冻结状态

Goldman and Morgan Stanley are getting slammed by withdrawals.

912
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,287
雷曼事件正在危及他们

913
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,210
我得和总统谈谈我们该如何控制损失
I should talk to the President about how we'll contain the damage.

914
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,837
在你找总统谈话之前
Before you speak to the President,

915
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,798
我们还有个麻烦需要解决
we've got another problem.

916
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,967
是美国国际集团
AIG.

917
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,013
Geithner先生正在同美国国际集团探讨由企业主导的解决方案
Mr. Geithner is working with AIG on a private-sector solution

918
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:26,768
部长正非常谨慎地跟进他们的进展
and the Secretary is monitoring their progress very carefully.

919
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,855
他与国会领导者们也保持密切联系...
He's in close contact with the Congressional leadership, most...

920

White House wants a briefing on AIG.

921
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,277
你知道的比我们多 我们有的信息 你也有
You're more informed about that than we are. We've got the same information you do.

922
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,322
不 我们并不认为雷曼兄弟破产
No, we don't believe that Lehman's bankruptcy

923
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,449
足以整垮整个华尔街
is taking down all of Wall Street.

924
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,826
好吧 那你怎么解释...
Okay, but how do you explain...

925
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,914
美国国际集团的情况恶化的原因在于...
The AIG situation may have been, you know, exacerbated by the...

926
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,749
还有Barney Frank的办公室
And Barney Frank's office.

927
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,628
- 你好  - 突然发生? 
- Yeah.  - A surprise?

928
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:56,047
不 美国国际集团已经挣扎了...
No, AIG has been struggling...

929
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,133
你们这帮人怎么没在6个月前阻止他们?
Why didn't you guys head off this situation six months ago?

930
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,096
因为我们没有魔杖 Doug
Because the requisite magic wand wasn't available, Doug.

931
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,724
如果我们找到了 我们会在第一时间通知你
But if we do find one, you will be among the very first to know.

932
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,436
Blankfei在四号线 紧急

934
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,232
嗨 Lloyd
Hey, Lloyd.

935
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,693
这该死的英国破产管理人
The goddamn British bankruptcy administrator

936
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,112
把所有雷曼客户的资产都冻结了
froze all of Lehman's customer accounts.

937
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,531
在你下决定之前你没有和他们协商好吗?
You didn't square this with the British before you did it?

938
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,074
Geithner 5号线
Geithner on five.

939
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,703
人们陷入了恐慌 他们拿不到钱
People are freaking out. They can't get their money.

940
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,539
不是投资者们 是客户们
Not investors, clients.

941
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,166
如果消费者觉得他们的钱放在雷曼那儿不安全
If customers think their money wasn't safe with Lehman,

942
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,793
他们也不会相信我们
they're not gonna trust us either.

943
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:37,005
没人愿意和我们做生意
No one will do business with us.

944
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,007
你得等我一下
You're gonna have to hang on.

945
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,133
Tim啊
Tim.

946
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,886
Dan和穆迪投资评级机构通话了 他们今晚要下调对美国国际集团的评级
Dan spoke to Moody's. They're downgrading AIG tonight.

947
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,097
虽说这事儿迟早会发生 但雷曼事件加速了下调的进程
Would have happened anyway, but Lehman put the whole thing into hyperdrive.

948
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,724
会降到哪一级?
How far down are they?

949
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,309
法国财政部长 6号线
French Finance Minister on six.

950
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,019
他们不知道
They don't know.

951
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,938
我们在努力挽救
We're working on it.

952
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,190
Christine啊
Christine.

953
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,067
你怎么能让这事情发生在雷曼身上?
How could you let this happen with Lehman?

954
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:59,736
Christine Lagarde 法国财政部长

955
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,736
你到底怎么想的?
What on earth were you thinking?

956
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,530
我们已做了我们该做的一切 Christine
We did everything we could, Christine.

957
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:06,701
你默许了雷曼破产 Hank 这大错特错
You allowed it to fail, Hank. It was a horrifying mistake.

958
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,287
这会给整个欧洲带来灾难性的结果
It is having catastrophic consequences all over Europe.

959
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,915
美国国际集团的情况会变得更糟
And AIG would be even worse.

960
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:15,627
整个欧洲银行都与美国国际集团往来密切
The European banks have tremendous exposure to AIG.

961
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,838
我们希望从你这儿得到保证 你不会让它像雷曼一样破产
We need assurance you will not fail to act, as you did with Lehman.

962
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,633
这不仅仅是美国的问题
It is not just an American problem.

963
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,010
非常感谢...
Thank you so much for...

964
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,386
是John Mack
John Mack.

965
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,848
- John  - John 一号线
- John.  - John, one.

966
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,436
雷曼的破产正连累着我们
The fallout from Lehman is killing us.

967
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,357
做空者都在抛售我们的股票 我们已经跌了10%
The short-sellers are all over us. We're down 10 % already.

968
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,734
你们不知道外面情况有多糟
You guys have no idea what's going on out here.

969
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,278
你的收入怎么样?
How are your earnings?

970
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,781
很好 我们准备周五公布消息
Strong. We're gonna announce Friday.

971
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,907
现在就公布
Announce now.

972
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,869
好了 Lloyd 不好意思
Okay, Lloyd, sorry.

973
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,122
Hank 如果储户们发现他们不能从雷曼的账户上取款
Hank, if depositors see they can't get their assets out of Lehman,

974
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,085
接下来就会有大批人从各投资银行撤资
the next step is gonna be a massive pullout from all the investment banks.

975
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,586
Jeff Immelt 通用电气
Jeff Immelt from GE.

976
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,465
天呐 Immelt为什么打电话给你?
Jesus, what's Immelt calling you for?

977
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,802
我得挂了 Jeff
I have to go. Jeff.

978
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,595
你得知道现在时态变成什么样子
You gotta know what's going on out here.

979
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:11,224
Jeffery Immelt 世界最大公司 通用电气 主席兼首席执行官

980
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,224
我们每天的营运现金流出现了问题
We're having trouble funding our day-to-day operations.

981
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,978
我们的财务部影响其他各个部门
Our finance division is infecting the rest of our business.

982
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,562
通用电气?
General Electric?

983
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,983
这件事情波及的不仅仅是华尔街的公司
This thing is spreading way past Wall Street.

984
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,193
我明白没有人想去碰次级贷款
I get that nobody wants to touch mortgages,

985
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,822
但我们要制造飞机 引擎 灯泡
but we're making planes and engines, light bulbs.

986
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,199
我们是家健康的企业
We're a healthy company.

987
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,994
如果我们不能有充足的日常营运资金来运营公司
If we can't finance our day-to-day operations,

988
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,330
那我们在美国所有的业务都有可能无法运作
every business in America's gonna be shutting down.

989
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,633
- 美国国际集团股价多少?  - 收盘价2美元
- Where's AIG?  - It closed at $2.

990
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:49,512
Tim觉得我们得采取有力行动 Ben和我都同意了
Tim thinks we need to do something big. Ben agrees, and so do I.

991
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,514
我们能做什么? 美国国际集团又不是银行
What can we do? AIG's not even a bank.

992
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,519
联邦政府会在非常紧急时期借钱给非银行机构 
The Fed can lend to non-banks under unusual and exigent circumstances.

993
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,856
我们考虑接手80%美国国际集团的股份
We're thinking of taking over 80% of the company.

994
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,111
Hank 我们不能这么做
Hank, we can't.

995
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,905
今天上午我们还向全体公民普及了道德风险观念
This morning we were lecturing the entire country on moral hazard.

996
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,867
美国国际集团有抵押品 他们有资产
AIG has collateral. They have assets.

997
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,412
雷曼兄弟没有 我们不能借钱给一个无底洞
Lehman didn't. We couldn't lend into a hole.

998
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,955
两者情况不同
It's not the same story.

999
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,832
没人会在乎这些
Nobody's gonna care.

1000
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,044
这又是一桩没有监管的注资行为
It's another bailout with no legislation.

1001
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,004
国会会大做文章 整个国家也会抓狂的
The Hill's gonna go crazy. The country's gonna go crazy.

1002
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,841
我们早上乘坐的班机是从美国国际集团租赁的
The plane that we flew in on this morning, leased from AIG.

1003
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,093
在市中心的建设 是美国国际集团承接的
Construction downtown, AIG.

1004
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:35,099
寿险 8100万份保单 账面价值1.9兆亿元
Life insurance, 81 million policies with a face value of 1.9 trillion,

1005
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,894
上百亿的教师退休金 美国国际集团的资产到处都是
billions of dollars in teachers' pensions, it's everywhere.

1006
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,521
你想要大而不倒? 就是这个了
You want too big to fail? Here it is.

1007
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,442
你有更好的主意吗? 我可是听着呢
You got a better idea? The suggestion box is wide open.

1008
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,951
我也知道现在说这个不太恰当
I hate to do this right now,

1009
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,329
但我得明天一大早得召开新闻发布会
but I'm gonna have to have a press call first thing,

1010
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,331
但我真不知道该对他们说什么
and I really don't know what I'm gonna tell them.

1011
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:03,836
告诉他们雷曼拖累了美国国际集团 同时兑现债务抵押债券 
Tell them Lehman exacerbated AIG. The simultaneous payouts of CDOs

1012
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,380
和信用违约掉期几乎要压垮...
and credit default swaps put catastrophic pressure on...

1013
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,049
再往前追述一点
Go back further.

1014
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,136
全球的投资的资金池...
The global pool of investment capital...

1015
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,932
她得用英文来发布 从房地产业主开始说起
She has to do this in English. Start with the homeowners.

1016
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,684
好吧 好吧 你该这么解释
Okay, okay, here's how you explain it.

1017
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:25,900
华尔街开始将房产抵押贷款捆绑 形成住房抵押贷款证券
Wall Street started bundling home loans together, mortgage-backed securities,

1018
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,403
再分成一份一份卖给投资者
and selling slices of those bundles to investors.

1019
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,447
他们借此谋取暴利
And they were making big money,

1020
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,117
于是他们就开始催促放贷者 说道
so they started pushing the lenders, saying,

1021
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,785
"快点 我们需要更多的贷款"
"Come on, we need more loans."

1022
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,413
放贷者已经将把钱放给信用等级高的借款人
The lenders had already given loans to borrowers with good credit,

1023
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,375
于是他们退而求其次 降低标准
so they go bottom-feeding. They lower their criteria.

1024
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:47,171
以前你需要有620积分的信用评分 加上20%的首付
Before, you needed a credit score of 620 and a down payment of 20%.

1025
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,966
现在 500就可以了 零首付
Now, they'll settle for 500, no money down.

1026
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,051
至于买方 走在大街上的普通人
And the buyer, the regular guy on the street,

1027
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,928
以为专家们知道他们在干什么
assumes that the experts know what they're doing.

1028
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,597
他自言自语道 "如果银行愿意借我钱
He's saying to himself, "If the bank's willing to loan me money,

1029
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,432
"那我肯定还得起"
"I must be able to afford it."

1030
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,560
所以他开始实现自己的美国梦
So he reaches for the American dream.

1031
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,978
他买下了房子
He buys that house.

1032
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,481
银行知道债券挂钩垃圾贷款是非常危险的
The banks knew securities based on shitbag mortgages were risky.

1033
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,816
你得强调 "垃圾"这个词
You'll work on "shitbag."

1034
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,403
为了控制负面影响 银行会开始购买一种保险
So to control their downside, the banks started buying a kind of insurance.

1035
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,447
如果抵押贷款违约 保险公司买单
If mortgages default, insurance company pays,

1036
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,241
违约掉期
default swap.

1037
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,537
银行为他们的潜在损失投保 使报表中不会出现风险
The banks insure their potential losses to move the risk off their books

1038
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,622
这样他们可以进行更多的投资 赚更多的钱
so they can invest more, make more money.

1039
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,833
如果很多公司投保
And while a lot of companies insured this stuff,

1040
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,378
那么就有一家公司蠢得要承担难以置信的风险
one was dumb enough to take on an almost unbelievable amount of risk.

1041
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,797
- 美国国际集团  - 你要强调"蠢"
- AIG.  - And you'll work on "dumb."

1042
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,049
那如果他们问我为什么他们会这么做呢?
And when they ask me why they did that?

1043
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,385
- 手续费  - 上亿的手续费
- Fees.  - Hundreds of millions in fees.

1044
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,013
美国国际集团估计房地产市场会继续走高
AIG figured the housing market would just keep going up,

1045
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,431
可是意外发生了
but then the unexpected happens.

1046
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,683
房价下跌
Housing prices go down.

1047
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,560
这穷光蛋买了他的梦想之屋
The poor bastard who bought his dream house,

1048
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,729
这恼人的抵押贷款利率不停上升
the teaser rate on his mortgage runs out.

1049
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,190
他的还款额上升 他违约了
His payments go up. He defaults.

1050
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:51,527
次级抵押证券出了问题 美国国际集团必须偿还掉期
Mortgage-backed securities tank. AIG has to pay off the swaps,

1051
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:55,281
全球 同一时间 所有的保单违约了
all of them, all over the world, at the same time.

1052
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,326
美国国际集团付不起了 入不敷出
AIG can't pay. AIG goes under.

1053
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:03,581
每一家他们承保的银行都在同一天要求兑现保费
Every bank they insure books massive losses on the same day.

1054
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,751
他们都入不敷出了
And then they all go under.

1055
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,669
都倒闭了
It all comes down.

1056
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,506
整个金融系统?
The whole financial system?

1057
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:22,433
那我该怎么说 如果他们问我为什么这件事情没有得到妥善监管?
And what do I say when they ask me why it wasn't regulated?

1058
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,061
没人想去监管
No one wanted to.

1059
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,315
经济形势表现得太好了
We were making too much money.

1060
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:43,996
你得强调 "经济形势表现得太好了"
You'll work on "We were making too much money."

1061
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,345
喂 Hank 呃...
Hey, Hank. Um...

1062
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,850
这些很温和 不过很有效
These are really mild, but they work.

1063
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,856
我知道你信基督教科学派 不吃药(该派认为物质是虚幻的 疾病只能靠调整精神来治疗)
I know the whole Christian Scientist thing, that you don't take medicine.

1064
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,443
不过你需要睡眠
But you need to sleep.

1065
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:21,867
- Jim...  - Hank 不仅仅是为了你自己 好吗?
- Jim...  - Hank, not just for your own sake. Okay?

1066
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,833
你看起来不太好
You don't look so good.

1067
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:38,384
就在几分钟前 CNN得到确切消息 美联储正在协调
Just minutes ago, CNN has confirmed that the Federal Reserve is negotiating

1068
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,970
拯救保险巨头美国国际集团
to rescue insurance giant AIG.

1069
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:45,349
协调计划包括一份850亿美金的临时贷款
The negotiations could include an $85 billion temporary loan

1070
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,643
用以延缓美国国际集团面临的倒闭
to stave off AIG's imminent collapse.

1071
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,145
朋友们 这可是个爆炸新闻
This is a blockbuster, folks.

1072
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,522
差不多昨天的这时候 很多在华尔街的人
About this time last night, many on Wall Street

1073
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,774
担心今天会是一团乱
were fearing total disaster today.

1074
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,570
于是 联邦政府又一次注资拯救另一家华尔街巨头
So, another federal bailout of another Wall Street giant.

1075
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,448
还有 我们提到的 是一起重大的 重大的金融消息
Again, as we mentioned, big, big financial news.

1076
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,868
并且这条消息影响到每一个买过401k养老保险计划的人
And this affects almost everyone out there who has a 401k.

1077
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:08,331
这条消息在股市收市的三个半小时后发布出来...
The news comes about three and a half hours after the stock exchange closed on...

1078
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,082
哦上帝啊
Motherfucker.

1079
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:15,296
我们现在马上把时间交给Ali Velshi来看看这次危机的底线在哪里 Ali
We wanna go straight right now to Ali Velshi to kind of give us a bottom line on this, Ali.

1080
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,547
然后我们来看看这次危机是不是会持续下去...
And then we're gonna get a lot more in depth...

1081
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,966
美国国际集团得到了收于850亿的救援...
AIG securing an 85...

1082
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,968
信贷市场的资金流动依旧很少
The credit markets are still frozen solid.

1083
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:23,471
如果我们继续想这些公司注资
We keep dumping money into these companies

1084
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,765
那么市场会慢慢稳定下来
so the markets will stabilize,

1085
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,641
除此之外没别的办法了
and nothing helps.

1086
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,810
我们不能一直这样
We can't keep doing this.

1087
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:34,940
我们无条件的救了贝尔斯登 又无条件的救了美国国际集团
We rescued Bear with no legislation, AIG with no legislation.

1088
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,778
人们会认为房利美和房地美在诱售
People think Fannie and Freddie was a bait-and-switch.

1089
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:42,365
你以为我愿意这样做吗 但是他们的状况都很特殊
I don't like it any more than you do, but they were exceptional situations.

1090
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,451
现在的情况要求
This situation demands an endgame

1091
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,913
那些公司不能再依靠联邦政府的协助
that does not rely on unilateral action from the Fed.

1092
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,331
这才是民主
This is a democracy.

1093
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,958
我们不能垂帘听政在幕后操纵
We cannot be men behind the curtain pulling the strings.

1094
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,671
我们需要找到一个完善的解决方法来修复整个金融体系
We need some kind of an overall solution that heals the entire system.

1095
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,715
并且是通过合法的方式进行
And it has to be legitimate.

1096
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,342
我们一再推迟了向国会汇报这些事情
We've been putting off going to Congress.

1097
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,094
离大选只有两个月了
It's two months before an election.

1098
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:08,891
选民们不可能投票给一个使得整个银行系统崩溃的政府
They can't vote yes to a massive bailout of the entire banking system.

1099
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,434
- 选民们不可能再选择我们  - Hank...
- They'd never get reelected.  - Hank...

1100
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:14,438
我们去国会说清楚我们已经对现在的局势
We go to Congress, publically state we don't have the firepower

1101
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,567
无能为力了 但是他们说不行
to control this anymore, and then they say no,

1102
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:22,988
这种场景真是一场噩梦
that is really the nightmare scenario.

1103
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:26,826
噩梦场景已经出现了 我的朋友
The nightmare scenario's already here, my friend.

1104
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,245
而且我们深陷其中
We're in it.

1105
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,057
P你还好吗
P.

1106
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,738
你不能把所有事情都自己扛下来
You can't put this all on your own shoulders.

1107
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,156
我们已经别无选择了
We're running out of options.

1108
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,994
那么你就继续尝试别的方法 这才是你该做的
Then you just keep trying. That's what you do.

1109
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,079
最后肯定会有办法解决的
Eventually something's gonna work.

1110
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,916
我都不知道 是不是这样的了
I'm not sure that that is true anymore.

1111
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:01,587
但是这世界上没有一家银行是有足够的钱去应对
There's not a bank in the world that has enough money in its vault

1112
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,758
储户的提款要求 银行都是建立在信用基础上的
to pay its depositors. It's all built on trust.

1113
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:11,430
而且 Wendy 我们已经岌岌可危了
And, Wendy, we are so very close.

1114
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,395
摩根斯坦利 高盛已经在悬崖边缘
Morgan Stanley, Goldman are an inch away.

1115
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,026
如果别的银行不再信任他们 如果他们停止了银行间的拆借
If the other banks stop trusting them, if they pull back on interbank lending,

1116
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,445
他们会立刻破产
it's over in a matter of hours.

1117
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,200
而且一旦破产开始了就不会停下来 会有连锁反应
And from there it goes too fast to stop, a run,

1118
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:36,247
而且到时候破产的就不仅仅是银行了 整个金融系统都会崩塌
and not just on one bank, I mean on the whole system.

1119
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:40,376
然后大众就会问 "我的钱安全吗?" 
And average people wondering, "Is my money safe?"

1120
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,963
他们开始提现
They start pulling their cash.

1121
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:50,636
再然后 银行门口就会排起长队 ATM机就会被挤爆
And after that, lines outside the banks, smashed ATMs.

1122
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,472
再过几个星期
A couple of weeks,

1123
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,351
银行里就没有钱可以提了
there's no milk in the store.

1124
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,520
这已经是本周第二次
For the second time this week,

1125
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,564
华尔街出现了大量的抛售
there was a massive sell-off on Wall Street,

1126
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,025
道琼斯工业指数暴跌超过450点
the Dow Jones Industrial's freefalling some 450 points

1127
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,321
因为消息称纳税人的资金用来救援美国国际集团保险公司
on news of a taxpayer-funded bailout of the AIG insurance company.

1128
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,490
五大投行中三家已经倒闭了
Three of the five investment banks are gone.

1129
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,909
全国最大的抵押贷款机构也倒闭了
The country's biggest mortgage lender is gone.

1130
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,704
房利美 房地美也已经收归国有
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, brought under government control.

1131
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,499
金融系统现在算是保住了 但是能维持多久?
The financial system is holding right now, but for how long?

1132
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,960
全部人力 全部资源都被完全利用
All the king's horses and all the king's men

1133
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,087
一定保持金融体系的顺利运行
are being brought to bear to keep this thing together.

1134
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,533
- 嗨 Tim  - 我在华尔街 Hank
- Hi, Tim.  - I'm on the Street, Hank,

1135
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,286
人们正要赶着去上班
and people are just going about their business.

1136
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,081
他们完全不知道这里的一切都将化为乌有
They have no idea the whole thing is about to fall down.

1137
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,628
我们不得不向国会报告了 我们已经别无选择
We're gonna have to go to Congress. We don't have a choice anymore.

1138
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,837
好吧
Okay.

1139
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,464
你觉得还要多久他们会做出决定?
How fast do you think you can get them to move?

1140
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,716
我想至少也要几天
It's gonna be at least a couple days.

1141
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,178
高盛和摩根斯坦利已经快不行了 
Goldman and Morgan Stanley are going down now.

1142
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:15,638
我们今天必须做点什么
We gotta do something today.

1143
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,847
比如说?
Like what?

1144
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,475
市场不像投行一样 对吗?
The market doesn't like investment banks, right?

1145
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,769
所有的商业模型都拿那些钱束手无策 
The money's saying "fuck you" to the whole business model.

1146
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:22,895
是的
Yeah.

1147
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,065
是的 那让他们变成商业银行
Yeah, so merge them with commercial banks,

1148
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,651
把投行变成普通的由联邦政府监管的商业银行
turn them into regular banks regulated by the Fed.

1149
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,152
他们就能动用储户的钱了
They can use depositors' cash.

1150
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,862
这样他们就能通过贴现窗口
It will give them access to the discount window.

1151
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,990
向政府以较低的利率借款
It's cheap government cash.

1152
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,826
- 你想让他们变得更大吗?  - 这也是没办法的办法 Hank
- You wanna make them bigger?  - It's a trade-off, Hank.

1153
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,954
好处是他们可以逐渐稳定下来
The upside is it'll stabilize them.

1154
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,583
坏处是
The downside is,

1155
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,337
对的 他们会变得出奇的庞大
yeah, they'll be really fucking big.

1156
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,005
去做吧 Tim
Do it, Tim.

1157
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,259
快去做
Godspeed.

1158
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,196
嗯 给我接Blankfein
Uh, get me Blankfein.

1159
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,117
Lloyd 打电话给Vikram Pandit 告诉他你想合并
Lloyd, call Vikram Pandit, talk to him about a merger.

1160
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,244
Tim 我们正在尽全力想办法
Tim, we're looking at all our options.

1161
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,872
你已经走投无路了 Lloyd 你的银行只能这样做
You don't have options, Lloyd. There's a run on your bank.

1162
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,582
你需要钱 花旗又有存款
You need money. Citi has deposits.

1163
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,335
花旗现在一团糟 你这里有条不紊 打电话给Pandit
Citi's a mess, you're organized. Call Pandit.

1164
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:38,804
怎么了
Yeah.

1165
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,848
我希望你可以考虑考虑和摩根斯坦利合并
I want you to look at merging with Morgan Stanley.

1166
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,058
什么 你在开玩笑吧? 我刚刚买了贝尔斯登
What, are you kidding me? I just bought Bear.

1167
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,518
我们仍然在想办法让它开始好转
We're still trying to make that work.

1168
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,395
你没有买贝尔斯登 它几乎算是送你的
You didn't buy Bear. You got Bear as a Christmas present.

1169
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,649
市场现在一团糟 Jamie 跟John Mack聊聊
The market's a fucking disaster, Jamie. Talk to John Mack.

1170
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,610
嘿 Geithner说我们可以谈谈合并的事情
Hey, Geithner says we should talk about a merger.

1171
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,529
- 你想这样做吗?  - 当然不想
- You wanna do a deal?  - No.

1172
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,698
那他为什么要让我打给你?
Then why the fuck did he tell me to call you?

1173
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,867
我得到命令去帮助你们公司
I'm under orders to try and help you.

1174
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,078
你是个王子 Jamie 真的是王子
You're a prince, Jamie. A real prince.

1175
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,503
很显然 有人认为把我们的公司进行合并是一个不错的方法
Apparently, some people seem to think combining our firms would be a good idea.

1176
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,381
我想说我对于这通电话受宠若惊
I want you to know I'm flattered by this call.

1177
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,677
Vikram 我没有奉承你的意思 相信我
Vikram, I'm not trying to flatter you, believe me.

1178
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,262
Geithener打电话来了
Geithner's calling.

1179
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,931
一摊子破事
Here comes goddamn eHarmony.

1180
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,975
嘿 猜猜看 Jamie一点都不感兴趣
Hey, guess what. Jamie's not interested.

1181
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,271
试试Wachovia
Do Wachovia.

1182
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,315
他们是闭着眼睛进行抵押贷款买卖的
They were writing mortgages with their eyes closed.

1183
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,442
Tim 那只是一块垃圾三明治 忘了他吧
Tim, it's a shit sandwich. Forget it.

1184
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,283
我在四小时之内是赶不到你那边的
I haven't been able to reach you for four hours.

1185
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,787
这在今天这样的日子里肯定是做不到的
That is totally fucking unacceptable on a day like today.

1186
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,081
我不得不让我的公司去评估高盛合并事宜
I had to run my team through the Goldman proposal.

1187
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,458
没用的
It's not gonna work.

1188
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,878
你已经联系好高盛了 却没给我说一声?
You passed on Goldman without even talking to me?

1189
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,881
我不需要在我的资产负债表上多出1兆亿的美元
I don't need another trillion dollars on my balance sheet.

1190
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,722
下次我打给你的时候 记得接电话
Next time I call, pick up.

1191
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,850
去死吧
Fucker.

1192
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,479
问题就在于那些不良资产 我们把他们买过来就好了
The problem is the toxic assets. Let's just buy them.

1193
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,397
哦 可以称为现金换垃圾
Ooh. We'll call it Cash for Trash.

1194
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,067
当市场稳定下来了 我们再把这些垃圾倾销掉
When the market stabilizes, we'll unload them.

1195
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,194
希望是这样 财政部能够把这些钱讨回来
Hopefully, Treasury will get its money back.

1196
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,738
- 这是破杯计划的一部分吗?  - 基本上是
- Is that in the Break the Glass plan?  - Basically.

1197
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,741
我的这份是不是少了几页 有谁能告诉我余下的几页...
My copy's missing some pages. Could someone else show me the rest of...

1198
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,493
这个是简洁版
It's succinct.

1199
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,663
我们在国会只有一次机会
We've got one shot with Congress.

1200
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,291
你觉得国会会根据这三页纸就签署一份法案吗?
You want them to write a piece of legislation based on three pages?

1201
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,417
听着 朋友们
Look, guys,

1202
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,128
购买不良资产肯定是一个噩梦
buying toxic assets is gonna be a nightmare.

1203
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,505
没人知道这些东西到底值几个子
Nobody knows what the stuff's worth.

1204
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,341
也许这些不良资产永远都理不清 银行马上就要倒闭了
It'll take forever to untangle. These banks are going down now.

1205
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,509
那我们能怎么做?
So what do we do?

1206
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,929
你想要让信用市场继续运作 是吗? 你希望银行能够继续放贷?
You wanna unfreeze credit, right? You want the banks to lend people money?

1207
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,682
- 这就是我们想要看到的  - 那就给他们钱让他们放贷
- That's the goal.  - So give them money to lend.

1208
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,144
资产注入?
Capital injections?

1209
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,271
Dan 摆脱别说傻话
Dan, come on.

1210
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,856
我不相信你竟然说出了那个带 "N" 的字眼
I can't believe you're pulling out the "N" word.

1211
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,148
我没有说要将银行国有化
I'm not saying nationalize the banks.

1212
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,569
我说的是把有问题的银行隔离开 然后进行注资
I'm saying isolate the ones that are really in trouble and make an investment.

1213
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,864
- 这做法不是美国人做的  - 当然也不是共和党人做的
- It's un-American.  - It's sure un-Republican.

1214
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:05,200
你让政府变成了一个股东
You'd make the government a stockholder.

1215
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,996
什么 我们是不是需要告诉他们怎么去经营 买哪些卖哪些?
What, do we tell them how to manage themselves, what to buy and sell?

1216
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,957
像经营邮局一样经营他们? 是那样就太好了
Run them like the post office? 'Cause that works like a dream.

1217
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,961
这只是暂时措施 我们可以是没有投票权的股东
We make it temporary. We make ourselves non-voting stockholders.

1218
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,381
你不能捧着一叠叠的钞票送到银行里
You can't just hand the banks massive piles of cash.

1219
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,049
没人会去理会这些的
Nobody's gonna go for it.

1220
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,012
对于共和党来说这是资产国有化 对于民主党来说这就是救助
To the Republicans it's nationalization. To the Democrats it's a bailout.

1221
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,680
而且银行会很生气的
And the banks are gonna go ballistic.

1222
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:31,810
抱歉 Dan 这是不可能的 很欣赏你的创造性思维
Sorry, Dan, not gonna happen. Kudos for out-of-the-box thinking.

1223
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,314
Neel 如果我们实行你的计划购买那些资产
Neel, if we go with your plan to buy the assets,

1224
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,565
我们会花多少钱?
how much is it gonna cost?

1225
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,025
那是不可能的
It won't work.

1226
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,612
听着 计划只有3页长 而且很空洞
Look, the plan is three pages long, totally vague.

1227
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:46,074
如果购买资产没有用的话 我们会用你的国有化计划 好吗?
If buying the assets doesn't work, we'll nationalize the banks for you, okay?

1228
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:50,120
- 要多少钱?  - 保守估计 需要一万亿
- How much? - To be safe, maybe a trillion.

1229
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,373
国会是不会批准一万亿的法案的 永远不会
The Congress will never do a trillion, never.

1230
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,044
有11万亿美元的住房抵押债券
There's $11 trillion in residential mortgages.

1231
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:02,424
还有三万亿的商业债券 一共是十四万亿 对吗?
There's three trillion in commercial mortgages. That's 14 trillion, right?

1232
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,552
别忘了5%的违约率
You gotta figure about 5% default rate.

1233
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,139
14万亿的5%是
5 % of 14 trillion is

1234
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,225
七千万美元
$700 billion.

1235
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,773
这也比一万亿要好
It's better than a trillion.

1236
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,738
让法案通过的唯一方法只能是吓得他们屁滚尿流
The only way to get this done is to just scare them shitless.

1237
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,033
这很简单 我自己都吓傻了
That should be easy. I'm scared shitless myself.

1238
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,033
2008年9月18日 星期四 雷曼兄弟破产后三天

1239
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:43,382
Barney Frank(马萨诸塞州代表) 众议院金融管理委员会主席

1240
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,382
问题资产剥离计划?
Troubled Asset Relief Program?

1241
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:44,883
我们称他为TARP 
TARP, we're calling it.

1242
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:48,261
这只是你们的草案?
This is your draft of the bill?

1243
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,722
这只是一个修订本 肯定的
Subject to revision, certainly.

1244
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:56,019
Chris Dodd(康乃迪克州代表) 参议院银行委员会主席

1245
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,019
我只拿到了三页纸 我是不是漏掉了什么?
I've only got three pages here. Am I missing something?

1246
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,438
没有
No.

1247
01:11:58,532 --> 01:12:02,609
Richard Shelby(阿拉巴马州代表) 参议院银行委员会副主席

1248
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,609
你在着急寻找的只是一张大额的空白支票
You're just looking for a big blank check in a hurry.

1249
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,321
这都是为了银行 你也不想
It's all for the banks. You don't want a penny

1250
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,615
让布什总统失去他的总统位置
for the average Joe that's about to lose his house?

1251
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,784
整件事完全没有任何监管
There's not a scrap of oversight built into this,

1252
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,620
钱没有给银行 也没有给你 只是为了解决这个情况
not for the banks or for you, for that matter.

1253
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:18,458
你希望我们简简单单的拿出7000万来相信你?
You want us to simply hand over $700 billion and trust you?

1254
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,752
Nancy Pelosi(加利福尼亚州代表) 众议院发言人

1255
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,752
你怎么可能没有想到我们的反应?
How is it possible you didn't see this coming?

1256
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,463
如果你们想让我再说一遍的话 我没有问题
If you wanna rewind the tape, we can do that.

1257
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,800
但是现在 最重要的是我们没时间了
But right now, the one thing we don't have is time.

1258
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,511
我们今晚需要一个决议来稳定市场
We need an announcement tonight to calm the market.

1259
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,221
我们需要法案在下周通过
We need legislation next week.

1260
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:38,770
我学术研究的内容只有一个
I spent my entire academic career

1261
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,232
就是大萧条
studying the Great Depression.

1262
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,947
大萧条的起因是因为股票市场的崩盘
The Depression may have started because of a stock market crash,

1263
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:53,702
但是打击到实体经济的是信用体系的瓦解
but what hit the general economy was a disruption of credit,

1264
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,707
普通群众无法借钱去做任何事 没法卖房子
average citizens unable to borrow money to do anything, to buy a home,

1265
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,626
没法做生意 没法进货
start a business, stock their shelves.

1266
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,339
信用是建立现在经济的基础
Credit has the ability to build a modern economy,

1267
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:11,053
但是信用缺乏也可以毁掉经济 迅雷不及掩耳的毁灭
but lack of credit has the power to destroy it, swiftly and absolutely.

1268
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:19,061
如果我们不能做出明确的决断 我们将会重演上世纪30年代的大萧条
If we do not act boldly and immediately, we will replay the Depression of the 1930s,

1269
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:23,982
只是这次情况会更糟 更糟
only this time it will be far, far worse.

1270
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,907
如果我们现在不做这些 我们的经济在周一就完了
We don't do this now, we won't have an economy on Monday.

1271
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,666
Geithner的电话
Geithner.

1272
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,507
我们把议案交到国会了
We took the proposal down to Congress.

1273
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,758
他们会通过吗?
Are they gonna go for it?

1274
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,551
他们不喜欢那么短的议案
They didn't like the fact that it was short.

1275
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,303
我想简单明了可以加分的
I thought concise was a plus.

1276
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,765
他们觉得这样太轻薄或者太傲慢或者别的什么
They thought it was flimsy or arrogant or something.

1277
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,684
我不知道他们怎么想 但是他们不会通过的
I don't know what they think. They couldn't get past it.

1278
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,104
市场已经无法控制了 他们否决这份议案
The market's in a death spiral. They're gonna sink the bill

1279
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,939
因为这份议案太短了?
because the proposal is too fucking short?

1280
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,567
他们正在研究 他们会把他弄得长一点
They're working on it. They're gonna make it longer,

1281
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,528
加入一些其他东西
among other things.

1282
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,949
好吧 告诉我你已经有进展了
Look, just tell me you got something.

1283
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,955
不 不 我一点进展也没有
No. No, we're nowhere.

1284
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,540
还有谁可以帮助摩根斯坦利?
Who's left for Morgan Stanley?

1285
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,794
中国投资有限公司
China Investment Corporation.

1286
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,047
嗯 或者是三菱集团
Uh, maybe Mitsubishi.

1287
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,716
不 日本人是不会做这笔生意的
No, the Japanese will never do this deal.

1288
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,301
那高盛有什么进展?
How about Goldman?

1289
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,138
高盛找到了联银行 但是他们被拒绝了
Goldman's looking at Wachovia, but they're so fucked,

1290
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,640
就连John Mack都不屑一顾
even John Mack turned up his nose.

1291
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,936
你必须让议案通过
You gotta get that bill passed.

1292
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,566
- 我在努力了  - 那就再努力一点 拜托了
- I'm pushing.  - Well, push harder. Please.

1293
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,280
这不会有用的 Hank
This isn't working, Hank.

1294
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,254
Hank 怎么了?
Hank?

1295
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,506
能让我单独待一会儿吗?
Could you excuse me a moment?

1296
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,866
2008年9月21日 雷曼兄弟破产后第六天

1297
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,866
哦 我的上帝呀 高先生 高先生
Oh, my God. Gao, Gao.

1298
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,411
对于这件事我很抱歉 但是我们无能为力
I am so sorry about this. There's nothing we can do.

1299
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:45,332
这里是纽约 你知道 我们很高兴我们还能在扬基体育馆买一杯啤酒
It's New York, you know. We're lucky we can still buy a beer at Yankee Stadium.

1300
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:48,168
别担心 反正我迟早都会退出的
Don't worry about it. I should quit anyway.

1301
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,962
当你准备好了 我们就进去
When you're ready, we'll be inside.

1302
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,051
有什么进展吗?
Is there any movement there?

1303
01:15:56,135 --> 01:16:00,639
他们给了一个低的离谱的价格 我假装我没听见
They made an extremely low opening offer. I pretended I didn't hear it.

1304
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,976
如果摩根斯坦利的问题没有解决 那市场就不能在周一开市
The markets can't open Monday without a resolution of Morgan Stanley.

1305
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,479
我们真的很需要你做一个决定
We really need you to do a deal.

1306
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,898
- 你打电话给Jamie  - 我打过Jamie了
- You need to call Jamie.  - I called Jamie.

1307
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,150
他对我们没兴趣 难度太大了
He doesn't want us. There's too much overlap.

1308
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,568
我们已经跟他说过了 他会同意的
We've spoken to him. He'll do it.

1309
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,529
为了什么 为了美元? 我为什么要这么做?
For what, a dollar? Why would I do that?

1310
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,658
我这里还有中投和三菱集团求着要我呢
I got China Investment and Mitsubishi kicking my tires.

1311
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:23,203
我知道这些家伙 他们不可能及时作出决定的
I know those guys. They're not gonna close a deal in time.

1312
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,414
我们希望你打电话给Jamie
We want you to call Jamie.

1313
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,625
让我问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

1314
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:33,505
因为美国国际集团 雷曼和贝尔斯登的事情 已经有3万5千人失业了
35,000 jobs just disappeared in this city between AIG, Lehman and Bear.

1315
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:38,176
如果我们跟Jamie达成协议 他会裁掉2万名摩根斯坦利员工
We make a deal with Jamie, he'll fire 20,000 Morgan Stanley employees.

1316
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,178
你觉得这是一个好办法吗?
You think that's good public policy?

1317
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,682
John 我们关注的是整个金融体系的安全
John, we are looking at the whole system here.

1318
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,350
中国人走了
The Chinese are leaving.

1319
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,185
高先生发现我们还在与三菱集团谈判
Gao found out we're also talking to Mitsubishi.

1320
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,937
我要走了
I gotta go.

1321
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,607
好的 把黑柳找来 再找一个日语翻译
All right, get me Kuroyanagi and a Japanese translator.

1322
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,567
今晚 我们跟三菱要签好约
We're closing with Mitsubishi tonight.

1323
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:55,986
Tim Geithner又打电话来了
Tim Geithner's calling again.

1324
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,738
你就当没听见
Cover your ears.

1325
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:02,534
你告诉T?im Geithner别来烦我了 我在想办法拯救我的公司
You tell Tim Geithner to fucking blow me. I'm trying to save my company.

1326
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:11,042
2008年9月22日 雷曼兄弟破产后7天

1327
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,206
我要和他见面 但是确保约在在午饭之后
Put him on the schedule, but make sure it's after lunch,

1328
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,042
因为之前我还要与Madeline碰头 而且...
because that way I can fit Madeline in beforehand. And...

1329
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,879
摩根刚才与三菱集团达成交易了
Morgan just made a deal with Mitsubishi.

1330
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,842
所以我们是唯一一家没有援助的银行了
So we're the only bank with our dick still in the wind.

1331
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,720
我再给巴菲特打个电话
I'm calling Buffett again.

1332
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:28,810
爷爷 他们一直在找你 万一是很重要的事怎么办?
Grandpa, they keep calling. What if it's important?

1333
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,104
他们总觉得自己很重要
They always think it's important.

1334
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,402
好吧 我会快点解决
All right, I'll make it fast.

1335
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,488
巴菲特 感谢你回复我 你最近怎么样?
Warren, thanks for calling back. How are you?

1336
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:44,242
挺好 Lloyd 这次我能帮你做什么?
Just fine, Lloyd. What can I do for you today?

1337
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,911
我想跟你谈谈关于入股高盛的事情
I'd like to talk to you about taking a stake in Goldman Sachs.

1338
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,581
什么价位? 听上去很贵
What do you have in mind? Sounds expensive.

1339
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,875
也许不贵
Maybe not.

1340
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,713
你最好给我的是好消息
You better have good news,

1341
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:00,592
也许搞定TRAP之前 我就挂了
because I might be dead before we finish haggling over TARP.

1342
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,137
巴菲特准备给高盛注资五十亿
Buffett's throwing five billion into Goldman.

1343
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,558
我们脱离险境
We're off the ledge.

1344
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,227
暂时而已
For the moment.

1345
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,855
十月的惊喜来的早了点
The October surprise arrived a little early,

1346
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,608
白宫的总统竞争出现了转机
with a game-changing jolt to the White House race.

1347
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:20,987
是该叫做出奇制胜还是孤注一掷
Call it a master stroke or a desperate Hail Mary pass,

1348
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:24,157
麦凯恩宣布他将暂停竞选
McCain announced he would suspend his campaign

1349
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:27,369
并要求推迟星期五的辩论
and asked for this Friday's debate to be postponed

1350
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,330
以便他能回到华盛顿集中精力应对金融危机
so he can return to Washington to focus on the economic crisis.

1351
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:36,378
现在是我们团结一致的时机 再次证明华盛顿有能力
Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again

1352
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,464
领导国家
capable of leading this country.

1353
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,300
感谢上帝 他回来了
Thank God he came back.

1354
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,596
就像大地英豪里的Daniel Day-Lewis(演员)
Like Daniel Day-Lewis in Last of the Mohicans,

1355
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,057
他会拯救我们的!
he will find us!

1356
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,311
- 他们要搞砸了  - 发生了什么?
- They're blowing it up.  - What happened?

1357
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:56,481
麦凯恩想趁机介入 挽救局面 但压根不知道怎么下手
McCain wanted to swoop in and save the day, but doesn't have any idea how to do it.

1358
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,693
这可是我们认真商量好几天 写了100页的法案
It's a 100-page piece of legislation we've been carefully negotiating for days.

1359
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,904
他以为我们就坐着这玩扔纸团?
What, did he think they were gonna sit around and spitball?

1360
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,823
是的 当麦凯恩到这
Yeah, when McCain got here

1361
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:08,535
并且发现这事情已经基本解决完了 他就愤怒了
and found out that the deal was basically done, he went apeshit.

1362
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,913
共和党没跟上进度 他们想重新来一遍
The Republicans fell in behind their guy. They wanna start all over again.

1363
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,915
民主党发飙 共和党想插进来
Democrats flipped out. Republicans dug in.

1364
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,251
- 乱七八糟  - 乱七八糟
- Clusterfuck.  - Clusterfuck.

1365
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,587
- Hank在哪? - 还在跟麦凯恩说话
- Where's Hank?  - Still talking to McCain.

1366
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,340
如果你或者任何其他人做了任何事
If you or anyone else does anything

1367
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:26,428
导致新一轮的大萧条 可别赖在我身上
that causes the next depression, it is not gonna be on me.

1368
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,762
我嘴巴很不严的 参议员
I have a big mouth, Senator,

1369
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,389
- 口风很松  - 等等
- a very big mouth. - Hold on...

1370
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:34,352
他不是在威胁共和党总统候选人吧?
He's not threatening the Republican presidential nominee, is he?

1371
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,439
- 必须采取一些行动  - 不 不 抱歉 离开一下
- Something's gotta be done.  - No, no. Excuse me, please.

1372
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,857
民主党的人在哪里?
Where are the Democrats?

1373
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,692
他们就在走廊那头
They're right down this way.

1374
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,193
- Nancy在吗?  - 是的 她在
- Is Nancy there?  - Yes. Yes, she is.

1375
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,403
谢了
Thank you.

1376
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,079
Nancy啊...
Nancy...

1377
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:01,087
哦 上帝 Hank 我不知道你还是天主教徒
Oh, Gee, Hank. I didn't know you were Catholic.

1378
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,300
我请求你 别毁了这个提案 这次会议很糟糕
I beg of you, don't blow this up. It was a bad meeting,

1379
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,051
但是我们必须达成共识
but we need to get together on this.

1380
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,970
我们不是想破坏这个提案的一方
We're not the ones trying to blow it up.

1381
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,264
我只是请求你能支持我们
I just ask you to stay with us.

1382
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,185
拜托了
Please.

1383
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:20,231
参议院在今早9点27分开始讨论援助议案
The House began debating the rescue bill at 9:27 this morning.

1384
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,942
约在下午1点28分 国会完成最终投票
At about 1:28 p.m., Congress did finally act.

1385
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,445
- 票数非常接近  - 我们马上来看一下
- This is a squeaker of a vote.  - We are down to it right now.

1386
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,489
似乎赞成票大多来自民主党
It looks like the Democrats delivered their caucus

1387
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,824
而目前来看共和党不大赞同此议案
and the Republicans so far have not.

1388
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,118
你认为他们会怎样修改议案
What do you think they could do to change the bill

1389
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,995
以便赢得共和党的选票?
to get a few Republican votes over to the other side?

1390
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,538
如果他们吊死那些华尔街的首席执行官
If they hang Wall Street CEOs,

1391
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,207
我想他们也许能得到更多的选票
I think that would get a few more votes.

1392
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,668
我不清楚他们具体能做些什么
I'm not sure what they could do exactly.

1393
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:44,589
国会的领导很可能认为
It is possible that the leadership of the Congress would conclude

1394
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,342
没有任何解决方法可以得到多数票的支持
that there's nothing that can get a majority of support

1395
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,428
就看Hank Paulson和当局能怎么做了
and see what Hank Paulson can do and the administration can do.

1396
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,932
领导们正在协商
Leaders are negotiating right now

1397
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,351
谁会拿自己的职位冒险 这就是我所听到的
who risks their seat. And that's what I'm hearing.

1398
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,186
如果Pelosi觉得议案不能通过的话
Pelosi wouldn't have brought the bill to the floor

1399
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,354
就不会将这个议案提上议程
if she didn't think it would pass.

1400
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,856
我不知道结果 Charlie 我没办法回答
I don't know the answer to that, Charlie. I can't answer.

1401
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,066
我正在读刚收到的一封邮件
I'm just reading an e-mail that's coming to me.

1402
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,110
我想最后的底线就是他们还得重新筹划
I think the bottom line is they gotta go back to the drawing board.

1403
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,779
但他们还有时间这么做吗?
Do they have the time, though, to do that?

1404
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,364
看看道琼斯工业平均指数
Look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

1405
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,157
知道吗 你们将会迎来一个大甩卖
You know you're gonna get a sell-off.

1406
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:14,160
你们 此时此刻 我们只能抓紧救生筏
You guys, at this point, we just gotta hold on to the sides of the kayak

1407
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,286
挺过去 因为
and ride through this because...

1408
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,247
他们没通过议案
They didn't pass it.

1409
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,291
- 他们没通过议案  - 这还不够
- They did not pass it.  - It just wasn't enough.

1410
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,587
议案以九票之差 未能获得通过 Bill
They're gonna end up being nine votes short, Bill.

1411
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:25,713
再说一次 Steve
Say that again, Steve.

1412
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,715
我认为他们会以九票之差否决这个议案...
I think they're gonna end up being nine votes...

1413
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,592
如果他们得到剩下的六票... 还有五票尚未投出
If they get all six... Five of the remaining votes,

1414
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,304
现在他们差10票 剩下的五票都支持议案
they'll be 10 votes short now, if they get all five remaining.

1415
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,473
票选结果在墙上
The writing is on the wall there.

1416
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:36,849
我们却失望的坐在地板上
And we're here down on the floor.

1417
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,226
当然 交易员已经站在那
Of course, traders have been standing around.

1418
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,936
看着 我们都三五成群的站着...
Look, we're all here in knots...

1419
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,485
媒体在新闻发布室等你
The networks are waiting for you in the press room.

1420
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,946
我甚至无法
I can't even...

1421
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,335
我们得重头再来
We have to go back again.

1422
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,838
他们不能对新议案说不
They don't get to say no on this.

1423
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,465
好的
Okay.

1424
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,633
白宫方面想跟你会面
The White House wants a meeting.

1425
01:22:10,718 --> 01:22:12,635
很好 我们要带着新策略去
Good. We'll come up with a new strategy.

1426
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,263
白宫必须给国会施压
The White House has to push harder on the Hill.

1427
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,765
同时 我们要想好如何运作资金
Meanwhile, we need to keep working on what we do with the money.

1428
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,100
让我们表现的好像议案能通过一样
Let's act like this is gonna work.

1429
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,935
这种情况下 我们还是谈谈资本注入吧
In that case, let's talk about cash injections.

1430
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,146
- 又来了  - 我们不能把银行国有化
- Here we go again.  - We can't nationalize the banks.

1431
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,272
这不是国有化
It's not nationalizing...

1432
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,107
这就是为什么日本经济衰退达十年的原因
That's how Japan got itself a decade-long recession.

1433
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,191
那就是我们想要的结果吗?
Is that where we wanna go?

1434
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:30,820
我们还有什么别的选择?
What else do we have?

1435
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,030
现金换垃圾
Cash for Trash.

1436
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,116
购入不良资产依旧是我们的出路
Buying toxic assets is still our go-to move.

1437
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,785
好吧 想办法简化方案
All right. Find a way to simplify it.

1438
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:41,456
Dan 做个方案出来
Dan, work something up.

1439
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,251
让我们看看会是什么情况 讨论一下
For discussion purposes, let's see what it would look like.

1440
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,306
针对那些支持7千亿华尔街援助的人而言
For those who supported the $700 billion Wall Street bailout,

1441
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,516
这是一次出乎意料的失败
it was a surprising and stunning failure

1442
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,894
当众议院投票否决此议案时
when the House of Representatives voted to reject it.

1443
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,480
对总统布什而言 被共和党同僚打击
It's a stinging defeat for President Bush,

1444
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,232
是一次惨痛的失败
delivered at the hands of his fellow Republicans.

1445
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:13,154
我们提出一个宏大的计划是因为我们面临着严重的问题
We put forth a plan that was big because we've got a big problem.

1446
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:17,241
现实就是我们处在非常紧急的情况下
The reality is that we're in an urgent situation.

1447
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,495
并且后果会日益恶化
And the consequences will grow worse each day

1448
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:21,996
如果我们不采取行动
if we do not act.

1449
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:31,506
两天后

1450
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:24,415
- 我明白 我一直都在说  - 起草新议案
- I know. I keep telling...  - Draft of the new bill.

1451
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,626
他们那边有什么进展了吗?
Are they having any luck with it?

1452
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,461
白宫认为先向参议院施加压力
The White House thinks they got a better shot of pushing it

1453
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,506
效果会更好 希望他们是对的
through the Senate side first. Hopefully they're right.

1454
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,383
他们叫我们收手 交给他们处理
They asked us to back off and let them handle it.

1455
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,511
所以我在试着收手
So I'm trying to back off.

1456
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,435
购买不良资产还是行不通
Buying toxic assets isn't gonna work.

1457
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,730
- 为什么行不通?  - 太慢了
- Why not?  - It's too slow.

1458
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:48,856
我想我之前就说过
I think I've been saying that.

1459
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,192
好吧 我们知道这会很复杂 但是有多慢
Well, we knew it was complicated, but how slow...

1460
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,277
两个月 也许更多
Two months, maybe more.

1461
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,947
我们怎么会不知道...
How is it possible we didn't know how...

1462
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,950
我没问会要多久 行不?
I didn't ask how long it would take, okay?

1463
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,120
有别的建议吗?
Can we move on?

1464
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:06,082
那么也许我们能谈谈资本注入
So maybe we can talk about capital injections.

1465
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,834
Dan 我们真不能那么做
Dan, we really can't.

1466
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,128
我想我们没选择了
I think we're gonna have to.

1467
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:16,134
就算Neel能加快进程 实际上不大可能
Even if Neel could expedite the process, which seems unlikely,

1468
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,847
体系正在崩溃 银行现在就需要钱
the system is crumbling. The banks need money now.

1469
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:24,392
如果注资是稳定整个体系最有效的方式
If cash injections are the most efficient way to stabilize them,

1470
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:27,562
那么我们就不能
then we can't back off

1471
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:32,400
因为我们不愿意成为是要将几家银行变成国有化的人而退却
because we're uncomfortable being the men who nationalized a few American banks.

1472
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,818
可以肯定的是 这更快
It's faster, that's for sure.

1473
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,947
这能够把我们从险境中拉出来 是的 激活整个系统
It will push us back off the precipice, yes, unfreeze the system.

1474
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:44,287
我们给他们一些钱然后他们贷出去
We give them some money and they lend it out.

1475
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,460
议案通过
The motion is adopted.

1476
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:53,087
在否决布什政府的TARP计划之后
After rejecting the Bush Administration's TARP plan

1477
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,007
仅过了四天 众议院今日通过了议案
only four days ago, the House passed it today.

1478
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,385
现在最大的问题是 投资者是否能从此消息中得到慰藉
The big question now, whether investors will take comfort in the news.

1479
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,055
市场指数显示股票仍在大幅下跌
Current indicators show the stock market is continuing its free fall.

1480
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,160
喂?
Hello?

1481
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,537
巴菲特 我是Hank
Warren, it's Hank.

1482
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:29,832
抱歉 这么晚了
I'm sorry. It's late.

1483
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,376
我吵醒你了吗?
Am I waking you?

1484
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,961
没 没有
No, not at all.

1485
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,089
能帮我出出主意吗?
Can I pick your brain for a minute?

1486
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,383
当然 什么情况?
Sure. What's the problem?

1487
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:45,473
怎么样让一家健全的的银行接受资本注入?
How do you get a healthy bank to accept a capital injection?

1488
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,780
我不得不大老远从加利福尼亚跑过来
I had to drag my ass all the way here from California.

1489
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,323
他们甚至不告诉我为什么要过来
They wouldn't even tell me why.

1490
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,117
没人知道这是要干什么吗?
Nobody knows what this is about?

1491
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,327
不知道
Nope.

1492
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,251
跟Jamie谈过了?
Talk to Jamie?

1493
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,461
恩 他会没事的
Yep. He'll be fine.

1494
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,380
你告诉他接下来要发生什么了吗?
Did you tell him what was coming?

1495
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,549
额 我告诉他我们会迫使他接受
Uh, did I tell him we're about to make him swallow

1496
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,510
不需要的注资了吗? 没说
a capital injection he doesn't need? No.

1497
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,264
我只告诉他 我们需要他的帮助
I, uh... I told him we need his help

1498
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,808
并且我非常礼貌的请求他今天不要跟我们作对
and I asked him very politely not to fuck with us today.

1499
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,561
他明白了
He got it.

1500
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:16,981
她在这了 
She's here.

1501
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:16,981
Sheila Bair 美国联邦存款保险公司主席

1502
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:25,865
绅士们 这能奏效吗?
Gentlemen. We think this is gonna work?

1503
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,075
啊 是的 他们会喜欢的
Oh, yeah. They're gonna love it.

1504
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:54,435
我们现在要着眼于美国的实际需求
We are of the view that the United States needs

1505
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,647
要采取坚决有力的行动
to take strong, decisive action

1506
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,318
以缓解金融体系的压力
to arrest the stress in our financial system.

1507
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,530
通过新授权的TARP方案
Through our new TARP authority,

1508
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:11,369
财政部将向这间房间里
Treasury will purchase preferred stock

1509
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,830
与会的每家银行 购买优先股
in each of the banks represented in this room.

1510
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,919
头五年 年收益为5%
That stock will yield 5 % the first five years,

1511
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:21,504
其后为9%
9 % after that.

1512
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,633
我们给你钱 你们借出去
We give you money. You lend it out.

1513
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:30,262
这可以激活信贷 稳定银行 重建信心
It will unfreeze credit, stabilize the banks, restore confidence.

1514
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,934
每个人都会因为体系中更多的资金而获益
Everyone will be better off with more capital in the system.

1515
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,396
这就是为什么你们九个人
And that is why all nine of you

1516
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,567
都要参与这个计划
will participate in the program.

1517
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,906
我们中有些人不需要资金
Some of us don't need any capital.

1518
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,908
你们都需要
You all need capital.

1519
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,995
你们不知道在未来一年里市场会变成什么样
You have no idea what the market's gonna look like in a year.

1520
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,788
你也不知道
Neither do you.

1521
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:00,167
我可不是你们这些鼓弄新花样的纽约佬
I'm not one of you New York guys with your fancy products.

1522
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,295
为什么我要呆在这房间里商量救助你们?
Why am I in this room talking about bailing you out?

1523
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,674
强势银行将为弱势银行买单
The stronger banks will serve as cover for the weaker banks.

1524
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,343
如果只有部分银行接受注资 那将成为一种信号
If just some of you take it, the money's a signal

1525
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:12,430
就是 这家银行无法存活 市场将吞噬掉它
that a bank is too weak to survive. The market will devour it.

1526
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,141
我们讨论的金额是多少?
How much are we talking about?

1527
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:16,892
1250亿
A hundred and twenty-five billion.

1528

1534
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,707

1535
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,293

State Street, two billion.

1536
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,254
富国银行 250亿
Wells Fargo, 25 billion.

1537
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,847
购买不良资产的那个方案怎么了?
What happened to buying toxic assets?

1538
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,767
- 那不是个好主意吗?  - 那样太慢了
- Wasn't that the idea?  - It's too slow.

1539
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,852
在这之前体系就会崩溃
It'll be dead before we sort it out.

1540
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,355
所以 我们就这么把缰绳交给你了?
So, we're just handing the reins over to you?

1541
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,399
这笔交易实际上很不错了
The deal's actually pretty good.

1542
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,735
你现在对此不屑一顾 等到我们还是得来援助你的时候
You turn your nose up at this now and we have to rescue you later,

1543
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,445
条件可就不这么有吸引力了
the terms won't be nearly as attractive.

1544
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,114
这是很便宜的资本 这不是最差的注意
It's cheap capital. It's not the worst idea in the world.

1545
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,158
这是针对我们中间那些已经有足够资本的
It is for those of us who already have capital.

1546
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:18,662
我们将成为没投票权的股东 这只是暂时的举措
We will be non-voting shareholders. This will be a temporary measure.

1547
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,375
要是我们拒绝参与呢?
What if we decline to be involved?

1548
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,004
美国联邦存款保险公司的主席就坐在这里
The Chairman of the FDIC is sitting right there.

1549
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,672
明天你就会发现
Tomorrow you'll find out

1550
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,008
你并不像你想的那样拥有雄厚资本
that you're not as well capitalized as you think you are.

1551
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,219
你们会采取什么样的保障措施
What kind of protections can you offer on changes

1552
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,595
针对补偿措施的改变?
for compensation policy?

1553
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:38,265
我的意思是 如果政府要成为共有者
I mean, if the government is going to become a part-owner,

1554
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:42,186
是不是表明将由政府来指定酬金?
does that mean that the government is going to dictate compensation?

1555
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,355
此刻你是在问我有关你的奖金问题吗 John?
Are you asking me about your bonus right now, John?

1556
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,524
我在经营一家公司
I'm running a company.

1557
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,112
如果美联储告诉我 我不能向有才能的人提供有竞争力的薪酬
If the Fed tells me I can't offer competitive pay for talent,

1558
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:54,365
你将导致这个国家有史以来最严重的人才流失
you're gonna launch the biggest brain drain this country's ever seen.

1559
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,117
这就是你们要经营银行的方式?
Is that the way you wanna run the banks?

1560
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,577
在偿还欠款给财政部之前
Until the money is repaid to the Treasury,

1561
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,664
会有一些限制扣税和黄金降落伞(公司控制权变动需要给高管进行补偿的协定)的规定
there will be some limitations on tax deductions and golden parachutes.

1562
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,582
- 果然  - 我真不明白
- Well, there you go.  - I don't really understand

1563
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,919
为什么讨论这个话题还如此严肃
why there needs to be so much tension about this.

1564
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,840
这个国家在面临自从大萧条以来最严重的经济危机
The country is facing the worst economy since the Great Depression.

1565
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:16,137
如果金融体系崩溃 你们每个人都会遭殃
If the financial system collapses, it will take every one of you down.

1566
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,397
给我文件
Give me the papers.

1567
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,573
- 你不能就这么签了  - 哦 为什么不行?
- You can't just sign it.  - Oh, no?

1568
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:39,243
- 没有你的董事会的同意  - 我的董事会24小时都待命
- Not without your board. - My board's on 24-hour notice.

1569
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,704
我想他们会同意的
I think they'll go along with it.

1570
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,457
如果他们不同意 那就炒了我
And if they don't, they'll fire me.

1571
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,674
其他人呢?
Anyone else?

1572
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,599
他们打算签吗?
Are they gonna do it?

1573
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,102
他们要联系各自的董事会
They're calling their boards.

1574
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,354
- 那是个好信号  - 如果他们同意
- That's a good sign.  - If they do go along with this,

1575
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,690
我们需要在宣布注资的同时 公布其他举措
we should announce something alongside the injections, uh,

1576
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,027
也许是一个收购房屋贷款抵押的计划
maybe a program to buy up mortgages.

1577
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:14,695
我不想草率的公布些不成熟的计划
I'm not rushing out some half-assed plan

1578
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,572
只是为了显示我们做了什么
just to make it look like we're doing something.

1579
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:20,075
或许我们能补充些限制条件 限制这些钱的用途
Maybe we just beef up the restrictions on how they spend the money,

1580
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,662
以去除毒瘤
something to take the stink off.

1581
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,165
加更多的条件的话 他们就不会答应了
Put more restrictions on it, they won't take it.

1582
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,714
今天完成的事情太多了
One thing too many for today.

1583
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,053
我们所知道的是他们差点搞垮了全美国的经济
They almost bring down the US economy as we know it,

1584
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,555
但是我们却不能限制他们如何使用
but we can't put restrictions on how they spend

1585
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,808
我们给他们的1250亿美元
the $125 billion we're giving them

1586
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:48,145
就因为他们可能不会接受
because they might not take it.

1587
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,137
这是什么?
What's this?

1588
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,224
那是 额
That is, um,

1589
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,686
一种有毒镖蛙
a poison dart frog.

1590
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,523
Wendy在圭亚那照的
Wendy took it in Guyana.

1591
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,329
这是你的吗?
Is this yours?

1592
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,670
Al Capone(美国黑帮教父)的
Al Capone's.

1593
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:58,382
九家银行中的八个已经同意了
Eight out of nine are in.

1594
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,010
- 美国银行还在等他的董事会 但是...  - 他也会同意的
- B of A is still waiting on its board, but...  - It's gonna go through.

1595
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,556
我要给众议院办公室打电话
I'll call the Speaker's office.

1596
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,517
还有 我们安排你跟总统电话联系下
And, uh, we're gonna get you on the phone with the President.

1597
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,352
好的
Okay.

1598
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:19,486
就因为我们的商议 道琼斯指数涨了900点
Dow is up 900 points just because we were meeting.

1599
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,408
太好了
Well, that's good.

1600
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:27,911
太好了
That's good.

1601
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,081
这样做是对的
It was the right thing.

1602
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,001
绝对的
Absolutely.

1603
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,045
我原本准备好应对更强的反对
I was prepared for more blowback.

1604
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:41,508
他们没有选择了 他们明白这点
They didn't have a choice. They knew that.

1605
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,513
好吧 我当然希望他们
Well, I certainly hope that they...

1606
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,891
什么?
What?

1607
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,064
我希望他们会把钱用在我们要求的地方
I hope they use the money the way we're asking them to.

1608
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:59,818
他们会贷出去 是吧?
They will lend it out, won't they?

1609
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:17,795
他们一定会的
Of course they will.

1610
01:35:27,195 --> 01:35:28,795
虽然TRAP得到通过 但是几家银行仍未进行贷款 市场继续动荡

1611
01:35:29,195 --> 01:35:34,795
失业率超过10% 数百万的家庭因丧失抵押品赎回权而无家可归

1612
01:35:38,195 --> 01:35:39,795
2009年 动荡的市场逐渐稳定 国际金融形势的恶化得到缓解

1613
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:47,795
最大的几家银行已经赎回了TRAP中政府购买的优先股

1614
01:35:50,195 --> 01:35:52,795
2010年 对华尔街的补偿已经达到1350亿美元的新纪录

1615
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:56,795
10家银行的资产占拥有全美银行资产总数的77%

1616
01:35:56,195 --> 01:36:04,795
他们被称为 大而不倒
