1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,007
解散監管機構並非我們的初衷
We have no intention of dismantling the regulatory agencies.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,929
但實際上 我們整天被這些低效繁瑣的規則所糾纏
However, we must come to grips with inefficient and burdensome regulations.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,724
我們要裁撤那些毫無效益非必要的部門
We will eliminate those that are unproductive and unnecessary.

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,020
取消那些過時的規章制度 授予銀行全新的職權
Tearing down these antiquated walls and granting banks significant new authority.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,648
銀行業迎來利好消息
In a victory for the banking industry,

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,608
國會通過了立法
Congress has approved legislation

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,902
准許商業銀行和投資銀行進行合併
which will allow commercial and investment banks

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,365
形成史上最大的 業務覆蓋全球的金融機構
to merge and form institutions of unprecedented size and global reach.

9
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:35,365
大而不倒

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:41,833
我認為我們沒有必要為了防範管制風險而去增加管制
I think it's very important for us not to introduce regulation for regulation's sake.

11
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,918
我一直堅信著美國夢
I do believe in the American dream.

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,005
而擁有自己的房產則是夢開始的地方
Owning a home is a part of that dream.

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,005

我們正採取措施 幫助數以萬計的美國人擁有自己的房產
We are taking action to bring many thousands of Americans closer to owning a home.

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,892
這項計劃不僅有利於全體公民
This project not only is good for the soul of the country,

16
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,019
同時也能帶動國家經濟的發展
it's good for the pocketbook of the country as well.

17
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,440
房地產市場已經近乎瘋狂
The housing market has reached frantic proportions.

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,484
大家似乎都在忙著蓋房子 然後進行買賣
It seems that everybody is building, buying or selling.

19
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,404
道瓊斯和標普指數雙雙創出新高
The Dow and the S&P both breaking records.

20
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,116
高盛集團今年的利潤飆升93%
Profits soared 93% at Goldman Sachs this year.

21
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:20,079
交易員中的佼佼者和銀行從業人員收入預計將達到1000萬
Hotshot traders and bankers can expect to take home 10, 25,

22
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,790
2500萬 甚至是5000萬
and in some cases, $50 million.

23
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,918
這一切好得近乎天方夜譚了
Things that are too good to be true, are.

24
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,837
當你看到其中的...
When you see something coming...

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,921
房地產業的泡沫...
The real estate bubble...

26
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:29,964
- 房地產泡沫  - 泡沫
- Housing bubble.  - Bubble.

27
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,758
切不可視而不見
don't put it off.

28
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,593
要立即採取行動
Take action immediately.

29
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,220
泡沫會逐漸緩解 還是只能等到破滅?
Will there be a soft landing, or will the bubble burst?

30
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:40,220

最新消息 次貸市場開始分崩離析
The new story, the mortgage meltdown.

32
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,772
由於次貸危機的發生 今天上午的最新數字表明
This morning in the mortgage meltdown, new numbers showing

33
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,775
失去住所的美國人數又創新高
that a record number of Americans are losing their homes.

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,445
在過去幾個月的時間 美國有70多家從事次貸業務的公司紛紛倒閉
More than 70 mortgage companies have failed in the last few months in America,

35
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,866
而現在貝爾斯登 以及大銀行等大型企業
and now the biggest of the big companies, the Bear Stearns, the big banks,

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,576
要開始承擔這一後果了
are caught holding the bag.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,208
貝爾斯登 這家國內排名第五的投資銀行
The fifth largest investment bank in the country, Bear Stearns,

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,836
以每股2美金的股價出售給了摩根大通銀行
is being sold for just $2 a share to JPMorgan.

39
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,131
這宗交易是在政府的協助下進行的 目的是為了保全
It's being assisted by the government, which is stepping in to guarantee

40
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:16,761
貝爾斯登帳下的300億美金的不良房地產資產
some $30 billion in Bear's toxic real estate assets.

41
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,976
你一定能想像得出來 Hank Paulson被布什總統任命為財政部長的時候
You've got to imagine that Hank Paulson didn't think he signed up for this

42
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,605
不會想到有一天會去簽署這樣一份文件
when President Bush picked him to become Treasury Secretary.

43
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,901
現在Hank Paulson可能不得不取消一些撤銷管制的規定
Hank Paulson may now have to undo some of the deregulation measures

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,863
而這些措施恰恰是在他主管高盛集團時與華爾街上的同行們一直努力倡導的
that he and his peers on Wall Street pushed through when he ran Goldman.

45
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,827
Hank Paulson財長今天上午對Matt Lauer說
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson telling Matt Lauer this morning,

46
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,622
"我們已經克服了一切困難 我對我們的市場充滿信心
"We're all over it. I've got great confidence in our markets.

47
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,290
它們是富有彈性和可塑性的"
They're resilient. They're flexible."

48
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,087
Ali 事實上貝爾斯登的收購事件只是掀開了冰山一角
Ali, the truth is that Bear Stearns is only a very small fraction of this story.

49
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,633
我們的經濟很可能會大幅衰退
Our economy could face far worse than a recession.

50
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,806
受貝爾斯登倒閉的影響 雷曼兄弟忙於
In the wake of Bear's collapse, Lehman Brothers is scrambling

51
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:06,185
說服投資者相信 次貸危機不會對雷曼兄弟的資產造成太大影響
to reassure investors about the impact of the mortgage crisis on its own assets.

52
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,021
今天上午雷曼兄弟的保證人遭受了一系列的壓力
Insurers of the firm under a great deal of pressure this morning.

53
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,858
Dick Fuld 在雷曼工作了39年
Dick Fuld, a 39-year veteran of Lehman

54
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,444
並且是華爾街上大型投資銀行中任職最久的首席執行官
and the longest-running CEO of a major investment bank on Wall Street,

55
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,906
曾多次讓公司在危機中起死回生
has pulled the firm back from the brink during other crises,

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,662
Richard Fuld 雷曼兄弟主席兼首席執行官

57
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,662
但是今天 我第一次聽到了投資者們對他的領導能力的質疑聲
but today, for the first time that I'm hearing it, investors are questioning his leadership.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,038
- 混蛋  - 投資者們
- Motherfucker.  - One key question

59
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,748
對雷曼兄弟最關注的一個問題就是
investors have for Lehman Brothers,

60
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,835
"這家投資銀行的盈利能力到底如何?"
"What's the true earnings power of this investment bank's business?"

61
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,387
Joe Gregory 雷曼兄弟總裁兼首席運營官

62
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,387
- 嘿  - 趕緊到我這兒來
- Hey.  - Get up here.

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,306
我們得去搬救兵了
We gotta start stacking sand bags.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,599
你在說什麼啊?
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:49,770
我們的股價暴跌了21% 從市價上看 我個人就損失了9000萬
We're down 21%. On paper, I just lost $90 million, personally.

66
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,691
隨著投資者不斷拋售雷曼兄弟的股票
With investors pummeling Lehman shares,

67
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,443
今天上午最大的一個疑問就是
the big question this morning is,

68
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,528
"Fuld還有何退路?"
"What options does Fuld have?"

69
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,947
截至目前 他還沒能夠籌措到新的投資
So far, he has failed to raise new capital

70
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,783
而事實上他的競爭對手們已經拿到了
while virtually all of his rivals have already done so.

71
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,783
財政部長 高盛前董事會主席兼首席執行官

72
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,330
現在 對沖基金經理David Einhorn已經在公開質疑公佈數字的準確性了
And now, hedge fund manager David Einhorn is publicly questioning the accuracy of the fund numbers

73
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,497
有什麼好消息嗎?
Anything good?

74
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,002
這是一隻紅尾鷹 今年頭回看到
It's a red-tailed hawk, first one this year.

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
Dick Fuld在1號線上等著
Dick Fuld's on one.

76
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,756
提供可信的答案
to provide credible answers.

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,591
讓我們來一起分析一下這些 呃
So let's go through a couple of those, uh,

78
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,718
被你稱為差異的東西 因為...
what you call discrepancies, because...

79
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,516
- 上午的日子不好過吧?  - 我們有高收益
- Tough morning?  - We show top-quality earnings,

80
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,852
- 粉碎了所有之前的預測  - 沒錯
- we beat every prediction.  - Yeah.

81
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,731
這是做空者的行為 你也知道他們的一貫伎倆 先做空 然後彎曲事實
It's the damn short-sellers. You know the game, short and distort.

82
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,858
他們善於散佈謠言 然後從中大賺一筆
They're rumormongers and they're making a killing.

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,944
你對於籌集資金有什麼計劃?
What are your plans for a capital raise?

84
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,529
我們想的比你更遠 讓我把話再講得明白些
We're way ahead of you. Now, let me be clear,

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,533
我們不需要現金
we don't need the cash.

86
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,037
這是一種直覺
You know, it's about perception.

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,747
快說巴菲特
Buffett, Buffett.

88
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,709
我們正在考慮同沃倫·巴菲特進行接洽
We're thinking of reaching out to Warren Buffett.

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,794
很好
Great.

90
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,214
你和巴菲特有過交情 對吧?
You and Buffett go back, right?

91
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,676
幫幫我 給他打個電話
Do me a favor and call him.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,344
告訴他雷曼兄弟有著很堅實的基礎
Tell him Lehman is rock solid.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,139
作為財政部長 我不能鼓動他去進行某一項的投資
As Treasury Secretary, I can't advocate for a specific investment.

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,727
Erin Callan 雷曼兄弟首席財務官

95
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,897
Hank 你想不想讓我籌集到資金?
Hank, you want me to raise capital or not?

96
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,902
2008年5月24日 星期六

97
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,484
雷曼兄弟的規模要比貝爾斯登大得多
Lehman Brothers is a hell of a lot bigger than Bear Stearns.

98
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,902
市場開始恐慌了
The market is terrified.

99
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,239
我在高盛集團主政期間 從來沒有想過要去
When I was running Goldman, I never even conceived

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,783
請求財長為我促成一筆交易
of asking the Treasury Secretary to cut a deal for me.

101
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,284
沒錯 但是對貝爾斯登的緊急援助造成了...
Yeah, but the Bear bailout created...

102
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,619
不要把它說成是緊急援助
Please don't call it a bailout.

103
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:33,040
好吧 對貝爾斯登的一攬子大規模收購援助政策
Okay, the very large Bear Stearns purchase assistance package

104
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,834
使公眾產生了一種預期
created an expectation.

105
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,585
Fuld正期待您的直接介入
Fuld's counting on direct intervention from you.

106
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,088
巴菲特可以輕而易舉地解決這個問題
Buffett's a simple solution.

107
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,757
Jim Wilkinson 財政部參謀長

108
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,091
我覺得您應該去給他打這個電話
I think you make the call.

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,179
以什麼身份呢? 他的朋友? 以前為他提供服務的人? 還是以財長的身份?
As what? Warren's friend? His former banker? The Treasury Secretary?

110
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,432
不 還是讓Fuld自己去打給他吧
No. Fuld's calling him.

111
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,308
希望他能介入進來 這樣大家都能安心了
Hopefully he'll jump in and we can all relax.

112
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,354
安心? 我們剛剛處理了一家投資銀行 這會兒又有另一家在茍延殘喘
Relax? We just buried one investment bank, we got another one that's barely breathing.

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,190
這是一場關乎信心的博弈 如果人們對雷曼兄弟失去了信心
This is a confidence game. People lose faith in Lehman,

114
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,026
那後面的銀行就會像多米諾骨牌一樣成片地倒下
these banks are gonna drop like dominoes,

115
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,487
而我也無法為此再做出什麼了
and I don't have the authority to do a thing about it.

116
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,116
已經晚了 一切都已經太晚了
We're late. We've been late on everything.

117
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,288
Neel Kashkari 部長助理 處理國際事務

118
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,369
Neel的團隊正在研究這樣災難即將帶來的後果
Neel's team is working on some kind of a disaster scenario.

119
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,288
我們把它稱為"破杯"計劃
We're calling it the "Break the Glass" plan,

120
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,498
當您走投無路的時候就可以要求國會執行這項計劃
what to ask Congress for if your back's against the wall.

121
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
錢唄
Money.

122
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,837
就是向他們要錢唄
Is what you ask them for.

123
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:26,635
Michele Davis 部長助理 處理公共事務

124
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,134
問題在於 除非我們已經撞上了冰山 否則國會不會採取舉措
The problem is, Congress won't move until we've already hit the iceberg,

125
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,635
而到那時 一切都已經太晚了
and at that point, it may be too late.

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,599
你的意思是說 我掌管著美國財政部
So you're saying, with the full weight of the United States Treasury behind me,

127
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,935
而我能做的就是去找巴菲特求助?
all I can do is call Warren Buffett?

128
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,773
嗨 巴菲特 我是Hank
Hi, Warren. It's Hank.

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,567
我知道你和Dick Fuld已經談過了
I understand you've been talking to Dick Fuld.

130
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,406
華倫·巴菲特 世上最富有的人

131
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,406
Hank 你也知道我對那些投資銀行的擔憂
You know my misgivings, Hank, about investment banks.

132
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,367
他們一旦開始為自己進行交易時
As soon as they started trading for themselves,

133
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,078
那些風險經理就都失控了
the risk managers lost control.

134
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,663
我和所羅門兄弟公司有過一次不太愉快的合作經歷
I had a very unpleasant time with Salomon Brothers.

135
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,832
你說得有道理
That's fair enough.

136
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,213
但我們都知道投資銀行向來都是一個有利可圖的行業
But we both know that investment banking is a profitable business.

137
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,841
我猜它大概已經為你賺了數十億美金了吧?
I figure it made you a billion or so, huh?

138
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:10,012
我相信如果他們出價合理的話 你也不會袖手旁觀吧
I gotta believe that if the price was right, you wouldn't just walk away.

139
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,683
在事實面前才算數 你覺得呢?
You know a good deal when you see one. What say you?

140
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,561
還是你自己來判斷吧
I gotta leave that to your judgment.

141
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,981
大家的反應就好像我們是奸商一樣
People act like we're crack dealers.

142
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,817
沒人拿著槍去指向某人說
Nobody put a gun to anybody's head and said,

143
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,320
"嘿 獵人 買下這棟你償還不起的房子吧 等你住進去以後
"Hey, nimrod, buy a house you can't afford. And you know what? While you're at it,

144
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,447
再用它申請信用額度 這件就可以再買一艘船了"
put a line of credit on that baby and buy yourself a boat."

145
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,950
巴菲特給你回復了嗎?
You heard anything from Buffett?

146
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,496
他要求獲得股價為40美金的優先股 分紅為9%
He's asking for preferred shares at 40 with a dividend of 9%.

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,998
股價剛還在66塊呢 搞什麼鬼啊?
We were just at 66. What the fuck?

148
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,042
或許這只是遊戲的序幕吧 Dick
Maybe it's just an opening gambit, Dick.

149
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,710
聽上去更像是一種侮辱
Sounds more like a goddamn insult.

150
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,212
- 我來幫你弄吧 Dick  - 謝謝
- Let me get that, Dick.  - Thank you.

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,339
我們的股價已經跌到了36塊
We're at 36 right now.

152
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,759
這幾個月以來我們從未到過66快附近
We haven't been anywhere near 66 in months.

153
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,761
市場喜歡巴菲特
The markets like Buffett.

154
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,639
- 他的名字會在一夜之間推動股價上升  - 我才不在乎他是誰
- His name will push the price up overnight.  - I don't care who he is,

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,811
我不會用1年花費3億6000萬的代價去取悅他以謀求合作
I am not spending $360 million a year for the pleasure of doing business with him.

156
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,020
房地產市場會重新振作起來的
Real estate will come back.

157
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,647
韓國人有意介入
Koreans have been sniffing around.

158
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,524
這不好了 他們不會漫天要價
There you go. And they won't steal us blind.

159
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,360
這種場面以前我也經歷過 首席執行官們開始恐慌 然後廉價賣掉自己的股票
I've seen this before. CEOs panic and they sell out cheap.

160
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,446
現在 整條華爾街都認為已經到了火燒眉毛的時候
Right now, the Street's running around with its hair on fire,

161
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,407
但暴風雨總會過去的
but the storm always passes.

162
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:16,120
我們要充滿信心 然後 去參加高盛舉辦的午宴
We stand strong, and on the other side, we'll eat Goldman's lunch.

163
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,915
那我們該如何回復巴菲特呢?
So, what do we do about Buffett?

164
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,627
去他媽的巴菲特
Screw Warren Buffett.

165
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,423
每周早餐會議

166
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,423
- 他拒絕了?  - 雷曼兄弟的股價
- He passed?  - Lehman dropped

167
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,758
在今天上午已經跌到了28塊半 他到底是怎麼想的啊?
to 28 and a half this morning. What in the world is he thinking?

168
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,846
他根本沒有思考 他是在妄想 他認為巴菲特的開價太高了
He's not thinking. He's delusional. He thought the ask was too high.

169
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:38,601
Ben Bernanke 聯邦儲蓄主席

170
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,682
他得去籌措資金啊
He's gotta raise cash.

171
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,601
我也是這麼跟他說的
I told him that.

172
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,104
- 我找格林斯潘談過了  - 真的嗎?
- I spoke to Greenspan.  - Really?

173
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:47,568
他說住房市場供過於求 這就是問題所在
He says there's too much housing supply. That's the problem.

174
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,449
所以我們應該買下所有閒置房屋 不讓它們流入市場
So we should buy up all the vacant houses and burn them.

175
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,959
Dick需要一個能認清現狀的買家
Dick needs a buyer, someone with a grip on reality.

176
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,295
幾個月前巴克萊銀行曾表示過些許興趣
Barclays expressed some interest a couple of months ago,

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,130
但我覺得現在的股價還沒有降到他們的心理價位
but I don't think the price is low enough for them.

178
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,217
- 美國銀行呢?  - 有這個可能
- Bank of America?  - Possible.

179
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,177
Dick之前也試探過他們
Dick's put out feelers there before.

180
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,846
不過我們得保持低調
We have to keep it quiet, though.

181
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,932
因為一旦有人獲悉他們準備出售
'Cause if anyone hears that they're trying to sell

182
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,976
雷曼兄弟將瞬間完蛋
Lehman'll be dead within the hour.

183
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,398
2008年6月11日 雷曼兄弟高管緊急決策會議

184
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,479
在房地產業務上的投資正在毀掉整個公司
The real estate investments are killing the firm.

185
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,398
我們得公開承認我們犯了一些錯誤
We have to admit publically we've made some mistakes.

186
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,525
我們需要對高管層進行更替
We need to make a senior management change,

187
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,694
從而向市場表明我們的立場
signal to the market that we get it.

188
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,407
- 你們指的是誰?  - Joe Gregory
- Meaning what?  - Meaning Joe Gregory.

189
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
別扯淡了
Get the fuck out of here.

190
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,830
還輪不到你們來告訴我該如何來運營我的公司
You are not gonna tell me how to run my company.

191
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,917
Joe在這場危機中沒有站在你這邊 這是人所共知的
Joe hasn't had your back on risk, and everyone knows it.

192
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,337
Erin Callan也得走人 整條華爾街都知道她就是個笑話
Erin Callan's gotta go, too. As far as the Street's concerned, she's a joke.

193
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,341
Joe Gregory和我共事了30多年
Joe Gregory has been with me for 30 years.

194
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,012
我們只是遇到了暫時性的困難 你們就想讓我把他攆走?
And you want me to kick him to the curb because we had a bad quarter?

195
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,639
這不是暫時性的困難
It's not just a bad quarter.

196
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,683
股價已經跌到23塊了
Stock hit 23.

197
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:07,311
Skip McGee 雷曼兄弟投行部 全球區總裁

198
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,311
23塊啊 公司大部分員工分到的股票都是在數年內無法進行買賣的
Twenty-three. Most of our guys are paid in stock they can't sell for years.

199
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,022
他們損失的是過去六個月媮的淨利潤
They've lost most of their net worth over the last six months.

200
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,068
如果你不穩住股價 你的那些交易員們只能跑路了
You don't stabilize the price, your traders are gonna jump ship.

201
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,028
一群自私鬼
Selfish fucks.

202
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,991
Dick 不僅是銀行家和交易員們 連客戶都會抽走他們的資金
It's not just bankers and traders, Dick. Clients are pulling their money.

203
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,785
公司將遭遇到連鎖反應
There's gonna be a run on this bank.

204
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,541
消息靈通人士對財經頻道透露
Sources tell CNBC that both

205
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,253
雷曼兄弟的Erin Callan和Joseph Gregory已經離任
Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory are out at Lehman Brothers.

206
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,755
公司的主席Dick Fuld在一份聲明中稱
In a statement, the company's chairman, Dick Fuld, said

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,858
2008年8月4日

208
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,758
將由48歲的Bart McDade代替Gregory的位子
replacing Gregory with 48-year-old Bart McDade

209
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:38,095
Bart McDade 雷曼兄弟新總裁兼首席運營官

210
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,095
這是他所做過的最艱難的一個決定
has been one of the most difficult decisions he's had to make.

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,558
Dick 韓國人剛剛到達Sullivan
Dick, the Koreans just arrived at Sullivan.

212
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,852
我們一定要抓住這次機會
Let's go make this happen.

213
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,730
我覺得這會兒你最好就待在這
My take is you'd be better off staying here for now.

214
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,358
我們要把你打造成為"幕後人士"
We need you to be our "missing man."

215
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,320
由我們去談 盡最大努力去促成這筆交易
We'll go in and push the deal as far as we can,

216
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,990
最後再由你出面來達成這筆交易
and then we'll bring you in at the end to top it off.

217
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,408
好吧 聽你的
All right, fine.

218
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,328
很好
Okay. Okay.

219
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,544
我們如期來到了紐約
We are committed to our presence in New York.

220
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,924
但我們需要知道確切的數字
But we need to know that the underlying numbers make sense.

221
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,930
我們也看到了事情的發展情況
We realize how things look.

222
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,224
但我們的股價只是被一些做空者暫時挫傷
But our stock is getting hammered by the shorts.

223
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,101
它的真實價值依舊沒變
The value is still there.

224
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,565
我們剛剛開始談 Min還是很興奮的 但他們還沒有給出具體的數字
We just started. Min's excited, but we haven't heard the terms.

225
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,234
你在哪兒?
Where are you?

226
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,944
我剛走出會議室來接你的電話啊
I just stepped out to take the call.

227
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,489
快回去 要有禮貌啊
Get back in there. Don't be rude.

228
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,575
好的
Okay.

229
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,495
我們只是將你們不感興趣的那一部分資產
We simply take the assets you don't find appealing,

230
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,664
拆分成一個獨立的公司
spin them off into a separate company.

231
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,419
- 你不必買下整家銀行  - 抱歉
- You don't buy that bank.  - I'm very sorry.

232
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,421
你只需買下這家運營良好的銀行就行了
You buy the good bank.

233
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,717
他們對房地產不感興趣
Look, they don't like the real estate.

234
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,135
什麼叫他們不感興趣?
What do you mean, they don't like it?

235
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,972
Dick 我們終於有些進展了 暫時不要打擾我了
Dick, we're making real progress here, okay? Let me stay on it for now.

236
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,157
Min 你好
Min, how are you?

237
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,576
很高興見到你
Great to see you.

238
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,121
希望沒有打擾到你們
I don't want to interrupt.

239
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,540
Dick 你來得正是時候
Dick, great timing.

240
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,167
看起來雙方對合同的大致框架都很滿意
We seem to be in sync on the broad strokes of the deal.

241
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,711
我們可以回到意向書上來了嗎?
Shall we get back to the letter of intent?

242
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,675
Min 我不得不告訴你 我覺得你正在犯一個大錯
Min, I have to tell you, I think you're making a big mistake here.

243
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,344
房地產資產價值巨大
There's great value in the real estate assets.

244
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,514
要不通過仔細分析投資組合
How about we walk through the portfolio

245
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
我來向你展示這一點如何?
and I'll show you?

246
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,354
我們已經仔細看過了
We have looked at them.

247
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,024
有些地方你肯定沒看懂
Then you must have looked at them in the wrong way.

248
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,653
我不想看你做出錯誤的決定
See, I just don't wanna see you leave money on the table.

249
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,364
或許我們應該休息一下
Perhaps we should take a break.

250
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,456
Min 非常抱歉
Min, I'm so sorry.

251
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,668
我們一直在真心實意地進行談判 突然就這麼回到原點了?
We have negotiated in good faith. Now all of a sudden we are going backward?

252
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,295
我們同意你給出的報價
We can work with you on the price.

253
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,213
這與報價無關
It is not about the price.

254
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,009
我說的是你們處理事情的方式
It is about the way you have conducted this.

255
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,642
非常感謝大家
I'd like to thank you, all of you,

256
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,229
但我覺得已經沒有繼續談下去的基礎了
but I don't think we have a structure that works.

257
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,653
什麼 就這麼結束了?
What, that's it?

258
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,530
你們就打算這麼打道回府了?
You're just gonna pack up and go back to Korea?

259
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,463
- 你好  - Neel 我是Dick Fuld
- Hello?  - Neel, it's Dick Fuld.

260
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,718
聽著 如果Hank想讓我找到買家
Listen, you know, if Hank wants me to find a buyer,

261
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,261
你們得出面幫我一把啊
you guys need to step up and help.

262
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,931
韓國人剛剛退出交易了
The Koreans just walked out, okay?

263
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,641
我只是表達一下自己的觀點
Look, I'm just speaking for myself here,

264
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,060
但我認為你應該做一些有利於公司的事情
but I think you need to do what's right for the firm.

265
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,853
什麼叫有利於?
Do what's right?

266
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,438
這話是什麼意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

267
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,690
如果股價繼續下跌
If your stock price keeps sliding,

268
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,235
你也許會得到一個令人失望的報價
you may get an offer at a price that doesn't look all that compelling,

269
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,279
但為了公司的持續經營 你必須接受它
but you may have to take it just to keep the company intact.

270
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,031
你指什麼樣的買價?
What kind of price are you talking about?

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,699
可能會...
Could be...

272
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,077
我指 股價可能在個位數
I mean, it might be low single digits.

273
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,333
二月份 我們公司每股66美元
Last February, we were at 66 a share.

274
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:42,589
雷曼兄弟可不是貝爾斯登
Lehman Brothers is not Bear Stearns.

275
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,134
我們業績很好的 房地產會復甦的
We've got a great business. Real estate's gonna come back.

276
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,263
我他媽不會把這公司送人的!
I am not fucking giving this company away!

277
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,008
在雷曼兄弟股價因其
While the real estate market has put

278
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,558
房地產業務而備受壓力時
put Lehman Brothers shares under pressure,

279
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,726
房貸巨頭房利美和房地美兩公司傳出報道說
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks

280
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,105
需要籌資750億美元才能償付其債務 
are suddenly plummeting this morning, after reports the companies

281
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,067
此後 這兩家公司的股價急劇下跌
may need to raise $75 billion just to remain solvent.

282
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,403
因為這兩家公司幾乎擔保了
Because they guarantee such an enormous percentage 

283
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,904
全國大部分的次級貸款
of the nation's mortgages,

284
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,739
有關人士預測政府將會介入
there is renewed speculation that the government

285
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,825
該事態中 收購兩家公司
may have to step in and take them over,

286
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,620
政府介入的可能性也從奧巴馬的競選演講中得到證實
a possibility Barack Obama has now raised on the campaign trail.

287
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,415
若房利美和房地美倒閉了
If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed,

288
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,588
那麼將會給整個金融界帶來
then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow

289
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,173
災難性的動盪
that it could be disastrous.

290
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,511
房地美下跌了8% 房利美下跌5%
Freddie just dropped another 8%. Fannie's down 5%.

291
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:34,511
Timothy Geithner 紐約聯邦儲備銀行行長

292
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,808
下跌趨勢迅猛 我們得採取措施了 立刻
There's no bottom here. We need to do something. Now.

293
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,936
我們正向國會提議
We're working on a proposal for Congress,

294
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,731
看能否批准我們向市場注資救市
see if we can get the authority to put some money in.

295
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,985
我本不想這麼做的 但若情況特別糟糕的話...
I'd rather not go that way, but if we get there...

296
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,779
我想事態已經很糟糕了
I think we're already there.

297
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,618
- 你能要到多少?  - 一張空白支票
- How much are you gonna ask for?  - A blank check.

298
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,705
投資資金必須足以讓我們挽救市場
It has to be enough of a statement to reassure the market.

299
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,500
得讓市場覺得 我擁有決定性武器
They need to think I've got a bazooka in my pocket.

300
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,671
不是說我們真的會注資 只是如果我們得到了國會的許可
I'm not saying that we use it, but if we have the authority,

301
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,508
那麼 所有瘋狂拋售股票的人會逐漸冷靜下來 重新參與
everyone who's dumping their shares will calm down, back off.

302
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,054
行 若你在國會 你也可以順便提議資助那些投資銀行 是吧?
Okay, if you're going to Congress, why don't we give to the banks, too?

303
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,389
因為雷曼兄弟眼看活不成了 美林也離破產不遠了
'Cause Lehman's looking like shit and Merrill's not far behind.

304
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,225
光說服他們願意接管房利美和房地美就夠走運了
We'll be lucky to get them to move on Fannie and Freddie.

305
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,686
我們只能說試試看
We do what we can do.

306
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,686
北京奧運會開幕式 2008年8月8日

307
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,367
部長先生 部長夫人 請看這邊
Secretary, Mrs. Paulson, over here.

308
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,285
請看這邊 謝謝
Over here, please.

309
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,956
Paulson部長 請看這邊 謝謝
Secretary Paulson, over here, please.

310
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,833
Paulson夫人 謝謝
Mrs. Paulson. Thank you.

311
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,546
Paulson夫人
Mr. Paulson.

312
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,132
Paulson部長 夫人 請看這邊 謝謝
Mr. and Mrs. Paulson, this way, please.

313
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,306
- 我來抱著  - 帶她先去一邊
- I've got her.  - You should take her.

314
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,768
請看這邊 Paulson部長 謝謝
Right over here, Secretary Paulson, please.

315
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,104
請笑一笑 謝謝
Big smile. Thank you.

316
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,189
這正是我需要的
That's just what I need.

317
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,317
新聞媒體拍到美國財政部長居然揮舞著中國國旗
Press photos of the Treasury Secretary waving the Chinese flag.

318
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:12,447
Paulson竟然是共產黨員 你當時臉上的表情很精彩的
Paulson the Communist. The look on your face was priceless.

319
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,160
Hank 關於房利美和房地美 我有問題要問
Hank, I must ask you about Fannie and Freddie.

320
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,168
我們在"兩房"公司投資了數十億美元
We have hundreds of billions invested.

321
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,168
你和我保證過投資是安全的
You've assured us the investment is safe.

322
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,046
是的 絕對安全
And it is, absolutely.

323
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,551
可我們發現 近期損失了很大一筆數額
We're watching a great deal of our money disappear.

324
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,722
兩個月內 股價竟然跌了60%
Share prices have dropped 60% in the last two months.

325
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,307
光到處宣揚你有決定性武器可以救市是不夠的
Carrying your bazooka around has not helped matters.

326
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,562
國會給了你權利 也許是時候使用這項權利了
Congress gave you the power. Perhaps it is time to use it.

327
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,399
市場會穩定下來的 需要的只是時間而已
The market will stabilize. We just have to give it some time.

328
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,361
俄羅斯上個月和我們聯繫
There was an approach last month from Russia.

329
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,240
他們也持有大量房利美和房地美的的債券
They have considerable holdings in Fannie and Freddie as well.

330
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,910
俄羅斯建議我和他們合作 搞一次突擊 
They suggested we coordinate, and without warning,

331
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,614
向市場大量拋售房利美
dump hundreds of billions of Fannie

332
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,414
和房地美的債卷
and Freddie's bonds onto the market.

333
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,878
- 那市場就會...  - 一片混亂
- That would be...  - Chaos.

334
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,002
貴國發售過多的債卷
The amount of debt your country carries

335
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,383
是你們一處致命的弱點
is a terrible vulnerability.

336
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,768
- 但你們...  - 我們很客氣地拒絕了
- But you...  - We declined, respectfully.

337
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,606
即使是在美國
Even in the US, it seems

338
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,560
你們政府和非國營企業
the relationship between the government

339
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,360
的關係似乎也是挺複雜的
and private industry isn't so simple.

340
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,241
他在威脅我們?
Was it a threat?

341
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,953
不 不是 只能算一個友情提示
No, no, it was a friendly reminder

342
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,001
提示我們 只要他們給莫斯科打一個電話
that with a single phone call to Moscow,

343
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,999
我們美國經濟就會全面崩潰
they can take down the entire US economy.

344
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:58,470
從賬面來看 房利美和房地美簡直就是一團糟
The book says Fannie and Freddie are a nightmare.

345
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,223
負債缺口至少有數百億美元
They are in the hole easily tens of billions of dollars.

346
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,558
過不了幾周 他們就無法償還債務了
Another few weeks, they're gonna start defaulting on their debts.

347
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,862
政府得介入干預此事了
We're gonna have to step in. 

348
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:07,562
我不明白該怎麼做
I don't see how we can avoid it.

349
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,568
看來武器不開一槍是震懾不住市場的
Turns out a bazooka's not that useful unless you fire it.

350
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,697
雷曼兄弟股價又跌了10%
Lehman's down another 10%.

351
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,325
你就不讓我安心地咬一口麵包 是吧?
You are not gonna let me get down a single bite, are you?

352
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,618
所以我早餐吃燕麥粥
This is why I have oatmeal.

353
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,329
Dick現在正滿世界地乞求援助
Dick is trotting around the world with his hat in his hands,

354
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,164
但就是沒人給他錢
no one will give him any money.

355
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,333
韓國老闆放棄了他 墨西哥人叫他別管了
Korea walked out on him. Mexico told him to shove it.

356
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,544
沒人對他公司感興趣 所有能忽悠到的融資早就入股了
No one's interested. All the dumb money's already in.

357
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,420
那找美國銀行如何? 他們還有興趣吧?
What about B of A? Are they still in the mix?

358
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,175
巴克萊銀行也開始蠢蠢欲動了
And Barclays is sniffing around again,

359
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,675
他們認為此時是買入的好時機
now that they think it's a fire sale.

360
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,552
- 這倒不錯  - 鬼知道
- That's promising.  - I don't know.

361
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,347
那些英國佬光會說說 從未付諸行動(巴克萊銀行是英國最大商業銀行之一)
The British, they do a lot of talking. They never close.

362
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,310
- 美國銀行是目前最好的收購者了  - 雷曼不能步貝爾斯登後塵
- B of A is still our best bet.  - This can't be another Bear.

363
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,355
不會的 他們會認購雷曼的全部股份
Absolutely not. They want Lehman, they buy it outright.

364
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,107
但他們需要我們經濟上的幫助
But they may need a little hand-holding, though.

365
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,651
因為他們才收購了美國國家金融服務公司 所以口袋埵麻I緊
They just bought Countrywide. They're spread a little thin.

366
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,280
央行對美國銀行資本充足率要求得暫時鬆一鬆
You may have to give them a break with the capital requirements.

367
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,741
你想讓我允許美國銀行提高他們的杠桿比率(償還財務能力比率)
You want me to allow them to raise their leverage

368
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,287
這樣他們就能收購另一家
so they can buy a bank that's about

369
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:05,287
因杠桿比率過高而即將破產的銀行?
to fail because it was overleveraged?

370
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,957
你有更好意見?
You got a better idea?

371
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,460
突發新聞剛剛傳來 財經頻道剛剛收到消息
Breaking news just coming in. Sources telling CNBC

372
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,578
政府最近宣佈接管
that the government has just taken

373
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,840
房利美和房地美公司
control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

374
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,884
然而在七月份 您可能會記起 Hank Paulson曾說過 
Back in July, you remember, Hank Paulson said

375
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,521
他想讓通過此舉來介入
that he wanted the power to step in,

376
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:22,721
但他可能不會採取行動
but he probably wouldn't use it.

377
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,349
現在看來Paulson
It certainly sounds like Paulson

378
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,349
不得不用起他手堛漯Z器了
just pulled the trigger on that bazooka.

379
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,435
雖然房利美和房地美公司正在進行國有化
Despite the move to nationalize Fannie and Freddie,

380
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:35,025
2008年9月11號 紐約市區

381
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,771
但股市仍然全盤處於下跌狀態
the market is still in negative territory across the board.

382
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,025
投資者們現在正關注雷曼兄弟的命運
Investors now focusing their attention on Lehman Brothers,

383
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,886
尤其是有傳言說 這家美國
amid fresh reports that the nation's

384
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,486
第四大投資銀行
fourth-largest investment bank

385
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,280
正處於破產邊緣
may be on the brink of bankruptcy.

386
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
嘿 Rodge
Rodge.

387
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,491
你好 Chris
Chris.

388
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,035
今天帶錢來了 對吧?
Bring your money today, huh?

389
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,035
Chris Flowers 銀行收購專家

390
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,291
別讓Fuld再隱藏什麼對公司不好的消息了
Make sure Fuld's not keeping any bad news out of the mix.

391
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,336
用Dick的話來說就是"大白於天下"
It's "open kimono," to quote Dick.

392
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,669
Rodgin Cohen 雷曼兄弟辯護律師

393
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
他讓人討厭
There's a revolting image.

394
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,469
你研究他們的數據了嗎?
Did, uh, you get a look at the numbers?

395
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,972
房地產資產是個問題 他們對其定價300億美元
The real estate's the issue. They got it marked at 30 billion.

396
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,060
估計高估了一半 別這麼緊張
It's worth maybe half of that. Don't look so nervous.

397
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,655
你們只需要花買一個熱狗的錢
You're about to get a Wall Street

398
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:13,355
就能買到這家華爾街的投資銀行
bank for the price of a hot dog.

399
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:20,983
Greg Curl 美國銀行策劃部部長 

400
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,583
我知道Paulson和Ken Lewis(美國銀行首席執行官)
I know that Paulson told Ken Lewis

401
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:16,983
說過他不會介入此收購的
that he's not gonna pay for this.

402
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,610
若政府不出面接管一些不良資產的話
And I don't see how we can do it

403
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,570
我想我們還是無法收購雷曼的
unless the government takes some of the downside.

404
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,656
Paulson只是故作姿態
Paulson is posturing.

405
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,784
他會給你支票的 就像他曾讓摩根大通
He'll write a check just like he did 

406
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,784
收購貝爾斯登時一樣
for Jamie Dimon on the Bear deal.

407
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,588
他必須這麼做
He has to.

408
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,788
他可不能在總統競選年度再損失一家大型投行了
He can't lose another major bank in an election year.

409
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,592
而且 那傢伙在高盛的時候
Besides, the guy made, like, a half

410
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:34,292
最起碼賺了五億美元
a billion bucks at Goldman Sachs.

411
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,253
他讓雷曼兄弟倒閉? 讓高盛最強的競爭對手倒閉?
He lets Lehman die? Goldman's biggest competitor?

412
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,005
那會讓人懷疑他還是高盛的人呢
Makes him look like he's still working for Goldman.

413
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,883
我估計他這會兒正在財政部寫支票呢
He's just doing it out of a desk at Treasury.

414
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,096
甜甜圈在哪?
Where are the donuts?

415
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,557
就是如此 若你是他們這些金融企業的首席執行官
Exactly. If you're the CEO of one of these financial firms,

416
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,227
你早就注意到政府願意支援你收購的話
you've already seen what the government was willing to do.

417
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,771
那你可以堂而皇之地說
Why wouldn't you play chicken with them and say,

418
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,108
"當然 我們願意協助你們 可你得給我點好處吧?
"Sure, I'll help you out. But you gotta throw in a sweetener,

419
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,943
就像你援助別人收購時所作的"
just like you did for those guys"?

420
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,531
公眾以為我們會資助Dick Fuld
They just assume I'm gonna bail out Dick Fuld,

421
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,575
以為我是那個為他們業績不好擦屁股的人
like I'm the guy behind the elephant with the shovel.

422
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,454
公眾認為雷曼兄弟這次被收購就像
They're all drawing a line from Bear

423
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,454
貝爾斯登 房利美和房地美一樣
and Fannie and Freddie right to Lehman.

424
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,373
不會有納稅人再願意支持資助另一家破產銀行了
There's no way the taxpayers are gonna go for another bailout.

425
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,084
一攬子大規模收購援助政策
Very large purchase assistance package.

426
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,337
這次必須讓他們自己去解決了
We need to come up with a private-sector solution,

427
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,423
讓他們投行自己去彌補負債缺口
get the investment banks to bridge the gap.

428
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,445
可以 但除非他們確信您不會再
Okay, but that's never gonna work

429
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,260
支援該收購行動 否則行不通
unless they believe that you've drawn a line.

430
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,430
我知道您不喜歡向公眾洩露消息 讓我們和媒體交流
I know you don't like leaking, but let us reach out to the press.

431
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,979
好
Okay.

432
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,693
Flowers先生 您有電話
Mr. Flowers, there's a call for you.

433
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,780
是美國國際集團的Bob Willumstad 他堅持一定要與您通話
Bob Willumstad from AIG. He's very insistent.

434
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:55,780
Robert Willumstad 美國國際集團首席執行官

435
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,622
Flowers先生 我的人說你是這方面的專家
Mr. Flowers. My people tell me you're the man to talk to.

436
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
我們公司面臨一個大問題
We've got a real problem here.

437
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,126
嗯? 什麼樣的問題?
Yeah? What kind of problem?

438
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,296
似乎我們的現金流就快斷了
It looks very much like we are about to run out of cash.

439
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,797
美國國際集團?
AIG?

440
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,883
我們給您發了一份文件 是一份電子錶格
We've sent over a document. It's a spreadsheet.

441
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,802
當然 這是一份機密文件 但會讓您瞭解我們的困境的
It's confidential, of course, but it might give you some insight.

442
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,472
我正在處理雷曼兄弟的事情 美國銀行要收購他們
I'm in the middle of Lehman. I'm working with B of A.

443
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,475
那您明天能過來一下嗎?
Is there any way you could come over tomorrow?

444
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:17,395
我會研究下這張表 然後再說吧
I'll take a look at the numbers and we'll talk.

445
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,236
Flowers先生
Mr. Flowers.

446
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,116
誰去開下電視
Somebody put the TV on.

447
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,869
財經頻道在說雷曼兄弟
CNBC's talking about Lehman.

448
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,504
一位熟悉Paulson的...
A person familiar with Paulson's...

449
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:42,504
一位瞭解財政部長Hank Paulson想法的人透露
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's thinking,

450
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,298
在目前這種經濟環境下
and he is saying there will be no government money

451
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,759
政府不會資助美國銀行收購雷曼兄弟
in the resolution of this situation.

452
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,178
他們說雷曼兄弟被收購和貝爾斯登的情況有兩處不同
They're saying two things make the Lehman deal different.

453
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,764
雷曼兄弟收購是市場早已預料到的 並有半年時間
The market's been aware and had time to prepare

454
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,058
可以準備 第二點是...
for over six months. And the second is...

455
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,769
只是電視台在胡扯?
Is that just TV bullshit?

456
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,939
還是Paulson想給我們傳遞的信息?
Or is that Paulson sending us a message?

457
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,774
喂 Chris?
Chris?

458
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,533
什麼? 不好意思
Yeah? Sorry.

459
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,156
"一位財政部部長的朋友"
What exactly does "a person familiar

460
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,456
這到底是什麼意思?
with the Treasury Secretary" mean?

461
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,708
可能有很多的含義
That could mean a lot of things.

462
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,460
是你的某位員工胡言亂語吧?
Did one of your staffers do this?

463
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,546
一定是你十分鐘前解雇了誰吧
Please tell me someone got fired 10 minutes ago.

464
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,464
那是我的意思
The leak came from me.

465
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,387
Hank 你那種公眾宣言
Hank, a public statement like that

466
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,387
可能會引起很多想像不到的災難
can have a lot of unintended consequences.

467
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,148
我們得提醒別的銀行
We had to send a message to the other banks.

468
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,348
讓他們自己解決了
They need to step up.

469
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,392
我的帽子埵A也變不出兔子來了
I don't have another rabbit I can pull out of my hat.

470
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,105
Rodgin Cohen剛打電話給我
Rodgin Cohen just called me.

471
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,441
他說美國銀行的收購團現在
The B of A team is sitting there

472
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:44,941
坐在那邊在手機上玩打磚塊
playing Brickbreaker on their phones.

473
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,234
他們不想收購了
They don't want this deal.

474
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,008
收購暫停是因為
The deal is hanging by a thread because

475
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,488
他們對雷曼調查得越仔細
the closer they get to Lehman,

476
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,866
就越覺得 這其實是一個廢料排放場
the more it looks like a toxic waste dump.

477
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,452
所以我們得為他們收購做風險上的補償
Which is why at the end of the day we may have to help them,

478
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,039
若您不作出那種公眾宣言的話 這場收購本該是很順利的...
which would be a lot easier if we didn't publicly state that...

479
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,167
我們不能 Tim! 那樣做不合法!
We can't, Tim! Legally, we can't!

480
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:07,589
若要合法地做 那這場災難我們也沒辦法阻止
Legally, we haven't figured out how yet.

481
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,510
我很擔心
I am concerned

482
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,349
因為我們現在還有幾種挽救措施 但我們正在
we are limiting our options at a time when we have very few,

483
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,101
浪費他們
if any, available.

484
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:28,735
我想讓那些首席執行官聚集到一起 給他們一個週末的時間
I want all the CEOs in a room. We've got the weekend.

485
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,904
把他們關在美聯儲
We lock them in a room at the Fed

486
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,574
在他們自己解決雷曼兄弟這爛攤子之前 不放他們出來
and we don't let them out until they have a solution on Lehman.

487
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,534
你的燕麥粥快涼了
Your oatmeal's getting cold.

488
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,621
他們會明白事態嚴重性的 他們自己會掏錢的
They'll figure it out. They'll all throw in some money.

489
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,193
Tim強烈建議我們
Tim is advocating strongly that we

490
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,293
央行出面提供一些支援
reconsider some kind of Fed support.

491
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,714
他想讓我們資助所有人
Tim wants us to pick up the tab on everyone.

492
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,714
我可不想做"破產救援大使"
I can't be Mr. Bailout.

493
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,010
而且雷曼兄弟的虧損是貝爾斯登的兩倍
The Lehman hole is twice what Bear's was.

494
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,546
而且投資者正急著從中抽身出來
Investors are pulling their accounts.

495
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:56,638
你想長期借貸給他們嗎?
You want to lend into a run?

496
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,475
那巴克萊銀行呢? 他們仍想收購雷曼嗎?
What about Barclays? Are they still interested?

497
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,311
他們在對待風險上比美國銀行更加保守
They can't afford the risk any more than B of A can.

498
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,814
我相信你一定能夠說服任何人掏出錢
I don't doubt your ability to talk anybody into submission,

499
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,567
但是這風險確實很大
but it is still a long shot.

500
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,862
而且雷曼兄弟很可能會破產
And there's a very real possibility that Lehman goes under.

501
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,198
這周將會有場收購談判
There's a deal to be made here.

502
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,993
這場談判一定會成功的
I'm gonna make the deal.

503
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,830
在收盤前不到一小時
With just a little more than an hour left until the market 

504
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,416
雷曼兄弟的股價又猛跌了一把
closes, shares of Lehman Brothers have taken another tumble.

505
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,587
股價跌到新低 每股4美元都不到了
The stock is now trading at a new low, under $4 a share.

506
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,988
而且從賣方形勢來看
And judging from the selling,

507
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,300
這種下跌趨勢仍會繼續
there doesn't appear to be a bottom in sight.

508
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,139
除了Blankfein(高盛首席執行官)說他有一場演講 會盡量趕過來的
So, Blankfein has a speech he's trying to get out of,

509
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,266
其他的人都同意了
but the rest have confirmed.

510
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,559
- 告訴他必須來參加  - 好的
- Tell him it's not optional.  - Yeah.

511
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,104
Christopher Cox 美國證交會主席

512
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,104
下午好 主席 歡迎來參加該次會議
Good afternoon, Chairman. Thank you so much for joining us.

513
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,275
- 這架是誰的飛機?  - 呃 這是租來的
- Whose plane is this?  - Uh, that's a rental.

514
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,985
Hank自己掏錢的
Hank put it on his card.

515
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,029
先生 你認識Neel 這是Michele Davis負責公眾事務
Sir, you know Neel and Michele Davis, Public Affairs.

516
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,155
嗨 很高興見面
Hi. Pleasure.

517
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,449
- 這位是Dan Jester 我們團隊的新人  - 你好
- This is Dan Jester, our new numbers guy.  - Hi.

518
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,285
是我勸他退休後繼續出來工作的
I talked him into coming out of retirement.

519
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,870
- 什麼? 退休?  - 我們以前在高盛是同事
- Excuse me? Retirement?  - He was with us at Goldman.

520
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,248
財政部還有沒有員工不是從高盛過來的?
Got anybody at Treasury who wasn't at Goldman?

521
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,202
主席 有一點必須澄清一下
Chairman, just to be clear,

522
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:09,002
我們財政部和高盛之間沒有任何利益衝突
there's no question of conflict of interest.

523
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,796
Hank在任職前就將高盛所有的股份拋售了
Hank sold all of his Goldman stock before he took office.

524
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,215
- 我什麼也沒暗示  - 不好意思
- I wasn't implying anything.  - Sorry.

525
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,385
我們對外面所傳的"高盛政府"的謠言比較敏感
We're a little touchy about the whole "Government Sachs" thing.

526
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,846
我們走吧?
Shall we?

527
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,512
美國銀行發現雷曼的不良資產越來越多
B of A keeps finding more toxic assets.

528
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,812
他們需要政府介入模仿之前摩根大通的收購
They want you to reconsider a Jamie deal.

529
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,482
他們會承擔10億元的損失
They'll split the first billion in losses,

530
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,482
剩餘的40億損失的由政府提供擔保
but they want you on the hook for the next 40.

531
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,859
就像你對貝爾斯登收購做的一樣
You did it for Bear.

532
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,945
Greg 我過會打給你
Greg, let me get back to you.

533
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,691
難道我得在我額頭上紋個字才行嗎?
What, do I have to tattoo it on my forehead?

534
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,991
我們不會對雷曼兄弟收購提供一分錢
We are not bailing out Lehman.

535
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,659
這是華爾街自己賭博失敗
Wall Street has a gambling problem.

536
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,530
若老是讓政府為他們擦屁股
If government keeps covering their losses,

537
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,830
他們永遠也得不到教訓
they never learn anything.

538
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,459
- 怎麼了?  - 我不知道您是想繼續
- What?  - I didn't know if you wanted

539
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,538
教導我道德危機
to keep lecturing me on moral hazard

540
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,838
還是想讓我拒絕美國銀行提議
or if I should just call B of A back.

541
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,559
我們只能讓他們都坐在一起 進行討論
We need to keep them at the table

542
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,759
直到這些企業找到自己的解決方法
until they come up with a private-sector solution.

543
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,427
告訴他們最好照我說的做
Tell them to stay with us.

544
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,889
- Alistair 你好啊  - 你好 Henry
- Alistair, hello.  - Hello, Henry.

545
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,099
請等一下
Hold on one second.

546
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,561
英國財政大臣打來的
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

547
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,023
我瞭解到巴克萊銀行想收購雷曼兄弟
I understand Barclays is one of your potential buyers for Lehman.

548
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,817
但我國的銀行最近的資金壓力也很大
My banks are already under a great deal of stress.

549
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,611
我可不想承擔過多義務
I don't want to become overextended.

550
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,155
雷曼兄弟雖然最近出了問題 但還是有價值的
Lehman is problematic, but there's value there.

551
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,451
我們會讓他能夠盈利的 繼續保持合作吧
We will find a way to make it attractive. Just stay with us.

552
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,119
那再說吧
Talk soon then.

553
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,454
再見
Bye.

554
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:33,167
2008年9月18日 星期五

555
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:31,167
我們不會拒絕巴克萊銀行 但最好還是由美國銀行來收購
We'll keep Barclays in the mix, but B of A is still our best bet.

556
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,213
我們今晚會召集所有主要銀行的首席執行官過來開會
We've got the CEOs of every major bank coming here tonight.

557
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,341
我們得明白地告訴他們 這是他們自己捅的簍子
We have to make it clear that this is their problem,

558
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,844
我們政府可以做顧問或是盟友
that we are their advisors and their allies,

559
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,973
但我們不是他們的保險箱
but we are not their safety net.

560
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,476
對這些人 我們還能指望什麼呢?
What should we expect from these guys?

561
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:54,300
紐約 美聯儲

562
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,239
Jamie很聰明
Jamie is smart.

563
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,450
他買下貝爾斯登後 手頭可運作的資金就不多了
He doesn't have as much cash to work with since he bought Bear.

564
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,450
Jamie Dimon 摩根大通主席兼首席執行官

565
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,746
Lloyd是巨星
Lloyd's a superstar.

566
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,707
高盛是華爾街上最精明的一家
Goldman's the smartest shop on the Block.

567
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,169
雖然我之前當過他老闆 但那並不表示 他就會聽我的了
And just because I used to be his boss, it doesn't mean he's gonna listen to me.

568
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,600
Lloyd Blackfein 高盛主席兼首席執行官

569
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,091
John Mack 他過去常常滿樓層東奔西跑 大呼小叫
John Mack, he used to run around the floor screaming,

570
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,511
"水埵釵撠! 我們殺啊!"
"There's blood in the water! Let's go kill someone!"

571
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,347
他是好戰分子
He's a fighter.

572
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,000
John Mack 摩根士丹利主席兼首席執行官

573
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:32,019
Thain是我在高盛的副手 他很自私 是個實用主義者
Thain was my number two at Goldman. He's selfish. He's a pragmatist.

574
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,356
他知道 如果雷曼兄弟倒了 下一個就輪到美林證券了
He knows if Lehman goes, Merrill's next.

575
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,300
John Thain 美林證券主席兼首席執行官

576
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,361
Vikram Pandit剛入職花旗
Vikram Pandit is the new guy at Citigroup.

577
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,533
沒人知道 是他在運作花旗 還是花旗在運作他
No one knows if he's running Citi or if Citi's running him.

578
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,000
Vikram Pandit 花旗集團首席執行官

579
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,893
感謝各位匆忙之中趕來這
Thanks for coming down here on such short notice.

580
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,606
下週一早上 雷曼兄弟將無法償付其債務
Monday morning, Lehman will no longer be able to honor its obligations.

581
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,236
有兩家有意購買 美國銀行和巴克萊銀行
We have two potential buyers. B of A and Barclays.

582
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,824
但如果沒有第三方融資 它們都無法完成收購
Neither will take the company unless someone else finances part of the deal.

583
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,203
政府不會進行干預
The government is not in a position to step in.

584
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,582
上一次是最後一次 這次就由你們完成了
I did the last one. You're gonna do this one.

585
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,042
Dick Fuld在哪兒?
Where's Dick Fuld?

586
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,377
Dick不適合再做決定了
Dick's in no condition to make any decisions.

587
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,464
我們將各位分成三組
We're breaking you into three groups.

588
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:46,385
第一組 評估雷曼兄弟的不良資產
The first one will try to value Lehman's toxic assets.

589
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,972
第二組 設計投資架構 讓大家都可以投資雷曼
The second one will work on some sort of structure for you all to invest in Lehman.

590
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,018
第三組 制定熄燈計劃
And the third one works on the lights-out plan.

591
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,604
如果雷曼兄弟申請破產 我們需要考慮
If Lehman files for bankruptcy, we need to figure out

592
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,898
如何遏制對各家的損害
how to contain the damage to the rest of you.

593
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,274
天吶
Christ.

594
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,151
我們早就預見到會出現這種狀況
We've all seen this coming for miles.

595
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:05,363
我認為 雷曼兄弟即使破產 也不會給我們公司帶來太大影響
I don't think a Lehman bankruptcy takes down our firms.

596
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,949
所以呢 我們就只能祝福雷曼了嗎?
What, are we crossing our fingers?

597
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:13,120
這是要求我們挽救競爭對手 別表現得好像在幫我們一樣
You're asking us to save a competitor. Let's not act like you're doing us a favor.

598
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,375
各位 各位 大家都是偉大的美國人
Gentlemen, gentlemen, you are great Americans

599
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,335
這是承擔我們的愛國責任
undertaking a patriotic duty.

600
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,964
各位的努力將為自身贏得
Your travail will earn you the love

601
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,466
舉國的愛戴和感激
and gratitude of your country.

602
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,802
我記得 Thomas Paine(激進民主主義者)曾經說過 "這些..."
I think it was Thomas Paine who said, "These are..."

603
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,096
雷曼兄弟是在座各家銀行的合作夥伴
Lehman is a trading partner for every bank in this room.

604
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,890
它的破產將對大家都有很大衝擊
Their failure will be a massive blow to all of you.

605
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,517
這就是重點
This is your problem.

606
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,562
我們可以好好說說 為何會到如此地步
We can all argue about how we got here.

607
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,232
放鬆管制 衍生品 Dick Fuld決策不利
Deregulation, derivatives, Dick Fuld made bad decisions.

608
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,819
我們都有責任 這是災難性的動盪
We're all responsible. It's a catastrophic mess.

609
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,656
政府已經竭盡所能 現在全靠你們了
The government's done whatever it can do. It's on you now.

610
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,492
各位該解決問題 付出代價了
You need to fix it and you need to pay for it.

611
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,703
我就直說了
Let me be clear.

612
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:59,500
沒出力的人 我們會記下的
We will remember anyone who is not helpful.

613
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:16,000
2008年9月13日 星期六

614
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,109
你注意到這其中的小規律了嗎?
Do you notice a little pattern here?

615
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,945
不見棺材不掉淚
We don't deal with things until there's some kind of emergency on the table.

616
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,114
是啊 不到最後一刻 沒人會去處理的
Yeah, we don't deal with things until Friday.

617
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,324
現在一隻腳已經踏進去了
Some kind of a weekend thing.

618
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,450
我們什麼時候才能
When were we gonna figure out

619
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,619
找到解決投資銀行的破產問題的好方法?
exactly how to handle the failure of an investment bank?

620
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,329
週末搞定吧
Let's do it over a weekend.

621
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,790
我剛剛跟一位密切關注現狀的專家談過
I talked to a person who is monitoring the situation out there,

622
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,003
他說 業界人士都期望 他們能和Jamie Dimon一樣 得到政府的自助
and the person said they all want the same deal Jamie Dimon got,

623
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,130
但預計期望會落空
and they're not going to get it.

624
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,383
提醒一句 Chris Flowers正在大廳
Just a heads up, Chris Flowers is in the lobby.

625
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,386
他是美國銀行收購雷曼案的顧問
He's consulting for B of A on Lehman.

626
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,182
Hank之前將Flowers擠出了高盛
Hank pushed Flowers out of Goldman.

627
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,894
昨天我們還認為雷曼的不良資產僅300億 今天就漲到了700億
Yesterday, we thought Lehman was holding 30 billion in crap. Today it's 70.

628
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,397
700億不良資產 這還只是隨機抽樣
$70 billion in assets that we're valuing with a dartboard.

629
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,732
沒事 我們會解決這個問題
No, we're gonna work this out.

630
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,318
除非政府干預 不然我們就停手
Unless you step in, we're ending this.

631
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,694
別忘了Dick
Don't forget about Dick.

632
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,740
好了 Dick Fuld不停打來電話 不停要求我們提高價格
Yeah, Dick Fuld keeps calling, hammering us to raise the price.

633
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,869
抱歉
Excuse me.

634
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:25,378
700億不良資產 還無擔保?
70 fucking billion and no collateral?

635
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,590
如果雷曼兄弟本週末破產
If Lehman Brothers fails this weekend,

636
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,928
專家們毫不懷疑 下一個將是美林證券
there's little doubt amongst the people I speak to that Merrill Lynch will be next.

637
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,180
信心是非常脆弱的
Confidence is a very fragile thing.

638
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,934
在金融市場 信心的流失速度非常快
And in our financial markets, it is eroding very quickly.

639
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:45,106
雷曼撐不下去了 我們就是下一個 必須立刻採取措施了
Lehman's not gonna make it. We're next. We need to do something right now.

640
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,776
只有美國銀行能救我們了 我可以打個電話看看
B of A's the only one out there. I can put in a call.

641
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,945
- 雖然這樣會毀了雷曼 不過...  - 雷曼是自食其果
- It screws Lehman, but...  - Lehman screwed themselves.

642
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,534
Paulson已經劃定了底線 雷曼完了 打電話吧
Paulson has drawn a line in the sand. Lehman is dead. Make the call.

643
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,124
你們考慮一下收購美林的股份吧
We'd like you guys to look at taking a stake in Merrill,

644
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,960
有約10%的利潤
something in the neighborhood of 10%.

645
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,797
我不知道能否拿到10%的利潤
I don't know if I can generate any interest in 10%,

646
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,592
不過如果是收購整家公司的話
but if the whole company's in play,

647
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,803
我們肯定是願意考慮一下的
I bet that's something that we'd consider.

648
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,930
我們和雷曼?
Us and Lehman?

649
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,725
這種規模的收購 我們只能完成一家
Deal this size, there's only room for one.

650
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:32,486
毫無疑問 風險很大 但是只要各位不中途退出
It is a lot of risk, no question, but if you stay in the game,

651
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,989
- 就都能找到各自的解決之道  - 當然了
- we all will find a private solution.  - Absolutely.

652
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:41,662
別被這些數字嚇到了 我們會解決的 雷曼是值得收購的
Don't get scared by the numbers. We'll figure it out. Lehman is worth owning.

653
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,457
各位 有空嗎?
Guys, you got a second?

654
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,920
我昨天去過了美國國際集團
I was at AIG yesterday.

655
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,592
下週三 他們將有至少50億的缺口
Next Wednesday, they got a $5 billion hole, minimum.

656
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,513
我跟沃倫·巴菲特聯繫過了 他表示絕對不會幫忙
I called Warren Buffett. He wouldn't touch it with a stick.

657
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,932
我們會調查清楚
We're looking into it.

658
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,976
這是一家非常大的公司
It's a very big company.

659
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,357
謝了 Chris 感謝你所有的幫助
Thanks, Chris. I appreciate all your help.

660
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,533
他們根本不瞭解狀況
They're not on top of it.

661
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,375
看看這個
Look at this.

662
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,423
這可能嗎?
Is this even possible?

663
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,258
美國國際集團?
AIG?

664
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,593
該死的
Holy shit.

665
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,138
調查清楚
Get into this.

666
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,517
嘿 John
John.

667
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,775
你明白現在的狀況嗎?
Do you see what's happening here?

668
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,444
你想好怎麼為自己打算了嗎?
Are you watching out for yourself?

669
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:59,990
我不笨 我正在採取行動
I'm not thick. I'm working on something.

670
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,996
你想去找美國銀行
You're talking to B of A.

671
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,333
抱歉
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,920
我知道 這樣對雷曼不好 但是我必須先顧好美林
I know it's not good for Lehman, but I have to take care of Merrill.

673
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,464
把雷曼扔給我來操心
Let me worry about Lehman.

674
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,134
巴克萊還沒有退出
Barclays is still in the game.

675
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,596
你去搞定吧
Just get it done.

676
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,361
美國銀行將收購美林
B of A is gonna buy Merrill.

677
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,699
我們必須讓巴克萊出手
We need to make Barclays work.

678
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,327
我記得你說過 英國佬只說不做的
I thought you said the British never close.

679
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,915
他們就在外面 似乎真的很想收購
They're here. They seem to really want it.

680
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,210
只要我們主動一點 他們就會收購的
If we hold their hands, they'll close.

681
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:58,674
Rodgin 怎麼回事? Geithner不接電話 Paulson也不接電話
Rodgin, what the fuck? I can't get Geithner. I can't get Paulson.

682
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,594
連我的手下現在也不接電話了
I can't even get my own goddamn employees to pick up the phone.

683
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,637
Dick 大家都太忙了
There's a lot happening down here, Dick.

684
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,139
噢 該死
Oh, fuck.

685
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,933
給我聽好 你去告訴Geithner
You know what? You tell Geithner,

686
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,061
他要是不幫我把這事解決了 下一個就輪到美林了
he doesn't pull my ass out of the fire, Merrill's gonna be next.

687
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,313
他知道
He knows that.

688
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,775
Dick 他剛告訴我 他們正在為美林尋找出路
Dick, he just told me they're working on a solution for Merrill.

689
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,156
那群混蛋要去幫美林?
Those cocksuckers are gonna bail out Merrill?

690
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,824
不 不是美聯儲
No, no, not the Fed.

691
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,870
沒有私營買家了 只有美國銀行和...
There's no private buyers. There's just B of A and...

692
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,498
他們想讓美國銀行收購美林?
They're gonna put B of A together with Merrill?

693
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,084
還有巴克萊銀行 Hank覺得...
We still have Barclays. Hank feels that...

694
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,963
聯邦政府竟然給我幫倒忙?
The federal government is snaking my deal?

695
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,800
我簡直不敢相信!
I cannot fucking believe this shit!

696
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,221
美國銀行和美林達成協議了?
B of A made a deal with Merrill?

697
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,307
對 雷曼的問題還是沒解決
Yeah, Lehman's still our problem.

698
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,000
2008年9月14日

699
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,143
再來這麼一次 我可受不了了
I don't think I can take another day of this.

700
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,521
你是剛下梅賽德斯 來到紐約美聯儲
You're getting out of a Mercedes to go to the New York Federal Reserve.

701
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,316
可不是奧馬哈海灘的希金斯快艇
It's not a Higgins boat on Omaha Beach.

702
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,786
好了 好了 時間已經夠長了
Okay, okay, we've been here a long time.

703
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,122
別廢話了
Let's stop fucking around.

704
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,125
政府想讓華爾街付賬
Main Street wants Wall Street to pay.

705
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,045
他們覺得 我們就是有錢的笨蛋
They think we're overpaid assholes.

706
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,590
沒有哪條政策規定 一定要參與緊急援助
There's no politician who's gonna sign off on a bailout.

707
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,594
那為什麼不去資助那些賺錢的人呢?
Why would you bail out people whose sole job is to make money?

708
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,598
簡單點說一下現在的狀況吧
So, let's make this real simple.

709
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,478
Hank認為 他可以把雷曼好的資產出售給巴克萊銀行
Hank thinks he can sell the good parts of Lehman to Barclays,

710
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,899
但這樣就得有人把拖垮這家公司的抵押房產接手下來
but someone has to take the real estate crap that's weighing down the company.

711
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,734
誰都不知道這些不良資產的價值
Nobody knows how much this shit is worth,

712
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,945
但我們很清楚 一定得有人買下這批資產 以完成收購
but we know somebody has to buy it to make a deal.

713
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:47,282
我不喜歡這樣 沒人喜歡這樣
I don't like it. Nobody likes it.

714
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,244
那就別抱怨了 去做吧
Let's just suck it up and do it.

715
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,000
有多少人可以投個10億元 阻止雷曼的頹勢?
How many of you can kick in a billion dollars to stop Lehman from going down?

716
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,505
我投 10億
I'm in. One billion.

717
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,186
好
Okay.

718
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,236
高盛投10億
Goldman's in for a billion.

719
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,995
John 你呢?
John?

720
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,414
喂?
Yeah?

721
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,463
是
Yes.

722
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,133
好
Yeah.

723
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,304
是
Yes.

724
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,895
成功了 巴克萊銀行願意購買
We did it. Barclays came through.

725
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,813
太棒了!
Too goddamn right!

726
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,443
巴克萊不願意要不動產資產 但是其他銀行同意收購這部分了
Barclays won't touch the real estate assets, but the other banks agreed to cover those.

727
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:10,324
通知董事會 把大家都喊來 我們有交易要談了
Call the board. Get everybody here. We got a deal to make.

728
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,700
好的
Okay.

729
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
晚上9點 倫敦

730
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,003
找到他了嗎?
Did you get him?

731
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,506
Geithner不回我電話
Geithner doesn't return my calls.

732
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,966
我們一個人都找不到
We can't get hold of any of those people.

733
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,928
今天之前 沒有我們發話 他們是簽不了協議的
At the end of the day, they can't sign the deal without our say-so.

734
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,138
對 但是他們知道嗎?
Yes, but do they know that?

735
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,893
對
Yes.

736
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:42,893
Callum McCarthy爵士 英國銀監會主席

737
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,689
嗯 一定 既然他屈尊來電 那就放他一馬吧
Yes, by all means, now that he deigns to call, put him through.

738
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,692
Callum爵士 抱歉沒能回電
Sir Callum, sorry I haven't gotten back to you.

739
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,363
我們在處理巴克萊銀行收購雷曼的事宜
We're just sorting through this Barclays deal for Lehman.

740
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,491
身為巴克萊銀行的監管方
As Barclays' regulator,

741
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,494
我們非常關注這樁計劃中的交易
we have serious concerns about this proposed arrangement.

742
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,456
什麼? 你是說你不同意這樁交易?
What? Are you saying you won't approve the deal?

743
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,001
就算我們同意這樁交易 事實上並非如此
Even if we were comfortable with the agreement, which we are not,

744
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,089
巴克萊銀行也需要至少提前30天徵得股東同意
Barclays would need at least 30 days for shareholder approval.

745
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,885
不 不 不 他不能 他不能這樣做
No, no, no, no, no, no. He can't. He can't do this.

746
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,638
- 他們能阻止交易嗎?  - 是的 當然可以了
- Can they stop the deal?  - Yeah, of course they can stop the deal.

747
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,640
不過就算他們阻止不了 光是耽擱一下 雷曼也完了
But even if they don't stop it, the delay will kill it.

748
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,185
立刻給英國財政大臣打電話
Let's call the Chancellor of the Exchequer right now.

749
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:25,190
巴克萊銀行絕對不會接受任何不良資產
None of those assets would be part of Barclays.

750
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,529
是 但是如果英國金融服務管理局要...
Yes, but if the FSA were to...

751
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,281
我們需要穩定的局勢
We need stability.

752
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,075
當然
Of course.

753
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,036
對英國金融系統而言 它也是 你們肯定發現了
must be to the British financial system. Surely you see that.

754
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,246
當然
Yeah.

755
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,249
晚安 好運
I wish you good night and good luck.

756
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,586
晚安
Good night to you, too.

757
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,762
"我們不會引入你們的癌癥"
"We don't want to import your cancer."

758
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,776
各位
Those of you

759
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,364
不想幫助巴克萊收購案的人
who didn't want to assist the Barclays deal,

760
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,117
現在可以鬆一口氣了
you can breathe a sigh of relief.

761
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,411
交易取消
The deal's not gonna happen.

762
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,747
- 嘿 我們籌到錢了  - 交易沒了
- Hey, we have the money.  - Deal's dead.

763
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,125
巴克萊的監管方不願簽字
British regulator won't sign off.

764
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,793
你們可以施壓啊
There must be some pressure you can exert.

765
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,463
相信我 我已經盡力了
Trust me, I've done everything I can.

766
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,215
英國佬
The British,

767
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,260
耍了我們
they grin-fucked us.

768
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,226
Paulson有10萬僱員 Geithner有200名律師
Paulson's got 100,000 employees. Geithner has 200 lawyers.

769
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,728
該死的Chris Cox有3千手下
Frigging Chris Cox has 3,000 people.

770
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,522
這群混蛋就沒一個人拿起話筒
Not a single one of those assholes could pick up a phone,

771
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,108
給英國佬打電話 趁他們還沒在週末剝削完我們的資金前
call the British, find out if there was a deal to be made

772
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,862
看看能不能搞定這樁交易?
before they spend the weekend sweating us for cash?

773
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,280
有人失誤了
Somebody dropped the ball.

774
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,199
他們不是失誤
They didn't drop the ball.

775
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,076
是有意犯錯 激怒高管
They dropped the ball, kicked the coach in the nuts

776
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,203
故意把事情搞得一團糟
and took a crap in the quarterback's mouth.

777
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,829
當然
Of course.

778
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,918
聯邦政府會有所行動
The Fed will do something.

779
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,295
必須的
They have to.

780
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,135
我們要馬上對外宣佈 雷曼破產的消息
We've got to announce the Lehman bankruptcy now.

781
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,847
如果亞洲股市開盤 收購案還沒敲定 大家都要做最壞的打算
If Asia opens and this isn't locked down, everyone's gonna assume the worst.

782
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,141
證券跌價會導致美國銀行收購美林的失敗
The sell-off will kill the Merrill-B of A deal.

783
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,602
- 誰去發佈公告?  - 我想應該有美國證監會來
- Who's gonna make the announcement?  - I think it's gotta be SEC.

784
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,812
對
Yeah.

785
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,856
好
Okay.

786
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,320
那就決定了 什麼時候開始行動?
Let's do it here. How soon can we set that up?

787
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,738
現在
Right away.

788
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,533
我們可以用主樓層 門廳那
We could use the main floor, the entrance hall.

789
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,160
我後面還能有雕像? 很棒
With the statue behind me? Excellent.

790
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,875
雷曼真的同意申請破產了?
Did Lehman actually agree to file?

791
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,261
Chris 給雷曼打電話
Chris, call Lehman.

792
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,929
確保他們馬上申請
Make sure they file right now.

793
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,681
一定
Absolutely.

794
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,862
美國國際集團是個大麻煩
AIG's a huge problem.

795
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,656
賬目一團亂 不過我現在可以告訴你
The books are a mess. But from what I can tell,

796
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,659
世界上一半的銀行和這群傢伙有關聯
half the banks in the world are in bed with these guys.

797
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,911
所有做過按揭抵押的銀行
Everyone who had a piece-of-crap mortgage security

798
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,415
都在美國國際集團為其風險投過保 我是說所有
bought insurance on their risk from AIG, and I mean everyone.

799
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,834
他們怎麼能讓這種事發生?
How could they let this happen?

800
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,963
他們肯定是覺得 房地產市場不會崩塌 絕不會
They must have figured real estate would never go down, ever.

801
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,632
Hank 雷曼還沒申請
Hank, Lehman still hasn't filed.

802
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,930
Cox必須要發佈公告了 亞洲股市要開盤了
Cox has to make his announcement. Asia's opening.

803
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,182
他和他們談過了嗎?
Has he talked to them?

804
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,476
他根本還沒打
He hasn't even called yet.

805
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,145
我們把巴克萊的事告訴了Fuld 我們說Cox會打電話給他
We told Fuld about Barclays. We said Cox was gonna call.

806
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,398
他就讓所有股東坐在那 不許接電話
He's got his entire board sitting there, no call.

807
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,233
Cox拒不開口
Cox is like a deer in the headlights.

808
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,944
混賬!
Son of a bitch!

809
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,746
你是他們的監管方 馬上給雷曼董事會打電話
You are their regulator. Call the Lehman board now.

810
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,415
Hank 現在的情況非常複雜...
Hank, it's a complicated situation where...

811
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,417
亞洲要開盤了
Asia's opening.

812
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,252
他們不公告 市場就完了
They don't announce, the market goes in the toilet.

813
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,381
我們必須考慮政府在其中扮演何種角色才比較恰當
We have to consider the appropriate role of government here.

814
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,549
我身為證監會主席 能否提議...
Can I, as Chairman of SEC, move forward and...

815
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,052
你們就像是不能出面的幕後人
You guys are like the gang that can't shoot straight.

816
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,804
這就是你們的工作
This is your job.

817
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,974
趕緊去打電話
Make the damn phone call.

818
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,025
Chris 我是Dick Fuld
Chris, this is Dick Fuld.

819
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,780
董事會成員正在開會 大家都到齊了 所有的股東和公司的法律顧問
The board is in session. Everyone is here. All the directors and the firm's counsel.

820
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,242
我們明白和巴克萊的談判已經失敗
We understand the Barclays deal has imploded.

821
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:52,416
我們在想你們有沒有我們還沒想到的解決方案
We were hoping you might have some option that we haven't thought of yet.

822
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:56,461
你知道 市場現在處於一團亂的狀態
Um, the markets are in turmoil, as you know.

823
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,214
我相信 雷曼兄弟的破產
A Lehman bankruptcy will help

824
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,050
有助於消除不穩定性因素 起到穩定市場的作用
settle that uncertainty and, we believe, calm the market.

825
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:04,886
不管是聯邦政府還是證監會都同意了
Both the Fed and SEC are in agreement about this.

826
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,807
讓我...  不好意思 我來說說看看我是不是理解了
Let me... I'm sorry, let me see if I understand this.

827
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,686
你是想命令我們使雷曼兄弟破產嗎?
Are you directing us to put Lehman into bankruptcy?

828
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,563
給我們幾分鐘
Give us a moment.

829
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,732
- 他們靜音了  - 這是怎麼回事?
- He's muted.  - What the hell was that?

830
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,904
讓他們去申請破產
Tell them to file.

831
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,074
任何在本次會議上的發言會被作為公共記錄
Everything said in that meeting is or will be public record.

832
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,285
我不能命令一家私人公司申請破產
I can't tell a private company to file for bankruptcy.

833
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,538
我沒這權利的吧?
I don't have that power. Do I?

834
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,043
去做
Do it.

835
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:55,061
董事會需要做出一個決定 提出破產保護的申請
The decision to file for bankruptcy protection is one the board needs to make.

836
00:46:56,022 --> 00:47:00,358
這並非政府的決定 但我們相信
It is not the government's decision. But we do believe

837
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,696
必須有人來解決問題
that the situation should be resolved.

838
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,365
所以你不是在命令我們申請?
So you're not directing us to file?

839
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,661
我要說的就這麼多了 謝謝
I'm not saying anything more than I've just said. Thank you.

840
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,760

P?

856
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,484
- 雷曼完蛋了  - 哦 親愛的
- Lehman's gone.  - Oh, honey.

857
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,236
我本該料到英國那邊會出問題的
I should have known the British were gonna be a problem.

858
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,863
兩天前我和他們談過 那時我應該察覺出言下之意的
I spoke to them two days ago. I should have read between the lines.

859
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:37,414
你不能獨自承受一切 這件事涉及了太多人
You can't take all this on. There's a lot of other people involved.

860
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,417
是我的問題 因為我是財政部長
It's on me. I'm Treasury Secretary

861
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,961
在我的監管下 我國第四大投資銀行
and the fourth-largest investment bank in the country

862
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,796
倒閉了
failed on my watch.

863
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,382
我是說...
I mean...

864
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,012
我不知道將來會發生什麼
I don't know what's gonna happen.

865
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,266
我也想你
Miss you, too.

866
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:05,830
2008年9月15日 週一  早上6:30

867
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,230
喲 出租車!
Yo, taxi!

868
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,246
亞洲股市大幅下跌收市 

869
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:54,246
專家稱:"Paulson終於讓華爾街變得一文不值"

870
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,246
Jim 我現在在市中心
Jim, I'm in midtown.

871
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,916
電子指示器在...
The ticker is...

872
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,960
我看到的究竟是什麼?
What the hell am I looking at?

873
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,380
Hank 沒事
Hank, it's good.

874
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,220
"財政部和聯邦儲備局
"It is oddly reassuring

875
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,014
放棄雷曼兄弟的決定
"that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve

876
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,516
意想不到地讓人感到舒心"
let Lehman Brothers fail."

877
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,643
好的 這條 這條
Okay, here it is. Here it is.

878
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,020
"政府的介入會被解讀成
"Government intervention would have been seen

879
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,774
全球金融體系正處於極度動盪中
"as a sign of extreme peril in the global financial system

880
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,694
或是聯邦管理當局的監管不力的標誌
"or extreme weakness on the part of federal regulators."

881
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,071
該死的紐約時報
The New York fucking Times.

882
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,157
是啊 不僅是他們 每個人都這麼說
Yeah, and it's not just them. It's everybody.

883
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,618
謝謝 議員 很感激你
Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it.

884
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,372
議會很喜歡
Congress is liking it.

885
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,207
我倒是不太確定他們是不是真這麼高興
I'm not sure they should be so happy about this,

886
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,377
不過他們覺得我們讓雷曼退出是對的
but they like that we let Lehman go.

887
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:52,674
你態度強硬 你果敢 在這種時候 人們需要的就是這種態度
You stood strong. You've got brass balls. It's what people need at a time like this.

888
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,759
市場反應怎麼樣?
What is the market doing?

889
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,346
歐洲股指只出現小幅下跌 道瓊斯指數也小幅下探了3%
Europe's only down a little. Dow Jones futures only off 3 %.

890
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,432
那你就得在新聞發佈會上強調這點
So you need to build on this at the press conference.

891
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,810
你要告訴大家我們已經為雷曼兄弟做了我們能做的一切
The story is we did everything we could for Lehman.

892
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,562
- 我們的確做了  - 但是放棄的理由是...
- We did.  - And the takeaway is...

893
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,272
沒有援助資金了
No more bailouts.

894
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,024
部長先生
Mr. Secretary.

895
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,818
我們應該如何解讀發生在雷曼兄弟身上的事件?
How should we read what happened with Lehman?

896
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:16,573
解讀成我認為維護市場的穩定和金融系統的有序
Read it as I think it's important to maintain the stability

897
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:20,243
是至關重要的
and orderliness of our financial system,

898
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,788
還有 呃 就是
and, um, the

899

我非常重視道德風險

900
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,837
- Paulson先生  - 部長 先生
- Mr. Paulson.  - Mr. Secretary, sir.

901
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,424
你認為現在的銀行體系是否健全?
How do you see the health of the banking system today?

902
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,092
當今市場的運行
The way the markets are performing today,

903
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,595
是對於驗證在極端情況下
it's a testament to how the financial industry has come together

904
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,473
整個金融行業是否能同心協力渡過難關的考驗
in an extraordinary set of circumstances.

905
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,769
美國民眾應該對金融系統的穩健和韌性
The American people can remain confident in the soundness and the resilience

906
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,439
持樂觀態度 謝謝各位
of the financial system. Thank you all.

907
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,525
- 部長大人  - Paulson先生
- Mr. Secretary.  - Mr. Paulson.

908
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,194
怎麼了?
What?

909
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,322
道瓊斯大幅下挫 已經下跌了400點了
Dow is falling off a cliff. Four hundred points already.

910
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,449
整個信貸市場也處於凍結狀態
And the credit markets are frozen.

911
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,118
高盛和摩根斯坦利收到大量撤資申請
Goldman and Morgan Stanley are getting slammed by withdrawals.

912
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,287
雷曼事件正在危及他們
The Lehman thing's killing them.

913
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,210
我得和總統談談我們該如何控制損失
I should talk to the President about how we'll contain the damage.

914
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,837
在你找總統談話之前
Before you speak to the President,

915
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,798
我們還有個麻煩需要解決
we've got another problem.

916
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,967
是美國國際集團
AIG.

917
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,013
Geithner先生正在同美國國際集團探討由企業主導的解決方案
Mr. Geithner is working with AIG on a private-sector solution

918
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:26,768
部長正非常謹慎地跟進他們的進展
and the Secretary is monitoring their progress very carefully.

919
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,855
他與國會領導者們也保持密切聯繫...
He's in close contact with the Congressional leadership, most...

920

白宮希望我們對美國國際集團的情況做簡要匯報
White House wants a briefing on AIG.

921
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,277
你知道的比我們多 我們有的信息 你也有
You're more informed about that than we are. We've got the same information you do.

922
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,322
不 我們並不認為雷曼兄弟破產
No, we don't believe that Lehman's bankruptcy

923
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,449
足以整垮整個華爾街
is taking down all of Wall Street.

924
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,826
好吧 那你怎麼解釋...
Okay, but how do you explain...

925
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,914
美國國際集團的情況惡化的原因在於...
The AIG situation may have been, you know, exacerbated by the...

926
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,749
還有Barney Frank的辦公室
And Barney Frank's office.

927
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,628
- 你好  - 突然發生? 
- Yeah.  - A surprise?

928
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:56,047
不 美國國際集團已經掙扎了...
No, AIG has been struggling...

929
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,133
你們這幫人怎麼沒在6個月前阻止他們?
Why didn't you guys head off this situation six months ago?

930
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,096
因為我們沒有魔杖 Doug
Because the requisite magic wand wasn't available, Doug.

931
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,724
如果我們找到了 我們會在第一時間通知你
But if we do find one, you will be among the very first to know.

932
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,436
Blankfei在四號線 緊急
Blankfein on four, urgent.

933

我得走了
I have to go.

934
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,232
嗨 Lloyd
Hey, Lloyd.

935
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,693
這該死的英國破產管理人
The goddamn British bankruptcy administrator

936
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,112
把所有雷曼客戶的資產都凍結了
froze all of Lehman's customer accounts.

937
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,531
在你下決定之前你沒有和他們協商好嗎?
You didn't square this with the British before you did it?

938
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,074
Geithner 5號線
Geithner on five.

939
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,703
人們陷入了恐慌 他們拿不到錢
People are freaking out. They can't get their money.

940
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,539
不是投資者們 是客戶們
Not investors, clients.

941
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,166
如果消費者覺得他們的錢放在雷曼那兒不安全
If customers think their money wasn't safe with Lehman,

942
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,793
他們也不會相信我們
they're not gonna trust us either.

943
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:37,005
沒人願意和我們做生意
No one will do business with us.

944
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,007
你得等我一下
You're gonna have to hang on.

945
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,133
Tim啊
Tim.

946
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,886
Dan和穆迪投資評級機構通話了 他們今晚要下調對美國國際集團的評級
Dan spoke to Moody's. They're downgrading AIG tonight.

947
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,097
雖說這事兒遲早會發生 但雷曼事件加速了下調的進程
Would have happened anyway, but Lehman put the whole thing into hyperdrive.

948
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,724
會降到哪一級?
How far down are they?

949
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,309
法國財政部長 6號線
French Finance Minister on six.

950
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,019
他們不知道
They don't know.

951
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,938
我們在努力挽救
We're working on it.

952
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,190
Christine啊
Christine.

953
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,067
你怎麼能讓這事情發生在雷曼身上?
How could you let this happen with Lehman?

954
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:59,736
Christine Lagarde 法國財政部長

955
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,736
你到底怎麼想的?
What on earth were you thinking?

956
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,530
我們已做了我們該做的一切 Christine
We did everything we could, Christine.

957
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:06,701
你默許了雷曼破產 Hank 這大錯特錯
You allowed it to fail, Hank. It was a horrifying mistake.

958
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,287
這會給整個歐洲帶來災難性的結果
It is having catastrophic consequences all over Europe.

959
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,915
美國國際集團的情況會變得更糟
And AIG would be even worse.

960
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:15,627
整個歐洲銀行都與美國國際集團往來密切
The European banks have tremendous exposure to AIG.

961
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,838
我們希望從你這兒得到保證 你不會讓它像雷曼一樣破產
We need assurance you will not fail to act, as you did with Lehman.

962
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,633
這不僅僅是美國的問題
It is not just an American problem.

963
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,010
非常感謝...
Thank you so much for...

964
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,386
是John Mack
John Mack.

965
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,848
- John  - John 一號線
- John.  - John, one.

966
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,436
雷曼的破產正連累著我們
The fallout from Lehman is killing us.

967
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,357
做空者都在拋售我們的股票 我們已經跌了10%
The short-sellers are all over us. We're down 10 % already.

968
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,734
你們不知道外面情況有多糟
You guys have no idea what's going on out here.

969
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,278
你的收入怎麼樣?
How are your earnings?

970
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,781
很好 我們準備週五公佈消息
Strong. We're gonna announce Friday.

971
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,907
現在就公佈
Announce now.

972
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,869
好了 Lloyd 不好意思
Okay, Lloyd, sorry.

973
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,122
Hank 如果儲戶們發現他們不能從雷曼的賬戶上取款
Hank, if depositors see they can't get their assets out of Lehman,

974
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,085
接下來就會有大批人從各投資銀行撤資
the next step is gonna be a massive pullout from all the investment banks.

975
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,586
Jeff Immelt 通用電氣
Jeff Immelt from GE.

976
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,465
天吶 Immelt為什麼打電話給你?
Jesus, what's Immelt calling you for?

977
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,802
我得掛了 Jeff
I have to go. Jeff.

978
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,595
你得知道現在時態變成什麼樣子
You gotta know what's going on out here.

979
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:11,224
Jeffery Immelt 世界最大公司 通用電氣 主席兼首席執行官

980
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,224
我們每天的營運現金流出現了問題
We're having trouble funding our day-to-day operations.

981
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,978
我們的財務部影響其他各個部門
Our finance division is infecting the rest of our business.

982
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,562
通用電氣?
General Electric?

983
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,983
這件事情波及的不僅僅是華爾街的公司
This thing is spreading way past Wall Street.

984
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,193
我明白沒有人想去碰次級貸款
I get that nobody wants to touch mortgages,

985
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,822
但我們要製造飛機 引擎 燈泡
but we're making planes and engines, light bulbs.

986
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,199
我們是家健康的企業
We're a healthy company.

987
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,994
如果我們不能有充足的日常營運資金來運營公司
If we can't finance our day-to-day operations,

988
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,330
那我們在美國所有的業務都有可能無法運作
every business in America's gonna be shutting down.

989
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,633
- 美國國際集團股價多少?  - 收盤價2美元
- Where's AIG?  - It closed at $2.

990
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:49,512
Tim覺得我們得採取有力行動 Ben和我都同意了
Tim thinks we need to do something big. Ben agrees, and so do I.

991
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,514
我們能做什麼? 美國國際集團又不是銀行
What can we do? AIG's not even a bank.

992
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,519
聯邦政府會在非常緊急時期借錢給非銀行機構 
The Fed can lend to non-banks under unusual and exigent circumstances.

993
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,856
我們考慮接手80%美國國際集團的股份
We're thinking of taking over 80% of the company.

994
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,111
Hank 我們不能這麼做
Hank, we can't.

995
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,905
今天上午我們還向全體公民普及了道德風險觀念
This morning we were lecturing the entire country on moral hazard.

996
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,867
美國國際集團有抵押品 他們有資產
AIG has collateral. They have assets.

997
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,412
雷曼兄弟沒有 我們不能借錢給一個無底洞
Lehman didn't. We couldn't lend into a hole.

998
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,955
兩者情況不同
It's not the same story.

999
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,832
沒人會在乎這些
Nobody's gonna care.

1000
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,044
這又是一樁沒有監管的注資行為
It's another bailout with no legislation.

1001
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,004
國會會大做文章 整個國家也會抓狂的
The Hill's gonna go crazy. The country's gonna go crazy.

1002
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,841
我們早上乘坐的班機是從美國國際集團租賃的
The plane that we flew in on this morning, leased from AIG.

1003
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,093
在市中心的建設 是美國國際集團承接的
Construction downtown, AIG.

1004
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:35,099
壽險 8100萬份保單 賬面價值1.9兆億元
Life insurance, 81 million policies with a face value of 1.9 trillion,

1005
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,894
上百億的教師退休金 美國國際集團的資產到處都是
billions of dollars in teachers' pensions, it's everywhere.

1006
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,521
你想要大而不倒? 就是這個了
You want too big to fail? Here it is.

1007
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,442
你有更好的主意嗎? 我可是聽著呢
You got a better idea? The suggestion box is wide open.

1008
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,951
我也知道現在說這個不太恰當
I hate to do this right now,

1009
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,329
但我得明天一大早得召開新聞發佈會
but I'm gonna have to have a press call first thing,

1010
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,331
但我真不知道該對他們說什麼
and I really don't know what I'm gonna tell them.

1011
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:03,836
告訴他們雷曼拖累了美國國際集團 同時兌現債務抵押債券 
Tell them Lehman exacerbated AIG. The simultaneous payouts of CDOs

1012
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,380
和信用違約掉期幾乎要壓垮...
and credit default swaps put catastrophic pressure on...

1013
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,049
再往前追述一點
Go back further.

1014
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,136
全球的投資的資金池...
The global pool of investment capital...

1015
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,932
她得用英文來發佈 從房地產業主開始說起
She has to do this in English. Start with the homeowners.

1016
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,684
好吧 好吧 你該這麼解釋
Okay, okay, here's how you explain it.

1017
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:25,900
華爾街開始將房產抵押貸款捆綁 形成住房抵押貸款證券
Wall Street started bundling home loans together, mortgage-backed securities,

1018
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,403
再分成一份一份賣給投資者
and selling slices of those bundles to investors.

1019
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,447
他們借此謀取暴利
And they were making big money,

1020
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,117
於是他們就開始催促放貸者 說道
so they started pushing the lenders, saying,

1021
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,785
"快點 我們需要更多的貸款"
"Come on, we need more loans."

1022
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,413
放貸者已經將把錢放給信用等級高的借款人
The lenders had already given loans to borrowers with good credit,

1023
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,375
於是他們退而求其次 降低標準
so they go bottom-feeding. They lower their criteria.

1024
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:47,171
以前你需要有620積分的信用評分 加上20%的首付
Before, you needed a credit score of 620 and a down payment of 20%.

1025
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,966
現在 500就可以了 零首付
Now, they'll settle for 500, no money down.

1026
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,051
至於買方 走在大街上的普通人
And the buyer, the regular guy on the street,

1027
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,928
以為專家們知道他們在幹什麼
assumes that the experts know what they're doing.

1028
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,597
他自言自語道 "如果銀行願意借我錢
He's saying to himself, "If the bank's willing to loan me money,

1029
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,432
"那我肯定還得起"
"I must be able to afford it."

1030
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,560
所以他開始實現自己的美國夢
So he reaches for the American dream.

1031
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,978
他買下了房子
He buys that house.

1032
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,481
銀行知道債券掛鉤垃圾貸款是非常危險的
The banks knew securities based on shitbag mortgages were risky.

1033
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,816
你得強調 "垃圾"這個詞
You'll work on "shitbag."

1034
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,403
為了控制負面影響 銀行會開始購買一種保險
So to control their downside, the banks started buying a kind of insurance.

1035
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,447
如果抵押貸款違約 保險公司買單
If mortgages default, insurance company pays,

1036
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,241
違約掉期
default swap.

1037
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,537
銀行為他們的潛在損失投保 使報表中不會出現風險
The banks insure their potential losses to move the risk off their books

1038
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,622
這樣他們可以進行更多的投資 賺更多的錢
so they can invest more, make more money.

1039
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,833
如果很多公司投保
And while a lot of companies insured this stuff,

1040
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,378
那麼就有一家公司蠢得要承擔難以置信的風險
one was dumb enough to take on an almost unbelievable amount of risk.

1041
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,797
- 美國國際集團  - 你要強調"蠢"
- AIG.  - And you'll work on "dumb."

1042
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,049
那如果他們問我為什麼他們會這麼做呢?
And when they ask me why they did that?

1043
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,385
- 手續費  - 上億的手續費
- Fees.  - Hundreds of millions in fees.

1044
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,013
美國國際集團估計房地產市場會繼續走高
AIG figured the housing market would just keep going up,

1045
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,431
可是意外發生了
but then the unexpected happens.

1046
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,683
房價下跌
Housing prices go down.

1047
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,560
這窮光蛋買了他的夢想之屋
The poor bastard who bought his dream house,

1048
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,729
這惱人的抵押貸款利率不停上升
the teaser rate on his mortgage runs out.

1049
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,190
他的還款額上升 他違約了
His payments go up. He defaults.

1050
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:51,527
次級抵押證券出了問題 美國國際集團必須償還掉期
Mortgage-backed securities tank. AIG has to pay off the swaps,

1051
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:55,281
全球 同一時間 所有的保單違約了
all of them, all over the world, at the same time.

1052
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,326
美國國際集團付不起了 入不敷出
AIG can't pay. AIG goes under.

1053
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:03,581
每一家他們承保的銀行都在同一天要求兌現保費
Every bank they insure books massive losses on the same day.

1054
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,751
他們都入不敷出了
And then they all go under.

1055
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,669
都倒閉了
It all comes down.

1056
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,506
整個金融系統?
The whole financial system?

1057
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:22,433
那我該怎麼說 如果他們問我為什麼這件事情沒有得到妥善監管?
And what do I say when they ask me why it wasn't regulated?

1058
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,061
沒人想去監管
No one wanted to.

1059
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,315
經濟形勢表現得太好了
We were making too much money.

1060
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:43,996
你得強調 "經濟形勢表現得太好了"
You'll work on "We were making too much money."

1061
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,345
喂 Hank 呃...
Hey, Hank. Um...

1062
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,850
這些很溫和 不過很有效
These are really mild, but they work.

1063
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,856
我知道你信基督教科學派 不吃藥(該派認為物質是虛幻的 疾病只能靠調整精神來治療)
I know the whole Christian Scientist thing, that you don't take medicine.

1064
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,443
不過你需要睡眠
But you need to sleep.

1065
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:21,867
- Jim...  - Hank 不僅僅是為了你自己 好嗎?
- Jim...  - Hank, not just for your own sake. Okay?

1066
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,833
你看起來不太好
You don't look so good.

1067
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:38,384
就在幾分鐘前 CNN得到確切消息 美聯儲正在協調
Just minutes ago, CNN has confirmed that the Federal Reserve is negotiating

1068
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,970
拯救保險巨頭美國國際集團
to rescue insurance giant AIG.

1069
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:45,349
協調計劃包括一份850億美金的臨時貸款
The negotiations could include an $85 billion temporary loan

1070
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,643
用以延緩美國國際集團面臨的倒閉
to stave off AIG's imminent collapse.

1071
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,145
朋友們 這可是個爆炸新聞
This is a blockbuster, folks.

1072
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,522
差不多昨天的這時候 很多在華爾街的人
About this time last night, many on Wall Street

1073
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,774
擔心今天會是一團亂
were fearing total disaster today.

1074
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,570
於是 聯邦政府又一次注資拯救另一家華爾街巨頭
So, another federal bailout of another Wall Street giant.

1075
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,448
還有 我們提到的 是一起重大的 重大的金融消息
Again, as we mentioned, big, big financial news.

1076
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,868
並且這條消息影響到每一個買過401k養老保險計劃的人
And this affects almost everyone out there who has a 401k.

1077
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:08,331
這條消息在股市收市的三個半小時後發佈出來...
The news comes about three and a half hours after the stock exchange closed on...

1078
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,082
哦上帝啊
Motherfucker.

1079
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:15,296
我們現在馬上把時間交給Ali Velshi來看看這次危機的底線在哪 Ali
We wanna go straight right now to Ali Velshi to kind of give us a bottom line on this, Ali.

1080
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,547
然後我們來看看這次危機是不是會持續下去...
And then we're gonna get a lot more in depth...

1081
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,966
美國國際集團得到了收於850億的救援...
AIG securing an 85...

1082
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,968
信貸市場的資金流動依舊很少
The credit markets are still frozen solid.

1083
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:23,471
如果我們繼續想這些公司注資
We keep dumping money into these companies

1084
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,765
那麼市場會慢慢穩定下來
so the markets will stabilize,

1085
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,641
除此之外沒別的辦法了
and nothing helps.

1086
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,810
我們不能一直這樣
We can't keep doing this.

1087
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:34,940
我們無條件的救了貝爾斯登 又無條件的救了美國國際集團
We rescued Bear with no legislation, AIG with no legislation.

1088
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,778
人們會認為房利美和房地美在誘售
People think Fannie and Freddie was a bait-and-switch.

1089
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:42,365
你以為我願意這樣做嗎 但是他們的狀況都很特殊
I don't like it any more than you do, but they were exceptional situations.

1090
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,451
現在的情況要求
This situation demands an endgame

1091
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,913
那些公司不能再依靠聯邦政府的協助
that does not rely on unilateral action from the Fed.

1092
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,331
這才是民主
This is a democracy.

1093
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,958
我們不能垂簾聽政在幕後操縱
We cannot be men behind the curtain pulling the strings.

1094
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,671
我們需要找到一個完善的解決方法來修復整個金融體系
We need some kind of an overall solution that heals the entire system.

1095
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,715
並且是通過合法的方式進行
And it has to be legitimate.

1096
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,342
我們一再推遲了向國會匯報這些事情
We've been putting off going to Congress.

1097
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,094
離大選只有兩個月了
It's two months before an election.

1098
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:08,891
選民們不可能投票給一個使得整個銀行系統崩潰的政府
They can't vote yes to a massive bailout of the entire banking system.

1099
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,434
- 選民們不可能再選擇我們  - Hank...
- They'd never get reelected.  - Hank...

1100
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:14,438
我們去國會說清楚我們已經對現在的局勢
We go to Congress, publically state we don't have the firepower

1101
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,567
無能為力了 但是他們說不行
to control this anymore, and then they say no,

1102
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:22,988
這種場景真是一場噩夢
that is really the nightmare scenario.

1103
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:26,826
噩夢場景已經出現了 我的朋友
The nightmare scenario's already here, my friend.

1104
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,245
而且我們深陷其中
We're in it.

1105
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,057
P你還好嗎
P.

1106
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,738
你不能把所有事情都自己扛下來
You can't put this all on your own shoulders.

1107
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,156
我們已經別無選擇了
We're running out of options.

1108
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,994
那麼你就繼續嘗試別的方法 這才是你該做的
Then you just keep trying. That's what you do.

1109
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,079
最後肯定會有辦法解決的
Eventually something's gonna work.

1110
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,916
我都不知道 是不是這樣的了
I'm not sure that that is true anymore.

1111
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:01,587
但是這世界上沒有一家銀行是有足夠的錢去應對
There's not a bank in the world that has enough money in its vault

1112
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,758
儲戶的提款要求 銀行都是建立在信用基礎上的
to pay its depositors. It's all built on trust.

1113
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:11,430
而且 Wendy 我們已經岌岌可危了
And, Wendy, we are so very close.

1114
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,395
摩根斯坦利 高盛已經在懸崖邊緣
Morgan Stanley, Goldman are an inch away.

1115
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,026
如果別的銀行不再信任他們 如果他們停止了銀行間的拆借
If the other banks stop trusting them, if they pull back on interbank lending,

1116
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,445
他們會立刻破產
it's over in a matter of hours.

1117
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,200
而且一旦破產開始了就不會停下來 會有連鎖反應
And from there it goes too fast to stop, a run,

1118
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:36,247
而且到時候破產的就不僅僅是銀行了 整個金融系統都會崩塌
and not just on one bank, I mean on the whole system.

1119
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:40,376
然後大眾就會問 "我的錢安全嗎?" 
And average people wondering, "Is my money safe?"

1120
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,963
他們開始提現
They start pulling their cash.

1121
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:50,636
再然後 銀行門口就會排起長隊 ATM機就會被擠爆
And after that, lines outside the banks, smashed ATMs.

1122
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,472
再過幾個星期
A couple of weeks,

1123
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,351
銀行奡N沒有錢可以提了
there's no milk in the store.

1124
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,520
這已經是本周第二次
For the second time this week,

1125
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,564
華爾街出現了大量的拋售
there was a massive sell-off on Wall Street,

1126
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,025
道瓊斯工業指數暴跌超過450點
the Dow Jones Industrial's freefalling some 450 points

1127
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,321
因為消息稱納稅人的資金用來救援美國國際集團保險公司
on news of a taxpayer-funded bailout of the AIG insurance company.

1128
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,490
五大投行中三家已經倒閉了
Three of the five investment banks are gone.

1129
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,909
全國最大的抵押貸款機構也倒閉了
The country's biggest mortgage lender is gone.

1130
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,704
房利美 房地美也已經收歸國有
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, brought under government control.

1131
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,499
金融系統現在算是保住了 但是能維持多久?
The financial system is holding right now, but for how long?

1132
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,960
全部人力 全部資源都被完全利用
All the king's horses and all the king's men

1133
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,087
一定保持金融體系的順利運行
are being brought to bear to keep this thing together.

1134
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,533
- 嗨 Tim  - 我在華爾街 Hank
- Hi, Tim.  - I'm on the Street, Hank,

1135
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,286
人們正要趕著去上班
and people are just going about their business.

1136
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:01,081
他們完全不知道這堛漱@切都將化為烏有
They have no idea the whole thing is about to fall down.

1137
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,628
我們不得不向國會報告了 我們已經別無選擇
We're gonna have to go to Congress. We don't have a choice anymore.

1138
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,837
好吧
Okay.

1139
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,464
你覺得還要多久他們會做出決定?
How fast do you think you can get them to move?

1140
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,716
我想至少也要幾天
It's gonna be at least a couple days.

1141
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,178
高盛和摩根斯坦利已經快不行了 
Goldman and Morgan Stanley are going down now.

1142
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:15,638
我們今天必須做點什麼
We gotta do something today.

1143
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,847
比如說?
Like what?

1144
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,475
市場不像投行一樣 對嗎?
The market doesn't like investment banks, right?

1145
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,769
所有的商業模型都拿那些錢束手無策 
The money's saying "fuck you" to the whole business model.

1146
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:22,895
是的
Yeah.

1147
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,065
是的 那讓他們變成商業銀行
Yeah, so merge them with commercial banks,

1148
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,651
把投行變成普通的由聯邦政府監管的商業銀行
turn them into regular banks regulated by the Fed.

1149
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,152
他們就能動用儲戶的錢了
They can use depositors' cash.

1150
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,862
這樣他們就能通過貼現窗口
It will give them access to the discount window.

1151
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,990
向政府以較低的利率借款
It's cheap government cash.

1152
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,826
- 你想讓他們變得更大嗎?  - 這也是沒辦法的辦法 Hank
- You wanna make them bigger?  - It's a trade-off, Hank.

1153
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,954
好處是他們可以逐漸穩定下來
The upside is it'll stabilize them.

1154
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,583
壞處是
The downside is,

1155
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,337
對的 他們會變得出奇的龐大
yeah, they'll be really fucking big.

1156
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,005
去做吧 Tim
Do it, Tim.

1157
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,259
快去做
Godspeed.

1158
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,196
嗯 給我接Blankfein
Uh, get me Blankfein.

1159
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,117
Lloyd 打電話給Vikram Pandit 告訴他你想合併
Lloyd, call Vikram Pandit, talk to him about a merger.

1160
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,244
Tim 我們正在盡全力想辦法
Tim, we're looking at all our options.

1161
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,872
你已經走投無路了 Lloyd 你的銀行只能這樣做
You don't have options, Lloyd. There's a run on your bank.

1162
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,582
你需要錢 花旗又有存款
You need money. Citi has deposits.

1163
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,335
花旗現在一團糟 你這埵陰齯ㄞ 打電話給Pandit
Citi's a mess, you're organized. Call Pandit.

1164
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:38,804
怎麼了
Yeah.

1165
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,848
我希望你可以考慮考慮和摩根斯坦利合併
I want you to look at merging with Morgan Stanley.

1166
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,058
什麼 你在開玩笑吧? 我剛剛買了貝爾斯登
What, are you kidding me? I just bought Bear.

1167
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,518
我們仍然在想辦法讓它開始好轉
We're still trying to make that work.

1168
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,395
你沒有買貝爾斯登 它幾乎算是送你的
You didn't buy Bear. You got Bear as a Christmas present.

1169
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,649
市場現在一團糟 Jamie 跟John Mack聊聊
The market's a fucking disaster, Jamie. Talk to John Mack.

1170
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,610
嘿 Geithner說我們可以談談合併的事情
Hey, Geithner says we should talk about a merger.

1171
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,529
- 你想這樣做嗎?  - 當然不想
- You wanna do a deal?  - No.

1172
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,698
那他為什麼要讓我打給你?
Then why the fuck did he tell me to call you?

1173
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,867
我得到命令去幫助你們公司
I'm under orders to try and help you.

1174
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,078
你是個王子 Jamie 真的是王子
You're a prince, Jamie. A real prince.

1175
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,503
很顯然 有人認為把我們的公司進行合併是一個不錯的方法
Apparently, some people seem to think combining our firms would be a good idea.

1176
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,381
我想說我對於這通電話受寵若驚
I want you to know I'm flattered by this call.

1177
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,677
Vikram 我沒有奉承你的意思 相信我
Vikram, I'm not trying to flatter you, believe me.

1178
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,262
Geithener打電話來了
Geithner's calling.

1179
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,931
一攤子破事
Here comes goddamn eHarmony.

1180
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,975
嘿 猜猜看 Jamie一點都不感興趣
Hey, guess what. Jamie's not interested.

1181
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,271
試試Wachovia
Do Wachovia.

1182
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,315
他們是閉著眼睛進行抵押貸款買賣的
They were writing mortgages with their eyes closed.

1183
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,442
Tim 那只是一塊垃圾三明治 忘了他吧
Tim, it's a shit sandwich. Forget it.

1184
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,283
我在四小時之內是趕不到你那邊的
I haven't been able to reach you for four hours.

1185
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,787
這在今天這樣的日子堛眯w是做不到的
That is totally fucking unacceptable on a day like today.

1186
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,081
我不得不讓我的公司去評估高盛合併事宜
I had to run my team through the Goldman proposal.

1187
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,458
沒用的
It's not gonna work.

1188
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,878
你已經聯繫好高盛了 卻沒給我說一聲?
You passed on Goldman without even talking to me?

1189
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,881
我不需要在我的資產負債表上多出1兆億的美元
I don't need another trillion dollars on my balance sheet.

1190
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,722
下次我打給你的時候 記得接電話
Next time I call, pick up.

1191
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,850
去死吧
Fucker.

1192
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,479
問題就在於那些不良資產 我們把他們買過來就好了
The problem is the toxic assets. Let's just buy them.

1193
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,397
哦 可以稱為現金換垃圾
Ooh. We'll call it Cash for Trash.

1194
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,067
當市場穩定下來了 我們再把這些垃圾傾銷掉
When the market stabilizes, we'll unload them.

1195
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,194
希望是這樣 財政部能夠把這些錢討回來
Hopefully, Treasury will get its money back.

1196
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,738
- 這是破杯計劃的一部分嗎?  - 基本上是
- Is that in the Break the Glass plan?  - Basically.

1197
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,741
我的這份是不是少了幾頁 有誰能告訴我餘下的幾頁...
My copy's missing some pages. Could someone else show me the rest of...

1198
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,493
這個是簡潔版
It's succinct.

1199
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,663
我們在國會只有一次機會
We've got one shot with Congress.

1200
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,291
你覺得國會會根據這三頁紙就簽署一份法案嗎?
You want them to write a piece of legislation based on three pages?

1201
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,417
聽著 朋友們
Look, guys,

1202
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,128
購買不良資產肯定是一個噩夢
buying toxic assets is gonna be a nightmare.

1203
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,505
沒人知道這些東西到底值幾個子
Nobody knows what the stuff's worth.

1204
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,341
也許這些不良資產永遠都理不清 銀行馬上就要倒閉了
It'll take forever to untangle. These banks are going down now.

1205
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,509
那我們能怎麼做?
So what do we do?

1206
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,929
你想要讓信用市場繼續運作 是嗎? 你希望銀行能夠繼續放貸?
You wanna unfreeze credit, right? You want the banks to lend people money?

1207
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,682
- 這就是我們想要看到的  - 那就給他們錢讓他們放貸
- That's the goal.  - So give them money to lend.

1208
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,144
資產注入?
Capital injections?

1209
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,271
Dan 擺脫別說傻話
Dan, come on.

1210
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,856
我不相信你竟然說出了那個帶 "N" 的字眼
I can't believe you're pulling out the "N" word.

1211
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,148
我沒有說要將銀行國有化
I'm not saying nationalize the banks.

1212
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,569
我說的是把有問題的銀行隔離開 然後進行注資
I'm saying isolate the ones that are really in trouble and make an investment.

1213
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,864
- 這做法不是美國人做的  - 當然也不是共和黨人做的
- It's un-American.  - It's sure un-Republican.

1214
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:05,200
你讓政府變成了一個股東
You'd make the government a stockholder.

1215
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,996
什麼 我們是不是需要告訴他們怎麼去經營 買哪些賣哪些?
What, do we tell them how to manage themselves, what to buy and sell?

1216
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,957
像經營郵局一樣經營他們? 是那樣就太好了
Run them like the post office? 'Cause that works like a dream.

1217
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,961
這只是暫時措施 我們可以是沒有投票權的股東
We make it temporary. We make ourselves non-voting stockholders.

1218
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,381
你不能捧著一疊疊的鈔票送到銀行
You can't just hand the banks massive piles of cash.

1219
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,049
沒人會去理會這些的
Nobody's gonna go for it.

1220
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,012
對於共和黨來說這是資產國有化 對於民主黨來說這就是救助
To the Republicans it's nationalization. To the Democrats it's a bailout.

1221
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,680
而且銀行會很生氣的
And the banks are gonna go ballistic.

1222
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:31,810
抱歉 Dan 這是不可能的 很欣賞你的創造性思維
Sorry, Dan, not gonna happen. Kudos for out-of-the-box thinking.

1223
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,314
Neel 如果我們實行你的計劃購買那些資產
Neel, if we go with your plan to buy the assets,

1224
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,565
我們會花多少錢?
how much is it gonna cost?

1225
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,025
那是不可能的
It won't work.

1226
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,612
聽著 計劃只有3頁長 而且很空洞
Look, the plan is three pages long, totally vague.

1227
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:46,074
如果購買資產沒有用的話 我們會用你的國有化計劃 好嗎?
If buying the assets doesn't work, we'll nationalize the banks for you, okay?

1228
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:50,120
- 要多少錢?  - 保守估計 需要一萬億
- How much? - To be safe, maybe a trillion.

1229
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,373
國會是不會批准一萬億的法案的 永遠不會
The Congress will never do a trillion, never.

1230
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,044
有11萬億美元的住房抵押債券
There's $11 trillion in residential mortgages.

1231
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:02,424
還有三萬億的商業債券 一共是十四萬億 對嗎?
There's three trillion in commercial mortgages. That's 14 trillion, right?

1232
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,552
別忘了5%的違約率
You gotta figure about 5% default rate.

1233
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,139
14萬億的5%是
5 % of 14 trillion is

1234
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,225
七千萬美元
$700 billion.

1235
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,773
這也比一萬億要好
It's better than a trillion.

1236
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,738
讓法案通過的唯一方法只能是嚇得他們屁滾尿流
The only way to get this done is to just scare them shitless.

1237
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,033
這很簡單 我自己都嚇傻了
That should be easy. I'm scared shitless myself.

1238
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,033
2008年9月18日 星期四 雷曼兄弟破產後三天

1239
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:43,382
Barney Frank(馬薩諸塞州代表) 眾議院金融管理委員會主席

1240
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,382
問題資產剝離計劃?
Troubled Asset Relief Program?

1241
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:44,883
我們稱他為TARP 
TARP, we're calling it.

1242
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:48,261
這只是你們的草案?
This is your draft of the bill?

1243
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,722
這只是一個修訂本 肯定的
Subject to revision, certainly.

1244
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:56,019
Chris Dodd(康乃迪克州代表) 參議院銀行委員會主席

1245
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,019
我只拿到了三頁紙 我是不是漏掉了什麼?
I've only got three pages here. Am I missing something?

1246
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,438
沒有
No.

1247
01:11:58,532 --> 01:12:02,609
Richard Shelby(阿拉巴馬州代表) 參議院銀行委員會副主席

1248
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,609
你在著急尋找的只是一張大額的空白支票
You're just looking for a big blank check in a hurry.

1249
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,321
這都是為了銀行 你也不想
It's all for the banks. You don't want a penny

1250
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,615
讓布什總統失去他的總統位置
for the average Joe that's about to lose his house?

1251
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,784
整件事完全沒有任何監管
There's not a scrap of oversight built into this,

1252
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,620
錢沒有給銀行 也沒有給你 只是為了解決這個情況
not for the banks or for you, for that matter.

1253
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:18,458
你希望我們簡簡單單的拿出7000萬來相信你?
You want us to simply hand over $700 billion and trust you?

1254
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,752
Nancy Pelosi(加利福尼亞州代表) 眾議院發言人

1255
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,752
你怎麼可能沒有想到我們的反應?
How is it possible you didn't see this coming?

1256
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,463
如果你們想讓我再說一遍的話 我沒有問題
If you wanna rewind the tape, we can do that.

1257
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,800
但是現在 最重要的是我們沒時間了
But right now, the one thing we don't have is time.

1258
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,511
我們今晚需要一個決議來穩定市場
We need an announcement tonight to calm the market.

1259
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,221
我們需要法案在下周通過
We need legislation next week.

1260
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:38,770
我學術研究的內容只有一個
I spent my entire academic career

1261
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,232
就是大蕭條
studying the Great Depression.

1262
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,947
大蕭條的起因是因為股票市場的崩盤
The Depression may have started because of a stock market crash,

1263
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:53,702
但是打擊到實體經濟的是信用體系的瓦解
but what hit the general economy was a disruption of credit,

1264
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,707
普通群眾無法借錢去做任何事 沒法賣房子
average citizens unable to borrow money to do anything, to buy a home,

1265
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,626
沒法做生意 沒法進貨
start a business, stock their shelves.

1266
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,339
信用是建立現在經濟的基礎
Credit has the ability to build a modern economy,

1267
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:11,053
但是信用缺乏也可以毀掉經濟 迅雷不及掩耳的毀滅
but lack of credit has the power to destroy it, swiftly and absolutely.

1268
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:19,061
如果我們不能做出明確的決斷 我們將會重演上世紀30年代的大蕭條
If we do not act boldly and immediately, we will replay the Depression of the 1930s,

1269
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:23,982
只是這次情況會更糟 更糟
only this time it will be far, far worse.

1270
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,907
如果我們現在不做這些 我們的經濟在週一就完了
We don't do this now, we won't have an economy on Monday.

1271
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,666
Geithner的電話
Geithner.

1272
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,507
我們把議案交到國會了
We took the proposal down to Congress.

1273
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,758
他們會通過嗎?
Are they gonna go for it?

1274
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,551
他們不喜歡那麼短的議案
They didn't like the fact that it was short.

1275
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,303
我想簡單明瞭可以加分的
I thought concise was a plus.

1276
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,765
他們覺得這樣太輕薄或者太傲慢或者別的什麼
They thought it was flimsy or arrogant or something.

1277
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,684
我不知道他們怎麼想 但是他們不會通過的
I don't know what they think. They couldn't get past it.

1278
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,104
市場已經無法控制了 他們否決這份議案
The market's in a death spiral. They're gonna sink the bill

1279
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,939
因為這份議案太短了?
because the proposal is too fucking short?

1280
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,567
他們正在研究 他們會把他弄得長一點
They're working on it. They're gonna make it longer,

1281
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,528
加入一些其他東西
among other things.

1282
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,949
好吧 告訴我你已經有進展了
Look, just tell me you got something.

1283
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,955
不 不 我一點進展也沒有
No. No, we're nowhere.

1284
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,540
還有誰可以幫助摩根斯坦利?
Who's left for Morgan Stanley?

1285
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,794
中國投資有限公司
China Investment Corporation.

1286
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,047
嗯 或者是三菱集團
Uh, maybe Mitsubishi.

1287
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,716
不 日本人是不會做這筆生意的
No, the Japanese will never do this deal.

1288
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,301
那高盛有什麼進展?
How about Goldman?

1289
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,138
高盛找到了聯銀行 但是他們被拒絕了
Goldman's looking at Wachovia, but they're so fucked,

1290
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,640
就連John Mack都不屑一顧
even John Mack turned up his nose.

1291
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,936
你必須讓議案通過
You gotta get that bill passed.

1292
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,566
- 我在努力了  - 那就再努力一點 拜託了
- I'm pushing.  - Well, push harder. Please.

1293
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,280
這不會有用的 Hank
This isn't working, Hank.

1294
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,254
Hank 怎麼了?
Hank?

1295
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,506
能讓我單獨待一會兒嗎?
Could you excuse me a moment?

1296
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,866
2008年9月21日 雷曼兄弟破產後第六天

1297
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,866
哦 我的上帝呀 高先生 高先生
Oh, my God. Gao, Gao.

1298
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,411
對於這件事我很抱歉 但是我們無能為力
I am so sorry about this. There's nothing we can do.

1299
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:45,332
這堿O紐約 你知道 我們很高興我們還能在揚基體育館買一杯啤酒
It's New York, you know. We're lucky we can still buy a beer at Yankee Stadium.

1300
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:48,168
別擔心 反正我遲早都會退出的
Don't worry about it. I should quit anyway.

1301
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,962
當你準備好了 我們就進去
When you're ready, we'll be inside.

1302
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,051
有什麼進展嗎?
Is there any movement there?

1303
01:15:56,135 --> 01:16:00,639
他們給了一個低的離譜的價格 我假裝我沒聽見
They made an extremely low opening offer. I pretended I didn't hear it.

1304
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,976
如果摩根斯坦利的問題沒有解決 那市場就不能在週一開市
The markets can't open Monday without a resolution of Morgan Stanley.

1305
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,479
我們真的很需要你做一個決定
We really need you to do a deal.

1306
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,898
- 你打電話給Jamie  - 我打過Jamie了
- You need to call Jamie.  - I called Jamie.

1307
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,150
他對我們沒興趣 難度太大了
He doesn't want us. There's too much overlap.

1308
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,568
我們已經跟他說過了 他會同意的
We've spoken to him. He'll do it.

1309
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,529
為了什麼 為了美元? 我為什麼要這麼做?
For what, a dollar? Why would I do that?

1310
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,658
我這媮晹酗之諰M三菱集團求著要我呢
I got China Investment and Mitsubishi kicking my tires.

1311
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:23,203
我知道這些傢伙 他們不可能及時作出決定的
I know those guys. They're not gonna close a deal in time.

1312
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,414
我們希望你打電話給Jamie
We want you to call Jamie.

1313
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,625
讓我問你個問題
Let me ask you a question.

1314
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:33,505
因為美國國際集團 雷曼和貝爾斯登的事情 已經有3萬5千人失業了
35,000 jobs just disappeared in this city between AIG, Lehman and Bear.

1315
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:38,176
如果我們跟Jamie達成協議 他會裁掉2萬名摩根斯坦利員工
We make a deal with Jamie, he'll fire 20,000 Morgan Stanley employees.

1316
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,178
你覺得這是一個好辦法嗎?
You think that's good public policy?

1317
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,682
John 我們關注的是整個金融體系的安全
John, we are looking at the whole system here.

1318
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,350
中國人走了
The Chinese are leaving.

1319
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,185
高先生發現我們還在與三菱集團談判
Gao found out we're also talking to Mitsubishi.

1320
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,937
我要走了
I gotta go.

1321
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,607
好的 把黑柳找來 再找一個日語翻譯
All right, get me Kuroyanagi and a Japanese translator.

1322
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,567
今晚 我們跟三菱要簽好約
We're closing with Mitsubishi tonight.

1323
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:55,986
Tim Geithner又打電話來了
Tim Geithner's calling again.

1324
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,738
你就當沒聽見
Cover your ears.

1325
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:02,534
你告訴T?im Geithner別來煩我了 我在想辦法拯救我的公司
You tell Tim Geithner to fucking blow me. I'm trying to save my company.

1326
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:11,042
2008年9月22日 雷曼兄弟破產後7天

1327
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,206
我要和他見面 但是確保約在在午飯之後
Put him on the schedule, but make sure it's after lunch,

1328
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,042
因為之前我還要與Madeline碰頭 而且...
because that way I can fit Madeline in beforehand. And...

1329
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,879
摩根剛才與三菱集團達成交易了
Morgan just made a deal with Mitsubishi.

1330
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,842
所以我們是唯一一家沒有援助的銀行了
So we're the only bank with our dick still in the wind.

1331
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,720
我再給巴菲特打個電話
I'm calling Buffett again.

1332
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:28,810
爺爺 他們一直在找你 萬一是很重要的事怎麼辦?
Grandpa, they keep calling. What if it's important?

1333
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,104
他們總覺得自己很重要
They always think it's important.

1334
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,402
好吧 我會快點解決
All right, I'll make it fast.

1335
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,488
巴菲特 感謝你回復我 你最近怎麼樣?
Warren, thanks for calling back. How are you?

1336
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:44,242
挺好 Lloyd 這次我能幫你做什麼?
Just fine, Lloyd. What can I do for you today?

1337
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,911
我想跟你談談關於入股高盛的事情
I'd like to talk to you about taking a stake in Goldman Sachs.

1338
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,581
什麼價位? 聽上去很貴
What do you have in mind? Sounds expensive.

1339
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,875
也許不貴
Maybe not.

1340
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,713
你最好給我的是好消息
You better have good news,

1341
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:00,592
也許搞定TRAP之前 我就掛了
because I might be dead before we finish haggling over TARP.

1342
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,137
巴菲特準備給高盛注資五十億
Buffett's throwing five billion into Goldman.

1343
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,558
我們脫離險境
We're off the ledge.

1344
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,227
暫時而已
For the moment.

1345
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,855
十月的驚喜來的早了點
The October surprise arrived a little early,

1346
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,608
白宮的總統競爭出現了轉機
with a game-changing jolt to the White House race.

1347
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:20,987
是該叫做出奇制勝還是孤注一擲
Call it a master stroke or a desperate Hail Mary pass,

1348
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:24,157
麥凱恩宣佈他將暫停競選
McCain announced he would suspend his campaign

1349
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:27,369
並要求推遲星期五的辯論
and asked for this Friday's debate to be postponed

1350
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,330
以便他能回到華盛頓集中精力應對金融危機
so he can return to Washington to focus on the economic crisis.

1351
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:36,378
現在是我們團結一致的時機 再次證明華盛頓有能力
Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again

1352
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,464
領導國家
capable of leading this country.

1353
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,300
感謝上帝 他回來了
Thank God he came back.

1354
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,596
就像大地英豪堛慣aniel Day-Lewis(演員)
Like Daniel Day-Lewis in Last of the Mohicans,

1355
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,057
他會拯救我們的!
he will find us!

1356
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,311
- 他們要搞砸了  - 發生了什麼?
- They're blowing it up.  - What happened?

1357
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:56,481
麥凱恩想趁機介入 挽救局面 但壓根不知道怎麼下手
McCain wanted to swoop in and save the day, but doesn't have any idea how to do it.

1358
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,693
這可是我們認真商量好幾天 寫了100頁的法案
It's a 100-page piece of legislation we've been carefully negotiating for days.

1359
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,904
他以為我們就坐著這玩扔紙團?
What, did he think they were gonna sit around and spitball?

1360
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,823
是的 當麥凱恩到這
Yeah, when McCain got here

1361
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:08,535
並且發現這事情已經基本解決完了 他就憤怒了
and found out that the deal was basically done, he went apeshit.

1362
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,913
共和黨沒跟上進度 他們想重新來一遍
The Republicans fell in behind their guy. They wanna start all over again.

1363
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,915
民主黨發飆 共和黨想插進來
Democrats flipped out. Republicans dug in.

1364
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,251
- 亂七八糟  - 亂七八糟
- Clusterfuck.  - Clusterfuck.

1365
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,587
- Hank在哪? - 還在跟麥凱恩說話
- Where's Hank?  - Still talking to McCain.

1366
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,340
如果你或者任何其他人做了任何事
If you or anyone else does anything

1367
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:26,428
導致新一輪的大蕭條 可別賴在我身上
that causes the next depression, it is not gonna be on me.

1368
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,762
我嘴巴很不嚴的 參議員
I have a big mouth, Senator,

1369
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,389
- 口風很鬆  - 等等
- a very big mouth. - Hold on...

1370
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:34,352
他不是在威脅共和黨總統候選人吧?
He's not threatening the Republican presidential nominee, is he?

1371
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,439
- 必須採取一些行動  - 不 不 抱歉 離開一下
- Something's gotta be done.  - No, no. Excuse me, please.

1372
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,857
民主黨的人在哪?
Where are the Democrats?

1373
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,692
他們就在走廊那頭
They're right down this way.

1374
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,193
- Nancy在嗎?  - 是的 她在
- Is Nancy there?  - Yes. Yes, she is.

1375
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,403
謝了
Thank you.

1376
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,079
Nancy啊...
Nancy...

1377
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:01,087
哦 上帝 Hank 我不知道你還是天主教徒
Oh, Gee, Hank. I didn't know you were Catholic.

1378
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,300
我請求你 別毀了這個提案 這次會議很糟糕
I beg of you, don't blow this up. It was a bad meeting,

1379
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,051
但是我們必須達成共識
but we need to get together on this.

1380
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,970
我們不是想破壞這個提案的一方
We're not the ones trying to blow it up.

1381
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,264
我只是請求你能支持我們
I just ask you to stay with us.

1382
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,185
拜託了
Please.

1383
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:20,231
參議院在今早9點27分開始討論援助議案
The House began debating the rescue bill at 9:27 this morning.

1384
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,942
約在下午1點28分 國會完成最終投票
At about 1:28 p.m., Congress did finally act.

1385
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,445
- 票數非常接近  - 我們馬上來看一下
- This is a squeaker of a vote.  - We are down to it right now.

1386
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,489
似乎贊成票大多來自民主黨
It looks like the Democrats delivered their caucus

1387
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,824
而目前來看共和黨不大贊同此議案
and the Republicans so far have not.

1388
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,118
你認為他們會怎樣修改議案
What do you think they could do to change the bill

1389
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,995
以便贏得共和黨的選票?
to get a few Republican votes over to the other side?

1390
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,538
如果他們吊死那些華爾街的首席執行官
If they hang Wall Street CEOs,

1391
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,207
我想他們也許能得到更多的選票
I think that would get a few more votes.

1392
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,668
我不清楚他們具體能做些什麼
I'm not sure what they could do exactly.

1393
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:44,589
國會的領導很可能認為
It is possible that the leadership of the Congress would conclude

1394
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,342
沒有任何解決方法可以得到多數票的支持
that there's nothing that can get a majority of support

1395
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,428
就看Hank Paulson和當局能怎麼做了
and see what Hank Paulson can do and the administration can do.

1396
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,932
領導們正在協商
Leaders are negotiating right now

1397
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,351
誰會拿自己的職位冒險 這就是我所聽到的
who risks their seat. And that's what I'm hearing.

1398
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,186
如果Pelosi覺得議案不能通過的話
Pelosi wouldn't have brought the bill to the floor

1399
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,354
就不會將這個議案提上議程
if she didn't think it would pass.

1400
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,856
我不知道結果 Charlie 我沒辦法回答
I don't know the answer to that, Charlie. I can't answer.

1401
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,066
我正在讀剛收到的一封郵件
I'm just reading an e-mail that's coming to me.

1402
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,110
我想最後的底線就是他們還得重新籌劃
I think the bottom line is they gotta go back to the drawing board.

1403
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,779
但他們還有時間這麼做嗎?
Do they have the time, though, to do that?

1404
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,364
看看道瓊斯工業平均指數
Look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

1405
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,157
知道嗎 你們將會迎來一個大甩賣
You know you're gonna get a sell-off.

1406
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:14,160
你們 此時此刻 我們只能抓緊救生筏
You guys, at this point, we just gotta hold on to the sides of the kayak

1407
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,286
挺過去 因為
and ride through this because...

1408
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,247
他們沒通過議案
They didn't pass it.

1409
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,291
- 他們沒通過議案  - 這還不夠
- They did not pass it.  - It just wasn't enough.

1410
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,587
議案以九票之差 未能獲得通過 Bill
They're gonna end up being nine votes short, Bill.

1411
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:25,713
再說一次 Steve
Say that again, Steve.

1412
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,715
我認為他們會以九票之差否決這個議案...
I think they're gonna end up being nine votes...

1413
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,592
如果他們得到剩下的六票... 還有五票尚未投出
If they get all six... Five of the remaining votes,

1414
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,304
現在他們差10票 剩下的五票都支持議案
they'll be 10 votes short now, if they get all five remaining.

1415
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,473
票選結果在牆上
The writing is on the wall there.

1416
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:36,849
我們卻失望的坐在地板上
And we're here down on the floor.

1417
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,226
當然 交易員已經站在那
Of course, traders have been standing around.

1418
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,936
看著 我們都三五成群的站著...
Look, we're all here in knots...

1419
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,485
媒體在新聞發佈室等你
The networks are waiting for you in the press room.

1420
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,946
我甚至無法
I can't even...

1421
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,335
我們得重頭再來
We have to go back again.

1422
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,838
他們不能對新議案說不
They don't get to say no on this.

1423
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,465
好的
Okay.

1424
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,633
白宮方面想跟你會面
The White House wants a meeting.

1425
01:22:10,718 --> 01:22:12,635
很好 我們要帶著新策略去
Good. We'll come up with a new strategy.

1426
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,263
白宮必須給國會施壓
The White House has to push harder on the Hill.

1427
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,765
同時 我們要想好如何運作資金
Meanwhile, we need to keep working on what we do with the money.

1428
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,100
讓我們表現的好像議案能通過一樣
Let's act like this is gonna work.

1429
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,935
這種情況下 我們還是談談資本注入吧
In that case, let's talk about cash injections.

1430
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,146
- 又來了  - 我們不能把銀行國有化
- Here we go again.  - We can't nationalize the banks.

1431
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,272
這不是國有化
It's not nationalizing...

1432
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,107
這就是為什麼日本經濟衰退達十年的原因
That's how Japan got itself a decade-long recession.

1433
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,191
那就是我們想要的結果嗎?
Is that where we wanna go?

1434
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:30,820
我們還有什麼別的選擇?
What else do we have?

1435
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,030
現金換垃圾
Cash for Trash.

1436
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,116
購入不良資產依舊是我們的出路
Buying toxic assets is still our go-to move.

1437
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,785
好吧 想辦法簡化方案
All right. Find a way to simplify it.

1438
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:41,456
Dan 做個方案出來
Dan, work something up.

1439
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,251
讓我們看看會是什麼情況 討論一下
For discussion purposes, let's see what it would look like.

1440
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,306
針對那些支持7千億華爾街援助的人而言
For those who supported the $700 billion Wall Street bailout,

1441
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,516
這是一次出乎意料的失敗
it was a surprising and stunning failure

1442
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,894
當眾議院投票否決此議案時
when the House of Representatives voted to reject it.

1443
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,480
對總統布什而言 被共和黨同僚打擊
It's a stinging defeat for President Bush,

1444
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,232
是一次慘痛的失敗
delivered at the hands of his fellow Republicans.

1445
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:13,154
我們提出一個宏大的計劃是因為我們面臨著嚴重的問題
We put forth a plan that was big because we've got a big problem.

1446
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:17,241
現實就是我們處在非常緊急的情況下
The reality is that we're in an urgent situation.

1447
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,495
並且後果會日益惡化
And the consequences will grow worse each day

1448
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:21,996
如果我們不採取行動
if we do not act.

1449
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:31,506
兩天後

1450
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:24,415
- 我明白 我一直都在說  - 起草新議案
- I know. I keep telling...  - Draft of the new bill.

1451
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,626
他們那邊有什麼進展了嗎?
Are they having any luck with it?

1452
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,461
白宮認為先向參議院施加壓力
The White House thinks they got a better shot of pushing it

1453
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,506
效果會更好 希望他們是對的
through the Senate side first. Hopefully they're right.

1454
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,383
他們叫我們收手 交給他們處理
They asked us to back off and let them handle it.

1455
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,511
所以我在試著收手
So I'm trying to back off.

1456
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,435
購買不良資產還是行不通
Buying toxic assets isn't gonna work.

1457
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,730
- 為什麼行不通?  - 太慢了
- Why not?  - It's too slow.

1458
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:48,856
我想我之前就說過
I think I've been saying that.

1459
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,192
好吧 我們知道這會很複雜 但是有多慢
Well, we knew it was complicated, but how slow...

1460
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,277
兩個月 也許更多
Two months, maybe more.

1461
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,947
我們怎麼會不知道...
How is it possible we didn't know how...

1462
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,950
我沒問會要多久 行不?
I didn't ask how long it would take, okay?

1463
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,120
有別的建議嗎?
Can we move on?

1464
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:06,082
那麼也許我們能談談資本注入
So maybe we can talk about capital injections.

1465
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,834
Dan 我們真不能那麼做
Dan, we really can't.

1466
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,128
我想我們沒選擇了
I think we're gonna have to.

1467
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:16,134
就算Neel能加快進程 實際上不大可能
Even if Neel could expedite the process, which seems unlikely,

1468
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,847
體系正在崩潰 銀行現在就需要錢
the system is crumbling. The banks need money now.

1469
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:24,392
如果注資是穩定整個體系最有效的方式
If cash injections are the most efficient way to stabilize them,

1470
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:27,562
那麼我們就不能
then we can't back off

1471
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:32,400
因為我們不願意成為是要將幾家銀行變成國有化的人而退卻
because we're uncomfortable being the men who nationalized a few American banks.

1472
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,818
可以肯定的是 這更快
It's faster, that's for sure.

1473
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,947
這能夠把我們從險境中拉出來 是的 激活整個系統
It will push us back off the precipice, yes, unfreeze the system.

1474
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:44,287
我們給他們一些錢然後他們貸出去
We give them some money and they lend it out.

1475
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,460
議案通過
The motion is adopted.

1476
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:53,087
在否決布什政府的TARP計劃之後
After rejecting the Bush Administration's TARP plan

1477
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,007
僅過了四天 眾議院今日通過了議案
only four days ago, the House passed it today.

1478
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,385
現在最大的問題是 投資者是否能從此消息中得到慰藉
The big question now, whether investors will take comfort in the news.

1479
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,055
市場指數顯示股票仍在大幅下跌
Current indicators show the stock market is continuing its free fall.

1480
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,160
喂?
Hello?

1481
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,537
巴菲特 我是Hank
Warren, it's Hank.

1482
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:29,832
抱歉 這麼晚了
I'm sorry. It's late.

1483
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,376
我吵醒你了嗎?
Am I waking you?

1484
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,961
沒 沒有
No, not at all.

1485
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,089
能幫我出出主意嗎?
Can I pick your brain for a minute?

1486
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,383
當然 什麼情況?
Sure. What's the problem?

1487
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:45,473
怎麼樣讓一家健全的的銀行接受資本注入?
How do you get a healthy bank to accept a capital injection?

1488
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,780
我不得不大老遠從加利福尼亞跑過來
I had to drag my ass all the way here from California.

1489
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,323
他們甚至不告訴我為什麼要過來
They wouldn't even tell me why.

1490
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,117
沒人知道這是要幹什麼嗎?
Nobody knows what this is about?

1491
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,327
不知道
Nope.

1492
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,251
跟Jamie談過了?
Talk to Jamie?

1493
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,461
恩 他會沒事的
Yep. He'll be fine.

1494
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,380
你告訴他接下來要發生什麼了嗎?
Did you tell him what was coming?

1495
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,549
額 我告訴他我們會迫使他接受
Uh, did I tell him we're about to make him swallow

1496
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,510
不需要的注資了嗎? 沒說
a capital injection he doesn't need? No.

1497
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,264
我只告訴他 我們需要他的幫助
I, uh... I told him we need his help

1498
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,808
並且我非常禮貌的請求他今天不要跟我們作對
and I asked him very politely not to fuck with us today.

1499
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,561
他明白了
He got it.

1500
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:16,981
她在這了 
She's here.

1501
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:16,981
Sheila Bair 美國聯邦存款保險公司主席

1502
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:25,865
紳士們 這能奏效嗎?
Gentlemen. We think this is gonna work?

1503
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,075
啊 是的 他們會喜歡的
Oh, yeah. They're gonna love it.

1504
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:54,435
我們現在要著眼於美國的實際需求
We are of the view that the United States needs

1505
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,647
要採取堅決有力的行動
to take strong, decisive action

1506
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,318
以緩解金融體系的壓力
to arrest the stress in our financial system.

1507
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,530
通過新授權的TARP方案
Through our new TARP authority,

1508
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:11,369
財政部將向這間房間
Treasury will purchase preferred stock

1509
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,830
與會的每家銀行 購買優先股
in each of the banks represented in this room.

1510
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,919
頭五年 年收益為5%
That stock will yield 5 % the first five years,

1511
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:21,504
其後為9%
9 % after that.

1512
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,633
我們給你錢 你們借出去
We give you money. You lend it out.

1513
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:30,262
這可以激活信貸 穩定銀行 重建信心
It will unfreeze credit, stabilize the banks, restore confidence.

1514
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,934
每個人都會因為體系中更多的資金而獲益
Everyone will be better off with more capital in the system.

1515
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,396
這就是為什麼你們九個人
And that is why all nine of you

1516
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,567
都要參與這個計劃
will participate in the program.

1517
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,906
我們中有些人不需要資金
Some of us don't need any capital.

1518
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,908
你們都需要
You all need capital.

1519
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,995
你們不知道在未來一年堨奕黦|變成什麼樣
You have no idea what the market's gonna look like in a year.

1520
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,788
你也不知道
Neither do you.

1521
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:00,167
我可不是你們這些鼓弄新花樣的紐約佬
I'm not one of you New York guys with your fancy products.

1522
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,295
為什麼我要呆在這房間堸荈q救助你們?
Why am I in this room talking about bailing you out?

1523
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,674
強勢銀行將為弱勢銀行買單
The stronger banks will serve as cover for the weaker banks.

1524
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,343
如果只有部分銀行接受注資 那將成為一種信號
If just some of you take it, the money's a signal

1525
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:12,430
就是 這家銀行無法存活 市場將吞噬掉它
that a bank is too weak to survive. The market will devour it.

1526
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,141
我們討論的金額是多少?
How much are we talking about?

1527
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:16,892
1250億
A hundred and twenty-five billion.

1528
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,189
美國銀行 150億
Bank of America, 15 billion.

1529
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,900
紐約梅隆銀行 30億
Bank of New York Mellon, three billion.

1530
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,112
花旗集團 250億
Citigroup, 25 billion.

1531
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,449
高盛 100億
Goldman Sachs, 10 billion.

1532
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,160
摩根大通 250億
JPMorgan, 25 billion.

1533
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:36,954

1534
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,707
摩根斯坦利 100億
Morgan Stanley, 10 billion.

1535
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,293
道富銀行 20億
State Street, two billion.

1536
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,254
富國銀行 250億
Wells Fargo, 25 billion.

1537
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,847
購買不良資產的那個方案怎麼了?
What happened to buying toxic assets?

1538
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,767
- 那不是個好主意嗎?  - 那樣太慢了
- Wasn't that the idea?  - It's too slow.

1539
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,852
在這之前體系就會崩潰
It'll be dead before we sort it out.

1540
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,355
所以 我們就這麼把韁繩交給你了?
So, we're just handing the reins over to you?

1541
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,399
這筆交易實際上很不錯了
The deal's actually pretty good.

1542
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,735
你現在對此不屑一顧 等到我們還是得來援助你的時候
You turn your nose up at this now and we have to rescue you later,

1543
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,445
條件可就不這麼有吸引力了
the terms won't be nearly as attractive.

1544
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,114
這是很便宜的資本 這不是最差的注意
It's cheap capital. It's not the worst idea in the world.

1545
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,158
這是針對我們中間那些已經有足夠資本的
It is for those of us who already have capital.

1546
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:18,662
我們將成為沒投票權的股東 這只是暫時的舉措
We will be non-voting shareholders. This will be a temporary measure.

1547
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,375
要是我們拒絕參與呢?
What if we decline to be involved?

1548
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,004
美國聯邦存款保險公司的主席就坐在這
The Chairman of the FDIC is sitting right there.

1549
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,672
明天你就會發現
Tomorrow you'll find out

1550
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,008
你並不像你想的那樣擁有雄厚資本
that you're not as well capitalized as you think you are.

1551
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,219
你們會採取什麼樣的保障措施
What kind of protections can you offer on changes

1552
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,595
針對補償措施的改變?
for compensation policy?

1553
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:38,265
我的意思是 如果政府要成為共有者
I mean, if the government is going to become a part-owner,

1554
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:42,186
是不是表明將由政府來指定酬金?
does that mean that the government is going to dictate compensation?

1555
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,355
此刻你是在問我有關你的獎金問題嗎 John?
Are you asking me about your bonus right now, John?

1556
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,524
我在經營一家公司
I'm running a company.

1557
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,112
如果美聯儲告訴我 我不能向有才能的人提供有競爭力的薪酬
If the Fed tells me I can't offer competitive pay for talent,

1558
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:54,365
你將導致這個國家有史以來最嚴重的人才流失
you're gonna launch the biggest brain drain this country's ever seen.

1559
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,117
這就是你們要經營銀行的方式?
Is that the way you wanna run the banks?

1560
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,577
在償還欠款給財政部之前
Until the money is repaid to the Treasury,

1561
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,664
會有一些限制扣稅和黃金降落傘(公司控制權變動需要給高管進行補償的協定)的規定
there will be some limitations on tax deductions and golden parachutes.

1562
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,582
- 果然  - 我真不明白
- Well, there you go.  - I don't really understand

1563
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,919
為什麼討論這個話題還如此嚴肅
why there needs to be so much tension about this.

1564
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,840
這個國家在面臨自從大蕭條以來最嚴重的經濟危機
The country is facing the worst economy since the Great Depression.

1565
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:16,137
如果金融體系崩潰 你們每個人都會遭殃
If the financial system collapses, it will take every one of you down.

1566
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,397
給我文件
Give me the papers.

1567
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,573
- 你不能就這麼簽了  - 哦 為什麼不行?
- You can't just sign it.  - Oh, no?

1568
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:39,243
- 沒有你的董事會的同意  - 我的董事會24小時都待命
- Not without your board. - My board's on 24-hour notice.

1569
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,704
我想他們會同意的
I think they'll go along with it.

1570
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,457
如果他們不同意 那就炒了我
And if they don't, they'll fire me.

1571
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,674
其他人呢?
Anyone else?

1572
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,599
他們打算簽嗎?
Are they gonna do it?

1573
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,102
他們要聯繫各自的董事會
They're calling their boards.

1574
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,354
- 那是個好信號  - 如果他們同意
- That's a good sign.  - If they do go along with this,

1575
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,690
我們需要在宣佈注資的同時 公佈其他舉措
we should announce something alongside the injections, uh,

1576
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,027
也許是一個收購房屋貸款抵押的計劃
maybe a program to buy up mortgages.

1577
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:14,695
我不想草率的公佈些不成熟的計劃
I'm not rushing out some half-assed plan

1578
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,572
只是為了顯示我們做了什麼
just to make it look like we're doing something.

1579
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:20,075
或許我們能補充些限制條件 限制這些錢的用途
Maybe we just beef up the restrictions on how they spend the money,

1580
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,662
以去除毒瘤
something to take the stink off.

1581
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,165
加更多的條件的話 他們就不會答應了
Put more restrictions on it, they won't take it.

1582
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,714
今天完成的事情太多了
One thing too many for today.

1583
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,053
我們所知道的是他們差點搞垮了全美國的經濟
They almost bring down the US economy as we know it,

1584
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,555
但是我們卻不能限制他們如何使用
but we can't put restrictions on how they spend

1585
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,808
我們給他們的1250億美元
the $125 billion we're giving them

1586
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:48,145
就因為他們可能不會接受
because they might not take it.

1587
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,137
這是什麼?
What's this?

1588
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,224
那是 額
That is, um,

1589
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,686
一種有毒鏢蛙
a poison dart frog.

1590
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,523
Wendy在圭亞那照的
Wendy took it in Guyana.

1591
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,329
這是你的嗎?
Is this yours?

1592
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,670
Al Capone(美國黑幫教父)的
Al Capone's.

1593
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:58,382
九家銀行中的八個已經同意了
Eight out of nine are in.

1594
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,010
- 美國銀行還在等他的董事會 但是...  - 他也會同意的
- B of A is still waiting on its board, but...  - It's gonna go through.

1595
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,556
我要給眾議院辦公室打電話
I'll call the Speaker's office.

1596
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,517
還有 我們安排你跟總統電話聯繫下
And, uh, we're gonna get you on the phone with the President.

1597
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,352
好的
Okay.

1598
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:19,486
就因為我們的商議 道瓊斯指數漲了900點
Dow is up 900 points just because we were meeting.

1599
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,408
太好了
Well, that's good.

1600
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:27,911
太好了
That's good.

1601
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,081
這樣做是對的
It was the right thing.

1602
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,001
絕對的
Absolutely.

1603
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,045
我原本準備好應對更強的反對
I was prepared for more blowback.

1604
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:41,508
他們沒有選擇了 他們明白這點
They didn't have a choice. They knew that.

1605
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,513
好吧 我當然希望他們
Well, I certainly hope that they...

1606
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,891
什麼?
What?

1607
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,064
我希望他們會把錢用在我們要求的地方
I hope they use the money the way we're asking them to.

1608
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:59,818
他們會貸出去 是吧?
They will lend it out, won't they?

1609
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:17,795
他們一定會的
Of course they will.

1610
01:35:27,195 --> 01:35:28,795
雖然TRAP得到通過 但是幾家銀行仍未進行貸款 市場繼續動盪

1611
01:35:29,195 --> 01:35:34,795
失業率超過10% 數百萬的家庭因喪失抵押品贖回權而無家可歸

1612
01:35:38,195 --> 01:35:39,795
2009年 動盪的市場逐漸穩定 國際金融形勢的惡化得到緩解

1613
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:47,795
最大的幾家銀行已經贖回了TRAP中政府購買的優先股

1614
01:35:50,195 --> 01:35:52,795
2010年 對華爾街的補償已經達到1350億美元的新紀錄

1615
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:56,795
10家銀行的資產占擁有全美銀行資產總數的77%

1616
01:35:56,195 --> 01:36:04,795
他們被稱為 大而不倒

1617
