(BELLS TOLLING)

2
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,306
昨晚  我梦见自己又回到了曼陀丽庄园
MRS. DE WINTER: Last night,I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.

3
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:59,904
恍惚中  我站在那扇通往车道的大铁门前
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive,

4
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:02,406
好一会儿被挡在门外
and for a while,I could not enter,for the way was barred to me.

5
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,596
进不去

6
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,411
这时  我突然像所有的梦中人一样
Then,like all dreamers,

7
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,050
不知从哪儿获得了超自然的神力
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers

8
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:15,023
幽灵般飘过面前的障碍物
and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.

9
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:18,047
车道在我眼前伸展开去
The drive wound away in front of me,

10
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,489
蜿蜒曲折  依稀如旧
twisting and turning as it had always done.

11
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,494
但是待我向前走去  就察觉到车道已起了变化
But as I advanced,

12
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,310
I was aware that a change had come upon it.

13
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:29,101
原来自然界已恢复了本来的面目
Nature had come into her own again,and littla by little

14
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:32,542
渐渐把她细长的手指顽强而偷偷摸摸地

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,065
had encroached upon the drive with long,tenacious fingers.

16
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:35,774
伸到车道上来了

17
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:42,750
即使在过去  树林对车道来说  也始终是个威胁
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive,

18
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:46,618
终于到达了曼陀丽
and finally,there was Manderley.

19
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,258
曼陀丽  还是和过去一样的隐僻  静谧
Manderley,secretive and silent.

20
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,440
时光的流逝  丝毫无损于围墙的完美对称
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those wells.

21
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,202
我看见那一泓银色的海水
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy,

22
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,974
犹如风平浪静时明镜般的湖面

23
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:02,677
静静地任月光爱抚
and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.

24
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:08,308
一朵乌云已经遮没了月亮
And then a cloud came upon the moon

25
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:12,885
乌云有好一阵子徘徊不去  就像一只黑手遮住了脸庞
and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.

26
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:16,442
顿时  幻觉消失了
The illusion went with it.

27
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:19,977
我遥望远处孤零的小屋
I looked upon a desolate shell

28
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:25,503
闪闪的墙上未留下一丝岁月的痕迹
with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.

29
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:28,433
曼陀丽不再为我们所有
We can never go back to Manderley again.

30
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,414
曼陀丽不复存在了
That much is certain.

31
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,021
但有时在我的梦里
But sometimes in my dreams,I do go back

32
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:36,556
我确实重回到我生命中奇怪的日子
to the strange days of my life

33
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:40,321
那是从在法国南部开始的
which began for me in the South of France

34
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:17,442
不  别跳
No! Stop!

35
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:20,988
你在嚷嚷些什么
What the devil are you shouting about?

36
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,950
你是谁  你看什么呢
Who are you? What are you staring at?

37
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:28,485
对不起  我不是有意偷看的  但我 我只是以为
I'm sorry,I didn't mean to stare,but I... I only thought...

38
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,416
你有意的  对吧  你在这儿干吗
Oh,yon did,did yon? Well,what are you doing here?

39
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,397
我只是在散步而已
I was only walking.

40
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,046
那就继续散步吧  别处在这儿乱嚷嚷
Well,get on with your walking. Don't hang about here screaming.

41
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,888
我再也不会在淡季来蒙特卡洛了
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.

42
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,225
酒店一个知名人物也没有
Not e single well-known personality in the hotel

43
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:12,802
咖啡凉了  服务员  侍者  叫人

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,891
Stone cold. Waiter!

45
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,898
让他拿些
Gargon! Call him. Tell him to get me some...

46
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:20,424
天哪  是迈克斯・德温特  你好啊
Why,it's Max de Winter.

47
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,891
How do you do?

48
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,972
-你好  -我是伊迪丝・范・霍珀
How do you do?

49
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,881
很高兴在这儿碰到你
I'm Edytde Van Hopper. It's so nice to run into you here,

50
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,540
我刚刚开始绝望  在蒙特
just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.

51
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,416
一个老朋友都没碰到

52
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,147
坐下来喝杯咖啡吧
But do sit down and have some coffee.

53
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,264
德温特先生要跟我一起喝咖啡
Mr.de Winter is having some coffee with me.

54
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,464
叫那个愚蠢的服务生再倒一杯
Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.

55
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:41,123
恐怕我非得同您抵触一下不可
I'm afraid I must contradict you.

56
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,250
是你们二位同我一道用咖啡
You shall both have coffee with me.

57
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,450
-服务生  咖啡  谢谢  -是  先生
Gargon. Coffee,please.

58
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,432
-抽烟吗  -不  谢谢
-Cigarette? -No,thank you.

59
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,248
你一进餐厅我就认出你了
You know I recognized you as soon as you came in,

60
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,991
虽然那晚在棕榈滩的赌城见过就没再见了
though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.

61
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,191
也许你不会记住像我这样的一个老妇人
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.

62
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,068
你有在这儿玩桥牌吗
Are you playinp the tables much here at Monte?

63
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:00,977
不玩了  恐怕那只是几年前我用来消遣的玩意
No.I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.

64
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:03,594
我很理解你  对我来说
I can well understand that.

65
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,960
如果我能拥有一座像曼陀丽一样的仙乡
As for me,if I had a home like Manderley

66
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,827
我肯定绝不会来蒙特
I should certainly never come to Monte.

67
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,945
那是国家最大的地方之一
I hear it's one of the biggest places is that part of the country,

68
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,718
你会被那儿的美景深深吸引住
and you just can't beat it for beauty.

69
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,368
你觉得蒙特卡洛怎么样  或是你根本就不屑于它
What do you think of Monte Carlo? Or don't you think of it at all?

70
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,568
我觉得过于匠气
Well. I think it's rather artificial.

71
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:20,373
她被宠坏了  德温特先生  这就是她的毛病
She's spoiled,Mr.de Winter that's her trouble.

72
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,156
多少姑娘情愿把自己的眼睛作代价
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.

73
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,198
换得看一看蒙特的机会
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?

74
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,805
这样一来不是达不到目的了吗

75
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,494
现在我们再次相遇
Now that we've found each other again,I hope I shall see something of you.

76
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,246
希望能不时见到你

77
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:31,509
你一定得到我房间里来坐坐
You must come and have a drink in my suite.

78
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,407
我想他们一定给你弄了个好房间
I hope they've given you a good room.

79
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:36,754
地方很空  所以要是你觉得不舒服  听着  别慌
The place is empty,so if you're uncomfortable,mind you make s fuss.

80
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:39,257
你的行李  侍从总给料理好了吧
Your valet has unpacked for you,I suppose?

81
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,073
我没有侍从  也许您愿意为我去打开行李吧
I'm afraid I don't possess one. Perhaps you would like to do it for me?

82
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:45,920
我 我可不是说
Well,I... I hardly think...

83
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,995
假如需要
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. de Winter

84
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:49,674
也许你能帮帮德温特先生的忙
if he wants anything done.

85
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,874
你在许多方面都是个能干的孩子
You're a capable child in many ways.

86
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,887
好极了  但是我信奉我家的老话
That's a charming suggestion,but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,

87
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,192
"单身旅客行路最快"
“He travels fastest who travels alone.” Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.

88
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:59,694
也许您从来没有听说过这句话吧  晚安

89
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,301
多滑稽啊
What do you make of that?

90
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:06,160
你觉得他唐突地离开是不是一种幽默
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?

91
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,558
走吧  别傻愣在那儿  上楼吧
Come,don't sit there gawking,let's go upstairs.

92
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,748
-你有带钥匙吧  -带了  范・霍珀太太
-Have you got the key? -Yes Mrs.Van Hopper

93
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,772
我记得曾经有一位出名的作家
I remember,when I was younger,there was e well-known writer

94
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,785
每见我走来就绕道而走
who used to dart down the back way whenever ha saw we coming.

95
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:20,445
我看他大概对我着了迷  可又缺乏自信
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.

96
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,948
这就是生活啊
Well,c'est la vie.

97
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,900
顺便说一下  亲爱的  别怪我又数落你
By the way,my dear,don't think that I mean to be unkind,

98
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:30,038
不过你在德温特先生面前毕竟是个小人物
but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. be Winter.

99
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,229
你竟想独揽大家的谈话
Your effort to enter the oouversation quite embarrassed me,

100
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,627
这使我很尴尬  我敢说他也有同感
and I'm sure it did him. Men loathe that sort of thing.

101
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,755
男人是不喜欢这种样子的  好了  别不高兴

102
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:40,988
毕竟我要对你在这儿的行为负责
Oh,come,don't sulk. After all,I am responsible for your behavior here.

103
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,897
也许他没有注意到  可怜的孩子
Perhaps hedidn’tnotice it.

104
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,662
Poor thing,I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.

105
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:47,035
我想他只是无法从他妻子过世的事里走出来

106
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,851
他们说他非常爱她
They say he simply adored her.

107
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,051
(MAN LAUGHING)

108
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,936
(CUTLERY CLINKING)

109
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:09,142
是

110
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:12,270
我真失礼
Oh... How awkward of me.

111
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,294
看我干的蠢事  对不起
What a stupid thing to do. Oh,I'm so sorry.

112
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,692
别麻烦了  真的没关系
Please don't bother. It doesn't really matter.

113
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:20,497
让它去吧  去我桌上添一副刀叉
No,leave that,leave that. Go and lay another place at my table.

114
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,532
-小姐跟我共进午餐  -这可绝对不行
-Mademoiselle will have lunch with we. -Oh,but I couldnn't possibly.

115
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,348
-为什么  -请不必客气  你人真好
-Why not? -Oh,well,please don't be polite. I...

116
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,298
不过只要侍者把桌布换一下  就没事了
It's very kind of you but I'll be all ripht if they just change the cloth.

117
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,267
我不是同你客气
I wasn't being polite.

118
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,248
即使你没有冒冒失失地撞翻花瓶
I should have asked you to have lunch with we

119
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,219
我也会邀请你的
even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.

120
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,838
Come along.

121
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,462
来吧  要是不愿意  我们不一定要说话
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.

122
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:38,443
非常感谢
Well,thank you very much.

123
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,116
我要些炒鸡蛋就行
Oh,I...I'll just have some scrambled eggs.

124
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,203
是  小姐
Oui,mademoiselle.

125
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,748
你朋友怎么了
-What's happened to your friend? -She's ill is bed with a cold.

126
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:52,729
她感冒了  卧病在床

127
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,962
对不起  我昨天的举止太不成体统
I'm sorry I wss so rude to you yesterday

128
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,661
对此  我只有一个借口
The only excuse I can offer is that I've become boorish through living alone.

129
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,601
单身生活使我变成了粗鲁的乡巴佬

130
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:02,426
谈不上粗鲁  你只不过想要单独
You weren't really. You simbly wanted to be alone and...

131
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:06,597
告诉我  范・霍珀太太是你朋友还是只是雇主关系
Tell me,is Mrs.Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?

132
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,715
不  是雇主  我就是所谓的有偿伙伴
No,she's my employer.I'm what is known as“a paid companion.”

133
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,019
我倒不知道伴侣还能花钱买呢
I didn't know companionship could be bought.

134
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,210
我曾在字典里查"伴侣"这个词
I looked at the word“companion” in the dictionary once.

135
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,296
释义说"伴侣就是心腹朋友"
It said,“a friend of the bosom.”

136
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,589
我不妒忌你的特殊待遇
I don't envy you the privilege.

137
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,020
她真的很友善  我得谋生
Well,she's very kind,really,and I have to earn my living.

138
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:25,888
-你没有家人吗  -没有  我妈妈很多年前就去世了
Haven't you any family?

139
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,017
No. My mother died years and years ago,

140
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,704
然后就只剩我父亲
and there was only my father,and he died last summer.

141
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:32,239
去年夏天他也去世了  然后我就找了这份工作

142
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,227
And then I took this job.

143
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,169
-对你打击很大  -是啊  打击颇大
How rotten for you.

144
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,984
因为我们关系很好
Yes it was rather,because,you see,we got on so well together

145
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:39,966
你跟你的父亲吗
You and your father?

146
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,947
对  他生前就是一个既可爱又不同凡响的人
Yes. He was a lovely person,very unusual.

147
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,033
-他做什么的  -他是位画家
-What was he? -A painter.

148
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,535
-他画得好吗  -我觉得很好
Ah! Was he a good one?

149
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,142
但世人不理解他
Well,I thought so,but people didn't understand him.

150
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:51,332
是的  艺术家的困扰
Yes,that's often the trouble.

151
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,877
他画树  至少那是一颗树
He painted trees. At least,it was one tree.

152
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,796
你是说他一直重复画同样的树?
You mean,he painted the same tree over end over again?

153
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,123
是的  他有个理论如果你发现一件完美的事物
Yes. You see,he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing

154
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,636
或是地方或是人  你就该坚持
or place or person,you should stick to it.

155
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,618
很蠢吧
Do you think that's really silly?

156
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,120
哪儿有  我是个坚信自我的人
Not at all. I'm a firm believer in that myself.

157
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,580
他在画树的时候
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?

158
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,457
你干吗那
Well,I sat with him and I sketched a little. I don't do it very well,though.

159
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,689
我坐在他身边  然后画点素描  虽然我画得不好

160
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,192
-下午你要去画素描吗  -是的
Were you going sketching this afternoon?

161
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,173
-去哪儿画  -我还没想好
Yes.

162
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,944
-Where? -Well,I haven't made up my mind.

163
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:22,301
-我开车载你去  -不用了  谢谢  我不是
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.

164
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,118
Oh,no,I didn't mean...

165
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,210
废话不多说了  快吃完  我们走吧
Oh,nonsense. Finish up that mess,and we'll get along.

166
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:28,245
谢谢  你人真好  但我不是很饿
Thank you.It's very kind of you,but I'm not very hungry.

167
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:31,373
快吃  像乖孩子一样吃完
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.

168
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,177
你画蛮久了
You've taken long enough for that sketch.

169
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:44,919
我期待一副艺术作品出炉
I shall expect a really fine work of art.

170
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,640
不要  别看  画得一点都不好
Oh,no,don't look at it. It's not nearly good enough.

171
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,621
但也不至于那么差吧
Well,it can't be as bad as all that. Nowbss’tmb it all sat.

172
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:51,602
快给我看看  别擦掉  先让我看看
Let me see it first.

173
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,303
-是透视画法  我永远画不好  -让我瞧瞧
Well it's the perspective. I never can get it right.

174
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,768
Let me see it,let me see it. Oh,dear.

175
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:56,712
亲爱的  告诉我  是透视画法
Tell me,is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious

176
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:59,528
让我的鼻子中段被画得歪歪扭扭的吗
twist in the middle?

177
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,239
-你作为素描模特不大容易画  -不容易吗
Well,you're not a very easy subject to sketch.Your...

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,471
-你的表情一直在变  -有吗
Your expression keeps changing all the time.

179
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,819
Does it?

180
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:08,495
我是你的话  就会专心于画风景
Well,I'd...I'd concentrate on the view instead,if I were you.

181
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,685
那更值得一画
Much more worthwhile.

182
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,906
它使我想起我们家的海岸线
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home. Do you know Cornwall at all?

183
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,324
你知道康沃尔吗

184
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,358
知道  放假的时候  我跟爸爸去过那儿
Yes,I went there once with my father on holiday. I was in a shop once,

185
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,903
我在一家商店看到过一张明信片
and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it,right by the sea.

186
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,616
上面印着一座坐落在海边的美丽房子

187
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:27,317
我问那间房子是谁的  那个老太太说  那是曼陀丽庄园
I asked whose house it was,and the old lady said,“That's Manderley.”

188
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,289
-我为自己的无知感到羞愧  -曼陀丽很漂亮
I felt ashamed for not knowing.

189
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,283
对我来说  那只是我出生的地方罢了
Manderley is beautiful.

190
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,441
But to me,it's just the place where I was horn,

191
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,901
而且要在那里终其一生
and have lived in all my life.

192
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:41,029
但现在  我不知道该如何去面对它
But now,I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.

193
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:52,708
我们很幸运  天气恶劣的时候没在家
(STUTTERING)We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather,aren't we?

194
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,382
在英格兰直到6月才能尽情游泳
I cent ecer remember nn)nying nmimming in Englend till June,nun ynn9

195
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,804
这儿的水很暖  所以我可以整天待在里面
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.

196
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:08,766
那儿的回头浪很危险  去年有个男人在这儿淹死了
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here lest year.

197
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:13,354
我对溺水从来都不觉得恐惧  你呢
I never have any fear of drowning. Have you?

198
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,009
走吧  我载你回家
Come,I'll take you home.

199
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:40,559
是的  我认识德温特先生  我也认识他太太
Oh,yes,I know Mr.de Winter well. I knew his wife too.

200
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:43,699
她结婚之前  可是漂亮的丽贝卡・希尔德莱思
Before she married she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth,you know.

201
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,618
当她在曼陀丽附近航行的时候淹死了  可怜的女人
She was drowned,poor dear,while she was sailing near Manderley.

202
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,423
他从不谈论此事  但他的心全都碎了
He never talks about it,of course,but he's a broken man.

203
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,458
你最好该吃药了  真恶心
I suppose I'd better have it.

204
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,960
给我块巧克力  快点
Wretched stuff! Give me a chocolate,quick!

205
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:57,254
你来了啊  正是时候
Oh,there you are.It's about time.

206
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,278
快点  我想玩拉米纸牌
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.

207
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,663
漂亮的丽贝卡・希尔德莱思
EDYTHE: She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth,you know.

208
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,853
他们说他非常爱她
They say he simply ahored her.

209
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:14,147
漂亮的丽贝卡・希尔德莱思
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hilbreth,you know.

210
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:16,545
我想他只是无法从他妻子过世的事里走出来
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.

211
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,943
漂亮的丽贝卡・希尔德莱思
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hilbreth,you know.

212
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,237
但他的心全都碎了
But he's a broken man.

213
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,502
-你好  -你要去哪儿
Bonjour

214
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,328
-我想去上网球课  -知道了
-Well,where are you going? -I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.

215
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,550
我猜你已经看到教练了  他帅呆了
I see.

216
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,633
I suppose you've had a look at the pro,and he's desperately handsome,

217
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,689
你肯定幻想着什么爱情故事吧
and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.

218
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,296
好了  去吧  好好享受吧
All right. Go ahead. Make the most of it.

219
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,467
-下班了吗  -是的
Off duty?

220
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,490
范・霍珀太太从感冒变成流感了
Well,yes. Mrs.Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu,

221
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,699
所以她请了位专业护士
so she's got a trained nurse.

222
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,785
真替那位护士感到难过  你喜欢打网球?
I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?

223
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:47,827
不是  不是特别喜欢
-Well,not particularly -That's good.We'll go for a drive.

224
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,851
那太好了  我们去游车河

225
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:12,436
下午好  范・霍珀太太  感觉怎么样
Good afternoon Mrs.Van Hopper. How are you feeling’?

226
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:15,554
你跟他处得不错啊  是吧
You got on rather well with him,didn't you?

227
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,693
除了网球  那个教练肯定还教了你其他东西吧
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.

228
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:22,968
快点  我要打几个电话
Hurry up,I want you to make some calls.

229
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,993
我想知道德温特先生是否仍在酒店
I wonder if Mr.de Winter is still in the hotel.

230
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,402
亲爱的德温特先生

231
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,854
你这讨厌鬼  怎么也不回我电话

232
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:36,263
我保证  等这恼人的感冒一好

233
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,755
我就会把你从蒙特卡洛这无聊的地方解救出来

234
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,529
因为我知道  你此刻一定无聊至极

235
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,262
无聊  无聊  无聊  伊迪丝・范・霍珀敬上

236
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,154
我可以走了吗
May I go now?

237
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,645
你已经上过多堂网球课了
For the number of lessons you've had,you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.

238
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,491
你该准备去温布尔登(网球锦标赛)

239
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,993
但这是最后一堂课了  尽情享受吧
But this will be your last,so make the most of it.

240
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,714
麻烦的是  像我这样卧病在床  你没什么事可干了
The trouble is,with me laid up like this,you haven't had enough to do.

241
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,226
但今天我要退掉护士
I'm getting rid of that nurse today.And from now on,you'll stick to your job.

242
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:33,771
并且从现在开始你将重归工作岗位

243
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,961
是的  范・霍普太太
Yes,Mrs.Van Hopper.

244
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,236
-护士  -是的  范・霍珀太太
-Nurse? -Yes,Mrs.Hopper?

245
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:44,084
你确定给德温特先生留言了吗
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr.de Winter?

246
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:46,910
-怎么了  是的  夫人  -我只是不敢相信
-Why,yes,madame. -I simply can't believe it.

247
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,517
他一定会回我电话的
He would most certainly have called me back.

248
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:53,062
可怜的孩子  我实在不忍看他孤身一人
Oh,well. Poor boy,I simply hate to see him so alone.

249
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,853
我 我希望能有种发明
You know,I... I wish there could be an invention

250
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:06,409
能把记忆像香水一样装在瓶子里多好
that bottled up the memory,like perfume,and it never faded,

251
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,704
记忆就永不褪色  常年新鲜
never got stale.

252
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:11,102
什么时候需要  只要随时打开瓶子
Then whenever I wanted to,I could uncork the bottle

253
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,292
你就仿佛又回过头去重新体验那一刻
and live the memory all over again.

254
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:16,003
有哪些特别的时刻  你想重新体验呢
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?

255
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:18,922
所有  过去几天的所有时刻
All of them. All these last few days.

256
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:23,500
我仿佛要 要收集满满一整架瓶子
I feel as though I'd...I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.

257
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,045
有时  那些小瓶子装着魔鬼
Sowetiwes,you know,those little bottles contain demons

258
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:29,558
会突然跑出来瞪着你
that have a way of popping out at you,

259
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,060
正像你要试图拚命去忘记
just as you're trying most desperately to forget.

260
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:44,887
别咬指甲了
Stop biting your nails.

261
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,806
但愿我是个36岁上下的女人

262
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,830
披一身黑缎子  戴一串珍珠项链
I wish I were a woman of 36,dressed in black satin with a atring of pearls.

263
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:53,646
如果你是这样一个人物  此刻你就不会和我在一起
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.

264
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,566
请你告诉我
Would you please tell me,Mr.be Winter,why you asked me to come out with you?

265
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:00,101
德温特先生  你为什么要约我出来

266
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:02,718
显然你是想要表示友好
It's obvious you want to be kind,but why do you choose me for your charity?

267
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,638
但为什么选择我呢

268
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,501
我邀你跟我一起出来是因为我想与你为伴
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.

269
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,482
你替我抹去往昔的影子
You've blotted out the past for me more than

270
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:19,402
你的力量比灯红酒绿的蒙特卡洛要大得多
all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.

271
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:22,425
但如果你认为我只是出于好意约你或是可怜你
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity,

272
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,346
那么你此刻就可以下车  自己寻路回去
you can leave the car now and find your own way home.

273
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,266
快呀  开门下车啊
Go on. Open the door and get out.

274
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:37,859
擤擤鼻涕吧
-Better blow your nose. -Thank you.

275
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,655
请别再叫我德温特先生
Please don't call me Mr.de Winter

276
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,877
我有一个令人印象非常深刻的名字
I have a very impressive array of first name.

乔治・弗特斯克・马克西米利安

You needn't bother with them all at once. My family call ma Maxim.

279
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,685
家里人都叫我迈克西姆

280
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,647
还有一件事
And another thing,

281
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,973
答应我  你一辈子不穿黑缎子衣服和珍珠项链
please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls,

282
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:01,008
也不假装自己是36岁
or to be 36 years old.

283
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,302
好的  迈克西姆

你好啊  怎么了  发生什么事了
Hello. What are you doing here?

317
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:09,537
我是来道别的  我们就要走了
Anything the matter?

318
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,090
I've come to say goodbye. We're going away.

319
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,456
-你在胡说八道些什么  -是真的
What on Earth are you talking about?

320
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,419
我们马上要走了  我怕再也见不到你了
It's true.We’regoing now,

321
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,934
and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.

322
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
她要带你去哪儿
-Where's she taking you to? -New York. I don't want to go.

323
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,430
纽约  可我不想去

324
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:29,454
我恨纽约之行  我会很苦恼的
I shall hate it. I shall be miserable.

325
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,857
我去换衣服  很快就好
I'll dress in here.

你比较喜欢哪个  纽约还是曼陀丽
Which would you prefer,New York or Menderley?

我最好马上说再见
Mrs.Van Hopper’s waiting. I’d better say goodbye now.

330
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:53,124
我再重复一遍
I’ll repeat what I said.

你要跟范・霍珀太太去美国
Either you go to America with Mrs.Van Hopper,

332
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,129
还是跟我一起回曼陀丽
or you come home to Manderley with me.

333
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,423
你是说  你想雇一个秘书之类的人?
You mean you want a secretary or something?

334
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,551
我是要你嫁给我  你这个小傻瓜
I’m asking you to marry ma,you little fool.

MAXIM: Come in.

337
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:18,359
是我的吗  我饿死了  一点早餐都没吃呢
Is that my food? I’m famished. I didn’t have any breakfast.

338
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:37,327
你对我的建议好像不领情啊  抱歉
My suggestion didn’t seem to go at all well. Sorry.

339
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:39,006
你不懂
Oh,but you don’t understand. It’s the...

340
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,810
男人可不找我这样的人结婚
-I’m not the sort of person men marry -What on Earth do you mean?

341
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:44,532
你这话究竟是什么意思

342
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,930
至少有一点  我不是你那个圈子里的人
I don’t belong in your sort of world,for one thing.

343
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,120
什么圈子
Well,what in my sort of world?

344
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:52,144
曼陀丽啊  你知道我的意思
Well,Manderley. You know what I mean.

345
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,959
你是不是属于那个圈子  只有我才能下判断
Well,I’m the best judge of whether you belong there or not.

346
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,357
当然  如果你不爱我  那就是另一回事了
Of course,if you don’t love me,that’s a different thing.

347
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,755
这对我的自负倒是一个很好的教训
Fine blow to my conceit,that’s all.

348
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:02,468
我爱你  非常非常爱
I do love you. I love you most dreadfully.

349
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:06,638
我整个早上都在哭  因为我以为再也见不到你了
I’ve been crying all morning because I thought I’d never see you again.

350
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:11,643
愿上帝保佑你
Bless you for that.

351
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:17,587
某天我会使你想起此事  你不会相信我
If I remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.

352
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:21,549
很遗憾你必须长大
It’s a pity you have to grow up.

353
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,156
现在搞定了  你可以帮我倒杯咖啡了

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,977
谁去跟范・霍珀夫人谈这件事儿  你去还是我去
Who is going to break the news to Mrs.Van Hopper? Shall you or should I?

357
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,063
你去跟她说  她一定会气个半死
You tell her.She’ll be so angry.

358

她房间电话多少

359
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:39,172
她不在房间  她在楼下车里
She’s not there. She’s downstairs in the car.

360
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,883

Hello.You’ll find Mrs.Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.

362
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:50,433
你去叫她  并代我向她致意
Would you ask her,with my compliments,

363
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:53,145
问她是否愿意来我房间
if she’d very kindly come up and see me is my room?

364
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,126

Why,certainly.

368
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:11,403
这并不是你理想中的求婚  是吗

00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,731
This isn’t at all your idea of a proposal.is it?

370
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,582
应该在温室中
It should be is a conservatory,

371
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:17,440
你穿着白色连衣裙  手里拿着一束红玫瑰

并且在远处有人拉着小提琴
and a violin playing in the distance,

373
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:23,281
我该站在棕树后面像你求爱
and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.

374
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:26,294
亲爱的小可怜  不用担心
Poor darling. Never mind.

I’m so glad you called me,Mr.de winter

我正赶着离开  没告诉你真太不礼貌了
I was making a hasty departure.

380

今早有个电报发过来说
It was so rude of me not to let you know.

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,779
我女儿要结婚了
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter

那太巧了  范・霍珀太太
in engaged to be married.

383
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,934
That’s rather a coincidence,Mrs.Van Hopper.

384
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,785
我叫您来这儿  正是为了告诉您我订婚的事
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.

385
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,799
你不会是开玩笑吧  太棒了
You don’t mean it. How perfectly wonderful.

多么浪漫啊  谁是那位幸运的姑娘
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?

I do hope it won’t inconvenience you too greatly.

389

这些都是什么时候发生的事
When did all this happen?

390
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:06,450
就刚才  范・霍珀太太  就在几分钟之前
Just now,Mrs.Van Hopper. Just a few minutes ago.

391
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:09,057
我简直不敢相信
I simply can’t believe it.

392
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:11,769
我想我应该因你没跟我
And I suppose I ought to scold you

393
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,428
透露半点风声而责怪你
for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.

394
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:15,940
我在想什么呀
What am I thinking of?

395
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:19,276
我该恭喜祝福你们俩
I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.

396
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:22,811
我真替你们俩开心  什么时候在哪里举行婚礼
I’m very happy for you both.

397
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,950
-在这儿  越快越好  -闪电结婚啊
-When and where is the wedding to be? -Here,as soon as possible.

398
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:29,182
好极了  我可以推迟船期1周
A whirlwind romance. Splendid! I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.

399
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:31,163
这可怜的孩子没有母亲
This poor child has no mother,

400
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:33,353
所以我该承担所有安排事物的责任
so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.

401
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:35,334
嫁妆  接待等等
Trousseau,reception and everythinp,and I'll give the bride away.

402
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,733
并由我将新娘交给新郎  但我们的行李
But our luggage.

403
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:40,194
下去告诉门僮把所有东西都从车里搬出来
Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.

404
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:40,861
等等
Just a minute.We’re most grateful,Mrs.Van Hopper,

405
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,842
我们不胜感激  但我想我们俩

406
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:45,554
都比较喜欢低调处理此事
but I think we’d both prefer to have it all as quiet as posaible.

407
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:48,984
-我不能让您改船期  -但是
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans.

408
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:52,540
不 亲爱的  我下去看看  把你的行李拿回来
―Oh,but... -No,no,no.

409
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,256
Dear,I’ll go down and see that your luggage in brought back.

410
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,729
谢谢  马克西姆
Thank you,Maxim.

411
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,275
那么  这事是在我生病期间发生的
So this is what’s been happening during my illness.

412
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,986
网球课  那才怪呢
Tennis lessons,my foot.

413
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,593
我猜我得颁个闪电恋爱奖给你
I suppose I’ve to hand it to you for a fast worker.

414
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:06,617
这事怎么给你办成的  静水流深啊
How did you manage it?

415
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,726
Still waters certainly run deep.

416
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:14,219
你说  你有没有做什么不该做的事情
Tell me,have you been doing anything you shouldn’t?

417
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,461
我不明白你在说些什么

418
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:18,598
好吧  没有关系
-I don’t know what you mean. -Well,never mind.

419
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,622
我常说英国男人的品味很怪异
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.

420
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:24,969
你今后要担负曼陀丽女主人的职责
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.

421
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,002
说句老实话  亲爱的  我看你根本对付不了
To be perfectly frank with you,my dear,I can’t see you doing it.

422
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:28,411
你没有经验
You haven't the experience,

423
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:33,718
你一点也不懂做一名好夫人意味着什么
you haven’t the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.

424
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,023
当然  你知道他为什么要娶你
Of course you knoe why he's marrying you,don’t you?

425
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,421
你不会自欺欺人地以为他爱着你吧
You haven’t flattered yourself that he’s in love with you?

426
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:41,132
实际情况是一幢空房子弄得他神经受不了
Fact is,that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent,

427
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,113
简直要把他逼疯
he nearly went off his head.

428
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:45,407
他只是无法继续独居
He just couldn’t go on living alone.

429
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:48,952
范・霍珀太太  你该走了  你会赶不上火车的
You’d better leave,Mrs.Van Hopper.You’ll miss your train.

430
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,504
德温特太太
(SCOFFS)

00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,319

He says I’ve forgotten the proof that we’re married.

-Isn't she sweet? -Yes.

443

你喜欢穿婚纱  对吧
You’d have liked a bridal veil,wouldn’t you?

-Gold,darling? -Yes,just a little bit.

There’s no need to be frightened,you know.

晚上好  丹弗斯太太
Oh.

00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:18,817
晚上好  夫人
-Good evening,Mrs.Danvers. -Good evening madam.

480
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:28,097
希望爱丽丝能令您满意  夫人
-I hope Alice was satisfactory,madam. -Oh,yes,thank you,perfectly.

481
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:30,391
-满意  谢谢  很满意  -她是客厅女仆

482
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:32,894
她会照顾你  直到你的专属女佣来了为止
She’s the parlor maid.

483
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,925
She’ll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.

484
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:35,605
但我不需要女佣  我肯定爱丽丝会做得很好
Oh,but I haven’t a maid. I’m sure Alice will do very nicely.

485
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:38,316
恐怕那不会很久  夫人
I’m afraid that would not do for very long,madam.

486
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:41,851
作为女主人有专属女佣是很平常的
It’s usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.

487
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:45,928
我希望您喜欢这些房间的新装修  夫人
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms,madam?

488
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,327
我不知道已经换过了呢
Oh,I didn’t know it had been changed.

489
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:50,621
我希望没有给你们带来太多麻烦
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.

490
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:53,227
我只是依照德温特先生的指示办事而已
I only followed out Mr.de Winter’s instructions.

491
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,521
之前是什么样子的
Well,what did it look like before?

492
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,711
各种各样的帷幕  帘子等等
It had an old paper and different hangings.

493
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,318
除了偶尔接待宾客  这套房间不大使用
It was never used much except for occasional visitors.

494
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,133
这么说  这不是他原来的卧室
Oh. Then it wasn’t Mr.de Winter’s room originally?

495
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,939
是的  夫人  过去他从来没用过东厢的房间
No,madam. He’s never used the east wing before.

496
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:09,599
当然  从这儿看不到海景
Of course,there’s no view of the sea from here.

497
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:13,040
西翼的房间是唯一的无敌海景房

498
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,595
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.

499
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,470
房间很温馨  住在这儿肯定会非常舒服
The room’s very charming,and I’m sure I’ll be comfortable.

500
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:19,609
夫人  如果您有什么事  只要告诉我就行了
If there’s anything you want done,madam,you have only to tell me.

501
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,986
你来曼陀丽好些年了吧
I suppose you’ve been at Manderley for many years,longer than anyone else.

502
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:23,144
大概比谁待的时间都长

503
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,178
不  弗里思比我来得早  老爷在世的时候  他就来了
Not so long as Frith.

504
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,472
那时  德温特先生还是个孩子
He was here when the old gentleman was living,

505
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:31,601
是这样啊  你是在那以后才来的?
when Mr.de Winter was a boy.

506
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,526
Oh I see. And you didn’t come till after that?

507
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:34,834
我来时正好是头一位德温特夫人嫁过来的时候
I came here when the first Mrs.de Winter was a bride.

508
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:42,237
丹弗斯太太  我希望我们俩能互相了解  处好关系
Mrs.Danvers,I do hope we’ll be friends.

509
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:43,499
你对我得有点耐心
You must be petiest with me.

510
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,876
因为这样的生活对我来说完全是新的

511
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:48,389
我一定要努力适应这儿
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it,

512
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,579
让德温特先生过得幸福
and make Mr.de Winter happy,

513
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,498
我知道一切家务安排全可交给你管
so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.

514
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,940
好的  但愿一切都能遂您的心意
Very well.I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction,madam.

515
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,443
自从德温特太太去世  都是由我来管理家务
I’ve managed the house since Mrs.de Winter’s death

516
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,362
德温特先生从来没表示过不满意
and Mr.de Winter has never complained.

517
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:11,225
我现在要下楼了
I think I’ll go downstairs now.

518
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:48,160
通过那道门就是我告诉你的
That room in the west wing I was telling you about in there,through that door.

519
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,746
西厢的房间

520
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:53,040
现在不用了
It’s not used now.

521
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,542
那是这栋房里最漂亮的房间
It’s the most beautiful room is the house,

522
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:59,505
是唯一能穿过草坪遥看大海的房间
the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.

523
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,363
那曾是德温特夫人的卧室
It was Mrs.de Winter’s room.

524
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,906
-早上好  -早上好
-Good morning. -Good morning.

525
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,991
你是德温特太太  是吗
-Yon’re Mrs.de Winter,aren't you? -Yes.

526
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:29,181
-是的  -我叫克劳莱
My name’s Crawley.I manage the estate for Maxim.

527
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:31,893
我为马克西姆管理财产事物

528
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:34,291
很高兴见到你
Awfully glad to meet you.

529
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:38,254
害怕当马克西姆不在的时候所有事都堆到一块儿了
(CRAWLEY TITTERS)

530
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,633
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.

531
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,652
是的  我肯定会这样
Yes I’m sure there must have been. I do wish I could help with some of it.

532
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:43,363
我真的希望能帮上什么忙

533
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:46,074
不  弗兰克绝不允许任何人帮他
No,no. Frank never allows anybody to help him.

534
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,889
他就处理像账单  房租跟税务这些鸡毛蒜皮的事
He’s like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.

535
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,954
走吧  弗兰克  我们必须看一下这些评估
Come on,Frank,we must go over these estimates.

536
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:51,809
我去拿文件
I’ll get my papers.

537
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,207
你会发现那边有很丰盛的早餐
You’ll find quantities of breakfast over there.

538
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,386
你必须都吃完  不然就是对厨师的不敬
But you must eat it all,or Cook will be mortally offended.

539
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,440
我会尽量的  马克西姆
I’ll do my best,Maxim.

540
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,775
我得跟弗兰克去个地方
I have to go over the place with Frank,

541
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:00,673
以确保万无一失
just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.

542
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:02,967
但你会好好的  对吗
You’ll be all right,won’t you? Getting acquainted with your new howe?

543
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:05,261
开始了解你的新家了吗

544
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,763
看看《纽约时报》  有一篇关于
Have a look at The Times. There’s a thrilling article

545
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:10,161
英格兰板球问题所在的尖锐文章
on what’s the matter with English cricket.

546
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:12,455
对了
Oh,yes...

547
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:13,999
我姐姐比阿特丽斯跟她丈夫
My sister,Beatrice,and her husband,Giles Lacy,

548
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,990
贾尔斯・莱斯要来吃顿中饭
have invited themselves over for lunch.

549
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:18,086
-今天吗  -是的
-Today? -Yes.

550
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:21,006
我猜想大姐迫不及待要来看你
I suppose the old girl can’t wait to look you over.

551
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,988
你会发现她为人很直
You’ll find her very direct.

552
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:25,282
她如果对你没有什么好感  就会当着你的面说出来
If she doesn’t like you,she’ll probably tell you so to your face.

553
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,931
别担心  亲爱的  我会及时回来保护你的
Don’t worry,darling,I’ll be back in time to protect you from her.

554
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:31,330
-再见  亲爱的  -再见  马克西姆
-Goodbye,darling. -Goodbye,Maxim.

555
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:33,623
-再见  -再见
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

556
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,168
-早上好  夫人  -早上好  弗里思
-Good morning,madam. -Good morning,Frith.

557
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,301
有什么需要我为您效劳的吗  夫人
Isn’t there anything I could get for you,madam?

558
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:28,159
不用  谢谢  弗里思  我真的不是很饿
No,thank you,Frith. I’m really not very hungry.

559
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,140
谢谢
Thank you.

560
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:33,373
-报纸  夫人  -对的  谢谢  弗里思
-The paper,madam. -Oh,yes. Thank you,Frith.

561
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:39,421
-夫人  -脚滑了一下
I slipped.

562
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,028
谢谢  弗里思
Thank you,Frith.

563
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:49,327
-好大呀  -是的  夫人  曼陀丽是个很大的地方
-It’s big,isn’t it? -Yes,madam,Manderley is a big place.

564
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:51,934
过去这个曾是宴会厅
This was the banquet hall is the old days.

565
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:55,479
这仍旧用以大庆  像是大的宴会或是舞会
It’s still used on great occasions,such as a big dinner or a ball.

566
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,327
是这儿的传统  一周一次
And the public is admitted here,you know,once a week.

567
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:01,318
真好
That’s nice.

568
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:25,093
太太  您要什么

569
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,595
藏书室里通常
I beg pardon,madam.

570
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,326
下午才生火
I’m afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.

571
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:30,307
此刻晨室里已生了火
But you’ll find one in the morning room.

572
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,915
当然  要是您吩咐在藏书室里也生火
Of course,if you wish this fire lit now,madam...

573
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:35,730
不必  我没有这个意思
No,Frith. I wouldn’t dream of it.

574
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:39,588
德温特太太
Mrs.de Winter...

575
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:42,299
过去  德温特夫人在早餐后总在那儿
I mean,the late Mrs.de Winter

576
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,219
写信  打电话
always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room,

577
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,513
谢谢  弗里思
after breakfast.

578
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,230
Thank you,Frith.

579
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,541
怎么了  夫人
Is anything wrong,madam?

580
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,671
没有  晨室怎么走
Oh,no. Which way is the morning room?

581
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:02,112
-那边左边那扇门  -好  谢谢
Oh,it’s that door there,on the left.

582
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,253
Oh,yes,thank you.

583
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,341
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

584
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,567
德温特太太?  恐怕您弄错了吧
Mrs.de Winter? Oh,I’m afraid you’ve made a mistake.

585
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:03,519
德温特太太去世已经一年多了
Mrs.de Winter’s been dead for ever a year.

586
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,032
我是说
Oh,I mean...

587
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,767
那是内线电话  夫人
Oh.

588
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:15,416
可能园丁长想要请示
That was the house telephone,madam.

589
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,993
Probably the head gardener wishing instruction.

590
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:19,067
你要见我吗  丹弗斯太太
Did you want to see me,Mrs.Danvers?

591
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,673
德温特先生通知我  他姐姐莱斯太太
Mr.de Winter informed me that his sister,Mrs.Lacy,and Major Lacy

592
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:23,967
跟莱斯少校会来用午餐
are expected for luncheon.

593
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:26,366
我想知道今天的菜单是不是合意
I’d like to know if you approve of the menu.

594
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,702
挺合适的  确实好极了
Oh ,well I’m sure it’s very suitable,very nice indeed.

595
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:32,924
请您看一下  在调味两字的边上我留出了空白
You will notice,madam,that I’ve left a blank space for the sauce.

596
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:36,688
过去德温特夫人非常讲究调味汁
Mrs.de Winter was most particular about sauces.

597
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:39,087
我看德温特夫人喜欢什么  你们就看着办好了
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs.de Winter would have ordered.

598
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:41,069
谢谢  夫人
Thank you,madam.

599
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,542
你的信什么时候写完  罗伯特会拿去邮局寄
When you’ve finished your letters,Robert will take them to the post.

600
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:48,159
我的 我的信?
My... My letters?

601
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,392
是的  当然  谢谢  丹弗斯太太
Oh,yes,of course. Thank you,Mrs.Danvers.

602
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:51,558
-你好  弗里思  -早上好  莱斯太太
-BEATRICE: How are you,Frith? -Good morning,Mrs.Lacy.

603
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,103
-德温特先生在哪儿  -跟克劳莱先生去农场了
Where’s Mr.de Winter?

604
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,172
FRICH: I believe he went down to the farm with Mr.Crawley.

605
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:58,544
真讨厌  我们来的时候  他老是不在
BEATRICE: How tiresome of him not to be bere when we arrive,and how typical.

606
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,512
(WHINING)

607
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,665
我必须说  老丹弗斯把这个房子管理得挺不错
BEATRICE: I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.

608
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,001
她肯定跟丽贝卡学了花艺技巧
She’s certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.

609
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,087
我想知道现在她有多喜欢它
GIlES: I wonder how she likes it now,

610
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,485
被一个交际花不断差遣
being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.

611
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:23,883
你到底从哪儿得知她是以前是个交际花啊
BEATRICE: Now,where on Earth did you get the idea

612
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:27,012
他在法国南部搭上她的  不是吗
she’s an ex-chorus girl?

613
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,533
He picked her up in the South of France,didn’t he?

614
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:31,287
-是又怎样  -我的意思是说  那就是了
What if he did?

615
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,544
Well,I mean to say,there you are.

616
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,586
您好  我是迈克西姆的太太
How do you do?I’m Maxim’s wife.

617
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:39,462
你好啊
How do you do?

618
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:42,851
你跟我猜想的完全不同
Well I must say you’re quite different from what I expected.

619
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:46,094
别说傻话了  她跟我和你讲的完全一样
Don’t be so silly. She’s exactly what I told you she’d be.

620
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:48,909
-觉得曼陀丽怎么样  -很漂亮  不是吗
Well,how do you like Manderley?

621
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:50,996
跟丹弗斯太太相处得怎么样
It’s very beautiful,isn’t it?

622
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,561
And how do you get along with Mrs.Danvers?

623
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:54,843
以前我从未见过像她那样的人
Well. I...

624
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,236
I’ve never met anyone quite like her before.

625
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:58,607
你是说她使你害怕?  她那副尊容可实在上不了油画
You mean,she scares you.

626
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,573
She’s not exactly an oil painting,is she?

627
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:01,517
贾尔斯  你话有点多啊  到别处去吧
Giles,you’re very much in tha way here. Go somewhere else.

628
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:03,612
我去找迈克西姆  可以吗
Well,I'll try and find Maxim,shall I?

629
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,385
贾尔斯
Giles.

630
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:09,973
我无意说丹弗斯太太坏话
I didn’t mean to say anything against Mrs.Danvers.

631
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:12,371
你没必要怕她
Oh,there’s no need for you to be frightened of her,

632
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:15,395
但我应该比她好相处
but I shouldn’t have any more to do with her than you can help.

633
00:43:15,397 --> 00:43:18,420
-我们可以坐下吗  -当然  请坐
-Shall we sit down? -Yes. Yes,please.

634
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,746
她起初一定会疯狂嫉妒
You see,she’s bound to be insanely jealous at first

635
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:23,842
并且她肯定对你极度不满
and she must resent you bitterly.

636
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:26,240
-为什么  -你不知道吗
But why should she?

637
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:29,160
我还以为迈克西姆肯定跟你说起过
Don’t you know?

638
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,933
I should have thought Maxim would have told you.

639
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:32,079
她对丽贝卡崇拜得五体投地
She simply adored Rebecca.

640
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,593
-你好  罗伯特  -很好  谢谢  夫人
-How are you,Robert? -Quite well,thank you,madam.

641
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:47,513
-牙还疼吗  -还会疼呢  夫人
-Still having trouble with your teeth? -Unfortunately,you,madam.

642
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:51,256
该把它们都拔掉  都拔掉  讨厌的东西  牙齿
You must have them out,all of them.

643
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,352
-谢谢  夫人  -好大一盘啊
-Wretched nuisances,teeth. -Thank you,madam.

644
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:57,001
-你会打猎吗  -不会  恐怕我连骑马都不会
What a plateful.

645
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,954
Do you hunt?

646
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,249
No,I don’t. I’m afraid I don’t even ride.

647
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,493
一定要在这儿骑马  我们都会
Yon have to ride down here,we all do.

648
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:02,621
你骑哪种  横座马鞍还是跨骑?
Which do you ride,sidesaddle or astride?

649
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,707
对了  我忘了  你不会骑马
Well,of course,I forgot. You don’t,do you?

650
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,406
你一定得学啊  这儿没什么事可做
You must. Nothing else to do around here.

651
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:09,932
迈克西姆  你什么时候要再在这儿办派对  像以往一样
Maxim,when are you going to have parties here again,like the old days?

652
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:13,154
-我还没想过呢  -但大家都期待看你和
I haven’t thought about it.

653
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:15,145
诗啊  我肯定他们很期待
-But everyone’s dying to see you and... -Yes,I bet they are.

654
00:44:15,146 --> 00:44:17,648
你怎么不再举办化妆舞会了呢
Why don’t you have the masquerade ball again this summer?

655
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:19,733
亲爱的  你喜欢跳舞吗
My dear,are you fond of dancing?

656
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,340
喜欢  但我跳得不好
I love it,but I’m not very good at it.

657
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:24,947
-你会跳伦巴吗  -我没跳过呢
Do you rumba?

658
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:25,614
你一定要向我请教
-Never tried. -You must teach me.

659
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:28,492
我说  老弟  我在尝试获悉你老婆到底会做什么
Actually,I’m trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.

660
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:30,890
她会点素描
She sketches a little.

661
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:33,184
素描  我希望不是什么现代主义的玩意
Sketches.

662
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,166
画一个倒置灯罩的画像
Not this modern stuff,I hope,you know,portrait of a lampshade upside down

663
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:37,148
来表现痛苦中的灵魂
to represent a soul in torment.

664
00:44:37,149 --> 00:44:40,067
-会开船吗  -不会
Don’t sail,do you?

665
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:44,134
谢天谢地  幸亏你不会
No,I don’t.

666
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,422
Thank goodness for that.

667
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,591
Huh?

668
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:57,376
你很爱迈克西姆  对吗
You’re very much in love with Maxim,aren’t you?

669
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:59,566
我看得出来
Yes,I can see you are.

670
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:03,321
别介意我那么说  我觉得你的头发得好好弄一弄
Don’t mind my saying so,but why don’t you do something about your hair?

671
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:06,449
为什么不剪一下  或者拢到耳朵后面去
Whydon’tyon days it oat or nwnng it band dndind ynnrsara’?

672
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:12,173
不行 不行  这样更糟  迈克西姆怎么说
Oh,no,that’s worse.

673
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:15,103
-他喜欢这样吗  -他从来没提起过
What does Maxim say about it? Does he like it like that?

674
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,080
Well,he never mentions it.

675
00:45:15,104 --> 00:45:17,084
那就别听我的
Oh. well,don’t go by me.

676
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:20,108
从你的穿着看  你对服饰打扮压根不在乎
I can see by the way you dress you don’t care a hoot how you look.

677
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:22,089
真奇怪  迈克西姆怎么一点儿不在乎呢
But I wonder Maxim hasn’t been at you. He’s so particular about clothes.

678
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:24,175
他对穿着总是很挑剔的

679
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:26,574
我看他甚至根本不注意我的穿戴
I don’t think he ever notices what I wear.

680
00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:30,432
那么说来  他的性格大概变了
Oh. He must have changed a lot,then.

681
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:35,124
你无需担心老迈克西姆跟他的心情
You mustn’t worry about old Maxim and his moods.

682
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:38,138
没人知道他脑袋瓜里在想什么
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.

683
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:41,172
他经常大发脾气  当他发脾气的时候
Often,he gets into a terrible rage,and when he does...

684
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:44,196
但我觉得他不会对你发脾气
(WHISTLES)

685
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,151
I don’t suppose he’ll lose his temper with you?

686
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:46,177
你是个沉静的小乖乖
You seem such a placid little thing.

687
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:48,565
快走  老太婆  3点我们要去看高尔夫球赛
Come on,old girl.We’ve got to go on the first ten at 3:00.

688
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:49,514
行了  我来了
All right,I’m coming.

689
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,704
再见  迈克西姆老弟
GILES: Well,goodbye,Maxim,old boy.

690
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:54,311
再见  贾尔斯  感谢你的光临  老兄
Goodbye,Giles. Thanks for coming,old boy.

691
00:45:54,312 --> 00:45:57,742
在建  亲爱的  原谅我问了你那么多无礼的问题
Goodbye,my dear. Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.

692
00:45:57,753 --> 00:46:00,150
我们俩真的希望你们会很幸福
We both really hope yon’ll be very happy.

693
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:02,549
谢谢  比阿特丽斯  非常感谢
Thank you,Beatrice,thank you very much.

694
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,260
我得恭喜你迈克西姆现在看起来很开心
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.

695
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:07,658
去年这个时候我们都很担心他
We were very worried about him this time last year.

696
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:11,412
但另一方面  当然  你知道整件事情
But then of course,you know the whole story

697
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:14,436
-再见  比阿特丽斯  亲爱的  -再见  老弟
-MAXIM: Goodbye,Beatrice. -Goodbye,old boy.

698
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:20,901
-再见  -再见
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

699
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,375
谢天谢地他们走了  现在我们可以去散散步了
Well,thank heavens they’ve gone.

700
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,941
Now we can have a walk about the place.

701
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:26,928
看来我们要变落汤鸡了
Looks as though we might have a shower.but you won’t mind that,will you?

702
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,513
但你不会介意吧
No,but wait a minute. I’ll go upstairs and get a coat.

703
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:29,650
不介意  但我要去拿件外套
There’s a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?

704
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:31,641
花房里一大堆胶布雨衣

705
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:34,425
罗伯特  快跑去花房拿件外套
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs.de Winter,will you?

706
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:35,489
给德温特太太  好吗
What do you think of Beatrice?

707
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,419
-你觉得比阿特丽斯怎么样  -我很喜欢她
Oh,I liked her very much,but she kept saying

708
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,651
她说我同她原先想像的不大一样
that I was quite different from what she expected.

709
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:43,633
她想像中的你究竟是什么样子
What the devil did she expect?

710
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:45,212
Oh,someone smarter and more sophisticated,I’m afraid.

711
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,657
我想  她以为我一定既漂亮又老练

712
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:48,951
你喜欢我头发得样子吗
Do you like my hair?

713
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:51,975
你的头发?  当然了  怎么会想到这上头的
Your hair? Yes,of course I do. What’s the matter with it?

714
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,478
没什么  我只不过随口问问
Oh,I don’t know. I just wondered.

715
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,667
你这人真怪
How funny you are.

716
00:46:56,668 --> 00:46:59,577
-谢谢  -必须穿上吗
Thank you.

717
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:02,924
是  当然 不能老像个小孩似的要人关心
-Do I have to put it on? -Yes,certainly,certainly,certainly.

718
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,899
You can’t be too careful with children.

719
00:47:02,925 --> 00:47:06,052
快来  杰斯珀  去溜溜腿  跑掉点脂肪
Come on,Jasper.Come and take some of that fat off.

720
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,001
杰斯珀  这边  不是那边
Jasper! Here. Hot that way! Come here!

721
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,982
过来这边
(MAXIM WHISTLES)

722
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:21,172
那通向哪儿
Where does that lead to?

723
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:23,977
我们过去用来停船的小海湾
Oh,it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.

724
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:25,124
那我们去那儿吧
Oh.let’s go down there.

725
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,950
不  那是个非常无聊的地方  无趣的绵延沙滩
Well,no.It’s a perfectly dull,uninteresting stretch of sand,

726
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:28,878
就像其它沙滩一样
-just like any other. -Oh,please.

727
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,391
-求你了  -好吧
Well,all right.We’ll walk down and take a look if you really want to.

728
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:34,623
如果你真想去的话  那我们就下去看看

729
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,387
(BARKING)

730
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:45,771
是杰斯珀  那儿肯定有什么不对劲  他可能受伤了
That’s Jasper.There must be something wrong.

731
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,492
-不  他没事  -我最好还是过去看看吧
-Perhaps he’s hurt himself. -No,he’s all right,leave him alone.

732
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,694
Don’t you think I’d better go and see?

733
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:51,172
别担心  他不会受伤的
Don’t bother about him,I tell you,he can't come to any harm.

734
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:52,871
他会自己回来的
He’ll find his own way back!

735
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:02,976
杰斯珀  杰斯珀
Jasper!Jasper?

736
00:48:02,988 --> 00:48:05,385
你在这儿啊
Oh,there you are.

737
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,623
(BARKING)

738
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:14,561
你在那儿干吗  杰斯珀  快走  快回家
What do you want in there,Jasper? Come on. Come on home.Let’s go home.

739
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:17,168
我们回家吧  杰斯珀  杰斯
Jasper...

740
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:31,235
我不知道有人住
Oh.

741
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,571
I didn’t know that there was anybody...

742
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:35,301
我认识这条狗  他来自那栋房子
I know that dog.

743
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,242
He comes from the house.

744
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,293
他不是你的狗
He ain’t yours.

745
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,421
对  他是德温特先生的狗
No.He’s Mr.de Winter’s dog.

746
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:42,924
你有什么东西可以拴住他的吗
Have you anything I could tie him with?

747
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:18,274
来  杰斯珀
Come on,Jasper.

748
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:21,506
你不会告诉别人在这儿看到过我吧
You won’t tell anyone you saw me in there,will you?

749
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,487
这房子难道不是你的吗
Don’t you belong on the estate?

750
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:27,439
我什么也没干  我只是在收拾我的贝壳
I weren’t doing nothing.

751
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,461
I was just putting me shells away.

752
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,682
她被大海带走了  是吗
She’s gone in the sea,ain’t she?

753
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:33,393
她再也不会回来了
She’ll never come back no more.

754
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:38,919
对  她永远不会回来了  快走  杰斯珀
No.She’ll never come back.

755
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,964
Come on,Jasper.

756
00:49:58,003 --> 00:50:00,609
迈克西姆  怎么了
Maxim!What’s the matter?

757
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,590
迈克西姆
Maxim!

758
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:07,699
对不起我去了那么久  我找了根绳子拴住杰斯珀
I’m sorry I was such a time,but I had to find a rope for Jasper.

759
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,097
快点  杰斯珀  天哪
Hurry up,Jasper,for heaven’s sake.

760
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:12,799
请等等我  迈克西姆  怎么了  你看起来很生气
Please wait for me. Maxim,what is it? You look so angry.

761
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,416
你知道我不想你去那边  但你非要去
You know I didn’t want you to go there,but you deliberately went.

762
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:16,542
为什么不让我去
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...

763
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:18,544
下面只有一间小屋跟一个奇怪的男人

764
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,047
-你没进去那间小屋吧  -进了  门
-You didn’t go in the cottage,did yon? -Yes,the door was...

765
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:23,862
-别再去那儿了  听见了吗  -为什么
-Don’t go there again,do you hear? -Well,why not?

766
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:24,821
如果你有跟我一样的回忆
Because I hate the place. And if you had my memories,

767
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,886
你就不会去那里  根本连想都不会想
you wouldn’t go there or talk about it or even think about it.

768
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:29,795
怎么回事  对不起  求你了
What’s the matter? Oh,l’m sorry,please.

769
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:34,185
我们该离开  我们原不该再回曼陀丽来
We should have stayed away.

770
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,399
We should never have come back to Manderley.

771
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:38,044
我多蠢
Oh,what a fool I was.

772
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:42,736
我让你难过  我伤害了你
I’ve made you unhappy.Somehow,I’ve hurt you.

773
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:45,864
我无法忍受看到你这个样子
Oh,I can’t bear to see you like this

774
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:48,575
因为我太爱你了
because I love you so much.

775
00:50:49,828 --> 00:50:54,310
真的?  真的?
Do you?

776
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,876
Do you?

777
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:59,524
我把你弄哭了  原谅我
I’ve made you cry.

778
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,553
Forgive me.

779
00:51:03,384 --> 00:51:07,137
有时我貌似会无缘无故发脾气
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.

780
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,037
是吗
Don’t I?

781
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:16,615
走吧  我们回家  喝点茶  把所有事都忘掉
Come,we’ll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.

782
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:18,919
对  把所有事都忘掉
Yes,let’s forget all about it.

783
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,109
给我  让我来牵杰斯珀
Here,let me have Jasper.

784
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,528
-你好  请进  -请别起身  克劳莱先生
-Hello. Come in. -Oh,please don't get up,Mr.Crawley.

785
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,563
我只是想问你前几天说的有关教我做事的
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day

786
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:58,857
话是不是真的
-about showing me the run of things. -Of course I did.

787
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:01,047
-当然是真的  -你现在在干什么
What are you doing now?

788
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,028
通知所有佃户  庆祝
Notifying all the tenants

789
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:05,113
迈克西姆新婚
that in celebration of Maxim’s return with his bride,

790
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:07,094
本周的租金全免
this week’s rent will he free.

791
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,180
是迈克西姆的主意吗
Oh,is that Maxim’s idea?

792
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,282
Oh,yes,all the servants get an extra week’s wages,too.

793
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:11,161
是的  也将多付一周的薪水给所有的佣人
Od,he didn’t tell me.

794
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,246
他没告诉我

795
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:16,896
我可以帮你吗  至少我可以帮忙贴邮票
Can’t I help you? I could at least lick the stamps.

796
00:52:16,897 --> 00:52:19,294
你人真好  坐下吧
Well,that’s terribly nice of you. Won’t you sit down?

797
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:21,276
好  谢谢
Yes,thank you.

798
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,305
前几天我去过沙滩上的小屋
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.

799
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:32,423
有个男人在那儿  一个怪人
There was a man there,a queer sort of person.

800
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:35,979
-杰斯珀一直冲着他叫  -那肯定是本
Jasper kept barking at him.

801
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,482
Oh,yes,it must have been Ben.

802
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,272
不好意思  他并无恶意
Excuse me.He’s quite harmless.

803
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:40,775
有时我们会给他点零活干
We give him odd jobs now and then.

804
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:43,486
那间小屋看起来破旧不堪
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.

805
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,468
为什么不去处理一下呢
Why isn't something done about it?

806
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:49,837
要是迈克西姆有意处理那屋子  我想他会对我说的
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it,he’d tell me.

807
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:53,393
那些都是丽贝卡的东西吗
Are those all Redecca’s things down there?

808
00:52:54,854 --> 00:52:58,398
是的  是的
Yes.

809
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,830
Yes,they are.

810
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:01,213
她用那小屋做什么
What did she use the cottage for?

811
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:03,716
那小屋以前是座船库
The boat used to be moored near there.

812
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:06,010
什么船  她的船后来怎么了
What boat? What happened to it?

813
00:53:06,011 --> 00:53:09,346
她是不是开那艘船出去的时候被淹死的
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?

814
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,863
是的  船翻了  她被海水冲出船舱
Yes. It capsized and sank. She was washed overboard.

815
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:18,210
单独开船出去难道她不怕吗
Wasn’t she afraid to go out like that alone?

816
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:20,713
她什么都不怕
She wasn’t afraid of anything.

817
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,343
他们在哪儿找到她的
Where did they find her?

818
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:32,902
大概2个月之后  大约在离海峡40英里的埃奇库姆附近
Near Edgecombe,

819
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,118
about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.

820
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:37,699
迈克西姆去认尸  那对他来说太可怕了
Maxim went up to identify her.

821
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,707
It was horrible for him.

822
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:40,108
是  肯定
Yes,it must have been.

823
00:53:44,176 --> 00:53:47,094
克劳莱先生  请别对我的好奇心见怪
Mr.Crawley,please don’t think me morbidly curious. It isn’t that.It’s...

824
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:51,161
不是那样的  只是我感到有点处于劣势
It’s just that I feel at such a disadvantage.

825
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:53,142
一直以来  不管什么时候我见到任何人
All the time,whenever I meet anyone,Maxim’s sister or even the servants,

826
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,332
迈克西姆的姐姐  甚至是佣人

827
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,043
我知道他们都在想同一件事
I know they’re all thinking the same thing,

828
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:00,754
他们一直拿我跟丽贝卡比较
that they’re all comparing me with her with Rebecca.

829
00:54:00,755 --> 00:54:02,735
你不该那么想
You mustn’t think that.

830
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:05,447
你跟迈克西姆结婚  我说不上来心里有多高兴
I can’t tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.

831
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:07,845
他的生活因此而整个变了样
It’s going to make all the difference to his life.

832
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:10,556
依我所见  怎么说呢
From my point of view,it’s very refreshing

833
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:13,580
找到一个像你这样完全曼陀丽
to find someone like yourself,

834
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,911
who’s not entirely in tune,shall we say,with Manderley.

835
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:15,979
不搭的人  非常新鲜

836
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,035
你真好  我敢说我曾犯傻过
That’s very sweet of you.

837
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,412
I daresay I’ve been stupid,

838
00:54:20,046 --> 00:54:25,248
我每时每刻总意识到
but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.

839
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,804
美丽  风趣与智慧
Beauty and wit and intelligence,

840
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:32,652
还有  所有那些东西对一个女人来说都很重要
and all the things that are so important in a woman.

841
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:35,061
但你有的那些重要的品质
You have qualities that are just as important,

842
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:37,355
要我说的话  那更重要
more important,if I may say so.

843
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,753
心地善良  待人诚挚
Kindliness and sincerity,

844
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:42,986
还有  如果你不见怪  谦逊端庄
and if you’ll forgive me,modesty,

845
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:44,383
对于一个做丈夫的
mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.

846
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:46,635
比之世界上所有的机智和美貌更重要

847
00:54:46,636 --> 00:54:51,213
任何人都不想活在过去里  尤其是迈克西姆
We,none of us want to live in the past,

848
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,776
Maxim least of all.

849
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:54,966
能否引着大家从往昔的羁缚中挣脱出来  全靠你了
It’s up to you,you know,to lead us away frow it.

850
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:59,243
我保证我再也不会提这事了
Right.

851
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,334
I promise you I won’t bring this up again,

852
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,277
可在结束谈话之前
but before we end this conversation,

853
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:05,092
你能不能如实回答我一个问题
would you answer just one more question?

854
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:10,087
如果我知道  我会尽量回答的
If it's something I’m able to answer,I’ll do my best.

855
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:14,164
告诉我  丽贝卡到底长什么样
Tell we,what was Rebecca really like?

856
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,426
我猜想
I suppose...

857
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:30,223
依我说  她是我有生以来见过的最美的女人
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.

858
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:04,529
-晚上好  迈克西姆 -好
Good evening,Maxim.

859
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,344
蜜月旅行的片子终于送到了
Hello. The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.

860
00:56:07,345 --> 00:56:09,847
你觉得晚餐之前我们能看看吗
Do we have time,do you think,before dinner?

861
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:14,957
你到底对自己做了些什么啊
What on Earth have you done to yourself?

862
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,002
没什么  只是从伦敦订了件新衣服
Oh,nothing. I just ordered a new dress frow London.

863
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,441
我希望你不会介意
I hope you don’t mind.

864
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:23,601
不  只是你觉得那样的东西适合你吗
Oh,no,no. Only,do you think that sort of thing’s right for you?

865
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:26,948
-它看来完全不适合你  -我以为你会喜欢的
-It doesn’t seem your type at all. -I thought you’d like it.

866
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:30,076
还有你对你的头发做什么了
And what have you done to your hair?

867
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:32,266
我明白了
Oh,I see.

868
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:34,768
亲爱的  亲爱的  对不起
Dear,oh,dear.I’m sorry.

869
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:36,854
你看起来可爱极了
You look lovely,lovely.

870
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:39,879
改变一下也很好
It’s very nice,for a change.

871
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:43,737
我们可以看照片了吗
-Shall we see these pictures? -Yes. I'd love to see them.

872
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:46,239
好  我很想看

873
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:56,041
快看  看那张
Look now,look at that.

874
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:59,367
很棒吧  亲爱的  将来我们还能再回到那儿吗
MRS.De WINTER:Wasn’t it wonderful,darling?

875
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,824
Can’t we go back there someday?

876
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:02,297
当然可以 瞧你  那儿
MAXIM:Yes,of course. Of course. Look at you.

877
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:05,947
当我们的子孙看到你如此可爱会非常开心的
Won’t our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?

878
00:57:06,053 --> 00:57:08,450
瞧你
MRS.DE WINTER:Oh,look at you.

879
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,871
(MAXIM LAUGHING)

880
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:10,848
我喜欢那张
MRS.DE WINTER:Oh,I like that.

881
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:12,829
看那张
Look at that.

882
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,540
-是啊  很漂亮  -记得那张吗
MAXIM: Yes,very nice.

883
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,867
-记得  -迈克西姆  我希望我们能永远度蜜月
-Remember that? -MAXIM:Yes.

884
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,132
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever,Maxim.

885
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:23,037
糟糕  见鬼了  等等
Dash it,look.

886
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,769
Hang it.

887
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:26,385
我又跟以前一样接错线了
I’ve threaded it up wrong as usual or something.

888
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:31,286
弗里思  什么事
Yes,Frith. What is it?

889
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:34,310
打扰一下  先生  我可以跟您谈件事吗
Excuse me,sir. May I have a word with you?

890
00:57:34,311 --> 00:57:37,126
好  说吧
Yes. Come in.

891
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:39,211
事关于罗伯特的事  先生
It’s about Robert,sir

892
00:57:39,212 --> 00:57:42,548
他和丹弗斯太太之间闹了点别扭
There’s been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs.Danvers.

893
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:44,633
-天哪  -罗伯特心里很不好受
Oh. dear.

894
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,749
-Robert is very upset. -This is trouble.

895
00:57:44,738 --> 00:57:47,031
真麻烦  什么事
What is it?

896
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,325
丹弗斯太太职责罗伯特
It appears that Mrs.Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament

897
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:51,828
私藏了晨室里一件值钱的摆设
from the morning room.

898
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:55,154
罗伯特矢口否认干过这样的事
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically,sir.

899
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:58,294
-究竟是哪件小摆设  -是那尊爱神瓷塑  先生
-What was the thing,anyway? -China cupid,sir.

900
00:57:58,295 --> 00:58:01,317
天哪  那可是我们家的意见宝贝  是吗
Oh,dear.That’s one of our treasures,isn’t it?

901
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:01,839
告诉丹弗斯太太
Well,tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.

902
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,654
想方设法弄清事实  我肯定不是罗伯特干的
-Tell her I’m sure it wasn’t Robert. -Very good,sir.

903
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:06,635
太好了  先生
Why do they come to me with these things?That’s your job,sweetheart.

904
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:10,076
他们干吗连这种事都来找我  这种事该由你管  亲爱的

905
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:13,204
迈克西姆  我早想告诉你  可是 可是我却忘了
Maxim,I wanted to tell you,but I forgot.

906
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:19,148
-其实是我打碎了爱神瓷塑  -你打碎的?
The fact is,I broke the china cupid.

907
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,404
You broke it?

908
00:58:19,149 --> 00:58:22,370
当你刚才在弗里思面前干吗不这么说呢
Now,why on Earth didn’t you say something about it when Frith was here?

909
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:24,362
我也不知道  我不想这么做
I don’t know. I didn’t like to.

910
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:26,343
我怕他会拿我当傻瓜看
I was afraid he’d think me a fool.

911
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:28,533
这下子他才真会拿你当大傻瓜看呢
He’ll think you much more of a fool now.

912
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:31,036
现在你可得把事情向他和丹弗斯太太讲清楚
You’ll have to explain to him and Mrs.Danvers.

913
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:33,955
-不  你去解释  我上楼去  -别像个小傻瓜似的
Oh,no,Maxim. You do it.I’ll go upstairs.

914
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,839
Don’t be such a littla idiot,darling.

915
00:58:33,956 --> 00:58:36,656
大家会认为你怕他们
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.

916
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,647
完全是一场误会  丹弗斯太太
MAXIM:It’s all a mistake,Mrs.Danvers.

917
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:40,733
看来是德温特太太自己把瓷塑打碎了
Apparently,Mrs.be Winter broke the cupid herself

918
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,714
后来压根把这事给忘了
end forgot to say anything about it.

919
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:46,666
非常抱歉  没想到给罗伯特惹了麻烦
I’m so sorry. I never thought that I’d get Robert into trouble.

920
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:49,284
那摆设还能修补一下吗  夫人
Is it possible to repair the ornament,madam?

921
00:58:49,285 --> 00:58:52,829
怕不行了　已经摔得粉碎
No,I’m afraid it isn’t. It smashed into pieces.

922
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,228
你怎么处理那些碎片的
What did you do with the pieces?

923
00:58:56,897 --> 00:59:01,265
我把它们放进写字桌的抽屉里面了
Well,I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.

924
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,986
瞧德温特夫人那模样
Well,it looks as though Mrs.de Winter was afraid

925
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:06,489
好像你会把她送进监牢似的  丹弗斯太太  对不
you were going to put her in prison,doesn’t it,Mrs. Danvers?

926
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:07,365
找出那些碎片
Well,never mind. Do what you can to find the pieces.

927
00:59:07,366 --> 00:59:10,858
看看能否修好  并且告诉罗伯特擦干眼泪
See if they can be mended,and above all,tell Robert to dry his tears.

928
00:59:10,869 --> 00:59:13,058
我当然要向罗伯特赔个不是
I shall apologize to Robert,of course. Perhaps if such a thing happens again,

929
00:59:13,164 --> 00:59:15,040
要是以后再发生这样的事
Mrs.de Winter will tell me personally.

930
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,594
德温特夫人是不是可以亲口向我讲明
MAXIM:Yes,yes,all right. Thank you,Mrs.Danvers.

931
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:19,315
好了  谢谢  丹弗斯太太

932
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,344
我猜想片段都会完好  我也不知道
Well,I suppose that clip will hold all right. I don’t know.

933
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:35,571
亲爱的  太抱歉了  我真是粗心大意
MRS.DE WINTER:I’m awfully sorry darling.It was very careless of me.

934
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:37,980
丹弗斯太太肯定要对我大发雷霆
-Mrs.Danvers must be furious with me. -Hang Mrs.Danvers.

935
00:59:37,982 --> 00:59:41,005
别管丹弗斯太太  你到底干吗要怕她啊
Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?

936
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:43,403
你的举动哪像个女主人
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something,

937
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:45,488
倒像家里的丫头呢
-not the mistress of the house at all. -Yes. I know I do.

938
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:49,242
我知道  但我感到很不自在

939
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,203
But I feel so uncomfortable.

940
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:52,985
每天我都竭尽全力  但上上下下的人打量着我
I try my best every day,but it’s very difficult with people looking me

941
00:59:52,997 --> 00:59:57,062
就像我是一头得奖的良种母牛
up and down as if I were a prize cow.

942
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:59,148
就算这样  那又何妨
What does it matter if they do? You must remember

943
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:01,129
你必须记住  唯有曼陀丽发生的事
that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.

944
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,110
才能引起人们的兴趣

945
01:00:03,112 --> 01:00:05,822
那我一定使他们大失所望了
What a slap in the aye I must have been to them,then.

946
01:00:05,823 --> 01:00:08,637
你大概是因为这个缘故才跟我结婚的吧
I suppose that’s why you married me,

947
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,661
你知道我这个人呆板无趣  不爱讲话  又没见过世面
because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced,

948
01:00:11,662 --> 01:00:15,092
所以这儿的人就不屑对我蜚短流长了
and there’d never be any gossip about me.

949
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:17,500
蜚短流长?  你这话时什么意思
Gossip?What do you mean?

950
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:20,733
我 我也不知道  我这话没别的意思
I don’t know. I just said it for something to say.

951
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:23,235
你干吗要折服模样
Don’t look at me like that. Maxim.

952
01:00:23,236 --> 01:00:27,198
迈克西姆  怎么了  我说什么了

953
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,367
What’s the matter? What have I said?

954
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:36,677
说这些话  可不怎么悦耳动听  是吗
Wasn’t a very attractive thing to say,was it?

955
01:00:36,688 --> 01:00:40,024
是的  既唐突  又叫人讨厌
No.It was rude,hateful.

956
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,844
我怀疑自己娶你  是不是干了件极其自私的事
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.

957
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,930
你这话是什么意思
How do you mean?

958
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:53,058
我对你可不是个好伴侣  是吗
I’m not much of a companion to you,am I?

959
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:56,395
你并没有得到很多乐趣  是吗
You don’t get much fun,do you?

960
01:00:56,397 --> 01:01:00,566
你应该嫁给一个跟你年龄相仿的小伙子
You ought to have married a boy,someone of your own age.

961
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:04,310
麦克斯曼  你干吗这么讲  我们当然是终生伴侣
Maxim,why do you say this? Of course we’re companions.

962
01:01:04,321 --> 01:01:07,240
是吗  我可不敢说
Ars we? I don't know.

963
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:10,264
我这个人恐怕很难相处
-I’m very difficult to live with. -No,you’re not difficult.

964
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:13,173
不  一点也不难相处
You’re easy,very easy.

965
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:16,416
我们的婚姻是美满的  是天赐良缘
Our marriage is a success,isn’t it,a great success?

966
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:19,857
我们很快活  是吧  非常非常快活
We’re happy,aren’t we? Terribly happy?

967
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,076
如果你认为我们不开心
If you don’t think we are happy,

968
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:33,204
我并不希望你言不由衷
it would be much better if you didn’t pretend.

969
01:01:34,665 --> 01:01:36,645
我会离开的
I’ll go away.

970
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,546
你为什么不回答我
Why don’t you answer me?

971
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:48,324
叫我怎么回答你呢  连我自己也搞不清楚
How can I answer you

972
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,527
when I don’t know the answer myself?

973
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:53,642
如果你说我们是快活的  那就别再往下说了
If you say we’re happy,let’s leave it at that.

974
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,771
我对幸福之事一无所知
Happiness is something I know nothing about.

975
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:05,217
看  那张
Oh,look.There’s the one when I left the camera

976
01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:08,032
我把相机放在三脚架上的时候拍的  记得吗
running on the tripod,remember?

977
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,048
(INAUDIBLE)

978
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:23,100
鉴于庄园事务赴宴伦敦

979
01:02:23,831 --> 01:02:26,322
我会在夜晚前赶回来

980
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:30,149
这没有我的短暂假日应该也很闲适  迈克西姆

981
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:04,236
不好意思  夫人  有什么我能为您效劳的吗
Pardon me,madam. Is there anything I can do for you?

982
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,052
没事  希尔达  非常感谢
I’m all right,Hilda. Thank you very much.

983
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:10,076
我马上去拿三明治  夫人
I’ll bring the sandwiches immediately,madam.

984
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,979
-希尔达  -是的  夫人
-Hilda. -Yes,madam?

985
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,035
西厢没有人再住过了  是吗
The west wing. Nobody ever uses it anymore,do they?

986
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:44,487
没有  夫人  自从德温特太太死后就没人住了
No,madam. Not since the death of Mrs.de Winter.

987
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,954
(DOOR OPENING)

988
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,713
(DOOR CLOSING)

989
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,200
过来  杰克先生  否则有人会看到你的
MRS.DANVERS:Come along,Mr.Jack,or someone may see you.

990
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:11,796
丹尼  老女妖  很高兴再次见到你
FAVELL:Well,Danny old harpy it’s been good to see you again.

991
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:14,935
得知所有消息简直令我窒息
I’ve been simply breathless to pick up all the news.

992
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:18,584
杰克先生  我认为您不该来这里
(BARKING)

993
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,141
MRS.DANVERS: I really don’t think it’s wise for you to come here,Mr.Jack.

994
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:21,608
-杰斯珀  过来  -胡说  就像回家一样
(SOFTLY)Jasper,come here.

995
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,887
FAVELL: Oh,nonsense,nonsense. It’s just like coming back home.

996
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:25,676
-轻一点  杰克先生  -我得小心别惊动了灰姑娘
MRS. DANVERS: Quiet,Mr.Jack.

997
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,683
FAVELL:Yes.We must be careful not to shock Cinderella,mustn’t we?

998
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:26,833
她在晨室
MRS.DANVERS: She’s in the morning room.

999
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:29,419
如果你从花园的门离开  她不会看到你的
If you leave through the garden door,she won’t see you.

1000
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:31,723
我感觉有点像穷亲戚
FAVELL:I must say,I feel a little like the poor relation,

1001
01:04:31,724 --> 01:04:34,122
从后门偷偷离开
sneaking around through back doors.

1002
01:04:34,123 --> 01:04:38,293
-再见  丹尼  -再见  杰克先生  小心点
Well,toodle-oo,Danny

1003
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,537
MRS.DANVERS: Goodbye,Mr.Jack,and please be careful.

1004
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,742
(DOOR CLOSING)

1005
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:43,298
杰斯珀  别出声
(WHINING)

1006
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,616
Jasper,be quiet.

1007
01:04:44,654 --> 01:04:47,677
在找我吗  我没吓着你吧
FAVELL: Looking for me?

1008
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,922
-I didn’t make you jump,did I? -No.

1009
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,702
没有  当然没有  我根本不认识你
Of course not. I didn’t quite know who it was.

1010
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:55,592
很高兴见到我吧  老伙计
Yes.You’re pleased to see me,aren’t you,old boy?

1011
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:59,878
很高兴这个家有人欢迎我回到曼陀丽
I’m glad there’s someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.

1012
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:04,361
亲爱的迈克斯老兄好吗
And how is dear old Max?

1013
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:06,655
很好  谢谢
Very well,thank you.

1014
01:05:06,656 --> 01:05:10,399
我听说他去伦敦了  留下他的小新娘独守空闺
I hear he went up to London,left his little bride all alone.

1015
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,390
这太糟糕了
It’s too bad.

1016
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:16,457
他难道不怕会有人来把你抢走?
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?

1017
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:21,358
丹尼  你百般提防  结果还是枉费心机
Danny,all your precautions were in vain.

1018
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,278
屋子的女主人就躲在门背后呢
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.

1019
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:30,315
怎么不向新娘介绍我
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?

1020
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:34,288
-这位是费弗尔先生  夫人  -你好
This is Mr.Favell.madam.

1021
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,294
How do you do?

1022
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:37,625
你好
How do you do?

1023
01:05:39,295 --> 01:05:41,692
请留在这儿用茶点吧
-Won’t you have some tea or something? -Now,isn’t that a charming invitation?

1024
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:43,882
这样盛情相邀  岂不让人心动

1025
01:05:43,883 --> 01:05:47,521
请我留下用茶点  丹尼  我还真想留下来呢
I’ve been asked to tea,Danny,and I’ve a good mind to accept.

1026
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:49,231
也许你是对的
Oh,well,perhaps you're right. Pity,just when we were getting on so nicely.

1027
01:05:49,232 --> 01:05:51,911
可惜了  我们刚相处地很好

1028
01:05:51,912 --> 01:05:55,133
我们不可以带坏小新娘  对吧  杰斯珀
We mustn’t lead the young bride astray must me,Jasper?

1029
01:05:55,144 --> 01:05:58,584
再见  很高兴见到你
Goodbye.It’s been fun meeting you.

1030
01:05:58,585 --> 01:05:59,481
顺便说一下
Oh,and by the way,it would be very decent of you if you didn’t mention

1031
01:05:59,482 --> 01:06:01,806
要是你不在迈克斯面前提起我来过的事儿

1032
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:05,049
那就太够朋友了
this little visit to your revered husband.

1033
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:07,970
他对我恐怕有点看法
He doesn’t exactly approve of me.

1034
01:06:07,971 --> 01:06:11,306
-好的  -你可真够朋友
-Very well. -That’s very sporting of you.

1035
01:06:11,307 --> 01:06:15,258
我还真希望有个结婚3个月的新娘在家里等着我呢
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.

1036
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,710
我是个孤苦伶仃的光棍
I’m just a lonely old bachelor.

1037
01:06:18,711 --> 01:06:21,108
祝你好运
Fare thee well.

1038
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:24,121
我知道刚介绍错了
Oh,and I know what was wrong with that introduction.

1039
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:28,615
丹尼没告诉你吧  我是丽贝卡喜爱的堂兄
Danny didn’t tell you,did she?

1040
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,648
I am Rebecca’s favorite cousin.

1041
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:32,787
再见
Toodle-oo!

1042
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,096
(WINDOW SLAMMING)

1043
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:32,389
太太  出了什么事
Do you wish anything,madam?

1044
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:40,847
我没想到会在这儿看到你  丹弗斯太太
I didn’t expect to see you,Mrs.Danvers.

1045
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:42,516
我看到一扇窗没关
I noticed that a window wasn’t cloned and I came up to see

1046
01:08:42,517 --> 01:08:44,813
所以我上来看看是不是能把它关严实

1047
01:08:44,814 --> 01:08:46,839
您何必对我说窗子是开着的呢
-if I could fasten it. -Why did you say that?

1048
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,456
我离开屋子前就把窗关上了
I closed it before I left the room. You opened it yourself,didn’t you?

1049
01:08:48,468 --> 01:08:51,912
是您自己开的窗  对吗

1050
01:08:51,912 --> 01:08:55,241
你一直想看看这间房  不是吗  夫人
You’ve always wanted to see this room,haven’t you,madam?

1051
01:08:55,254 --> 01:08:57,967
您干吗以前不叫我领您来看呢
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?

1052
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,994
我每天都准备陪您上这儿来
I was ready to show it to you every day.

1053
01:09:04,962 --> 01:09:07,363
这是个可爱的房间  是吗
It’s a lovely room,isn’t it?

1054
01:09:07,363 --> 01:09:10,076
您从来没有见过这么可爱的房间吧
Loveliest room you’ve ever seen.

1055
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:13,209
一切都照德温特太太喜欢的摆放着
Everything is kept just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.

1056
01:09:13,209 --> 01:09:16,757
自那晚以来所有东西都没变过
Nothing has been altered since that last night.

1057
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,368
来  我带您参观她的衣帽间
Come.I’ll show you her dressing room.

1058
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:23,753
我把她所有的衣服都放在这里
Thin is where I keep all her clothes.

1059
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,243
你想看  不是吗
You would like to see them,wouldn’t you?

1060
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:41,291
感受一下
Feel this.

1061
01:09:41,397 --> 01:09:43,901
那是德温特先生送给她的圣诞礼物
It was a Christmas present from Mr.de Winter.

1062
01:09:47,138 --> 01:09:50,582
他总是送她贵重的礼物  整年都是
He was always giving her expensive gifts,the whole year round.

1063
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,594
我把她的内衣放在这边
I keep her underwear on this side.

1064
01:09:57,787 --> 01:10:01,858
它们是圣克莱儿修道院的修女们专门为她做的
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St.Claire.

1065
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:08,644
我过去一直会等她回来  不管多晚
I always used to wait up for her no matter how late.

1066
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:11,983
有时她跟德・维特先生直到黎明时分才回来
Sometimes she and Mr.de Winter didn’t come home until dawn.

1067
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,133
她宽衣的时候  会告诉我有关她所去的派对的事
While she was undressing,she’d tell me about the party she’d been to.

1068
01:10:18,145 --> 01:10:22,529
她认识的所有相关人员  还有所有爱她的人
She knew everyone that mattered.

1069
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,166
Everyone loved her.

1070
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:27,112
当她洗好澡的时候
When she finished her bath,

1071
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:30,879
会走进卧室  然后走向梳妆台
she’d go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.

1072
01:10:41,007 --> 01:10:43,408
你动过她的梳子  是吗
Oh,you’ve moved her brush,haven’t you? There.That's better.

1073
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:46,748
在这儿  好多了  就像她一直摆放的那样

1074
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:49,558
她会说  "快点  丹尼  梳头发"
Just as she always laid it down.

1075
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,071
“Come on,Danny. Hair drill,” she would say.

1076
01:10:49,568 --> 01:10:54,568
我像这样站在她身后  每次梳20分钟
And I’d stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

1077
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:57,188
然后她会说
And then she would say,“Good night,Danny,”

1078
01:10:57,293 --> 01:11:00,842
"晚安  丹尼"  然后她就上床休息

1079
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,455
and step into her bed.

1080
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:11,699
我亲手为她绣的这个衣套
I embroidered this case for her myself,and I keep it here always.

1081
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:14,101
我一直把它放在这儿

1082
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:24,958
你有见过如此精美的东西吗
Did you ever see anything so delicate?

1083
01:11:38,112 --> 01:11:41,766
瞧  你可以透过它看到我的手
Look. You can see my hand through it.

1084
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:07,134
你不会以为她已经离开很久了吧
You wouldn’t think she’d been gone so long,would you?

1085
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:10,047
有时我沿着这条过道走着走着
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,

1086
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,772
简直觉得她就跟在我身后
I fancy I hear her just behind me.

1087
01:12:12,772 --> 01:12:16,946
听得见她那急促而又轻快的脚步声  我绝不会搞错
That quick light step. I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

1088
01:12:16,948 --> 01:12:21,843
不仅是在这个房间  这栋房的所有房间都一样
Not only in this room,it’s in all the rooms in the house.

1089
01:12:21,855 --> 01:12:24,255
此刻我几乎也能听到
I can almost hear it now.

1090
01:12:26,136 --> 01:12:29,162
你相信死去的人会回来看活着的人吗
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?

1091
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:31,981
不  我不相信
No.I don’t believe it.

1092
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:36,981
有时我真怀疑  她是不是悄悄回到了曼陀丽
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn’t come back here to Manderley,

1093
01:12:36,993 --> 01:12:40,229
注视着您和德温特先生的一举一动呢
and watch you and Mr.de Winter together.

1094
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:47,631
你看起来很累  何不待在这儿休息一会
You look tired.

1095
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,356
Why don’t you stay here a while and rest?

1096
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:50,355
听听大海的声音?
And listen to the sea.

1097
01:12:51,713 --> 01:12:54,426
非常平静
So soothing.

1098
01:12:56,098 --> 01:12:58,080
听
Listen to it.

1099
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:03,509
听
Listen.

1100
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:07,790
听大海的声音
Listen to the sea.

1101
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:39,631
告诉丹弗斯太太我要马上见她
Tell Mrs.Danvers I wish to see her immediately.

1102
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:54,224
德温特夫妇诚邀杰克・费弗尔先生至曼陀丽庄园

1103
01:13:56,377 --> 01:13:58,402
丽贝卡  我会在那儿等你  --杰克

1104
01:14:06,462 --> 01:14:09,060
您叫我吗  夫人
You sent for me,madam?

1105
01:14:09,072 --> 01:14:11,472
是的  丹弗斯太太
Yes,Mrs.Danvers.

1106
01:14:11,473 --> 01:14:13,873
我要你把这些东西都扔掉
I want you to get rid of all these things.

1107
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:15,961
这些是德温特太太的东西
-These are Mrs.de Winter's things. -I am Mrs.de Winter now.

1108
01:14:15,962 --> 01:14:19,302
现在我才是德温特太太

1109
01:14:19,303 --> 01:14:22,434
好  我会照您的指示做的

1110
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,326
Very well.I’ll give the instructions.

1111
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,991
(CAR HONKING)

1112
01:14:26,089 --> 01:14:28,802
请等一下
Just a moment,please.

1113
01:14:30,786 --> 01:14:35,055
丹弗斯太太  我不会告诉德温维特先生有关
Mrs.Danvers,I intend to say nothing to Mr.de Winter

1114
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:36,099
费弗尔先生来访的事
about Mr.Favell’s visit.

1115
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:40,912
事实上  我宁愿忘记一切今天下午所发生的一切
In fact,I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.

1116
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:52,082
迈克西姆  迈克西姆  一整天没看到你了
Maxim,Maxim,you’ve been gone all day.

1117
01:14:52,082 --> 01:14:55,108
你让我喘不过气来了
You’re choking me.

1118
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:58,033
-你都做了些什么  -我在思考呢
Well,well,well,what have you been doing with yourself?

1119
01:14:58,034 --> 01:15:01,688
-思考什么  -进去我再告诉你
-I’ve been thinking. -What did you want to do that for?

1120
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,448
Come in here and I’ll tell you.

1121
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:05,759
亲爱的  我们可以举行一场化妆舞会吗
Darling,could we have a costume ball just as you used to?

1122
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,682
就像以往一样

1123
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:11,292
怎么会有这个想法
Now what put that into your mind?

1124
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:13,274
比阿特丽斯给你洗脑了?
Has Beatrice been at you?

1125
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,990
不  不是  但我感觉我们应该做些什么
No,no,but I feel that we ought to do something

1126
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:19,748
使人们觉得曼陀丽跟以往一样
to make people feel that Manderley is just the name as it always was.

1127
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:24,131
求你了  亲爱的  可以吗
Ok,please,darling,could we?

1128
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:28,830
你不知道那意味着什么
You don’t know what it would mean,you know.

1129
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:32,796
我要招待数百人  全国的人
You’d have to be hostess to hundreds of people,all the county.

1130
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:34,488
还有很多年轻人会从伦敦赶来
And a lot of young people would come up from London,

1131
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:36,546
会将房子变成夜总会那样
-and turn the house into a nightclub. -Oh,yes. But I want to. Please.

1132
01:15:36,556 --> 01:15:38,852
知道  但我想要嘛  求你了

1133
01:15:38,853 --> 01:15:41,879
我从未参加过大型派对  但我可以学习怎么做
I’ve never been to a large party,but I could learn what to do.

1134
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:44,907
并且我向你保证  我不会让你丢脸的
And I promise you,you wouldn’t be ashamed of me.

1135
01:15:52,842 --> 01:15:54,929
好吧  如果你觉得你会喜欢的话
All right,if you think you’d enjoy it.

1136
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,434
你最好让丹弗斯太太来帮忙  好吗
You’d better get Mrs.Danvers to help you out,won’t you?

1137
01:15:57,541 --> 01:16:00,045
不  不用  我不需要丹弗斯太太帮我
No,so.I don’t need Mrs.Danvers to help me. I can do it myself.

1138
01:16:00,045 --> 01:16:02,341
-我可以自己搞定  -好吧  我的心肝

1139
01:16:02,342 --> 01:16:05,358
谢谢  亲爱的  谢谢
All right,my sweet.

1140
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,800
Thank you,darling.Thank you.

1141
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:08,919
-你会打扮成什么  -我从不打扮

1142
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,320
那是作为主人的特权
-What’ll you go as? -I never dress up.

1143
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,222
That’s the one privilege I claim as the host.

1144
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,405
你会打扮成什么
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland,with that ribbon around your hair?

1145
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,347
漫游仙境里头发扎着缎带的爱丽丝吗

1146
01:16:14,348 --> 01:16:16,330
不告诉你  我会亲自设计我的服装
No,I won’t tell you.

1147
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:18,419
给你一个终身难忘的惊喜
I’ll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.

1148
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:37,105
请进
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1149
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,256
Come in.

1150
01:16:41,283 --> 01:16:43,892
罗伯特在藏书室发现了这些画稿  夫人
Robert found these sketches in the library,madam.

1151
01:16:43,893 --> 01:16:46,606
-你打算把它们扔掉吗  -是的  丹弗斯太太
-Did you intend throwing them away? -Yes,Mrs.Danvers,I did.

1152
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:49,623
它们只是我为舞会服装画的设计稿
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.

1153
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,826
德温特先生没有给你什么建议吗
Hasn’t Mr.de Winter suggested anything?

1154
01:16:51,826 --> 01:16:54,749
没有  我要给他惊喜  不想让他知道
No,I want to surprise him. I don’t want him to know anything about it.

1155
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,567
我只不过想也许
I merely thought that you might find a costume

1156
01:16:57,569 --> 01:17:00,074
在家族肖像画中你会找到适合你的服装
among the family portraits that would suit you.

1157
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,729
你是说挂在楼梯边上的那些画吗  我去瞧瞧
Oh,you mean those at the top of the stairs?I’ll go and look at them.

1158
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:15,095
比如这幅  也许它是为你量身订做的
This one,for instance. Might have been designed for you.

1159
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,508
我肯定你能如法炮制一件
I’m sure you could have it copied.

1160
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:18,216
我听德温特先生讲过
I’ve heard Mr.de Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.

1161
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:21,568
这幅是所有油画里他最喜欢的一幅

1162
01:17:21,581 --> 01:17:24,712
这位是卡洛琳・德温特夫人  他的一位祖先
It’s Lady Caroline de Winter,one of his ancestors.

1163
01:17:24,712 --> 01:17:28,062
真是个好主意  丹弗斯太太
Oh,well,that’s a splendid idea,Mrs.Danvers.I’m very grateful.

1164
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:29,618
不胜感激

1165
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,476
-一切尽在掌控之中吗  弗里思  -是的  先生  谢谢
-Everything under control,Frith? -Yes,sir,thank you.

1166
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:03,223
抱歉问一句  先生  你是要扮演一位校长吗
Excuse me,sir,are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?

1167
01:18:03,234 --> 01:18:05,738
不是  这件只是我的旧方帽长袍
Oh,no. This is just my old cap and gown.

1168

1298
01:27:26,394 --> 01:27:29,105
让我做你的朋友和伙伴吧
I’ll be your friend,your companion. I’ll be happy with that.

1299
01:27:29,105 --> 01:27:31,712
那样我就很开心了

1300
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:40,471
你很爱我  对吗
You love me very much,don’t you?

1301
01:27:44,537 --> 01:27:47,144
一切都晚了  宝贝
But it’s too late,my darling.

1302
01:27:48,604 --> 01:27:51,523
我们失去了绝无仅有的过幸福日子的机会
We’ve lost our little chance of happiness.

1303
01:27:51,523 --> 01:27:55,590
-不  迈克西姆  不  -是的  现在一切都结束了
-No,Maxim,no. -Yes.

1304
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,972
It’s all over now.

1305
01:27:57,154 --> 01:27:59,657
事情终于发生了
The thing’s happened.

1306
01:27:59,657 --> 01:28:02,774
一直在我料想中的事
The thing I have dreaded day after day.

1307
01:28:02,785 --> 01:28:04,870
日复一日  夜复一夜
-Night after night. -Maxiw,what are you trying to tell me?

1308
01:28:04,974 --> 01:28:07,685
迈克西姆  你在说些什么

1309
01:28:09,145 --> 01:28:12,065
丽贝卡得胜了
Rebecca has won.

1310
01:28:13,942 --> 01:28:17,164
她的幽灵老是在你我之间徘徊
Her shadow has been between us all the time,keeping us from one another.

1311
01:28:17,174 --> 01:28:19,260
阻止我们在一起

1312
01:28:20,615 --> 01:28:23,535
她知道这事会发生
She knew that this would happen.

1313
01:28:23,535 --> 01:28:25,933
你在说什么啊
What are you saying?

1314
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:30,406
他们派了一个潜水员下去  他找到了另一艘船
They sent a diver down.

1315
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,757
-He found another boat. -Yes,I know. Frank told me.

1316
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:33,962
我知道  弗兰克告诉我了  是丽贝卡的船

1317
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:36,467
Rebecca’s boat. Oh,it’s terrible for you.I’m so sorry.

1318
01:28:33,962 --> 01:28:37,184
那对你来说太残酷了  对不起

1319
01:28:37,194 --> 01:28:40,009
潜水员还有另外一个发现
The diver made another discovery.

1320
01:28:40,009 --> 01:28:43,242
他弄破其中一个舱口  检查了船舱
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.

1321
01:28:44,597 --> 01:28:46,891
里面有一具尸体
There was a body in there.

1322
01:28:46,891 --> 01:28:49,081
因此她并不是单独出海的
She wasn’t alone. There was someone sailing with her,

1323
01:28:49,185 --> 01:28:51,219
这说明当时她和另一个人一起出航
and you have to find out who it was,that’s it,isn’t it,Maxim?

1324
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:52,418
你现在得查明这人是谁

1325
01:28:52,418 --> 01:28:54,503
就时这么一回事  对吗  迈克西姆
You don’t understand. There was no one with her.

1326
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:58,768
你不明白  没人跟她一起出海

1327
01:28:58,778 --> 01:29:02,636
躺在船舱板上的是丽贝卡的尸体
It’s Rebecca’s body lying there on the cabin floor.

1328
01:29:03,992 --> 01:29:06,390
不
Oh,no.

1329
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,310
被冲上埃奇库姆海岸的女人
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe,

1330
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:12,646
现在埋葬在家族墓地里的那个女人
the woman that is now buried in the family crypt,

1331
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:14,940
不是丽贝卡
that was not Rebecca.

1332
01:29:15,044 --> 01:29:18,277
那是一个没人认领的无名女尸
That was the body of some unknown woman,

1333
01:29:18,277 --> 01:29:21,916
不知属于何方的女人尸体
unclaimed,belonging nowhere.

1334
01:29:21,926 --> 01:29:26,608
我认的尸  但我知道那不是丽贝卡
I identified it. But I knew it wasn’t Rebecca.

1335
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:29,017
一切都是谎言
It wan all a lie.

1336
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:34,126
我知道丽贝卡的尸体在哪里
I knew where Rebecca’s body was,

1337
01:29:34,126 --> 01:29:37,880
陈尸于海底的船舱板上
lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.

1338
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,174
你怎么知道的  迈克西姆
How did you know,Maxim?

1339
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:44,762
因为是我放在那儿的
Because I put it there.

1340
01:29:52,582 --> 01:29:56,127
现在你还能看着我的眼睛  告诉我你爱我吗
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?

1341
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:12,081
你看  我没说错
Yon see? I was right.

1342
01:30:14,062 --> 01:30:16,147
太晚了
It’s too late.

1343
01:30:21,986 --> 01:30:25,104
什么太晚了  不许再说这话
No,it’s not too late. You’re not to say that.

1344
01:30:25,115 --> 01:30:27,721
我爱你胜过世间的一切
I love you more than anything in thu world.

1345
01:30:27,826 --> 01:30:30,224
求你了  迈克西姆  吻我  求你了
-Oh,please,Maxim,kiss me,please. -No.

1346
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:33,978
不  没用了  太迟了
It’s no use.It’s too late.

1347
01:30:33,978 --> 01:30:36,480
现在我们不能失去彼此
Oh,we can’t lose each other now. We must be together always.

1348
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,598
我们必须永远在一起  没有秘密  没有阴影
No secrets,no shadows.

1349
01:30:39,608 --> 01:30:42,632
我们可能只剩几天  几个小时
We may only have a few days,a few hours.

1350
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:44,916
迈克西姆  你之前为什么不告诉我
Maxim,why didn’t you tell me before?

1351
01:30:44,926 --> 01:30:47,950
有时我差点就讲出来了  但你那时的态度太冷漠
I nearly did sometimes,but you never seemed close enough.

1352
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:51,693
我看出你在想念丽贝卡  还叫我怎么跟你亲热
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?

1353
01:30:51,704 --> 01:30:55,562
我看出你仍然爱着丽贝卡  怎么能要你再来爱我
How could I even ask you to love me,when I knew you Rebecca still?

1354
01:30:57,021 --> 01:31:01,714
你在胡说些什么  你这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

1355
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:01,861
What do you mean?

1356
01:31:03,278 --> 01:31:07,751
每当你抚摸我的时候  我就想  你在拿我和丽贝卡相比
Whenever you touched me,I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.

1357
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:10,608
每当你对我说话  每当你看着我
Whenever you looked at we or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,

1358
01:31:10,608 --> 01:31:12,443
或是同我一起在花园散步

1359
01:31:12,454 --> 01:31:14,539
我知道你在想
I knew you were thinking,“This I did with Rebecca,and this,and this.”

1360
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:17,876
"我曾跟丽贝卡做过此事"

1361
01:31:17,876 --> 01:31:19,857
我说的不对吗
Oh it’s true,isn’t it?

1362
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:23,611
你以为我爱丽贝卡?  你这么认为?
You thought I loved Rebecca? You thought that?

1363
01:31:26,217 --> 01:31:28,198
我恨她
I hated her.

1364
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:42,786
我曾为她着迷
Oh,I was carried away by her,enchanted by her as everyone was.

1365
01:31:42,796 --> 01:31:45,507
为她心醉  跟所有人一样

1366
01:31:45,507 --> 01:31:50,304
我娶她的时候  别人都说我是世界上最幸运的男人
And when I was married,I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.

1367
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:55,622
她长得那么美
She was so lovely,so accomplished,

1368
01:31:55,622 --> 01:31:58,854
很聪明  很风趣

1369
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:58,668
so amusing.

1370
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:02,253
大家都说
“She’s got the three things that really matter in a wife,”everyone said.

1371
01:32:02,253 --> 01:32:03,223
"一个妻子得有三种美德"
“Breeding brains and beauty.”

1372
01:32:03,234 --> 01:32:05,840
"教养  头脑和姿色"

1373
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,073
我完全相信了他们的话
And I believed them. Completely.

1374
01:32:10,532 --> 01:32:13,661
但跟她在一起我从未有过幸福的时刻
But I never had a moment’s happiness with her.

1375
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,476
她不懂爱
She was incapable of love

1376
01:32:16,476 --> 01:32:20,021
或是温柔或是宽容
or tenderness

1377
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,815
or decency.

1378
01:32:21,377 --> 01:32:24,494
你不爱她?  你不爱她?
You didn’t love her. You didn’t love her.

1379
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:29,197
还记得那天我开车带你上蒙特卡洛山顶的情景吗
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?

1380
01:32:29,197 --> 01:32:32,638
我曾跟丽贝卡一起到那儿度蜜月
Well. I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.

1381
01:32:32,638 --> 01:32:35,453
那就是我们相遇的地方
That’s where I found out about her,four days after we were married.

1382
01:32:35,453 --> 01:32:38,373
4天后我们就结婚了

1383
01:32:38,477 --> 01:32:40,980
她站在那儿笑
She stood there laughing,her black hair blowing in the wind

1384
01:32:41,084 --> 01:32:43,586
她的一头黑发在风中吹起

1385
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:46,714
告诉我所有有关她的事
and told me all about herself.Everything.

1386
01:32:46,714 --> 01:32:48,696
所有事

1387
01:32:50,677 --> 01:32:53,899
我绝不会告诉别人
Things I’ll never tell a living soul.

1388
01:32:53,909 --> 01:32:55,890
我想要杀了她
I wanted to kill her.

1389
01:32:56,099 --> 01:32:59,018
那太容易了  记得那个悬崖吗
It would have been so easy.You remember the precipice?

1390
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,369
我吓到你了  对吧  你以为我疯了
I frightened you,didn’t I? You thought I was mad.

1391
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,924
说不定我也确实是个疯子
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.

1392
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:13,721
跟魔鬼一起生活的人神智不可能健全  对吗
It wouldn’t make for sanity,would it? Living with the devil?

1393
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:19,560
她说"我要跟你做笔交易"
“I’ll make a bargain with you,” she said.

1394
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,270
"刚结婚4天你就想跟我离婚"
“You’d look rather foolish trying to divorce me now

1395
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,199
"你看来相当的愚蠢"
after four days of marriage,

1396
01:33:23,209 --> 01:33:25,149
"所以我会扮演一位贤妻"
so I’ll play the part of a devoted wife,

1397
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:26,963
"你珍贵的曼陀丽庄园的女主人"
mistress of your precious Manderley.

1398
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:27,797
"只要你愿意
I’ll make it the most famous showplace is England,if you like,

1399
01:33:27,797 --> 01:33:30,091
我可以使这所宅子成为全国首屈一指的闻名去处"

1400
01:33:30,091 --> 01:33:32,385
"人们会跑来做客  羡慕我们 "
and people will visit us and envy us,

1401
01:33:32,385 --> 01:33:35,409
"在背地议论说我们俩是全英国最幸运  最美满的一对"
and say we’re the luckiest,happiest couple is the courtry.

1402
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:40,414
"多大的愚弄  同时又是多大的成功"
What a grand joke it’ll be. What a triumph,”

1403
01:33:45,002 --> 01:33:49,277
我不该接受她那肮脏的交易  可我还是接受了
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain,but I did.

1404
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:55,002
当时我过于年轻气盛  太过于在乎家族荣誉
I was younger then,and tremendously conscious of the family honor.

1405
01:33:55,012 --> 01:33:58,453
家族荣誉
Family honor.

1406
01:33:58,453 --> 01:34:00,434
她知道我宁愿牺牲一切
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court

1407
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:02,519
也不要站在离婚法庭上

1408
01:34:02,519 --> 01:34:05,960
抛弃她  承认我们的婚姻是一场诈欺婚姻
and give her away,admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.

1409
01:34:08,671 --> 01:34:12,415
你鄙弃我  是吗  连我自己都鄙弃我自己
You despise me,don’t you?

1410
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:11,638
As I despise myself

1411
01:34:12,425 --> 01:34:17,743
你无法明白我什么感受  你能吗
You can’t understand what my feelings were,

1412
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:16,973
can you?

1413
01:34:19,307 --> 01:34:22,227
我当然能明白  亲爱的  我当然明白
Of course I can,darling. Of course I can.

1414
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,951
我遵守协议  显然她也是
Well,I kept the bargain and so did she,apparently.

1415
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:30,568
她非常遵守游戏规则
Oh,she played the game brilliantly,

1416
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:33,592
但不久  她慢慢地放肆起来
but after a while,she began to grow careless.

1417
01:34:33,592 --> 01:34:37,023
她在伦敦买了一套公寓  定期会在那儿住几天
She took a flat in London,and she'd stay away for days at a time.

1418
01:34:37,033 --> 01:34:39,744
她开始把自己的一帮狐群狗党请到这儿来
Then she started to bring her friends down here.

1419
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:42,142
我向她提出过警告   她却毫不在意地一耸肩
I warned her,but she shrugged her shoulders.

1420
01:34:42,142 --> 01:34:44,541
说"这跟你有什么关系"
“What’s it got to do with you?” she said.

1421
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:49,327
后来她竟同弗兰克调起情来  可怜的  忠实朋友
She even started on Frank.

1422
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:47,962
Poor,faithful Frank.

1423
01:34:49,337 --> 01:34:53,404
她有个表哥  此人名叫费弗尔
Then there was a cousin of hers,a man named Favell.

1424
01:34:53,404 --> 01:34:56,834
我认识这个人  你去伦敦那天他来过
Yes. I know him. He came the day you went to London.

1425
01:34:56,845 --> 01:34:59,451
干吗不告诉我
Why didn’t you tell me?

1426
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:04,863
我不想告诉你  我怕一说又会惹起你对丽贝卡的回忆
I didn’t like to.

1427
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,770
I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.

1428
01:35:04,873 --> 01:35:08,314
惹起我的回忆?
Remind me?

1429
01:35:08,314 --> 01:35:11,432
难道我还要别人来惹起回忆吗
As if I needed reminding.

1430
01:35:11,443 --> 01:35:14,675
费弗尔常常来这间小屋探望她
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.

1431
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:17,386
我发现了此事  又一次提出警告
I found out about it,and I warmed her that if he come here again,

1432
01:35:17,386 --> 01:35:20,410
如果他再来这儿  我会开枪打死他们俩
I’d shoot them both.

1433
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:24,779
某夜当我发现她悄悄从伦敦回来的时候
One night,when I found she had come back quietly from London,

1434
01:35:24,789 --> 01:35:26,875
我以为费弗尔跟她在一起
I thought that Favell was with her,

1435
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:29,002
我知道我已无法再忍受
and I knew then that I couldn’t stand

1436
01:35:29,002 --> 01:35:31,880
这种充满污秽和欺诈的生活
this life of filth and deceit any longer.

1437
01:35:33,235 --> 01:35:37,510
我决定过来跟他们俩同归于尽
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.

1438
01:35:39,387 --> 01:35:41,368
但她独自一人
But she was alone.

1439
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:44,392
她在盼望费弗尔的到来  但他没有
She was expecting Favell,but he hadn’t come.

1440
01:35:44,392 --> 01:35:46,686
她躺在长沙发椅上
She was lying on the divan,a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.

1441
01:35:46,686 --> 01:35:50,127
一大盘掐灭的的烟头放在她旁边

1442
01:35:50,127 --> 01:35:53,140
她看上去生病了  不舒服
She looked ill,queer.

1443
01:35:53,151 --> 01:35:55,549
她突然起身
Suddenly,she got up,started to walk toward me.

1444
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:58,364
开始向我走来

1445
01:35:58,364 --> 01:36:00,658
她说  "假如我有个孩子"
“When I have a child,”she said,“neither you nor anyone else

1446
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:03,891
"你跟我都无法证明孩子不是你生的"
could ever prove it wasn’t yours.

1447
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:06,571
"迈克斯  你想要个继承人  不是吗"
You would like to have an heir,wouldn’t you,Max,

1448
01:36:06,571 --> 01:36:08,364
"为了你钟爱的曼陀丽"
for your precious Manderley?”

1449
01:36:08,374 --> 01:36:10,356
她开始放声大笑
Then she started to laugh.

1450
01:36:10,356 --> 01:36:13,901
"多有趣  真是有趣到极点  妙不可言"
“How funny.How supremely,wonderfully funny.

1451
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,684
"我将做一个十全十美的良母
I’ll be the perfect mother,just as I’ve been the perfect wife.

1452
01:36:15,684 --> 01:36:17,238
就像我是个十全十美的贤妻"
No one will ever know.

1453
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:19,323
"谁也不会了解事实真相"
It ought to give you the thrill of your life,Max,

1454
01:36:19,323 --> 01:36:21,825
"那应该会使你的生活充满恐惧  迈克斯"
to watch my son grow bigger day by day

1455
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:24,526
"看着我的儿子一天天长大 "

1456
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:28,603
"一旦你死了  这一切将全部都归他所有"
and to know that when you die,Manderley will be his.”

1457
01:36:28,603 --> 01:36:31,835
她面对着我
She was face to face with me.

1458
01:36:31,835 --> 01:36:34,328
一只手插在口袋里
One hand is her pocket,the other holding a cigarette.

1459
01:36:34,338 --> 01:36:37,258
另一只手拿着香烟

1460
01:36:36,632 --> 01:36:38,927
微笑着
She was smiling.

1461
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:42,891
"迈克斯  你将会怎么做"
“Well,Max?

1462
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:43,290
What are you going to do about it?

1463
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:47,275
"难道你要杀了我吗"
Aren’t you going to kill me?”

1464
01:36:48,841 --> 01:36:51,345
我猜想那一刻我失去理智了
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1465
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:55,414
我必须打她
I must have struck her.

1466
01:36:58,858 --> 01:37:01,675
她站在那儿盯着我
She stood staring at me.

1467
01:37:01,677 --> 01:37:04,807
她看起来几近得意洋洋
She looked almost triumphant.

1468
01:37:06,372 --> 01:37:10,535
然后她又开始微笑着向我走来
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.

1469
01:37:10,547 --> 01:37:13,259
突然她绊倒了
Suddenly,she stumbled and fell.

1470
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:20,981
过了很久  当我低头看的时候
When I looked down,

1471
01:37:20,982 --> 01:37:23,371
好像 她正躺在地上
ages afterwards,it seemed,she was lying on the floor.

1472
01:37:23,383 --> 01:37:28,287
她将她的头往一块很重的船用索具上撞
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship’s tackle.

1473
01:37:30,271 --> 01:37:34,340
我依然记得当时纳闷她为何仍然在微笑
I rememder wondering why she was still smilling.

1474
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,530
然后我才意识到她已经死了
Then I realized she was dead.

1475
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:39,766
但你没有杀她  那是一场意外
But you didn’t kill her.It was an accident.

1476
01:37:39,767 --> 01:37:44,242
谁会相信我  我不知所措
Who would believe me?

1477
01:37:44,254 --> 01:37:47,895
我只知道我得做些什么事  任何事
I lost my head.

1478
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,684
I just knew I had to do something. Anything.

1479
01:37:47,906 --> 01:37:51,141
我把她的尸体拖上了船
I carried her out to the boat.

1480
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:55,095
外面一片漆黑  那晚上没有月光
It was very dark. There was no moon.

1481
01:37:55,107 --> 01:37:57,611
我把她的尸体拖进船舱
I put her in the cabin.

1482
01:37:57,612 --> 01:37:59,928
当船看起来离岸有一段安全距离的时候
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore,I took a spike,

1483
01:37:59,928 --> 01:38:00,428
我拿了一枚大钉
and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.

1484
01:38:00,428 --> 01:38:03,443
然后一直猛击船板

1485
01:38:03,455 --> 01:38:06,784
我打开通海阀  水开始快速流进来
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.

1486
01:38:06,795 --> 01:38:10,029
我爬进小船里  划走
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.

1487
01:38:10,031 --> 01:38:14,830
我看着船倾斜 下沉
I saw the boat heel over

1488
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:15,253
and sink.

1489
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:20,569
我折回到小海湾
I pulled back into the cove.

1490
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:23,282
天开始下雨
It started raining.

1491
01:38:23,282 --> 01:38:26,099
迈克西姆  有别人知道这事吗
-Maxim,does anyone else know of this? -No. No one except you and me.

1492
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:28,813
没有  除了你跟我  没人知道

1493
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:32,153
我们必须去解释清楚
We must explain it.

1494
01:38:32,154 --> 01:38:35,492
因为那具尸体你之前从未见过
It’s got to be the body of someone you’ve never seen before.

1495
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:37,475
不  他们一定认识她
No,they’re bound to know her. Her rings,bracelets she always wore.

1496
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:40,605
她一直戴的戒指  手镯

1497
01:38:40,607 --> 01:38:45,396
他们会认出她的尸体  然后他们会记起另一个女人
They’ll identify her body then they’ll remember the other woman.

1498
01:38:45,407 --> 01:38:48,735
另一个埋葬在墓地里的女人
The other woman buried in the crypt.

1499
01:38:48,746 --> 01:38:51,041
如果他们发现那是丽贝卡
If they find out it was Rebecca,

1500
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:54,381
你必须说你认错尸了
you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.

1501
01:38:54,382 --> 01:38:56,062
因为你去埃奇库姆的那天  你正发病
That the day you went to Edgecombe,you were ill,

1502
01:38:56,062 --> 01:38:57,407
不能对自己的所作所为负责
you didn’t know what you were doind.

1503
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,703
丽贝卡已死  那才是我们要记住的事
Rebecca’s dead.That’s what we’ve got to rememdar.Rebecca’s dead.

1504
01:38:59,703 --> 01:39:01,790
丽贝卡已死  她无法再开口讲话
She can't speak. She can't bear witness. She can't harm you anymore.

1505
01:39:01,792 --> 01:39:04,087
死无对证  她无法再伤害你了

1506
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:07,217
天知地知  你知我知
We’re the only two people in the worlh thet know,Maxiw,yon and I.

1507
01:39:07,217 --> 01:39:10,754
我曾告诉过你  娶你为妻  是我多么自私的行为
I'd told you once that I’d done a selfish thing in marrying you.

1508
01:39:10,766 --> 01:39:13,791
现在你能明白什么意思了
You can understand now what I meant.

1509
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,817
我爱你  亲爱的
I’ve loved you,my darling.

1510
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:19,010
我会永远爱你
I shall always love you,

1511
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:24,008
但我自始至终都知道丽贝卡最终会赢
but I’ve known all along

1512
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,613
that Rebecca would win in the end.

1513
01:39:24,018 --> 01:39:26,417
不  不  她没有赢
No. no. She hasn't won.

1514
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:29,967
不管现在发生什么事  她都没有赢
No matter what happens now,she hasn’t won.

1515
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,205
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1516
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:46,141
喂?  喂
Hello?

1517
01:39:47,396 --> 01:39:50,943
喂  弗兰克  喂  弗兰克  是
Hello. Frank.

1518
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,393
Hello,Frank. Yes.

1519
01:39:51,047 --> 01:39:53,655
谁  卡洛祖兰?
Who? Colonel Julyan?

1520
01:39:53,656 --> 01:39:57,933
告诉他我会尽快去那儿见他
Yes. Tell him I’ll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.

1521
01:39:57,935 --> 01:40:01,587
什么
What?

1522
01:40:01,587 --> 01:40:06,699
就说等我们确定事态后再谈
Well...

1523
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,448
Say we could talk about that when we’re sure about the matter.

1524
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,649
怎么了
What’s happened?

1525
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:17,438
卡洛祖兰召见  他是国家郡警察局长
Colonel Julyan called.

1526
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,500
He’s the chief constable of the county.

1527
01:40:17,449 --> 01:40:20,996
他被警察局请去停尸间
He’s been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.

1528
01:40:20,998 --> 01:40:25,171
他想知道我是否有可能认错了
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake

1529
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:27,466
那具尸体
about that other body.

1530
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:48,505
卡洛祖兰
Well,Colonel Julyan,apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.

1531
01:40:48,507 --> 01:40:51,668
显然我是认错尸体了

1532
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,599
在那种情况之下  弄错很自然
Tha mistake was natural under the circumstances.

1533
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,043
-再说  那时你状态不好  -我当时状态很好
-Besides,you weren’t well at the time. -That’s nonsense. I was perfectly well.

1534
01:40:58,044 --> 01:41:00,235
别担心  迈克西姆
Don’t let it worry you,Maxim. Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.

1535
01:41:00,235 --> 01:41:02,947
没人会因你搞错而责怪你

1536
01:41:03,052 --> 01:41:06,798
可惜的是  你得重新经受同样的事
The pity is,you’ve got to go through the same thing all over again.

1537
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:09,941
-什么意思  -理所当然  将会有另一次审讯
What do you mean?

1538
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:11,138
There’ll have to be another inquest,of course. Same formality and red tape.

1539
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:12,861
同样的手续跟繁杂的公事程序

1540
01:41:12,863 --> 01:41:14,752
我希望你可以避免公众对它的主意
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it,but I’m afraid that's impossible.

1541
01:41:14,752 --> 01:41:16,086
但我恐怕那很难办到
Oh,yes,publicity.

1542
01:41:16,098 --> 01:41:18,601
对  公众的主意

1543
01:41:18,601 --> 01:41:21,418
我猜想德温特太太走下甲板去拿东西
I suppose Mrs.de Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat

1544
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:24,759
然后无人掌舵的船遭遇飓风
with nobody at the helm.

1545
01:41:24,759 --> 01:41:27,983
我猜想是那么回事  你觉得呢  克劳莱
I imagine that’s about the solution now,don’t you think so,Crawley?

1546
01:41:27,995 --> 01:41:31,438
是的  可能门卡住了  她无法再回到甲板上
Oh,yes. Probably the door jammed,and she couldn't get on deck again.

1547
01:41:31,438 --> 01:41:33,420
对  泰伯  那个造船的人
Yeah.

1548
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:35,078
Tabb,the boat builder,will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.

1549
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,924
毫无疑问会得出一些这样的结论

1550
01:41:35,926 --> 01:41:38,534
为什么  他会知道些什么
Why,what would he know about it?

1551
01:41:38,535 --> 01:41:40,517
他现在在检查船只
Well,he’s examining the boat now. Purely as a matter of routine,you know.

1552
01:41:40,621 --> 01:41:42,708
完全按照惯例

1553
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:46,673
明天我会进行审讯  迈克西姆  完全非正式的
I’ll be at the inquest tomorrow,Maxim,quite unofficially,you know.

1554
01:41:46,674 --> 01:41:49,689
等所有事都结束了  我们必须一起打场高尔夫
We must get together for a game of golf when it’s all over,eh?

1555
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:51,892
-好  -再见
Bys-bye.

1556
01:42:04,205 --> 01:42:06,500
我有晚报  夫人
I have the evening papers,madam. Would you care to see them?

1557
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:08,797
-要看看吗  -不  谢谢  弗里思
Oh,no thank you,Frith,

1558
01:42:08,902 --> 01:42:11,614
还有我想德温特先生也不会想看
and I prefer that Mr.de Winter weren’t troubled with them,either.

1559
01:42:11,615 --> 01:42:12,459
明白  夫人
I understand,madaw. Permit me to say that we’re all most distressed outside.

1560
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,944
请允许我说句话  我们都承受着外界最巨大的困扰

1561
01:42:14,955 --> 01:42:16,122
谢谢  弗里思
Thank you,Frith.

1562
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:18,919
恐怕那些新闻使丹弗斯太太受惊了
I’m afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.

1563
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,424
是啊  我多少预料到了
Yes,I rather expected it would be.

1564
01:42:21,426 --> 01:42:24,242
好像有一场验尸官审讯会  夫人
It seems there’s to be a coroner’s inquest,madam?

1565
01:42:24,242 --> 01:42:26,954
是的  弗里思  完全出于形式的审讯
Yes,Frith.It’s purely a formality

1566
01:42:26,955 --> 01:42:29,563
当然  夫人  我  我想说
Of course,madam. I...

1567
01:42:29,565 --> 01:42:32,486
如果我们任何人可能被传唤取证
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give avidence,

1568
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:35,825
我将会很乐意做任何可能帮到家族的事
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.

1569
01:42:35,827 --> 01:42:37,611
谢谢  弗里思  我肯定
Oh,thank you,Frith,why,I...

1570
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:39,780
德温特先生会很开心听到这席话
I’m sure Mr.de Winter will be very happy to hear it.

1571
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:42,922
但我不认为有任何必要
But I don’t think anything will be necessary.

1572
01:42:55,758 --> 01:42:57,740
迈克西姆
Maxim.

1573
01:42:58,785 --> 01:43:00,871
亲爱的
Hello,darling.

1574
01:43:00,872 --> 01:43:05,557
迈克西姆  我 我担心明天在审讯会上你会做什么
Oh,Maxim,I’m worried about what you’ll do at the inquest tomorrow.

1575
01:43:05,569 --> 01:43:07,551
什么意思
What do you mean?

1576
01:43:07,655 --> 01:43:09,950
你不会发脾气吧
You won’t lose your temper,will you?

1577
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:12,767
向我保证他们不会令你发火
Promise me that they won’t make you angry.

1578
01:43:12,768 --> 01:43:15,271
好的  亲爱的  我保证
All right,darling.I promise.

1579
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:18,925
不管他问你什么  你不会失去理智
No matter what he asks you,you won’t lose your head?

1580
01:43:18,925 --> 01:43:21,428
别担心  亲爱的
Don’t worry,dear.

1581
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:24,351
他们无法马上都搞定  对吗
They can’t do anything at once,can they?

1582
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:25,070
No.

1583
01:43:26,334 --> 01:43:29,871
-那我们还剩一点时间在一起?  -是的
Then we’ve a little time left to be together.

1584
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,820
Yes.

1585
01:43:29,884 --> 01:43:33,431
我想要跟你一起去审讯会
-I want to go to the inquest with you. -I’d rather you didn’t,darling.

1586
01:43:33,431 --> 01:43:35,100
我宁愿你不去  亲爱的
But I can't wait here alone.

1587
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,291
但我无法一个人在这儿等着

1588
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:40,317
我向你保证我不会给你带来任何麻烦的
I promise you,I won’t be any trouble to you.

1589
01:43:40,318 --> 01:43:43,970
不管发生什么事我必须待在你身边
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens,

1590
01:43:43,972 --> 01:43:47,102
我们片刻都不会分离
we won’t be separated for a moment.

1591
01:43:47,102 --> 01:43:49,084
好吧  亲爱的
All right,dear.

1592
01:43:51,066 --> 01:43:54,395
这整件事我都不在乎  除了你
I don’t mind this whole thing except for you.

1593
01:43:54,407 --> 01:43:57,642
我无法忘怀对你所做的事
I can't forget what it’s done to you.

1594
01:43:57,642 --> 01:44:01,293
自从它发生以来  我别无它想
I’ve been thinking of nothing else since it happened.

1595
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:07,032
永远都回不去了
It’s gone forever,

1596
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:12,136
我所爱的风趣  年轻貌美
that funny,young,lost look I loved.

1597
01:44:12,147 --> 01:44:14,233
永远不会再回来了
It won’t ever come back.

1598
01:44:15,487 --> 01:44:18,825
当我告诉你有关丽贝卡的事时  就被我抹杀了
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.

1599
01:44:18,826 --> 01:44:21,320
都离开了
It’s gone.

1600
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:24,355
在几个小时之内
In a few hours,you’ve grown so much older.

1601
01:44:24,357 --> 01:44:26,965
你变得更成熟了

1602
01:44:28,427 --> 01:44:31,452
迈克西姆  迈克西姆
(SOBBING)Oh,Maxim Maxim.

1603
01:44:56,812 --> 01:44:58,899
布莱克杰克・布莱德是他的名字
Black Jack Brady was his name.

1604
01:44:58,899 --> 01:45:01,507
我曾办过的最重要的案件
The most important arrest I ever made.

1605
01:45:01,613 --> 01:45:04,012
2年之前的案件
It must have been about two years ago now.

1606
01:45:04,012 --> 01:45:05,994
当然毫无疑问
Of course,there was no doubt about it. He was hung a month after I caught him.

1607
01:45:05,995 --> 01:45:08,499
我逮捕他1个月后  他被处以绞刑
Hello. Wait a minute.

1608
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,899
等一下

1609
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:13,300
他们带老伯米・本上来了
They’ve got old Balmy Ben up now.

1610
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,325
你记得前任德温特太太吧
CORONER: You remember the late Mrs.de Winter,don’t you?

1611
01:45:16,327 --> 01:45:18,726
-她死了  -是的  我们知道
-She’s gone. -Yes,we know that.

1612
01:45:18,727 --> 01:45:21,543
她出海  被大海吞噬了
-She went in the sea. The sea got her. -That's right.That’s right.

1613
01:45:21,544 --> 01:45:24,465
对的 我们想要你告诉我们
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore

1614
01:45:24,467 --> 01:45:27,377
那晚她出海  你是否在岸边
-that last night she went sailing. -Eh?

1615
01:45:27,389 --> 01:45:29,788
那晚她出去
Were you on the shore that last sight she went ou,when she didn't come back?

1616
01:45:29,892 --> 01:45:32,802
当她没返回的时候  你在岸边吗

1617
01:45:32,815 --> 01:45:37,092
我什么都没看见  我不想要去精神病院
I didn’t see nothing. I don’t want to go to the asylum.

1618
01:45:37,093 --> 01:45:39,388
那儿有恶人
Them cruel folks there.

1619
01:45:39,495 --> 01:45:41,894
没人要送你去精神病院
Now,nobody’s going to send you to the asylum.

1620
01:45:41,894 --> 01:45:44,502
我们只想要你告诉我们你所见到的
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.

1621
01:45:44,503 --> 01:45:46,172
我什么也没看到
I didn’t see nothing.

1622
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:50,858
快点  你有看到德温特太太那晚有上她的船吗
CORONER: Come,come.

1623
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:50,920
Did you see Mrs.de Winter get into her boat that last night?

1624
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:56,398
我什么都不知道  我不想去精神病院
I don’t know nothing.

1625
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,884
I don’t want to go to the asylum.

1626
01:45:59,426 --> 01:46:01,825
好了  你可以走了
Very well.You may go.

1627
01:46:01,826 --> 01:46:04,538
你可以走了
-Eh? -You may go now.

1628
01:46:04,644 --> 01:46:08,608
泰伯先生  请上前
-Mr.Tabb,step forward,please. -Yes?

1629
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:13,670
你所说的证供属实
The evidence you give will be the truth,the whole truth

1630
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:16,018
绝无半点虚假
and nothing but the truth,so help you God?

1631
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,930
我敢向上帝发誓
I do,so help me God.

1632
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,503
前任德温特太太
The late Mrs.de Winter used to send her boat

1633
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:22,801
过去常常把她的船送到你的船坞调修
-to your shipyard for reconditioning. -That’s right,sir.

1634
01:46:22,801 --> 01:46:25,722
-是的  长官  -你还记得任何
CORONER: Can you remember any occasion

1635
01:46:25,724 --> 01:46:28,540
-当她开船造成船只出任何意外的原因吗  -没有  长官
when she had any sort of accident with the boat?

1636
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:30,524
我经常说德温特太太是个天生的水手
TABB: No,sir. I often said Mrs.de Winter was a born sailor.

1637
01:46:30,524 --> 01:46:33,444
当德温特太太走下甲板的时候  假设
Now,when Mrs.de Winter went below,as is supposed,

1638
01:46:33,446 --> 01:46:35,533
一场突如其来的飓风刮来
and a sudden gust of wind came down,

1639
01:46:35,533 --> 01:46:38,454
足以把船吹翻  不是吗
that would be enough to capsize the boat,wouldn’t it?

1640
01:46:38,455 --> 01:46:41,679
不好意思  长官  但还有其它的原因
Excuse we,sir. But there's a little more to it than that.

1641
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:45,133
-什么意思  泰伯先生  -长官  我是说通海阀
-What do you mean,Mr.Tabb? -I mean,sir,the seacocks.

1642
01:46:45,134 --> 01:46:47,429
-什么是通海阀  -通海阀
What are the seacocks?

1643
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:52,219
通海阀是船抽水的阀门
Sea...

1644
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:51,819
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.

1645
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:56,810
当你在海上航行的时候  它们一直都是紧闭着的
They’re always kept tight closed when you’re afloat.

1646
01:46:56,822 --> 01:46:58,387
然后呢
Yes?

1647
01:46:58,491 --> 01:47:01,934
昨天当我检查船只的时候  我发现它们被打开了
Well,yesterday,when I examined that boat,I found they’d been opened.

1648
01:47:01,936 --> 01:47:05,171
-会有什么后果  -就是这样
Whet could be the reason for that?

1649
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,742
Just this,that’s what flooded the boat and sunk her.

1650
01:47:05,171 --> 01:47:09,125
水渗进来把她淹没了

1651
01:47:09,135 --> 01:47:12,672
-你是指   -船根本就不是被吹翻的
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?

1652
01:47:12,685 --> 01:47:15,605
长官  我知道这么不应该
I know it’s a terrible thing to say,sir,but in my opinion,

1653
01:47:15,606 --> 01:47:19,049
但依我所见  她是被淹没的
she was scuttled.

1654
01:47:21,137 --> 01:47:24,580
-还有洞  -什么洞
-And there’s them holes. -What holes?

1655
01:47:24,686 --> 01:47:27,492
-在她的翼板上  -你在说什么
-Is her planking. -What are you talking about?

1656
01:47:27,503 --> 01:47:31,154
当然  船已经在水下超过一年
Of course,that boat’s been underwater for over a year,

1657
01:47:31,155 --> 01:47:34,494
潮水使她的船撞到海脊
and the tide’s been knocking her against the ridge.

1658
01:47:34,495 --> 01:47:38,668
但是那些裂口看起来好像是她从里面造成的
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she’d made them from the inside.

1659
01:47:40,339 --> 01:47:43,364
那么你认为她肯定是故意弄出来的
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.

1660
01:47:43,365 --> 01:47:47,434
以她对船的知识  不可能会出此意外
Couldn’t have been no accident not with her knowledge of boats.

1661
01:47:49,418 --> 01:47:52,328
我相信  你对前任德温特太太很了解吧
You know the former Mrs.de Winter very well,I believe?

1662
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:51,666
Oh,yes.

1663
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,887
-是的  -你相信她会有自杀倾向吗
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?

1664
01:47:55,888 --> 01:47:59,018
不  坦白讲我不相信  但这很难说
No.Frankly,I would not. But you never can tell.

1665
01:47:59,018 --> 01:48:01,835
你可以下去了  泰伯先生
You way stand down,Mr.Tabb.

01:48:02,985 --> 01:48:05,593
德温特先生  请
Mr.de Winter,please.

Sorry to drag you back for furthur questioning,Mr.de Winter.

1670
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:18,303
你已经听到泰伯先生的陈述了
But you’ve heard the statement of Mr.Tabb.

1671
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,099
我想知道你是否能给予帮助
I wonder if you can help us in any way.

1672
01:48:20,099 --> 01:48:22,801
-恐怖帮不上忙  -你能想到为何会有洞吗
I’m afraid not.

1673
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,984
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes

1674
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:25,628
前任德温特太太的船船板上的洞
in the planking of the late Mrs.de Winter’s boat?

1675
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:27,925
我当然想不出任何原因
Well,of course I can't think of any reason.

1676
01:48:27,925 --> 01:48:30,742
之前有人曾跟你谈论过这些洞吗
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?

1677
01:48:30,743 --> 01:48:33,361

Well,since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,

1678
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,044
I scarcely think that likely.

1679
01:48:33,363 --> 01:48:34,698
我几乎不可能想过
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

1680

for you in this matter.

-That’s rather obvious,isn’t it? -I hope that it is.

1685
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:44,852
因为德温特太太单独出海
Well,since she went sailing alone,

1686
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:46,907
难道我们就认为是她自己凿的那些洞吗
are we to believe that she drove those doles herself?

You may believe what you like.

1688
01:48:48,797 --> 01:48:50,675
你可以启发我们关于德温特太太为何
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs.de Winter should have wanted

1689
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:52,762
想要结束她自己的生命
to end her own life?

1690
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:54,848
我不知道什么原因
I know of no reason whatever.

1691
01:48:54,849 --> 01:48:57,144
德温特先生  不管有多么痛苦
Mr.de Winter,however painful it may be,

1692
01:48:57,145 --> 01:48:59,440
我必须问你一个非常私人的问题
I have to ask you a very personal question.

1693
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:03,614
你跟前任德温特太太之间的感情很幸福吗
Were relations between you and the late Mrs.de Winter perfectly happy?

1694
01:49:05,286 --> 01:49:09,031
你跟前任德温特太太之间的感情很幸福吗
Were relations between you and the late Mrs.be Winter perfectly happy?

1695
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,066
我不能再忍受了  你不妨现在就知道
I won’t stand this any longer! You might as well know now...

1696
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:13,285
(GAVEL BANGING)

1697
01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:16,660
休庭直到午餐过后  德温特先生
CORONER:We’ll adjourn till after lunch.

1698
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:18,625
Mr.de Winter,I presume you’ll be available for us then?

1699
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,955
我相信那时你会为我们腾出时间来吧

1700
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:21,720
我告诉过你该吃点早餐
I told you,you should have had some breakfast.

1701
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:24,360
你只是饿了，没别的
You’re hungry. That’s what’s the matter with you.

1702
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:31,438
弗里思先生说您也许想吃家里的午餐
Mr.Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house,

1703
01:49:31,606 --> 01:49:32,606
就让我带来了
and sent me with it.

1704
01:49:32,774 --> 01:49:34,400
不要紧，停在街角吧
No,that’s fine. Pull around the corner.

1705
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,235
好的，先生
Very good,sir.

1706
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:47,916
我真是太笨了  这样都会晕倒
Awfully foolish of me,fainting like that.

1707
01:49:47,968 --> 01:49:50,888
胡说  如果你没晕倒的话  我真的要发脾气了
Nonsense. If you hadn’t fainted like that,I’d have really lost my temper.

1708
01:49:50,888 --> 01:49:52,869
亲爱的  请小心点
Daring,please be careful.

1709
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:01,106
亲爱的  在这儿等一会
Darling,wait here a few moments. I’ll see if I can old Frank.

1710
01:50:01,106 --> 01:50:03,818
-我去看看能否找到老弗兰克  -去吧  亲爱的
Of course,darling. Don’t worry about me.I’ll be all right.

1711
01:50:03,818 --> 01:50:07,884
-别担心我  我会没事的  -确定?  好的
Sure?

1712
01:50:07,884 --> 01:50:11,732
给  喝点这个  会舒服点的
Here,try a spot of this. Do you good.

1713
01:50:11,742 --> 01:50:13,723
谢谢
Thank you.

1714
01:50:15,704 --> 01:50:18,509
-你确定没事吗  -确定
-Are you all right? -Yes,of course.

1715
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,918
-不会很久的  -行了
-I won’t be long. -Right you are.

1716
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:25,653
Hello.

1717
01:50:26,027 --> 01:50:29,572
新娘子今天觉得如何呀
And how does the bride find herself today?

1718
01:50:31,971 --> 01:50:35,610
我是说  跟迈克西姆的婚姻并不如意吧
I say,marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses,is it?

1719
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:38,018
我觉得你最好在迈克西姆回来之前离开
I think you’d better go before Maxim gets back.

1720
01:50:38,018 --> 01:50:41,147
他会吃醋?  我根本无权指责他
Oh,jealous,in he? Well,I can’t say I blame him.

1721
01:50:41,147 --> 01:50:43,962
但你不认为我是个大坏蛋  是吗
But you don’t think I’m the big bad wolf,do you?

1722
01:50:43,962 --> 01:50:47,090
我可不是  我是个非常平凡又和善可亲的人
I’m not,you know.I’m a perfectly ordinary,harmless bloke.

1723
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:50,010
我觉得你对这件事处理的很好
And I think you’re behaving splendidly over all this. Perfectly splendidly.

1724
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:51,991
非常的棒

1725
01:50:51,991 --> 01:50:54,597
自从上次见过你之后  你稍微变成熟了
You know,you’ve grown up a bit since I last saw you. It's no wonder...

1726
01:50:54,597 --> 01:50:56,891
-怪不得   -你想干吗  费弗尔
What do you want,Favell?

1727
01:50:56,891 --> 01:51:00,635
你好啊  迈克斯  你过得很好吧
Oh,hello,Max. Things are going pretty well for you,aren't they?

1728
01:51:00,645 --> 01:51:02,053
比你以前预期的更好
Better than you ever expected.

1729
01:51:02,053 --> 01:51:04,086
起初我还很担心你
I was rather worried about you at first. That's why I came down to the inquest.

1730
01:51:04,086 --> 01:51:06,589
所以我过来听审

1731
01:51:06,589 --> 01:51:08,799
我被你的关心所打动  但如果你不介意的话
Well,I'm touched by your solicitude.

1732
01:51:07,202 --> 01:51:09,818
But if you don't mind,we’d rather like to have our lunch.

1733
01:51:08,799 --> 01:51:10,228
我们想要用午餐了
Lunch? I say,what a jolly idea. Rather like a picnic,isn’t it?

1734
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:14,305
午餐  多么好的主意啊  更像是野餐  不是吗

1735
01:51:14,305 --> 01:51:18,152
对不起  是否介意我把这个放在这儿
I’m so sorry. Do you mind if I put this there?

1736
01:51:18,163 --> 01:51:19,331
迈克斯  老兄
You know,Max,old boy,I really think I ought to talk things over with you.

1737
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:22,115
我真的觉得我应该跟你商量点事

1738
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:24,419
商量什么
Talk what things over?

1739
01:51:24,419 --> 01:51:27,130
首先  那些船板上的那些洞
Well,those holes in the planking,for one thing.

1740
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:30,154
那些洞是从里面被凿开的
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.

1741
01:51:30,154 --> 01:51:32,656
-穆勒  -什么事  先生
-Oh,Mullen? -Yes,sir?

1742
01:51:32,656 --> 01:51:35,680
可以把我的车开去加油吗
Would you,like a good fellow,have my car filled with petrol?

1743
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,661
-快没油了  -好的  先生
-It’s almost empty. -Very good,sir.

1744
01:51:37,661 --> 01:51:40,790
-还有  穆勒  把门关上吧  -是的  先生
-And,Mullen,close the door,will you? -Yes,sir.

1745
01:51:40,946 --> 01:51:43,448
烟熏到你了吗
Does this bother you?

1746
01:51:50,435 --> 01:51:52,624
老兄  我有种强烈的感觉
You know,old boy,I buys a strong feeling that before the day’s out,

1747
01:51:52,624 --> 01:51:55,231
不出一天  有些人将会
somebody’s going to make use of that rather expressive,

1748
01:51:55,335 --> 01:52:00,132
用婉转的方式表达一般所说的"谋杀"
though somewhat old-fashioned term,“foul play.”

1749
01:52:01,174 --> 01:52:04,198
你们觉得无聊吗
Am I boring you with all this?

1750
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:07,848
没有吗  很好
No?

1751
01:52:07,952 --> 01:52:11,184
迈克斯  我发觉自己处于一个相当尴尬的立场
Good.Well,you see,Max,I find myself in a rather awkward position.

1752
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:15,564
你只要看一下这封信就明白了  是丽贝卡写的
You’ve only got to read this note to understand.It’s from Rebecca.

1753
01:52:15,564 --> 01:52:18,692
还有  她真是有先见之明
And,what’s more,she had the foresight to put a date on it.

1754
01:52:18,692 --> 01:52:21,716
她去世的那天写给我的
She wrote me the day she died.

1755
01:52:21,716 --> 01:52:23,801
不巧地是  那天晚上我去参加派对了
Incidentally,I was at a party on that night

1756
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:25,887
所以直到第二天我才看到
so I didn’t get it until the next day.

1757
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:27,972
为什么你觉得我会对这封信感兴趣呢
And what makes you think that note would interest me?

1758
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:30,475
我不会跟你讨论信的内容
Oh,I’m not gonna bother you with the contents now.

1759
01:52:30,475 --> 01:52:33,081
但我可以肯定那不是一个打算当晚
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman

1760
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:36,210
自杀的女人会写的信
who intends to drown herself that same night.

1761
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:41,527
顺便说一下  你怎么处理以前的骨骸
By the way,what do you do with old bones? Bury them?

1762
01:52:41,527 --> 01:52:44,134
葬了它们  还是怎样

1763
01:52:44,134 --> 01:52:47,366
然而  暂且
However,for the time being...

1764
01:52:47,366 --> 01:52:48,076
迈克斯
You know,Max,I’m getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.

1765
01:52:48,076 --> 01:52:51,433
我真的受够了做汽车销售员的工作

1766
01:52:51,433 --> 01:52:53,831
我不知道你是否曾经经受过那种感觉
I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced the feeling

1767
01:52:53,831 --> 01:52:56,751
开着一辆价值不菲却不属于你的汽车
of driving an expensive motorcar which isn’t your own?

1768
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:58,732
但那真的会气死人
But it can be very,very exasperating.

1769
01:52:58,732 --> 01:53:02,069
你知道我什么意思  你想拥有自己的车
You know what I mean. You want to own the car yourself.

1770
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:05,197
我经常问自己  迁居到乡下会是什么样
I oftan wonder what it would be like to ratire to the country.

1771
01:53:05,197 --> 01:53:08,116
拥有一个有着几英亩猎场的漂亮的小地方
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.

1772
01:53:08,116 --> 01:53:10,098
我从未弄明白那要花一年的时间
I’ve never figured out what it what it would cost a year,

1773
01:53:10,098 --> 01:53:12,079
但我想要跟你谈谈
but I’d like to talk about it with you.

1774
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:13,486
我想听听你的建议
I’d like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.

1775
01:53:13,486 --> 01:53:15,520
怎样能不用努力工作而过着舒适的生活

1776
01:53:17,501 --> 01:53:20,420
你好  费弗尔  你找我吗  迈克西姆
Hello,Favell. You looking for me,Maxim?

1777
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:25,738
是的  费弗尔先生跟我有点事要谈
Yes.

1778
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:25,546
Mr.Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.

1779
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:28,658
我想我们最好去小酒馆解决
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.

1780
01:53:28,658 --> 01:53:32,829
那儿也许有包间
They may have a private room there.

1781
01:53:32,829 --> 01:53:35,540
待会儿见
Well,see you later.

1782
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,564
去找朱利安上校  告诉他我要马上见他
Find Colonel Julyan. Tell him I want to see him immediately.

1783
01:53:38,564 --> 01:53:41,066
走吧  费弗尔
Come on.Favell.Let’s go.

1784
01:53:45,758 --> 01:53:48,156
请问有包间吗
-Have you a private room,please? -Of course,sir. Through there,sir.

1785
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:51,285
-当然有  先生  那边请  先生  -谢谢

1786
01:53:53,683 --> 01:53:56,081
希望这位就是德温特先生
Hope this will do,Mr.de Winter.

1787
01:53:56,081 --> 01:53:59,001
很豪华啊 的确像是豪华的酒馆
Splendid.Splendid. Exactly like the Ritz.

1788
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:02,129
-要点餐吗  先生们  -给我一杯大的白兰地苏打水
Any orders,gents?

1789
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,741
Yes. You might bring me a large brandy and soda.

1790
01:54:02,129 --> 01:54:05,674
你呢  迈克斯  一杯酒我还请得起
How about you,Max? Have one on me. I feel I can afford to play host.

1791
01:54:05,674 --> 01:54:08,489
-谢谢  好的  -来两杯  可以吗  好伙计
Thanks. I don’t mind if I do.

1792
01:54:08,489 --> 01:54:10,470
-好的  先生  -德温特先生在哪里
Make it two,will you,like a good fellow?

1793
01:54:08,467 --> 01:54:10,298
-Very good,sir. -COLONEL JULYON:Where’s Mr.de Winter?

1794
01:54:10,575 --> 01:54:13,181
开门就是了  先生
PROPRIETOR: Through the other door,sir.

1795
01:54:13,181 --> 01:54:15,893
朱利安上校  他是费弗尔先生
Colonel Jnlyan,this is Mr.Favell.

1796
01:54:15,893 --> 01:54:18,916
我认识朱利安上校  我们是老相识了  是吧
Oh,I know Colonel Jnlyan. We’re old friends,aren’t we?

1797
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:20,105
既然你们是老相识
Since you’re old friends,I assume you also know

1798
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:22,774
我猜想你也知道他是这儿的警方首脑
he’s head of the police here.

1799
01:54:22,879 --> 01:54:25,016
我想他会有兴趣听你的陈述
He might be interested to hear your proposition. Tell him all about it.

1800
01:54:25,016 --> 01:54:26,111
说吧  告诉他所有事
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars

1801
01:54:26,111 --> 01:54:29,239
我只不过说我希望放弃卖车的工作并退休

1802
01:54:29,343 --> 01:54:31,429
事实上  他提出  如果我酬谢他的话
and retire into the country.

1803
01:54:29,196 --> 01:54:31,687
Actually,he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest

1804
01:54:31,429 --> 01:54:33,410
他会保留一份很重要的证据
if I made it worth his while.

1805
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,121
我只是想见识一下司法公正  上校
I only want to see justice done,Colonel.

1806
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:38,102
那位造船人的证据
Now,that boatbuilder’s evidence suggested certain possible theories

1807
01:54:38,102 --> 01:54:40,709
指出某些有关丽贝卡之死的看法
concerning Rebecca’s death. One of them,of course,is suicide.

1808
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:42,690
其中之一  当然  是自杀
Now I have a little note here which I consider

1809
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:47,487
我这儿有封信可以驳回那个可能性
puts that possibility quite out of court.

1810
01:54:47,487 --> 01:54:50,093
-读一下吧  上校  -"亲爱的  杰克"
Read it,Colonel.

1811
01:54:50,093 --> 01:54:53,639
"我刚看完医生  我要马上回曼陀丽"
“Jack,darling,

1812
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:53,375
I’ve just seen the doctor and I’m going down to Manderley right away.

1813
01:54:53,639 --> 01:54:55,005
"我整晚都会待在小屋"
I shall be at the cottage all this evening

1814
01:54:55,005 --> 01:54:57,080
"并为你留着门"
and shall leave the door open for you.

1815
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:01,146
"我有要事相告  丽贝卡上"
I have something terribly important to tell you.

1816
01:55:01,146 --> 01:55:03,075
那像是一个决定自杀的女人
Rebecca.”

1817
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:02,426
Now,does that look like the note of a woman

1818
01:55:03,075 --> 01:55:04,900
会写的信吗
who had made up her mind to kill herself?

1819
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:05,974
除此之外  上校
And apart from that,do you mean to tell me

1820
01:55:05,974 --> 01:55:08,341
难道说如果你要自杀的话
that if you wanted to commit suicide,you would go to all the trouble

1821
01:55:08,341 --> 01:55:11,365
你会特意出海
of putting out to sea is a boat,and then take a hammer and chisel

1822
01:55:11,365 --> 01:55:12,678
还拿一把榔头跟凿子
and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?

1823
01:55:12,678 --> 01:55:14,597
然后费劲凿洞弄穿底部吗
Come,Colonel.As an officer of the law,

1824
01:55:14,597 --> 01:55:17,100
得了吧  上校  作为一个执法官

1825
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,436
你难道不觉得有些许嫌疑吗
don’t you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?

1826
01:55:20,436 --> 01:55:22,730
-谋杀的嫌疑?  -还能有什么
-Of murder? -What else?

1827
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:26,171
你认识迈克斯很久了  所以你知道他是个老古董
You’ve known Max a long time. So you know he’s the old-fashioned type,

1828
01:55:26,275 --> 01:55:29,404
会誓死I卫他的荣誉或是扼杀它
who’d die to defend his honor,or who’d kill for it.

1829
01:55:29,404 --> 01:55:31,385
纯粹是敲诈
It’s blackmail,pure and simple.

1830
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:33,794
Blackmail is not so pure,nor so simple.

1831
01:55:33,969 --> 01:55:36,301
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.

1832
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:40,017
还有敲诈者有时最终会将自己送进监牢
And the blackmailer sometimes find himself in jail at the end of it.

1833
01:55:40,017 --> 01:55:43,041
我明白  你会为德温特辩解
Oh,I see.You’re going to hold de Winter’s hand through all this.

1834
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:44,876
只因为他是这儿的大亨
Just because he’s the big noise around here

1835
01:55:44,876 --> 01:55:46,899
而且你是他的座上客  他是你的酒肉朋友
and he’s actually permitted you to dine with him.

1836
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:49,401
说话小心点  费弗尔  你所指控的是谋杀
Be careful,Favell. You’ve brought an eccusation of murder.

1837
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:52,113
-你有任何证人吗  -我确实有一个证人
-Have you any witnesses? -I do have a witness.

1838
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:54,094
那就是本
It’s that fellow,Ben.

1839
01:55:54,198 --> 01:55:56,388
如果那个愚蠢的验尸官是个内行的话
If that stupid coroner hadn’t been as much of a snob as you are,

1840
01:55:56,388 --> 01:55:58,379
他会看出那个傻子在隐瞒些事
he’d have seen that half-wit wes hiding something.

1841
01:55:58,379 --> 01:55:59,620
本为何要隐瞒
And why should Ben do that?

1842
01:55:59,724 --> 01:56:01,205
因为丽贝卡跟我  我们曾抓住他
Because we caught him once,Rebecca and I,

1843
01:56:01,205 --> 01:56:02,748
他透过小屋的窗户偷看我们
peering at us through the cottage window.

1844
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:05,459
丽贝卡威胁说要把他送到精神病院  所以他不敢说
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum. That's why he was afraid to speak.

1845
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:08,379
但他一直闲晃  所以他肯定看到过整件事
But he was always hanging about. He must have seen this whole thing.

1846
01:56:08,379 --> 01:56:11,298
听起来就够荒谬的
It’s ridiculous,even listening to all this.

1847
01:56:11,298 --> 01:56:14,009
你们所有人像是个小工会  不是吗
You’re like a little trade union,all of you,aren’t you?

1848
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:15,991
如果我的猜测是对的话  克劳莱
And if my guess in right,Cramley,

1849
01:56:15,991 --> 01:56:19,431
在你的内心深处对我有点敌意  不是吗
there’s a bit of malice in your soul toward me,isn’t there?

1850
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:22,455
克劳莱追不到丽贝卡
Crawley didn’t have much success with Rebecca,

1851
01:56:22,455 --> 01:56:25,583
但这次他应该会更幸运
but he ought to have more luck this time.

1852
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:28,607
新娘子会感激你伸出友谊的臂膀  克劳莱
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm,Crawley,

1853
01:56:28,712 --> 01:56:30,693
一个多星期之后
in a week or so. Every time she faints,in fact.

1854
01:56:30,693 --> 01:56:32,674
-每次她晕倒  实际上  -德温特
-De Winter! -Maxiw,please!

1855
01:56:32,674 --> 01:56:34,759
-迈克西姆  拜托  -德温特

1856
01:56:34,759 --> 01:56:37,887
你会为你的臭脾气付出代价的  迈克斯
That temper of yours will do you in yet,Max.

1857
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:38,651
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1858
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:46,125
打扰一下  先生们  还需要什么吗
Excuse me,gentlemen.

1859
01:56:44,289 --> 01:56:46,746
-Now is there anything else? -Yes.

1860
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:49,566
需要  你可以拿支镇静剂给德温特先生

1861
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:49,449
You might bring Mr.de Winter a sedative.

1862
01:56:49,566 --> 01:56:52,277
-不  不用了  什么都不需要  出去吧  -好的  先生
-No,no. Nothing at all. Just leave us. -Very good.

1863
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:57,282
费弗尔  我们来做个了结
Now,Fevell,let’s get this business over.

1864
01:56:57,282 --> 01:56:59,889
你好像对整件事做过仔细的了解
As you seew to have worked out the whole thing so carsfully,

1865
01:56:59,993 --> 01:57:02,287
也许你可以给我们提供一个动机
perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.

1866
01:57:02,287 --> 01:57:04,789
我知道你会提出这个问题  上校
I know you were going to bring that up,Colonel.

1867
01:57:04,894 --> 01:57:06,385
我曾拜读过很多侦探小说
I’ve read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.

1868
01:57:06,385 --> 01:57:08,022
从而知道肯定会有杀人动机

1869
01:57:08,126 --> 01:57:11,880
是否容我失陪一下  我会提供动机的
And if you’ll all excuse me,I might supply that,too.

1870
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:15,321
我希望你先回家  你不该待在这儿经受这一切
I wish you’d go home. You ought not to he here through all this.

1871
01:57:15,321 --> 01:57:17,302
拜托让我留下  迈克西姆
Please let me stay. Maxim.

1872
01:57:17,302 --> 01:57:19,387
无疑地  朱利安上校  你不会允许这个家伙
Surely,Colonel Julyan,you’re not going to allow this fellow to...

1873
01:57:19,492 --> 01:57:22,411
我对费弗尔的看法与你一样不好  克劳莱
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours,Crawley.

1874
01:57:22,411 --> 01:57:24,392
但做为警察
But in my official capacity,I have no altnrnative

1875
01:57:24,392 --> 01:57:26,686
我别无选择唯有继续听他的指控
But to pursue his accusations. I entirely agree with you,Colonel.

1876
01:57:26,686 --> 01:57:28,772
我完全同意你的说法  上校

1877
01:57:28,772 --> 01:57:30,753
在一定程度上像这件如此严重的案件  我们必须
In matters as serious as this,we must make sure of every point

1878
01:57:30,857 --> 01:57:33,777
弄清楚每一个要点  寻求各种途径
and explore every avenue.

1879
01:57:33,777 --> 01:57:37,843
事实上  如果我千方百计捏造事实
And in fact,if I may coin a phrase,leave no stone unturned.

1880
01:57:37,843 --> 01:57:40,554
她来了  缺少的环节
Here she is,the missing link,the witness who will help supply the motive.

1881
01:57:40,659 --> 01:57:43,265
将帮忙提供动机的证人

1882
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:46,602
朱利安上校  丹弗斯太太  我相信你认识所有人
Colonel Julyan Mrs.Danvers. I believe you know everyone else.

1883
01:57:46,602 --> 01:57:47,415
要坐下吗
Won’t you sit down?

1884
01:57:47,415 --> 01:57:49,730
无意冒犯  上校  但我想由我来问丹尼
No offense,Colonel,but I think I’ll put this to Danny.

1885
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:53,484
她会更容易明白  丹尼  谁是丽贝卡的医生
She’ll understand it more easily.

1886
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,229
Danny,who was Rebecca’s doctor?

1887
01:57:53,484 --> 01:57:56,299
德温特太太一直都看村里的麦克林医生
Mrs.de Winter always had Dr.McClean from the village.

1888
01:57:56,299 --> 01:57:59,844
你听到了  我是说丽贝卡在伦敦的医生
Now,you heard. I said Rebecca’s doctor in london.

1889
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,181
我对此一无所知
I don’t know anything about that.

1890
01:58:03,181 --> 01:58:06,205
别跟我打哈哈  你知道丽贝卡的所有事
Oh,don’t give me that,Danny.You knew everything about Rebecca.

1891
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:08,707
你知道她与我恋爱  不是吗
You knew she was in love with we,didn’t you?

1892
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,355
你肯定没有忘记过去她跟我
Surely you haven’t forgotten the good times she and I used to have

1893
01:58:10,355 --> 01:58:12,565
在下面小屋里的美好时光
down at the cottage on the beach.

1894
01:58:12,565 --> 01:58:15,172
她有权消遣她自己  不是吗
She had a right to amuse herself,didn’t she?

1895
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:18,196
对她来说  爱情是一场游戏  它令她发笑
Love was a game to her. Only a game. It make her laugh,I tell you.

1896
01:58:18,196 --> 01:58:21,324
她过去常常坐在她的床上嘲笑你
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.

1897
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:23,232
你可想得出任何理由
Can you think of why Mrs.de Winter should have taken her own life?

1898
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,391
对德温特夫人的自杀作出解释吗

1899
01:58:25,391 --> 01:58:27,476
不  不  我拒绝相信此事  我知道她的所有事
No,no. I refuse to believe it.

1900
01:58:27,476 --> 01:58:29,457
我不会相信她是自杀
I knew everything about her and I won’t believe it.

1901
01:58:29,562 --> 01:58:32,481
听到了吧  不可能  她跟我一样
There. You see?It’s impossible. She knows that an well as I do.

1902
01:58:32,481 --> 01:58:35,505
听我说  丹尼  我们知道丽贝卡去伦敦看医生
Now,listen to me,Danny.

1903
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:34,888
We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London

1904
01:58:35,505 --> 01:58:38,633
-是谁  -我不知道
on the last day of her life. Who was it?

1905
01:58:38,633 --> 01:58:40,719
我明白  丹尼
I don’t know.

1906
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:40,568
I understand,Danny

1907
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:43,847
你以为我们要求你泄露丽贝卡生命的秘密
You think we’re asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca’s life.

1908
01:58:43,847 --> 01:58:46,349
你想要保护她  但我也是
You’re trying to defend her.But that's what I’m doing.

1909
01:58:46,454 --> 01:58:49,269
我想要澄清她自杀的嫌疑
I’m trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.

1910
01:58:49,269 --> 01:58:52,397
丹弗斯太太  有人指出
Mrs.Danvers,it has been suggested

1911
01:58:52,397 --> 01:58:55,108
德温特太太是被蓄意谋杀的
that Mrs.de Winter was deliberately murdered.

1912
01:58:55,108 --> 01:58:57,402
你简单说明一下  丹尼
There you buys it in e nutshell,Danny.

1913
01:58:57,402 --> 01:59:00,426
但还有一件事  你要说的凶手的名字
But there’s one more thing you’ll want to know,the name of the murderer.

1914
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:03,345
一个可爱的名字
It’s a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.

1915
01:59:03,345 --> 01:59:06,474
乔治・福斯科・马克西米利安・德温特
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.

1916
01:59:12,626 --> 01:59:15,858
是有位医生  德温特太太有时私下让他看病
There was a dactor.

1917
01:59:15,858 --> 01:59:18,673
她过去常常让他就医  即使在她结婚之前也是
Mrs.de Winter sometimes went to him privately.

1918
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,898
She used to go to him even before she was married.

1919
01:59:18,673 --> 01:59:21,071
丹尼  我们不想听你回忆旧事  他叫什么名字
We don’t want reminiscences,Danny.What was his name?

1920
01:59:29,517 --> 01:59:33,480
贝克医生  谢菲德小镇  戈德霍克路165号
Dr.Baker. 165 Goldhawk Road,Shepherd’s Bush.

1921
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,504
听见了吧  上校  那儿将是你找到动机的地方
There you are,Colonel. There’s where you’ll find your motive.

1922
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:39,423
去问贝克医生  他会告诉你为何丽贝卡去看他
Go and question Dr.Baker. He’ll tell you why Rebecca went to him.

1923
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:41,821
去确认她怀孕的事实
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.

1924
01:59:41,821 --> 01:59:44,324
孕育一个可爱的  满头卷发的小孩子
A sweet,curly-headed little child.

1925
01:59:44,428 --> 01:59:47,243
那不是真的 她会告诉我要孩子的事的
It isn’t true. It isn’t true. She would have told me.

1926
01:59:47,243 --> 01:59:49,955
她曾告诉过迈克斯  迈克西姆知道自己不是经手人
She told Max about it. Max knew he wasn’t the father.

1927
01:59:49,955 --> 01:59:53,500
所以  他像传统的绅士一样  杀了她
So,like the gentleman of the old school that he is,he killed her.

1928
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:56,002
恐怕我们得去问问贝克医生
COLONEL JULYAN:I’m afraid we shall have to question this Dr.Baker.

1929
01:59:56,107 --> 02:00:00,069
知道了 但为了安全起见  我想我也要一起前往
Hear,hear. But for safety’s sake,I think I’d like to go along,too.

1930
02:00:00,069 --> 02:00:03,301
遗憾地是  我猜想你有权要求一起前往
Yes. Unfortunately,I suppose you have the right to ask that.

1931
02:00:03,301 --> 02:00:04,782
我要去见一下验尸官
I’ll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed

1932
02:00:04,782 --> 02:00:06,742
让审讯推迟  直到找到进一步证据为止
pending farther evidence.

1933
02:00:06,742 --> 02:00:10,913
难道你不担心囚犯 可能会逃跑吗
I say,aren’t you rather afraid that the prisoner,shall we say,might bolt?

1934
02:00:10,913 --> 02:00:14,145
记住我的话  他不会那么做的
You have my word for it that he will not do that.

1935
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:17,274
再见  迈克斯  一起走吧  丹尼
Toodle-oo,Max. Come along,Danny.

1936
02:00:17,378 --> 02:00:21,340
别打扰这对不幸福的夫妇一起度过最后的时光了
Let’s leave the unhappy couple to speed their last moments together alone.

1937
02:00:32,184 --> 02:00:34,478
你确定不要我跟你一起去吗  迈克西姆
Are you sure you don’t want me to go with you,Max?

1938
02:00:34,478 --> 02:00:36,564
是的  亲爱的  那会使你疲惫不堪的
No,darling. It’ll be very tiring for you.

1939
02:00:36,772 --> 02:00:39,077
我一大早就会回去了
I’ll be back the very first thing in the morning.

1940
02:00:39,077 --> 02:00:40,526
我会不眠不休地赶回去
-And I won’t even stop to sleep. -I’ll be waiting for you.

1941
02:00:40,526 --> 02:00:42,716
我等你

1942
02:00:48,242 --> 02:00:50,849
-好了吗  迈克西姆  -好了
-Ready,Maxim? -Yes.

1943
02:00:50,849 --> 02:00:53,768
你们俩开前面  我跟着费弗尔
You two go on ahead. I'll follow with Favell.

1944
02:01:07,324 --> 02:01:08,429
贝克医生
COLONEL JULYAN:Dr.Baker,you may have seen

1945
02:01:08,429 --> 02:01:11,911
最近你也许在报纸上看过德温特先生的名字
Mr.de Winter’s name in the pepers renently.

1946
02:01:11,911 --> 02:01:15,770
是的 跟一具在船上被发现的尸体有关
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.

1947
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:18,689
我太太看了所有报道  令人伤心的案件
My wife was reading all about it. A very sad case. My condolences.

1948
02:01:18,689 --> 02:01:21,192
-同情   -这将花去数小时  容我
FAVELL: This is going to take hours. Let me...

1949
02:01:21,192 --> 02:01:24,111
别费心了  费弗尔  我想我可以告诉贝克医生
Don’t bother,Favell. I think I can tell Dr.Baker.

1950
02:01:24,111 --> 02:01:26,509
我们想要了解某些有关
We’re trying to discover certain facts

1951
02:01:26,509 --> 02:01:29,950
前任德温特太太去世当天的活动真相
concerning the late Mrs.de Winter’s activities on the day of her death.

1952
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:33,496
去年  10月12号  如果你记得的话  我想你告诉我
October the 12th,last year

1953
02:01:31,785 --> 02:01:33,446
I want you to tell me if you can,

1954
02:01:33,496 --> 02:01:36,832
那天是否有叫这个名字的人拜访过你
if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?

1955
02:01:36,832 --> 02:01:39,960
非常抱歉  恐怕我帮不上忙
I’m awfully sorry. I’m afraid I can't help you.

1956
02:01:40,065 --> 02:01:42,567
我是记得有个叫德温特的人
I should have remembered the name de Winter.

1957
02:01:42,567 --> 02:01:45,174
但我从未给一个叫德温特太太的人看过病
I’ve never attended a Mrs.de Winter in my life.

1958
02:01:45,174 --> 02:01:48,093
你怎么可能记得所有你病人的名字
FAVELL: How can you possibly tell all your patients'names?

1959
02:01:48,093 --> 02:01:51,534
如果你想的话  我可以从预约本上找找
I can look it up is my engagement diary if you like.

1960
02:01:51,534 --> 02:01:54,663
-你是说10月12号吗  -是的
-Did you say the 12th of October? -COLONEL JULYAN:Yes.

1961
02:01:54,663 --> 02:01:59,459
找到了  没有  没有叫德温特的
Here we era.

1962
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,675
No. No de Winter

1963
02:01:59,459 --> 02:02:03,317
-你确定吗  -这是那天所有的预约
Are you sure?

1964
02:02:01,022 --> 02:02:03,559
Well,here are all the appointments for that day.

1965
02:02:03,317 --> 02:02:06,862
"罗丝  坎贝尔  斯蒂尔  佩里诺  丹弗斯  马修 "
Ross,Campbell Steadall,Perrino Danvers...

1966
02:02:06,862 --> 02:02:09,365
丹尼  见鬼
-Danny? What the devil? -Would you read that name again?

1967
02:02:09,365 --> 02:02:12,806
可以再念一遍名字吗  你念到丹弗斯?

1968
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,776
Did you say Danvers?

1969
02:02:12,806 --> 02:02:15,517
是的  3点有位丹弗斯太太的预约
Yes. I have a Mrs.Danvers for 3:00.

1970
02:02:15,517 --> 02:02:17,915
她长什么样  你还记得吗
What did she look like? Can you remember?

1971
02:02:17,915 --> 02:02:21,252
记得  我记得很清楚  她是位非常漂亮的女人
Yes,I remember her quite well. She was e very beautiful woman.

1972
02:02:21,252 --> 02:02:24,276
高挑个儿  黑黑的脸蛋  穿着很精致
-Tall dark,exquisitely dressed. -CRAWLEY: Rebecca.

1973
02:02:24,276 --> 02:02:27,612
-是丽贝卡  -那位女士肯定用了化名
The lady must have used an assumed name.

1974
02:02:27,612 --> 02:02:33,451
是吗  真是令人吃惊  我认识她很久了
Is that so?

1975
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:33,001
This is a surprise. I’ve known her a long time.

1976
02:02:33,451 --> 02:02:35,015
她得了什么病
What was the matter with her?

1977
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,205
尊敬的先生  我们有职业操守
Well,there are certain ethics.

1978
02:02:37,205 --> 02:02:41,167
你可能提供德温特太太自杀的原因  贝克医生
Could you supply a reason Dr.Baker,for Mrs. de Winter’s suicide?

1979
02:02:41,167 --> 02:02:44,191
是谋杀  她怀孕了  不是吗
For her murder,you mean?

1980
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:45,438
She wan going to have a kid,wasn't she? Come on. Out with it!

1981
02:02:44,191 --> 02:02:46,172
快点  快说
Tell me,what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?

1982
02:02:46,172 --> 02:02:49,301
她这种高尚的女人怎么会做这样污秽的事

1983
02:02:49,301 --> 02:02:50,583
我以警方的名义来访  对我来说有必要
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...

1984
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:52,220
使你相信如果没必要的话
I assure you we’d not be troubling you if it were not necessary.

1985
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:56,391
我们就不会来打扰你了

1986
02:02:56,391 --> 02:02:58,893
你们想知道我是否可以指出任何有关
You want to know if I can suggest any motive

1987
02:02:58,893 --> 02:03:01,605
德温特太太会自杀的动机?
as to why Mrs.de Winter should have taken her life?

1988
02:03:01,605 --> 02:03:04,837
我想可以
Yes,I think I can.

1989
02:03:06,505 --> 02:03:10,363
那位自称丹弗斯太太的女人得了很严重的病
The woman who called herself Mrs.Danvers was very seriously ill.

1990
02:03:10,363 --> 02:03:13,908
我不是怀孕了吗
She was not going to have a child?

1991
02:03:13,908 --> 02:03:17,766
她以为是  但我的诊断却不同
That was what she thought. My diagnosis was different.

1992
02:03:17,766 --> 02:03:22,980
我让她去找一位知名的专科医生做检查  照X光
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an axamination and x-rays.

1993
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:26,942
而那天她是拿她的检查报告来给我看的
And on this date,she returned to me for his report.

1994
02:03:26,942 --> 02:03:31,009
我记得她站在这儿拿着她的X光片
I rememder her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.

1995
02:03:31,009 --> 02:03:33,199
她说  "我想知道真相"
“I want to know the truth,”she said.

1996
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:36,222
"我不要听冠冕堂皇的话"
“I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.

1997
02:03:36,222 --> 02:03:39,038
"如果有病  你可以马上告诉我"
If I’m for it you can tell me right away.”

1998
02:03:39,038 --> 02:03:41,645
我知道她不是那种听了假话会信以为真的人
I knew she was not the tyge to accept a lie.

1999
02:03:41,645 --> 02:03:44,564
她要听实话  所有我就告诉她了
She’d asked for the truth,so I let her have it.

2000
02:03:44,564 --> 02:03:48,631
她跟我道谢之后  我再也没有见过她了  所有我猜想
She thanked me. I never saw her again,so I assumed...

2001
02:03:48,631 --> 02:03:51,759
-她得了什么病  -癌症
-What was wrong with her? -Cancer.

2002
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:56,764
是的  癌症晚期
Yes,the growth was deep-rooted.

2003
02:03:56,764 --> 02:03:59,788
动手术也完全无济于事
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.

2004
02:03:59,788 --> 02:04:02,499
要不了多久  她就得靠吗啡来止痛了
In a short time,she would have been under morphia.

2005
02:04:02,499 --> 02:04:06,044
除了等死  没什么可做的了
There was nothing that could be done for her,except wait.

2006
02:04:06,148 --> 02:04:09,902
当你告诉她病情的时候  她有说什么吗
MAXIM:Did she say anything when you told her?

2007
02:04:09,902 --> 02:04:13,343
她怪异地微笑着
DR.BAKER:She smiled in a queer sort of way.

2008
02:04:13,343 --> 02:04:16,262
你的妻子是个很棒的女人  德温特先生
Your wife was a wonderful woman,Mr.de Winter.

2009
02:04:16,262 --> 02:04:19,078
对了  我记得她说了一些
And,oh,yes,I remember she said something

2010
02:04:19,182 --> 02:04:22,102
当时令我觉得非常奇怪的话
that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.

2011
02:04:22,102 --> 02:04:24,708
当我告诉她只剩几个月的时候
When I told her it was a matter of months,she said,

2012
02:04:24,708 --> 02:04:27,732
她说  "不  医生  不用那么久"
“Oh.no. Doctor,not that long.”

2013
02:04:30,652 --> 02:04:33,884
很好  你已经告诉我们所有我们想知道的事了
You’ve been very kind. You’ve told us all we wanted to know.

2014
02:04:33,989 --> 02:04:36,700
我可能会需要一次正式的审查
We shall need an official verification.

2015
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:39,828
-审查?  -是的  以确定自杀的裁决
-Verification? -Yes.

2016
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:40,549
-To confirm the verdict of suicide. -DR.BAKER: I understand.

2017
02:04:39,828 --> 02:04:42,852
我明白  可以请你们喝杯雪利酒吗
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?

2018
02:04:42,852 --> 02:04:45,980
不用了  太客气了  我想我们该走了
COLONEL JULYAN: No,that's very kind? I think we ought to be going.

2019
02:04:48,795 --> 02:04:50,776
谢天谢地我们终于知道真相了
Thank heaven we know the truth.

2020
02:04:50,776 --> 02:04:52,757
可怕的事  太可怕了
Dreadfnl thing. Dreadful.

2021
02:04:52,757 --> 02:04:55,573
像她这样一位年轻貌美的女人  难怪
Young and lovely woman like that. No wonder...

2022
02:04:55,573 --> 02:05:00,161
我一点也不明白  丹尼肯定也是
I never had the remotest idea. Neither did Danny,I’m sure.

2023
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,602
希望我是喝醉酒了
I wish I had a drink.

2024
02:05:03,706 --> 02:05:06,208
我们还需要再做进一步审讯吗  朱利安上校
Will we be needed at the inquest any further,Colonel Julyan?

2025
02:05:06,313 --> 02:05:08,919
不用了  我看得出迈克西姆也不想再被骚扰了
No,no.I can see to it that Maxim’s not troubled any further.

2026
02:05:08,919 --> 02:05:11,213
-谢谢  长官  -准备走了吗  上校
-Thank you,sir. -You ready to start,Colonel?

2027
02:05:11,213 --> 02:05:13,820
不用  谢谢  今晚我要待在城里
No,thank you. I’m staying in town tonight.

2028
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:17,678
费弗尔  敲诈勒索可不是什么好行当
And let me tell you,Favell,blackmail in not much of a profession.

2029
02:05:17,678 --> 02:05:19,816
我们这一带的人知道该怎么对付讹诈
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world,

2030
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:21,432
尽管在你看来这或许有点新鲜
strange as it may seem to you.

2031
02:05:21,432 --> 02:05:23,934
我的确不知道你在讲什么
I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.

2032
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:27,062
上校  但是如果你什么时候需要买车的话就告诉我
But if you ever need a new car,Colonel,just let me know.

2033
02:05:27,062 --> 02:05:30,086
不知该如何感谢你帮忙我们解决了这件事
It’s impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.

2034
02:05:30,086 --> 02:05:31,609
千言万语尽在不言中
You know what I feel without my saying it.

2035
02:05:31,609 --> 02:05:32,797
别客气  别说感谢的话了
Not at all. Put the whole thing behind you.

2036
02:05:32,902 --> 02:05:35,821
最好先通知你太太  她会担心的
But let your wife know. She'll be getting worried.

2037
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:38,845
是  我会马上打电话给她  然后就直接回曼陀丽
Yes,of course. I’ll phone her at once

2038
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:37,772
and we’ll get straight down to Manderley.

2039
02:05:38,845 --> 02:05:42,077
再见  克劳莱  迈克西姆是个很好的朋友
Goodbye,Crawley Maxim’s got a great friend.

2040
02:05:48,125 --> 02:05:50,523
-弗兰克  -什么事  迈克西姆
-Frank. -Yes,Maxim?

2041
02:05:52,505 --> 02:05:54,903
有些事你不知道
-There’s something you don’t know. -Oh,no,there isn’t.

2042
02:05:55,007 --> 02:05:57,614
不  我都知道

2043
02:06:05,956 --> 02:06:08,249
我没有杀她  弗兰克
I didn’t kill her, Frank.

2044
02:06:08,249 --> 02:06:10,231
但我现在明白当她告诉我孩子的事时
But I know now that when she told me about the child,

2045
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:12,525
她想要我杀了她
she wanted me to kill her.

2046
02:06:12,525 --> 02:06:15,653
她故意撒谎  她早已预料到整件事
She lied on purpose. She foresaw the whole thing.

2047
02:06:15,757 --> 02:06:18,572
所以当她 她站在那儿笑
That’s why she stood there laughing when she...

2048
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:21,179
别再想了
Don’t think about it anymore.

2049
02:06:23,264 --> 02:06:25,350
谢谢你  弗兰克
Thank you,Frank.

2050
02:06:27,123 --> 02:06:30,772
喂  丹尼  我只是想要告诉你个消息
Hello,Danny.I just wanted to tell you the news.

2051
02:06:30,772 --> 02:06:34,943
丽贝卡把我们俩都耍了  她得了癌症
Rebecca held out on both of us. She had cancer.

2052
02:06:36,715 --> 02:06:39,009
是的  是自杀
Yes,suicide.

2053
02:06:39,009 --> 02:06:42,033
从此以后迈克斯跟他亲爱的小新娘
Now Max and that dear little bride of his

2054
02:06:42,033 --> 02:06:45,891
将会继续幸福地在曼陀丽生活
will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.

2055
02:06:47,247 --> 02:06:49,228
再见  丹尼
Bye-bye,Danny.

2056
02:06:52,148 --> 02:06:55,484
-这是你的车吗  先生  -是的
-This your car,sir? -Yes.

2057
02:06:55,484 --> 02:06:58,508
可以马上开走吗  这不是停车位
Will you be going soon? This isn’t a parking place,you know.

2058
02:06:58,508 --> 02:07:00,489
不是吗  如果想的话
Oh,isn’t it? Well,people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.

2059
02:07:00,489 --> 02:07:02,679
我就有权把车停在外面

2060
02:07:02,679 --> 02:07:06,224
真遗憾  你们这些家伙没什么好事可做的
It’s a pity some of you fellows haven’t anything to do.

2061
02:07:09,457 --> 02:07:12,480
你打电话回去的时候  她说会等你回来吗
When you phoned,did she say she’d wait up?

2062
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:15,609
我让她先睡  可她不听
I asked her to go to bed,but she wouldn't hear of it.

2063
02:07:17,173 --> 02:07:20,196
真希望能开得再快点儿
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.

2064
02:07:20,196 --> 02:07:22,699
你在担心什么  迈克西姆
Is something worrying you,Maxim?

2065
02:07:22,699 --> 02:07:25,723
事情有点不对头  有点不妙
I can’t get over the feeling something’s wrong.

2066
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:15,669
-弗兰克  -怎么了  干吗停车
-Frank. -What’s the matter? Why did we stop?

2067
02:08:15,773 --> 02:08:17,754
现在几点了
What’s the time?

2068
02:08:17,754 --> 02:08:20,674
这表不准  肯定是3、4点了  怎么了
Well,this clock’s wrong. It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?

2069
02:08:20,674 --> 02:08:22,968
那不可能是破晓黎明
That can’t be the dawn breaking over there.

2070
02:08:22,968 --> 02:08:25,679
因为是冬天  所以你看到北极光了吧
It’s in the winter that you see the northern Iights,isn’t it?

2071
02:08:27,555 --> 02:08:30,788
那不是北极光  那是曼陀丽
That’s not the northern lights. That’s Manderley.

2072
02:08:53,727 --> 02:08:56,751
弗里思  弗里思  德温特太太呢  她在哪儿
Frith! Frith!

2073
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:56,304
Mrs.de Winter. Where is she?

2074
02:08:56,751 --> 02:08:58,941
-我想我看到过她  先生  -在哪儿
-I thought I saw her,sir -Where?

2075
02:09:06,136 --> 02:09:07,595
迈克西姆
Maxim!

2076
02:09:09,368 --> 02:09:13,820
-谢天谢地你回来了  -你没事吧  快告诉我
Thank heavens you’ve come back to me!

2077
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:12,699
-Are you all right,darling? -Oh,yes,I am.

2078
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:14,894
-没事  我没事  -你没事吧
Are you all right?

2079
02:09:14,894 --> 02:09:17,710
是丹弗斯太太放的火  她疯了
Mrs.Danvers,she’s gone mad.

2080
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:19,086
她说宁愿毁掉曼陀丽
She said she’d rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.

2081
02:09:19,086 --> 02:09:20,838
也不要看着我们幸福地住在这儿

2082
02:09:20,942 --> 02:09:24,279
看  快看西厢
ROBERT: Look! The west wing!
