00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:54,782
别过来
Don't come any closer.

我会跳下去的

长官 他这才交做实事

00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,157

别跟我说话
Don't you dare talk to me.

548
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:05,322
你去哪了?
Where were you?

549
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:07,091
昌迪加尔
Chandigarh.

550
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:09,559
我朋友的女儿结婚了
My friend's daughter was getting married.

551
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:13,226
我本来想改天见你的 但是那个老东西...
I tried to meet you the other day, but the old man...

552
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:14,998
- 我父亲 - 是的 就是他
- Father. - Yes, him.

553
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:17,998
整个晚上我都在打你电话...
I tried calling you all evening...

554
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:19,542
但是每次都是他接的
but he answered the call every time.

555
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,838
你看见请柬了吗?
Did you see the card?

556
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:22,939
怎么样?
How was it?

557
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:27,450
为什么要浪费你爸爸的存款呢?
Why are you wasting your father's provident fund?

558
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:29,609
奶奶非常喜欢这个男孩
Grandma really likes the boy.

559
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:32,087
你好像很高兴
You look happy.

560
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:35,318
你真的那么喜欢图卡拉姆吗?
Do you like that Tukaram as well?

561
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:37,787
我高兴因为我知道...
I'm happy because I know...

562
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:39,954
你不会让我嫁给图卡拉姆
you won't let me marry that Tukaram.

563
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,998
再者 你到底在等什么?
By the way, what are you waiting for?

564
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,966
一笔大买卖
For a big tender.

565
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,600
你把你的骗局和偷盗称为大买卖
You call your scams and thefts tender.

566
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:48,705
我还有一些耻辱感
I still have some shame left in me.

567
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,901
为什么这种事情对你这么重要呢?
Then why do such things in the first place?

568
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,941
因为我只会做这个
Because that's the only thing I know.

569
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,507
人们都浮躁不安...
People are restless..

570
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:56,978
而我的想法也变得飘忽不定
and my mind is restless.

571
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:01,176
无论何时我一看见你...
Whenever I look at you...

572
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:04,216
就会重获新生
I feel like being good.

573
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,655
这就是你要逃避我的原因吗?
Is that why you keep running away from me?

574
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:17,525
我试过了 但是没办法

00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:26,373
如果你被抓了怎么办?

578
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,809
这世界上没人能抓住我

00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,670
四个假装成我们部门的人组织了一次突击搜查
Four people conducted a raid posing as officers of our department.

589
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:03,173
因为种种原因部长没有报案
The minister isn't filing a case for obvious reasons.

590
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,613
- 因为他的名声 - 是的

为了维护自己的名声...
The minister isn't filing a case...

592
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:08,675
部长没有报案
for reasons best known to him.

593
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:10,651
这是个很简单的案子 长官
It's a simple police case, sir.

594
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:12,984
- 你得知道他... - 可是 先生
- You do know that they... - But still, sir.

595
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,885
为什么完全不追究...
Why indulge in such petty...

596

你看见那个人了吗?

他叫Sl 就是他助了那帮人一臂之力
He's the Sl who helped them conduct the raid.

598
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:20,728
真可怜 他很羞愧
Poor guy, he was humiliated.

599
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:23,496
他管理一个学术研究...
He conducted an investigation...

600
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,198
并且收集有关的信息

只有一部分被调查了
These are the ones that were detected.

603
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:33,037
没人知道具体数字
No one knows the real number of cases.

604
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,765
假装中央调查局 税务局或者Acb
Fake CBI, Income Tax or ACB teams 

605
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,008
搞一次突击搜查...
conduct a raid...

606
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,413
受害者从来不上报
and the victims never report.

607
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:41,250
谣言满天飞
Rumours are spreading.

608
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:45,380
有些人总结认为罪犯是前任中央调查局
There's a theory that they're ex-CBI.

609
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:46,983
很奇怪
Strange.

610
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,926
算了 我们得制止这些谣言
Anyway, we've to stop this nonsense.

611

他们正在诋毁我们的名声

612
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:57,197
马德拉斯 那格浦尔 特里凡得琅 勒克瑙
Madras, Nagpur, Trivandrum. Lucknow.

613
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:58,632
长官 这些地方遍布了整个国家
Sir, it's all over the country.

614
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:01,830
他们的目标大多数是商人和政客
They mostly target businessmen and politicians.

615
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,338
因为他们有很多黑钱...
Because there's black money involved...

616
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:04,999
没人希望报道这个
no one wants to report it.

617
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,433
这些政客都来自哪些党派 长官?

618
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,670
每个党派都有
They're from every party we know.

619
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:12,478
我希望你尽快解决这件麻烦事
I expect you to end this nuisance immediately.

620
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,976
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

621
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:16,880
长官 我还从来没升职和加薪过
Sir, I haven't received a promotion and increment yet.

622
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,248
家里都快揭不开锅了
It's getting difficult to run the household.

623
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:19,731
我应该开始收受贿赂了吗? 
Shall I start accepting bribes? 

624
00:51:19,732 --> 00:51:20,483
你又在威胁我
Threatening me again.

625
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:21,984
我们就事论事
I'm discussing this matter.

626
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:23,286
站在我的角度想想

中央调查局不是微风 是海啸
CBl is not just wind, its Tsunami...

1131
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:34,424
不管是谁

好了 让我们席卷而去!

There's 4 of you and 22 of them.

1140
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:00,750
这不是歧视

1141
01:37:01,429 --> 01:37:05,331
你们四个人也能做二十二个人的事

真正的力量是源自内心

1145
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:16,802
在人生中不要害怕任何人
Don't ever be scared of anyone in life.

1146
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,974
明白吗? - 明白 长官
Understood? - Yes, sir.

1147
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:21,046
完成突袭任务之后
After the completion of the raid...

1148
01:37:21,115 --> 01:37:23,675
你们要回到这里报到 如果没有任何差错的话
...you will all report back here, and if nothing goes wrong...

1149
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:26,049
你们每人都能得到自己的委任书

1150
01:37:26,354 --> 01:37:30,120
然后 你们可以开一个小派对
And then, you can all throw a small party for all.

1151
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:31,785
好的 长官

1152
01:37:36,397 --> 01:37:40,060
女士们先生们 你们刚刚开始了自己

...becoming a part of lndia's best and intellectual agency.

1154

1156
01:37:50,878 --> 01:37:52,641
为国家而死

1157

中央调查局意味着你就是最棒的

这一刻我几乎忘了我们是贼了
For a minute l forgot that we're thieves.

他们问我们中央调查局的全称

They said we'll go out for a raid post-lunch.

1174
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:46,932

Where? - They haven't said that yet.

# 生命转瞬即逝 你会在何时降临 #
Life is passing by, when will you come?

1187
01:41:14,048 --> 01:41:15,242

1188
01:41:44,211 --> 01:41:45,769
你还好吗 沙玛先生?
How are you, Mr. Sharma?

1189
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:49,907
我们是中央调查局的
We're from the CBl.

1190
01:41:52,019 --> 01:41:53,247
真正的中央调查局
The real one.

1191
01:41:57,858 --> 01:41:58,984
那么 沙玛先生
So, Mr. Sharma.

1192
01:41:59,493 --> 01:42:01,791
你喜欢玩官兵抓贼的游戏 对吧?
You like playing cops-and-robbers, don't you?

1193
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:05,326
不 我只是...
No, l was just...

1194
01:42:06,233 --> 01:42:09,566
我要问你几个问题 你有两个选择
l will ask you some questions, and you will have two options.

1195
01:42:09,837 --> 01:42:11,429
首先 你会否认所有事
Firstly, you will deny everything...

1196
01:42:11,539 --> 01:42:13,404
说你什么都不知道
...and say you don't know anything.

1197
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:14,118
在这种情况下 
ln that condition, 

1198
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:15,499
我们会把你带到一个地方严刑逼供
we'll be compelled to do it and...

1199
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:19,876
绝对会让你印象深刻
...in places, which was never done to you before by anyone.

1200
01:42:22,016 --> 01:42:25,042
你将会很痛苦 但是相信我
lt will cause you a lot of pain but, believe me...

1201
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,953
你可能会瞬间想起所有细节
...you will suddenly remember everything in detail.

1202
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:30,557
我...我... 
l... l...

1203
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:33,991
你的第二个选择就是跟我们合作
Your second option is that you cooperate with us...

1204
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:36,358
这会节省我们很多时间和精力
...and save our time and effort.

1205
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:37,930
而且也不会给你带来任何痛苦
This option won't cause you any pain...

1206
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:40,796
你还可以请求我们的些许宽大处理
...and you can expect us to be slightly lenient with us.

1207
01:42:44,338 --> 01:42:45,737
好吧 开始吧
So, let's begin.

1208
01:42:45,973 --> 01:42:48,168
第一个问题 你们虚假中央调查局明天要在哪
First question, where's your fake CBl team...

1209
01:42:48,242 --> 01:42:49,573
进行突击检查?
...going to conduct a raid tomorrow?

1210
01:42:49,643 --> 01:42:51,577
胡万达斯 辛哈尼亚 珠宝店

1211
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,909
- 几点? - 下午三点
- What time? - 3 pm.

1212
01:42:54,215 --> 01:42:55,807
那什么是二十六人特别小组?
What's Special 26?

1213
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,649
那是个挺大的地方 所以我们想...
lt... was a big place, so we thought...

1214
01:43:03,724 --> 01:43:05,885
需要更多人手
...if we have more men with us...

1215
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,988
所以你们在报纸上登了广告
So you put an ad in the paper...

1216
01:43:08,095 --> 01:43:09,225
说来一个要一个 照单全包 
...stating Come one, come all, 

1217
01:43:09,226 --> 01:43:10,791
这个是一个大买卖 帮助我们 是不是?
it's a big heist. Help us.

1218
01:43:10,898 --> 01:43:12,058
计划是什么?
What's the plan?

1219
01:43:14,468 --> 01:43:16,129
明天上午我们会给他们做培训
Tomorrow morning we'll give them training.

1220
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:17,363
培训?
Training?

1221
01:43:20,474 --> 01:43:23,272
我的意思是说明他们的分工
l mean we'd explain them their role...

1222
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:25,937
比如 做什么 怎么做
...like what to do, how to do it.

1223
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:31,674
我们要解释给他们 还要准备
We would explain them all that and prepare them.

1224
01:43:31,952 --> 01:43:35,117
下午两点半一过 我们的车就到达酒店门口
And then at 2:30, our bus would reach the hotel.

1225
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:09,816
然后呢?
Then?

1226
01:44:11,358 --> 01:44:14,350
然后我们就去大剧院
We were supposed to go to Opera House in it...

1227
01:44:14,428 --> 01:44:17,989
进行一次突击
...and conduct a big raid.

1228
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,905
我们是中央调查局 都别动!
We're from the CBl! No one moves!

1229
01:45:05,012 --> 01:45:06,639
现在 开始
Come on, start.

1230
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:11,010

1234
01:45:19,893 --> 01:45:22,555
长官 长官 对不起 长官
Sir.. please sir.. sorry sir..

1235
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,845
所有都收走
Pick up everything.

1236
01:45:58,632 --> 01:46:02,796
我们会在别人反应过来之前逃走
We would flee before anyone knew what happened?

1237
01:46:03,037 --> 01:46:07,474
我们计划在三十分钟内抢两千万卢比
We planned to loot 2 crores in 30 minutes.

1238
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:12,804
昂儒是什么背景?
What's your Ajju's background?

1239
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,741
他想加入中央调查局
He wanted to join the CBl.

1240
01:46:28,128 --> 01:46:30,187
他笔试过了
He had cleared the written exam.

1241
01:46:30,731 --> 01:46:32,289
但是面试失败了
But failed in the interview.

1242
01:46:40,274 --> 01:46:43,266
考试的失利让他很受伤
He failed in the exam and he was hurt.

1243
01:46:43,977 --> 01:46:46,002
所以她开始进行冒充中央调查局
So he started a fake CBl team.

1244
01:46:49,016 --> 01:46:50,984
迄今为止你们犯案多少次?
How many raids have you conducted so far?

1245
01:46:55,956 --> 01:46:58,789
明天是第五十次

1246
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:00,053

1249
01:47:04,932 --> 01:47:07,162
但是你消息散布混乱
...but you've spread a chaos.

1250
01:47:08,502 --> 01:47:09,969
不是四个
Not four.

1251
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:14,703
人们也愿意帮我们
People like him help us as well.

1252
01:47:15,809 --> 01:47:18,277
长官 我能跟他单独谈一分钟吗?
Sir, can l talk to him in private for a minute?

1253
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:21,612
干嘛一分钟 你明天可以跟他慢慢谈
Why a minute, you can talk to him all you want tomorrow.

1254
01:47:21,749 --> 01:47:22,977

1255
01:47:23,317 --> 01:47:24,909
那 告诉我 沙玛先生
So, tell us, Mr. Sharma.

1256
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:28,382
你想要安全还是跟他们一样被抓?
Do you want to be safe or go down with them?

1257
01:47:28,756 --> 01:47:29,882
让我告诉你...
Let me tell you...

1258
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:31,981
监狱对于你这个年龄的人来说可不是好地方 
...jail isn't a great place for people of your age.

1259
01:47:34,294 --> 01:47:37,320
长官 长官 我选另一个
Sir... sir, another option.

1260
